35,Eurostars Mariner  September 2024,"We stayed at this hotel after our virgin voyages cruise.  The hotel is 50 ft from where the boat docked. The attendant brought our bags from the ship to the hotel.  We lucked out and got a room at 10 am. The room was enormous with a nice balcony that overlooked the port. The bathroom was divided into 2 areas. There was a  tub and a separate shower.   You are within walking distance of the  rambles,  the hop on hop off bus and the metro train.

The food was excellent.  We added the buffet  to our stay. There also is a beautiful bar
 area . The food here was pretty good, too.  There was an automated robot that brought your food to the server, which intrigued me.  The staff was extremely helpful. We had a great stay.

35,Poor Communications and poor Customer Service,"Really disappointing room was ok but not 5 star sadly. Customer Service is poor on our second night there was no Wi- Fi available during our stay and be needed to make travel arrangements! Over 5 calls to reception was told the person was having his lunch (this was 9pm)so couldn’t come and sort out the problem we eventually gave up.

This makes it challenging when doing business which it claims it is suited too as no communications available when required will never return to this hotel after the lack of support as need adequate communications in place.",1,2024,09,28
35,Not a 5 star hotel.,"The hotel is not a 5 star hotel. It’s more of a 3/4 star. 
The rooms are okay but could use a refresh.  Bathrooms are nice. If you think of it as more of a 3/4 star hotel you won’t be disappointed. Staff seem okay but not 5 star friendly. Over all if you can get a good price or going on a cruise this hotel will be fine.",3,2024,09,21
35,Do not stay at this hotel,"This was one of the worst hotel experiences that my wife and I have ever had. It wasn’t just about the poor quality of service. This was evidenced by the warm welcome other guests ahead of us received and the ease with which they were checked in on arrival and catered to by the front desk during the interactions we observed during our stay.

When we arrived, it took 20 minutes to check in, yet the two groups being attended to at the same time as us took way less time and received a warm welcome. It was extremely odd as we purchased a City Suite with bed and breakfast over a month prior. They made me re-enter my email (even though it was already displayed on the iPad). The manager sarcastically blamed the “delay” on a glitch in technology, which was untrue.

The next day, we were mildly jet-lagged (we’re from the US) and slept in. We placed our do not disturb sign on the door. A house keeper knocks once and immediately enters our room without permission. My wife speaks Spanish and told her we’re still in the room. Completely freaked out, we immediately put every valuable we have in our locked suitcases and the safe. They called several times requesting to enter the room to clean even though we did not ask for the service. The do not disturb sign remained on the door for that day.

The following day, we left the room at 10:00am to allow staff to clean. We returned to the room at 3:30pm and a housekeeper is still in the room. We were mildly annoyed because we needed to retrieve several items from the room. The housekeeper explained that she was just finishing up so we left to purchase our tickets for a boat tour for the America’s Cup. We returned to the room  about 45 minutes later only to discover that our room key was no longer functioning even though the key worked on the elevator. We left for the boat tour and went to the front desk when we returned from the tour about 1 hour later. When we arrived at the front desk, we  were dismissed by a man who appeared to be the manager. We were then attended to by a rude representative who condescendingly told us we must have de-magnetized the keys by putting it next to our phones.  The representative re-issued the keys and when we returned to the room and our keys still did not work. More than annoyed and fearful for our stuff we went back to the front desk and then staff returned with us and brought a technician, who determined that the battery on the room door had died. No apology for the inconvenience, nothing at all.

We thankfully departed to go home the next day. As we are checking out, the only words from the front desk attendant were “did you use anything from the minibar?”",1,2024,09,20
35,Will not return,"This hotel was next the cruise port, while we were waiting for our check in time we headed up to the hotel terrace for a cold drink. The hotel staff were welcoming and the drinks were cold. 

We then left to check into our cruise only to be told that they were delayed and to come back in an hour. So we headed back to the hotel and this time denied access to the terrace. The receptionist told us to ask the concierge and the concierge went to ask the manager. The manager then interrogated us before finally escorting us to the terrace. 

She told the lifeguard to keep an eye on us. Clearly didn’t imagine that we both understand Spanish well. 

Very poor experience and would not recommend this hotel. I understand if hotels only allow guests but be consistent in that rule. We were clearly “allowed” by some staff and not accepted by others. Snobbery.",2,2024,09,01
35,Bad service,"In our 2 night stay: check in was slow, rude guy that was checking us in. 

Room: it was ok, the plug sockets for charging your phone etc are in difficult positions we got on our knees to plug in. The Shower was great, the best thing in the hotel

Service: we wanted a taxi and reception lady said she would not call us one and go stand at the taxi stand, we waited for nearly an hour. I spoke to the manger he was also quite rude and unprofessional and did raise my voice at the lack of service and he then got upset and said he would make us leave the hotel, I said all I want is good service. 

Another guest was also complaining because they lost his luggage in the hotel and that was 12 hours ago 

Not five star service

Would not stay again",1,2024,08,30
35,Pleasant Surprise!,We had an excellent experience from the pre-arrival communication with reservations for the Black Marina restaurant to the thoughtful slightly early check-in to our very clean and comfortable room. We had dinner at the Black Marina and it is a gorgeous spot on the roof with nearly 360 views of Barcelona. The tapas were varied and very good — especially the pork!,5,2024,08,28
35,GTEAT LOCATION FOR CRUISERS,"Convenient location at the pier, could walk to La Ramba and other locations.  Arrived at hotel a little before noon and the check-in time was 3:00 pm, but Julia on the front desk graciously gave us a room rather than storing our bags.  It was a large room (#348) with separate sitting area - 2 televisions.  Breakfast was included with the room.",4,2024,08,27
35,Aug 2024,Not a 5 star hotel a 4 at best. Rooftop pool is a big bath and no parasols is tough going . Very clean but the biggest let down is the staff at reception. One really doesnt know what the other is doing its actually frustrating. There is plenty of them but they just stand around laughing with each other. Asked for an iron 4 times and it arrived 2 days later!! They are very arrogant with security that are very rude. It felt like we were doing them a favour staying there. Bar is a waste of time and a robbery. Stay well clear,3,2024,08,23
35,Cruising ? You have to stay here !!,"If you are on a cruise this is fantastic literally within walking distance to the port, turn left out of the front door and there is your ship !!Great hotel massive rooms and amazing roof top bar. Staff were fantastic especially the lady in the rooftop bar who actually helped me with my Spanish !!",5,2024,08,20
35,A good place after a cruise,"This was the hotel the cruise line had for the extension after our cruise. I did not really know what to expect but was overall happy. Julia at the front desk was pleasant and welcoming and did her best to get us into a lovely room. The room was clean and very spacious. We had drinks and tapas at the bar, and for the most part, the service was good, although a little slow. The breakfast buffet was included in the package and had everything we needed and more. The location is a little far from the main attractions, but the waterfront is pretty and you can walk to some restaurants at the marina. I did not like the many busloads of cruise people coming in all at the same time. It was quite chaotic in the lobby and it appeared the hotel was never prepared for the arrivals which is funny as that seems to be their main business.",4,2024,08,19
35,Okish with improvement,"Overall ok, location is good. Our room had no option to open a window to get fresh air. View was on container ships and cruising ships. The roof top pool could be nice but very small and no sun beds in shadow available at all. Tiles around the pool are horrible slobbery when wet. At check out various positions from mini bar are on the check. Got deducted as not used by us. Wondering how this could happen. All in all ok and so much room for improvement with more love to detail.",3,2024,08,17
35,Amazing vacation,"My husband and I spent 3 days at the Eurostars Grand Marina after returning from a 12 day Cruise.  From the beginning, the staff were friendly, helpful, and provided a level of service that exemplified what it means to stay at a luxury hotel. The food at the Black Marina was excellent and the ambiance was superb. The breakfast buffet was great and offers different options daily.  We had the Executive Suite. The room was clean, and extremely comfortable, there were toiletries provided. My husband and I would love to thank Luis at the front desk for his amazing and warm welcome and Leandro who works at the Black Marina restaurant such an amazing and delightful person.  This was our second stay at the Eurostars Grand Marina Barcelona. We will surely make this our home away from home when we visit Barcelona.  Thanks again for adding to our amazing vacation in Barcelona.",5,2024,08,14
35,Not Five Star,"Sadly this hotel has declined, our room was ok…comfortable bed, large powerful shower and air conditioning that was hard to adjust.
The A/C was a little too cold and did not respond to an increase of two degrees degrees, I eventually turned it off and back on in the morning.

The tea/coffee mugs did not fit under the coffee maker, no small cups were provided.
The television is too high on the wall, very dated.
Not enough tissues or toilet paper.
Overall not bad but definitely NOT five star accommodations.
The location is the only reason this hotel gets away charging such high prices (when ships are in port) otherwise they would be scrambling for guests.",3,2024,08,04
35,Looking for a hotel near Virgin Voyages terminal? Look no further!!,"We are checking out today after 2 nights and I’ve really been impressed with this hotel. The hotel staff are absolutely amazing!! The rooms have wonderfully cold AC that stays cold overnight, powerful water pressure, and comfy beds. The breakfast buffet has been fabulous both mornings. Fair prices on cocktails for a hotel. Pool is small but the views on rooftop are glorious for sunrise and sunset! Directly next to Virgin Voyages cruise terminal for those cruising out of Barcelona. Beach is 1.5 mile walk along waterfront and Las Ramblas is just a short 10 min walk away. I highly recommend this hotel for families, couples or solo travelers!!",5,2024,07,28
35,So disappointing,"Having stayed and eaten in this hotel last year we thought it an ideal to place to take a meal there while waiting for a ferry to Sardinia. Our previous meal there was very good even though the Cube restaurant was lacking in atmosphere. This restaurant is now closed and all clientele are directed to the rooftop restaurant. It was here we waited 15  minutes for a waiter to direct us to a table, in the end we gave up and just chose one ourselves. A further  15 minutes for a waiter to appear to take a drinks order and another 10 minutes for menus to be brought to the table, and only in the Catalan language, so choosing was hit and miss.  The food arrived 30 minutes later at exactly the same time as our drinks. Totally unacceptable waiting time, the food was good but by this stage we had lost the will to live. If you are going to have a 5 star establishment and charge  5 star prices you really need to sort out the service staff. The waiters had no designated areas and were rushing around like headless chickens not knowing who or what to serve. Also the evening entertainment, a guy on bongo drums and another singer with a guitar were so loud that it made conversation virtually impossible. Definitely will not be eating there again.",1,2024,07,11
35,Great Stay,"We stayed here for two nights at the end of May before a cruise. This is the perfect hotel if you are going on a cruise as it's near the port (there are buses to take you to the port on your day of the cruise for a fee), or if you want to stay by the water and out of town, and somewhere quieter. However, if you want to be in town, closer to attractions, you might want to skip this place. Although, I will say, it's an easy 10-20 min walk to the main area and most museums. To go to Park Guell or La Sagrada Familia you'll probably want to take public transportation or a taxi (of which there are many outside the hotel). We weren't able to check in early, however they safely kept our luggage for us as we went about the town. We were supposed to have a city view, but were upgraded to a city/water view and it was great, right on the corner of the building with amazing views. The room was large and clean, as was the bathroom. The staff were very friendly and helpful. And the breakfast was amazing; highly recommend adding that on. We ended up getting room service twice, as we were just too tired to go out. The employee who brought it was very friendly. Although, if I did complain, it would be that the food wasn't super good, and was highly priced (expected at a hotel), and the first time we ordered it took a rather long time to get the food. But that is my only minor complaint. There is a small pool on the roof, as well as a bar, and a restaurant inside. There is also a coffee place and cafe with lunch outside the hotel. Overall, it was a lovely, relaxing stay that we greatly enjoyed, and our room was beautiful and clean.",5,2024,06,23
35,A mix of highs and lows,"Location:
The hotel's prime location is undoubtedly one of its best features. Nestled in a vibrant area, it provides easy access to nearby attractions, making it an ideal choice for tourists.

Accommodation:
We stayed in one of the suites, which was impressively spacious. However, the experience was marred by the lack of a good view and the absence of patio furniture, which would have been a nice addition for enjoying the outdoors.

Decor:
The hotel decor is a bit of a letdown, feeling rather outdated. The presence of fake flowers in the room and hallways detracted from the overall ambiance and gave it a somewhat tacky feel.

Gym:
The gym facilities were disappointing. It was quite small, and several weights were missing. Additionally, a portion of the mirror was broken, complicating the process of lifting weights, especially with other guests moving around.

Pool:
On a positive note, the rooftop pool was a highlight. It offered a stunning view and a lively atmosphere with a DJ playing music throughout the day. It was a great spot to relax and enjoy the city's sights from above.

Breakfast:*
The complimentary breakfast exceeded expectations. There was an extensive selection of tapas, fresh fruit, bread, and beverages, making it a delightful start to the day.

Staff:
The staff were excellent—attentive, friendly, and always ready to assist. Their service significantly enhanced our overall experience.

Overall:
While the hotel boasts a fantastic location and some standout amenities like the rooftop pool and excellent breakfast, it falls short in other areas such as decor and gym facilities. With some updates and improvements, it has the potential to offer a much more satisfying stay.",3,2024,06,22
35,"Brill location & rooms, but service is hit and miss.","Got off to a very rocky start, gave us a room key, went to room and someone was asleep inside, went back to reception where they apologised and gave me keys to another room, guess what, someone in that one as well, whilst this was going on, we had to chase our luggage around the hotel as well, finally got out 3rd room but the bottle of Cava to apologise never materialised that they promised!. Put that to side, the hotel facilities and location are excellent. Rooms are fantastic, great showers, and facilities brill. Beds very comfy and air con efficient. Also doesn’t switch off when you leave the room so nice and cool when you come back from being out.  Roof top is really sunny, great views, plenty of beds, and bar staff friendly. While we were there a huge virgin party cruise ship pulled up, right next door, I didn’t mind the vibe, but it was very loud and everyone on the top deck was overlooking us in the hotel. Might annoy some people. Location was brill, great views of the Marina and well placed for the main areas you would want to visit. Also a taxi rank outside which is useful if going further like the Sangrada or Patk Guell.",4,2024,06,20
35,Don't stay here if you don't care if you get an inferior room than what you purchased.,"First, I've stayed here many times so I was surprised when I checked in this time, I was given the wrong room. When I went to Luis and told him this wasn't the room I purchased, he said they gave me a twin because I didn't choose. When, I showed him my confirmation which clearly stated ""superior king bed"". He again looked at me and lied. Then I showed him a photo and layout of the room I purchased. He again looked me in the face and lied and said that the photos were from a year ago and that they didn't have that room. I told him I was here 8 months ago, and I paid and purchased the same room. He again, looked me in the face and lied and said the rooms change every month. Again, I went online to show him the room and layout and said that isn't true because why would this company put photos on the room layout in choosing a room if they didn't exist as that would be fraudulent, and he lied again and said it changes every month. Then I explain to him that I chose this room specifically because it contains a bath tub and I ran a half marathon and I needed this room to soak my legs in the bath tub. He again, looked me in the face and lied by saying ""none of the rooms have bath tubs and never had bath tubs in the rooms"". I told him that it was false as I had this room 4 or 5 times and always ordered this room and on each occasion, it contained a bath tub. He said I was mistaken. I asked for a refund so that I could check into the W hotel as I called and the W informed me that they had rooms, and he said I couldn't have a refund because it was prepaid.  So, I said ""I'm suppose stay in the room you provided which is inferior to the room I paid for?"", and he said yes, and he wouldn't refund me and to speak to the day head manager who comes in at 9am. Since it was late (close to 10 pm), have been traveling all day and exhausted, we slept there that night.  The next morning around 9:15 am, I went and spoke the the day manager, Ricardo, and he looked at my reservation and confirmation number and immediately said ""You're correct, and they gave you the wrong room and you should be in another room (which is the room I order, purchased and was expecting), and immediately changed the room and had someone to come up to get our belongings to move me to the correct room.  I hate that Luis, the evening manager, insisted in not giving me the correct room and lying to my face several times regarding the room. So, if you do not care if they give you a lesser room that you paid for, then stay here, but if staying in a room layout that you chose and paid for, then I suggests staying somewhere else or at least speak to Ricardo or Manuel.",3,2024,06,17
35,Never again!,"First day, I had to request our room be serviced, into the evening on our return to the hotel, nothing done. Next day, confirmed in the morning, football would be on, reassured, definitely. Cocktail bar, first floor, Yes.
Came back to the hotel, upstairs to rooftop for an evening bevvi, oops private function, closed OK, pool bar oops closed at 19:00, OK downstairs to cocktail bar, empty I might add and sure enough, nope not having football on the TV. Seriously, it's the Euro's !!!!
Went to reception, sorry, you can have some strawberry chocolates and a bottle of Cava...really £300 plus a night, and that is the response ... I don't think so.
Back in a taxi, another £11, cause the hotel is not a near distance to the restaurants to go out for dinner, not an inexpensive experience, back in the taxi, yip another £11. No worries, coffee in our room. Oops need milk, and here's the stinger £14, £14 quid for a pint of milk.
A rip off from start to finish.....furious does not even start to sum it up
Go somewhere else, stay somewhere else.oh, and to management who on two occasions could not get off their proverbials and deem us worth a conversation..... speechless.",2,2024,06,15
35,"Nice hotel, wouldn't say 5* now but probably would have been in 80s and 90s","This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel as it's right next to the cruise port, so ideal.  We were offered an upgrade as we were last time. However, our stay this time felt a little different from last time.  
We had a large room, which was very grand and I am sure that in the 1980s and 90s this would have been the highest of standards and very modern, however it is looking slightly dated now and would not consider this a 5* hotel.  We had a balcony which was pretty useless as you couldn't sit out on it. With the doors closed we could hear everything going on outside, in fact I got up at one point to check it was closed.  The air con was very good, which is a massive plus for us.
The rooms are not well soundproofed.  We could here our next door neighbour coming back having a massive argument and could here walking around the walls seemed to creak!  
The bed was massive but my god was it uncomfortable, like sleeping on a board, could feel springs go almost flat and board on the base underneath.  The base was noisy and creaked on moving slightly.  We had a very disturbed night's sleep.
Plus points the food we had there was fabulous.  The waiters were all so helpful and kind. We did not have breakfast here just lunch and evening dinner.
Plus points, great big shower. Lovely bathroom..
There were security guards everywhere you looked.  I'm sure they didn't have them last year when we stayed.  
So, all in all, I'm glad we were only staying the one night.  I think the hotel rooms are now in need of a little bit of TLC, definitely more soundproofing.  The hotel was clean and bonus for the toothbrushes, toothpaste, comb and lovely hand washes etc.  nice touch!",3,2024,06,11
35,Perfect stay!,"Having just got off a luxury cruise this stay was the perfect way to end our holiday. We were given a lovely suite, stunning!! Everything we needed was available and more.
Cute pool area on the roof.
The service from everyone we met was impeccable from the bellboy, reception & bar staff, nothing was too much trouble.
The food in the restaurant was also great.
Thanks for a lovely stay!",5,2024,06,10
35,The Hotel itself has always been great and is highly encouraged to become worse over time,"This Hotel was ""once"" my preferred choice. This has changed due to a cummulative amount of issues over ""years"".

Let me start with positive aspects.
Breakfast in this hotel is locally oriented, but generally international. You can eat in the inner open air space or inside. You can have fresh coffee, orange juice, fresh fruits, bread, cornflakes, eggs etc. The collection is very nice.
Sometimes when the staff is not as quick as desired you will grab your own coffee or juice - and in this moments they will ask ironically if you need assistance. Well... if they had been faster...
However, in BCN you wont need a breakfast, you can definitely eat better locally within the city.
The best of all is the terrace in the evening with a stunning view over the port of Barcelona. Priceless indeed. However the staff sometimes overwrites your ""tip"" on the bill...
You have a pool (small) upstairs and a spa, where you can train a bit. I just wonder, who uses that while being in the city. ;) nevermind...
The staff is usually quite helpful, also when it comes to special wishes or recommendations. I received very good advices from the concierge.

Now that bads...
This Hotel never replies to critics, not by mail, not when being directly at the receptions. They act ""stubborn"" somehow, which I highly discourage.

In my bathroom, while showering, suddenly the staff knocked on the door, because water was dripping through the ceiling a room one level below my room.
Ahm, how can this be? Generally the equipment in the bathroom appears cheap and amateurishly attached.

Using the laundry Service was fun. They received a pullover from me with my choice of services for it, and the staff just by itself changed my preferences to make it more expensive.

The roof top bar service is utterly bad. They are completely non-attentive, brings you the wrong orders and increase the tip you write on the bill by 2-3 times by themselves.
Fortunately I remembered my orders quite well and mentioned all this during the checkouts.

Last year it was even worse, with very loud noises on the floors by others guests. The managers from the hotel did not even react on this, nor did they relocate them. Other guests felt highly disturbed throughout the night. Kids from the other rooms played tricks on the doors of other guests, i.e. putting the dont-disturb markers on the doors of other guests, so their rooms where not cleaned at all.
Talking to the hotel manager has not even brought up an excuse. That was a very wild experience, feeling like being in a zoo, not in a 5-star Hotel.

Also this Hotel does not react on mailings for adjustments of services afterwards, which makes the experience even worse.
I have been a guest in this Hotel for years now, it was always my first choice when travelling to BCN. However I could write even more and I am very sick of writing and discussing for nonsense with this Hotel, as they dont care.
They have their ""theoretical 5 Star rating"" and so guests may come anyway. However for me and us they story is done here. The Eurostars is not known for good services anyway, I also experience similar bad services in other Hotels from them, opposed to other 5* Hotels which provide excellent services.

To me, this Grand Marina Hotel is totally overrated, overpriced, bad services and it simply does not justify the price at all. There are several 5* boutique Hotels around which are excellent and far superior than what I have seen here now over years.

Guests have the choice and will make use of this.",2,2024,06,08
35,Comfortable lodging and stellar service,"Five-star service. Professional, helpful, friendly staff. The hotel is in a good location to get acquainted with the festive side of Barcelona with nightly street activity in the square with music, food and merchant vendors and to see some harbor activity.",5,2024,06,03
35,Amazing dinner experience with Leandro,"Nice property with a nice view of the marina, very convenient for those leaving to Balearic Islands or who wanna stay near the centre without the hustle and bustle of Barcelona traffic.

Spacious room, great breakfast buffet with outdoor seats and stunning terrace.

Very positive note to the food experience in the evening provided by Mr. Leandro who kindly explained the whole menu and wine choice to in a very professional way.

Thanks also to the GM Mr. Ricardo and miss Anna for making my stay so good!",5,2024,05,29
35,Could be much better,"Location 5/5 - Great Sea views
Front Desk 3.5/5 Most were helpful some were outright rude
Housekeeping 2.5/5 Extremely loud, Demand right of way from guests in the hallway...
Room 2.5/5 Please renew the mattresses or flip the mattresses. The mattress next to the window was so worn it squeaked if you turned in the bed
Breakfast 2.5/5 Really bad coffee, New York Police Station quality, same Breakfast every day.  Most staff were helpful, some were poorly trained and didn't have the suitable attitude to be working in a hotel.

No sound insulation, it's like a dormitory with six rooms living together. You could hear the people next door turn in bed.

Spanish President stayed at the hotel while we were there and they blocked the 8th floor and we couldn't access the pool, gym, and terrace. No explanation was given, and no attempt at compensation was made.  

The Green Vita Restaurant and next-door supermarket literally around the corner are great. Lots of pickpockets around the hotel and immediately outside the port area. Please be careful as you will be targeted.",3,2024,05,29
35,Very good hotel,"Excellent front desk staff, quiet hallways, nice rooms, excellent buffet breakfast.

Really Good
Air conditioning that can go very cool if you need it.
Comfortable bed
Quiet rooms
Good toiletries
Buffet breakfast 

Not so good
Not enough toilet paper
2nd toilet in 1BR suite has no exhaust
No face washers
No tissues in room",4,2024,05,20
35,Good location but overpriced and no compassion from managers,"The hotel location is ideal for the World Trade Centre and the centre of Barcelona. However, hotel management are heartless and inflexible if you need to change anything on your booking. I had a 3 day stay booked and asked to reduce to 2 as I had a family issue crop up. Fro t desk said NO. emailed the GM and, Reservations and neither had the curtesy to reply to me! A simple request that most large hotels would honour... Not apparently Euro stars who would only say check your booking conditions... Zero compassion!!! ",1,2024,05,08
35,A hotel with kindness and beauty inside,"“A spectacular hotel anchored in the port of Barcelona”, indeed. 
A very welcoming atmosphere. The staff throughout the hotel were very professional, friendly and extremely helpful. They were always greeting and smiling to us. The room service was amazing. The location of the hotel is great. The room was very spacious and well equipped with all essentials and fantastic view. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to the tourists who want to go to Barcelona. Will be back to this place soon..!!!
From the moment we checked in until we checked out, the service was excellent. Carlos was the best !   
We arrived much earlier and had to wait for a while so the room can be ready for check-in. We noticed the team at the reception were amazing with all the customers. Everyone was courteous, smiling to all customers -  genuine smiles - eyes smiling too, a very friendly and welcoming energy. Carlos knew we wanted a room with view and a balcony and even we were keen for an upgrade, he literarily understood what we want and told us to wait so a room will be ready , he knew he is going to surprise us with the room 711 - An AMAZING space. We hope he get as much love as we felt when we entered that space. We hope Carlos and his team, his manager will receive this review with our special thanks. 
 
To the cleaners : Bushra and the Room service staff : we are extending our thanks to them, too.  We were completely impressed with their professionalism and customer service, Quick service & very trustworthy, also Impeccable Cleanliness. 
 
We cannot wait to come back and we hope we can find Room 711 available again for us.",5,2024,05,06
35,Experience we had!,"We are incomplete without giving an honest review with Eurostars Grand Marina. We had great experience in this hotel from the warmth welcome of the reception, the breakfast and the room service is fantastic!!!! We are so happy that Jaycelyn made an extra effort to bring a cake on my husband’s birthday with a candle lighted by her. She sings happy birthday without hesitation😊 made me and my husband felt so special. Thank so much! More power to the hotel!",5,2024,04,17
35,Good but wouldn’t return,"Designer handbag and cash taken from the room! Not what you expect from a 5* hotel! Management didn’t seem bothered. 
Hotel was clean. Dinner in the restaurant is recommended. Not too far from shops and restaurants. However make sure everything is locked away in the safe!",2,2024,04,01
35,Lost my passport here - Avoid at all costs,"Absolutely awful experience at EuroStars Grand Marina. Had my passport stolen from my room! Reported it to the staff who didn't seem to care at all. Made me feel like this wasn't the first time it happened. If you're a traveller, especially with a foreign passport (like British), avoid this hotel at all costs. Their security seems nonexistent, and the staff is extremely unhelpful. Look elsewhere for your safety and peace of mind.",1,2024,03,25
35,Amazing Hotel,Me and my husband stayed for 3 days and nights at this hotel. The room is clean. The service is absolutely amazing. I have to mention na the woman who serves food at our room I asked her name was Jaycelyn her smile is so pretty and very friendly. We will definitely come and book again in this hotel. Thank you. Keep it up.,5,2024,03,16
35,Poor service,"Poor service. The power to our door went out, so we could not enter our room in the middle of night. It took 1 hour to fix the problem. Missed a good night sleep without instant compensation. Will not come back here again. I do not understand why it took so long time to chance a battery for The door.",1,2024,02,17
35,Definitely not a 5 Star,"My husband said I’ve just booked us a 5 star hotel in the Marina 
Just to let you know this isn’t a 5 star hotel 
We were at the front of the hotel and the noise from the ferries was horrendous- lucky I had ear plugs 

The room was ok nothing special other than a muffin in a box on the bed 

Nice to walk into La Rambles but we came back and ordered food via an app

The breakfast was really good alot of variety 

Bed was ok pillows nice and comfy 

I definitely wouldn’t stay here again 

The only reason we booked was because of the location of the ship and to travel the next day",3,2024,01,13
35,Too good to be better,"This was the second time we stayed at this hotel. We stayed here for the first time more or less 15 years ago and we have never forgotten this hotel. We stayed here again between December 22-25, 2023: the hotel and the room were as good as 15 years ago.

The location of the hotel is EXCELLENT: at the end of the Ramblas and the beginning of the Ramblas del Mar. Our room overlooks the sea and that famous bridge.

Leaving the hotel, there is the statue of Columbus. You can walk directly to the statue, it's the beginning of Ramblas. When you arrive at Plaza Catalunya along the Ramblas, you can walk or take the hop-on hop-off bus along Passeig de Gracia. We suggest you walk that street, it's not that far and at the end is Casa Fuster. You can see many beautiful theaters, buildings and all of the most famous ""casa""s, from the hotel to Casa Fuster!

The reception service is very good, they don't have a concierge but they do their best to give you information about visiting the city.

There is a small restaurant in the hotel, you can have a leisurely dinner in the evening if you are not eating at La Boqueria or a tapas restaurant.

Breakfast is as good as any other 5-star hotels.

There is parking in the hotel, 30 euros/night, it is not cheap but very convenient. It's probably not really necessary to have a car because the hop-on hop-off bus is VERY convenient in Barcelona.

We really enjoyed this hotel and we love Barcelona, we will go there more often,  for sure.

35,Eurostar grand marina ,We love the hotel and the excellent service.Thank you to Edgar and Lejandro at the piano bar for outstanding service and hospitality. To Emilia and her breakfast crew for making our stay extra special. The hotel is well located in the city and very convenient. We walked everywhere. Thank you!! ,5,2024,01,03
35,Good upscale hotel in the harbor area near La Rambla,"I recently stayed at the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel for my two-night visit to Barcelona.  I selected this hotel because its prices were reasonable and it looked like it was close enough to La Rambla but not too close, since I had seen the negative news coverage of Barcelona's decline such as the April 2023 article in the Financial Times.  It turned out the news coverage was right. I was very glad to not be paying even more to stay in the overpriced luxury hotels which happen to be right next to the urban decay around La Rambla!

One thing that is not crystal clear from the Web site is the relationship of the hotel to the adjacent buildings. The World Trade Center consists of four directly adjacent buildings which look like a single complex from a distance, but when you are on the roof, it is clear that they are separate buildings which do not touch.  The Grand Marina Hotel is in the northwest building.  Thus, if you get a cheap rate like I do, you will probably get a room facing southeast towards the courtyard.  That was okay since I'm not the type to stay in the hotel room all day.

I had no issues at all with noise or pollution, probably because I was lucky enough to stay at the hotel not long after the city banished all cruise ships to the cruise ship port to the south.  

The room was clean, well-maintained, and comfortable: no unusual sights or smells noted.  HVAC was quiet. Temperature control were excellent, as was true of all hotels I stayed in during my Spain visit.  The fitness center was the best of all the hotels I stayed in on this visit. 

The main reason I can't give this place a five, versus a four, is the inconvenient location and the fact it doesn't directly face the harbor or the sea.  It's half a mile from La Rambla and over half a mile from the Maremagnum shopping mall, which appears to consist solely of tourist traps.  There is no good source for groceries close by, except for tiny convenience stores.  

It took me a few hours to figure out that the easiest way to get anywhere from this hotel is to catch the V11 bus from the Moll de Barcelona bus stop (the bus schedules on Google Maps are very accurate), then connect to the Metro system at the Paral·lel station. The best place to get groceries in the area is the supermarket in the basement of El Corte Ingles at Placa de Catalunya, which is several metro stops and over a mile away. ",4,2024,01,01
35,Fantastic 5* Hotel,Good quite Location but still very close to the center. Fatastic rooms and perfect breakfast. Friendly service. Many facilities for meetings and conferences. Ideal also for groups. Terrace on top of the hotel.,5,2023,12,06
35,Welcoming and helpful,"We spent two nights at Eurostars Grand marina prior to a cruise. Due to my error I booked a room with twin beds instead of a double. At checkin, there was no problem to find a double bed room. However, in the room we could see a small ship outside in the marina with loud music coming from it and evidence of setting up for a function that night. We asked for a quieter room and this was obliged within a short wait. So far amazing but more to come. We went for drinks in the Corner Bar, excellent service, then a light dinner. Ricardo was so nice and helpful, he should be acknowledged by management for his commitment to the job and his guests. Second night, more great service from Ricardo than a surprising performance from three talented opera singers performing well known opera songs. Who expected that? At breakfast Ricardo was there again, helpful, charming. A great stay.",5,2023,11,23
35,Amazing stay,"I had a very bad experience with the same chain in another city, but my experience in this hotel was amazing and I didn’t expect I will enjoy my stay. 

PROS:
- Lovely staff, very supportive. He helped us with the early check in and the room was so good.
- The size of the room is good and convenient.
- Comfortable beds.
- Bath size is perfect.
- Location is amazing.

CONS:
- Nothing",5,2023,11,21
35,Cruise.,"The hot breakfast was poor. Cold choice breakfast very good. All self service for everything even tea/coffee. I like a pot of tea. However, the cup was ok. Room bed very comfortable. Shower no hand rails at all. A bit scary. I’m not as young as I used to be. Only 1 mug for tea/coffee in room where 2 people are staying. Odd.  However, overall have been pleased",4,2023,10,29
35,Bit of a let down...,"Have just returned from a 4 night stay here with the family (3 young children) and feeling really disappointed and let down. 

Firstly we had a room sleeping 2 adults and 3 children, on arrival (late Saturday after a full days travelling) we arrive to only one double bed. So whilst we unpack etc a young lad is wheeling in a single bed to the room, one single bed for 3 children... eventually we manage to have this removed and the sofa bed extended. 
Other minor frustrations and grievances - the key cards frequently didn't work in the lift, whilst being out for the whole day, the room was being made up at 17:30 when we returned one day. Swimming pool was closed.

Also on arrival we asked the lady on reception for recommendations for a restaurant nearby that was child friendly and that might even have somewhere they can play etc for that evening. She was kind enough to book us a place near the beach/marina, however we should have probably double checked ourselves. On arrival it was clearly a club/restaurant with entertainers, not child friendly and of course didn't have a kids menu, we got some strange looks! 

Wouldn't recommend to tourists, is probably a good spot for business travel or if you are spending one night here before a cruise. ",2,2023,10,26
35,Hygiene and cleanliness the worst ever,"Stay away the hygiene and cleanliness of the rooms is appalling.
The rooms are old and very tired the furniture has stains and holes, the bath towels are grey I’m colour as they have been used far too many times. We had marks of the floor and toe nails alongside the bed - dreadful .
We went to the pool
Deck which the pool was closed but the tiles are broken and uneven and very very hazardous.
There weee more birds seagulls at breakfast than guests. 
There is so much choice there is not one reason why I would ever return or come back .",1,2023,10,23
35,"Awful experience with staff who have no compassion, no understanding and we lost all our money!","I'm really disappointed with this hotel. I booked it for myself and my partner for her birthday on Saturday, and within a few hours we had to rearrange the trip because of a sad, unfortunate family emergency. We were passed from pillar to post with Expedia and were told to reach out to the hotel ourselves which we did. My partner emailed and explained the situation, asking for compassion, help and their understanding in order to change our booking from 18th - 21st October to 25th - 28th October. Literally the same package but for just a week later. We couldn't get through via phone so she emailed and all we got back from the hotel was to 'go back to Expedia' to sort out. I asked them again to help because we were getting no-where with Expedia, explaining the situation. Again, they didn't want to know. Here we are, asking for them to re-book and take our money and custom, yet they didn't seem interested. It's like that they didn't want £1400 from us! You'd think a hotel of such prestige would want to help their customers and show a little compassion with what had happened with our family circumstances at home. But nothing. And now, we were advised by Expedia to cancel our trip in order to get a refund from the hotel in order to rebook, but yesterday we were told that this was not possible and we've lost all our money. Absolutely appalling service. Now, we've lost all our money and now we have no trip for my partners birthday. I will never book this hotel in the future based on this experience. There will be better hotels, with understanding and compassionate staff elsewhere.",1,2023,10,19
35,Failed expectations,"“5 star”? Nope. Not sure how such ratings are acquired. 

They really fail at the little things. Very little toilet paper and small cheap rolls. No tissue paper for your nose. None. Really odd.  Few and hard to access outlets for charging. Most of our devices were on the floor. Really outdated. WiFi was inconsistent. 

The hotel is literally in the port.  It looks nice but you might not realize how loud those cruise liners can get. They seem to “beep” when backing up.

The worst problem was we ordered a bottle of wine with our visit to be delivered to the room prior to the trip. They seemed to forget. We reminded them for three days in a row. They failed to deliver every day. We paid for it and we had to remind them?!? They never delivered and finally agreed to a refund after refusing. Still waiting for the money. 

Positives included good breakfast. 10-minute walk to town. Lots of taxis there, mostly.",2,2023,10,18
35,Fantastic Hotel,What an amazing experience. Huge rooms. Immaculate condition. Staff was helpful and friendly. I recommended the hotel to my brother and he said the same. Excellent spot for cursing. Loads of taxis- and very cheap. Next time in Barcelona it will be my go to hotel,5,2023,10,16
35,Disappointed,"We do not recommend this hotel. We advise against it! Good morning, unfortunately we are not satisfied with the hotel we chose. The offer lacks information that the rooms are located right next to the passenger and cargo port. “Right next to” means that huge passenger ships were parked under my window, just 50 meters away. Stern in front of my window. The roar of the ships' engines with their engines running all the time made it impossible to sleep! This is outrageous. For a business center, I expected that the hotel rooms were facing the sea and the yacht marina, and not the ""stop"" of passenger ships. In addition, cruises announced through a loud megaphone... We feel cheated and treated disrespectfully. We felt like we were sleeping at the station. The reception allocates these terrible rooms and hopes that maybe it will work out. Room for 1200 euros for 4 nights. The hotel is gloomy. Narrow corridors. Furniture destroyed.",2,2023,10,10
35,Pre-Cruise Stay,"This was an excellent hotel to stay in when departing on a cruise. We arrived late at night and were upgrated to a suite, it was beautiful, the staff at the hotel were very quick on check in and the bell boy took our luggage for us and it was in the room before we arrived. Excellent service all round, we did not use any of the facilities but would definitely return to this lovely hotel.",5,2023,10,09
35,Good hotel location for cruise ship passengers,"When our flight from USA to Barcelona was canceled, the hotel staff, Ashley, was very helpful when we called. She made sure we will have our room when we arrived two days late, and she even upgraded our room at no charge.  
The room has a walk-in closet with plenty of storage spaces.  Bathroom was large.  Beds were comfortable. The breakfast buffet at the hotel has an amazing selection of food and drinks. And the servers are very friendly. 
Hotel is about ten minutes walk to a subway station and ten minutes drive to cruise ship terminal. There is a taxi stand right outside the hotel but somehow one day we had difficulty getting a taxi to dinner, but we got one from another taxi stand five minutes walk away.
The disappointing part was when we left to go on our cruise ship, the bell attendants did not retrieve and load all six pieces of our luggages (two large luggages, two carry on, and two backpacks) onto our taxi.  We brought our luggages down to bell service in the  morning for storage while we went exploring Montjuïc Castle.  Since there were two bell attendants helping us with our luggages when we were heading to our cruise ship in the afternoon, we just trusted that they got all of our luggages.  Luckily the hotel was ten minutes drive away.  When we realized the mistake when we got to the cruise ship port, the taxi driver took us back to the hotel right away.
Overall it was a good stay at Eurostars Marina.

35,Not 5 star,"Disappointing in many respects other than the view,poor value for what we paid . I should have checked it out better. No USB.  Coffee machine didn't work . Towels are old . Windows were dirty . Dinner service and food was slow  other than breakfast buffet (which was exellant )food was below average. The lock was broken on the patio door I was told twice it would be fixed and they told me it was because people could get locked out on the patio. Not acceptable  . i can see it was once a great hotel and could be again everything is fixable  they need to spend some money on this hotel.

Room was huge, with inward facing balcony. 
Breakfast was good, decent coffee. 
Great location to explore the city, less than 10mins walk from Las Ramblas.",4,2023,09,18
35,Good hotel for business trip,"A very good hotel with good facilities.

Typically used for corporate events being adjoined to the world trade centre the hotel has good facilities for anyone also staying in Barcelona. 

The rooms have good temperature control and are very clean. Bed was huge and comfortable with coffee and water provided. The mini fridge is a surcharge for the items within so I recommend bringing your own if your sensitive on price.

The bathroom was the highlight with a fantastic multi jet shower and also a bath with spa functions. Lovely tiled bathrooms make these a highlight.

Breakfast was provided and had a great selection, also catering for gluten intolerances well with its own section. Good coffee with hot food and a wide variety of deli style options. Was great.

Pool on the roof was a little small considering the size of the hotel and also the opening hours were a let down. With the hotel having a focus on business visitors you’d think they’d have a wider opening time for the pool to support this.  

Gym is on the roof and air conditioned and provides some good equipment to cover all basic workouts and weight training.

Overall, the hotel is quite grand and well suited for anyone visiting Barcelona. Only being a short walk into the city and beach locations. It is modern and clean with good facilities.",5,2023,09,15
35,Fabulous,"We have recently returned from Barcelona and this hotel and we had a fantastic time. The hotel is very well located, only a few minutes walk from La Rambla and a Metro Station. The open top buses also depart from very close by. All of the team were so friendly, nothing was too much trouble. Room was amazing and a fantastic view from the balcony. We also enjoyed breakfast. All in all a highly enjoyable stay. Thank you. ",5,2023,09,10
35,Fabulous hotel,"Absolutely loved our stay at this hotel. Booked a two night stay before we embarked on our cruise. The room allocated was lovely. Very big! The bed was really comfortable! 
Our room wasn’t ready on arrival and we were asked to go up to roof top bar for a refreshment. What a fantastic view so was well worth the wait. The staff were all very friendly. We had breakfast on our last morning. Great choice but expensive. 
Overall this hotel had everything we could ask for and was in a fantastic location too! ",5,2023,08,11
35,a wonderful hotel with great staff,"We stayed at the Marina hotel prior to our Virgin cruise the next day, we arrived very early before we could have access to our rooms, the reception staff could not have been more helpful, took our bags from us so we could go into Barcelona and explore, gave us a keycard so we could access the top floor pool area - just perfect :-)

the hotel was soo clean, the rooms were amazing, bathrooms wonderful, breakfast outstanding, drinks on the roof top bar superb :-)

the city tour buses have stops right outside the front of the hotel so we jumped on these to explore the city and got them back again rather than getting taxis - great idea and we seen the whole of Barcelona :-)

if you are thinking of booking this hotel don't hesitate - I would stay here every time I went to Barcelona :-)

35,Average stay nothing out of the ordinary. ,"Average stay nothing out of the ordinary. We stayed here as it was the closest to the cruise ship that we had just come off. It cost us £200 for 1 night. Nothing fantastic about it, basic place to lay your head. 

Its literally on the port. Its a good location about a 15 minute walk to the La Ramblas, however if you are looking to stay more in the centre then there are other hotels closer, if we weren't on the cruise then we would have stayed somewhere else closer to the centre. There are cheaper hotels closer to the centre, this hotel is one of the expensive in Barcelona. 

Check in is at 3pm. Whilst you wait you can access the pool area on the 8th floor. We did enquire around 1pm if the room was ready and they moved us to another room that was ready so we could check in. They store your luggage for you and once your room is ready bring your luggage to your room, this was a good service. 

The pool area was a complete let down. The pool is tiny, but in fairness I think most of the pools in the hotels in Barcelona are small. It also doesn't open till 11am, which I think is pretty late. 

We had some drinks and food on the roof top (where the pool was), and it was nice, the service was friendly. 

We booked a Superior Room, it was big and clean, we was quite impressed with the room. The walls are thin and you do hear the other doors slamming. We also had someone try to come into our room at 2am, I assume they must of been drunk and returned back to the wrong room trying the handle. There was also a smell of cannabis at some points throughout the hotel. The only downside to the room was that the TV was positioned in the middle of the room and not in front of the bed so it made it awkward to watch tele in bed, couldn't work out why they placed the TV there. 

There is a mini bar in the fridge, my understanding is that it was not free, it only included some small juices and waters, I think these should have been free given the price but there we are. 

They do offer room service, there are no menus in the room, you have to scan the code and get the menu online. 

We had breakfast included (I should think so for the price), it was standard, with pastries teas/coffee's, meats, cheeses etc, its buffet so help yourself. There was a tiny cart for gluten free Products, for those who are gluten free. 

In terms of the local area, its right on the port, if you come of the hotel and walk straight then right, and keep going, it takes you around the marina and eventually if you keep walking you can walk to the beach, (about 20/30 minute walk), however, if you come out of the hotel and turn right, and then after a couple of lefts it takes you to La Ramblas.

Its a 10 minute walk to the bottom of the La Ramblas 
Its a 30 minute walk to the Plaça de Catalunya. 
Its a 1 hour walk to the Sagrada Família 
Its a 30 minute walk to the beach Platja de Sant Sebastià.

I would stay here again, but only if we were using the port for the cruise, otherwise I think I would stay closer to the town if I was doing more sight seeing.  ",3,2023,08,01
35,Poor quality 5 stars hotel,"I stayed in the Hotel for 4 nights. From day one, I didn’t feel that this hotel is worth the money or even worth to be 5 stars hotel maybe 3-4 stars but never 5 stars. I will explain our experience in a constructive criticism and fairly review based on facts and not assumptions.
1)  Restroom smells very bad because of ventilation was not working, and none of the windows for the room could be open. This would increase the Humidity in the bathroom as well as the room itself and will cause this bad smell.
2) when walking in the corridor in 6th floor where we stayed, we smelt awful smelling , smell like Hash/Marijuana everywhere. I couldn’t believe that this could happen in a 5 stars hotel. But after walking in Barcelona city we realized that this is almost legalized in the City. But still the hotel should consider guests with Asthma or have hard breathing. We tried to change the room and explained the situation but staff were not cooperative.
3) Most of the guests in this hotel are commercially related or events related guests, but not private guests, that’s why staff do not give any attention or even care about Privat guests. So if you are booking as private guest then don’t expect so much because you will be very disappointed.
4) After 4 nights in this hotel I realized that the administration of this hotel does not give any attention to the maintenance of the hotel. This was my experience after 4 nights as a regular private guest who booked via booking.com. Many things were broken and even we have oriented the staff but nothing happened, I have registered and documented as well all my observations so my review is based on fact and not just words. Our closet were broken for 4 nights without any fix, even closet in their fitness were broken, restrooms were broken, training machines were broken in fitness, sauna was not working in fitness even after i called staff, I was collecting cigarettes from swimming pool on 8th floor. I have spotted a sign in fitness area it was like an announcement from the hotel that they sorry for any bad experience for guests.

Plus for this hotel is:
1) location
2) breakfast 
Please check my attached photos",1,2023,07,12
35,Awful time at the Marina - 1 night that felt like days of slow torture of issues,"The experience from start to finish was atrocious service and poor quality. 
1. Asked for early checkin and we’re told they’d try. Ended up getting in AFTER guaranteed checkin time. 
2. When got keys only got to 1 of the family suite rooms not two so another trip to lobby 
3. Room service couldn’t take order properly so had to go ask in person.  
4. Waited over an hour for basic food 
5. Was told at checkin breakfast was included and then when went down this AM it was not. Last straw. What suite room for over $1K a night doesn’t include breakfast. 
Joke of a hotel and awful service. Won’t be back. Suggest avoiding.",1,2023,07,09
35,Don’t book unless you want an 18/30s pool vibe,"We booked a family suite to relax and enjoy two nights of time together before boarding our cruise from Barcelona. First impressions were good, room spacious and perfect for a family of 4 to stay. We ate tapas lunch in the restaurant which was an ok meal but hugely overpriced.
We were looking toward to an afternoon by the pool relaxing. We had been there 5 minutes sat poolside with our 6 and 9 year old enjoying the pool when a large group arrived and it turned into a loud raucous 18-30s style pool area. Lots of smoking, heavily intoxicated young adults who were pushing each other in the pool almost landing on my child on more than one occasion. The children were scared and we had no option but to leave. Very disappointed children, a ruined afternoon and hotel didn’t do anything to resolve the issue to make it suitable for children. Don’t bother booking a ‘family’ suite as the hotel prioritise large groups of drunk party animals and don’t care about families of young children who want half an hour of safe fun in the pool.",1,2023,07,07
35,Exceptional experience,"Exceptional experience , actually i had the best experience ever in hotel from the service and welcoming at the first when i reach to the hotel at 12 PM they told me sorry the room will be ready at 3 Pm and i was so tired from travelling but 

Special thanks to Paula front reception she gave me a room at 1 Pm as i was so tried from traveling 

The resturant at first floor was so cool and the room was so big and clean but it needed a better view but its okay i liked the 8th floor pool rooftop also was so great but what I didn’t like 

That they let me pay taxes for 2 adults as if its a double room while am single person 

The gym was also good for the hotel 

And the location was really amazing as its on marina and just 10 mins walking away from la rambla street",5,2023,07,04
35,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location ","We booked this hotel after we discovered that our cruise ship docked right at the side of it and as we were staying an extra night in Barcelona after our cruise we booked whilst on the ship.  We got off our cruise around 10.30am and walked straight across to the hotel.  They took all our details and said our room wasn't quite ready but could leave all our luggage and this would be moved upto our room when it was free.  We discussed we would like to to the open top city tour bus and straight away we were able to purchase these tickets direct from the hotel, bonus!  We left and returned around 4pm.  We were greeted with the most fantastic news that we had been given a free upgrade to a suite!  And it's was absolutely fantastic!  I cannot say a single thing was bad or needed any improvement, it was truly out of this world!  Being really hot outside the amazing Aircon in our room was very welcome.  The bathroom was just massive, we didn't use the bath but a fantastic shower with huge rainfall shower head, all the shampoo, conditioner and soaps smelt gorgeous.  They even left toothbrushes and toothpaste, absolutely everything had been thought of.  There was a stocked mini bar in our room, but we just had water. Bathrobes were also supplied.
We had some dinner outside on the terrace, tapas and a burger and this was beautiful.  Ice cream for pudding washed down with a lovely cold beer.
Staff were also fantastic and so accommodating and couldn't do enough to please.
Will definitely stay again, great location and we loved Barcelona, we need a longer stay next time.
Just perfect, thank you for making the end of our holiday so amazing.",5,2023,06,28
35,First impression is the last impression,"I visited in June 2023 and stayed for five nights. My experience began on a sour note due to an unfortunate encounter at reception. I arrived at 1 pm, aware that check-in wasn't until 3 pm. However, when I asked about a place to freshen up as I was travelling with a toddler, one particular individual at the front desk suggested the rooftop gym area rather than the more comfortable first-floor lobby. This experience left me feeling unfairly treated, which tarnished my initial impression of the hotel. Apart from this incident, the hotel's spacious rooms and decent breakfast were appreciated. Carlos and Othman, specifically, provided commendable service during my stay.",3,2023,06,21
35,Don't Judge a hotel by it's name or star classification ,"Unfortunately our experience with the hotel differs from the majority of the  reviews.  I am writing this to be honest as the reviews were a big factor when we booked  We should have in the first instance looked more closely into the location, Grand Marina is somewhat misleading, Grand Industrial Ferry and Cruise Ship Port is far more accurate. The smell of diesel in the air and the constant engine noise from the ships is hard to ignore.  We had a cruise ship docked so close to our room I could practically see what they were having for breakfast!!  The other rooms unfortunately have views of either the office blocks or the taxi rank.   The hotel was very clean and the room a good size and I have no doubt that once upon a time it was five star but it's in desperate need of modernisation or a more realistic classification. Where I feel most let down is I should not have to request toilet roll 3 times in a five star hotel. Due to their workload I understand that things may be missed by the maid.  The problem is not the issue, it's how it's rectified, or not in our instance.  By my third request my patience was wearing thin and when complaining direct to the Manager / Director  to be told to shush was totally unprofessional .  I eventually resorted to helping myself from the maids trolley as needs must! The food we also found to be substandard. As it was my Birthday whilst we were away we ordered  a room service breakfast and at a cost of 40 Euros we expected more than a frilly, crispy overcooked egg and half a plate of raw cherry tomatoes. After another 'conversation' with the Manager this was duly refunded, but we didn't however expect to return to our room 6 hours later to find the breakfast still there in our unmade non toilet paper accommodation. Again after another 'chat' we were offered a bottle of champagne and a fruit bowl.  The bottle of warm Cava and the slice of chocolate cake was close enough!!   I must commend the general reception, bar and the concierge staff who were lovely and should not be having to deal with issues beyond  their control.  ",2,2023,06,19
35,5 Star Service - Excellent Hotel - Highly Recommend,"This hotel is 5 star and probably one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at in Europe.  I visited Barcelona with my husband for a work conference that was being held at this hotel.  Everything was exceptional. 
First, we were on the fifth floor near the elevator, and still did not hear a thing. We slept soundly and it was quiet. The bed was comfortable, shower was fantastic, and it was very clean. The cleaning service asked us if everything was okay with the room a couple times during our stay.  The water was complimentary in our room.  We had sufficient space in the room. 
Our first night we went to the rooftop bar and had a nice view. The Octopus and croquettes were EXCEPTIONAL.  We met some other couples during our stay from the UK and Switzerland. 
The front desk and concierge were very helpful and thankfully all employees spoke English very well.  (I speak Spanglish!) haha 
The breakfast was a wide variety and the fruit was VERY fresh.  They have espresso machines for your lattes, cappuccinos, americanos, etc. 
The Lunch and Appetizers served during my conference were delicious and they had a good variety.  The first time I had pink and green colored buns on sliders! 
The location is great - easy walk to La Ramblas and Port Vell. It was 15 Euro from the train station and 28 Euro to the airport.  
Highly recommend this hotel and we would definitely stay again.",5,2023,06,16
35,Amazing views and scenic location,"I have neglected to review the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel following my first visit there last summer.  I had read mixed reviews before booking but booked anyway as I wanted a room with a balcony and a view.  
I was not disappointed, I was actually amazed.  
I have traveled widely in my many years to some beautiful places all over the world and stayed in some great hotels but I have never had a room with a view this magnificent.  Most city hotels, no matter how luxurious, cannot offer a view like this.  I will post one of the many photos I took from my balcony.

But first as to some of the negative comments.  Yes it is a ""convention/conference style"" hotel. It is big and a little impersonal.  The common areas are not grand, but nice nonetheless.   That said, I found the check-in staff to be excellent.  I did not interact with many staff, again that is part of the nature of a large hotel like this, except the front desk and, mostly, the bartenders at the second floor bar who had to tolerate this ice-loving American bothering them daily for ice.  They did so with a smile.
The location, literally above the water and adjacent to the port and the conference center, is both great and sometimes less so, but only for short amounts of time.  Why?  
Great because, again, the views are breathtaking, especially if you like ports, ships, ferries, etc like I do.  
The downside is that it can get a little smoky at times outside and especially on the rooftop bar when ships are departing and ships often dock literally adjacent to the hotel.
I also read about cleanliness issues but I did not experience any concern with cleanliness.  My room was perfectly clean and in great condition.

I splurged for a Grand Suite (Room 611) on this visit and I am glad I did.  The room was modern and well equipped with a great bathroom, a wonderful bed, an amazing terrace and, I'll say it again, the most amazing views one can imagine.   The room was larger than one person could really take advantage of but the view was worth it.

The location, which gives it such views, is pretty great if you are a good walker.  It is a fairly short walk to the base of La Rambla but nothing, except a really tasty cafe, is actually nearby.  Bikes can be rented nearby and the location to start a bike ride is perfect.

If you are willing to trade being slightly away from the main tourist areas (which can also be a GREAT thing), you will more than make up for it with the views from this Port Vell location.  Breathtaking.

I will return to the Eurostars Grand Marina hotel, as soon as I can.",5,2023,06,16
35,Comfortable and safe vacation.,"The hotel is nice, but the best experience was Ricardo Silvestre, Director/Manager.  I thought he was the concierge.  He was the epitome of customer service! Very warm, inviting and most helpful! Most of the front desk staff were nice and helpful. Accommodations were nice and clean.  I wish I had included the breakfast buffet in my stay - next time.",4,2023,06,01
35,Great stay in a great location,Great hotel. Check in was quick and efficient - we were upgraded to a city view room and it was great. The balcony and the view really added to our weekend break. Perfect location - very close to the busy city centre yet felt you were much more remote as was very quiet and relaxed. Would definitely recommend.,5,2023,05,30
35,Great choice in Barcelona,"Positive points: Great location (10 min walk to La Rambla) , 24 hour gym and a roof garden with amazing view to wharf and the city and spacious rooms.
Negative points: Low variety of breakfast and very simple decoration of lobby",4,2023,05,13
35,Convenient for pre cruise stay,"We chose this 5star hotel due to its proximity to the Cruise terminal. 
I have rated it as average due to the lack of detail we experienced during our one night, pre cruise stay. 
The receptionist confused our booking, and did the quizzical look we all fear when looking at his screen anxious that our booking can’t be found!  
We were given a twin bedded room instead of a double although the view over the port was excellent. 
The cocktails were awful, for some reason they added lime juice to my grey goose martini. 
We ate in their restaurant and the service was friendly but amateurish. Things missed off our order, wrong wine list although overall the food was acceptable. 
Would choose somewhere else next time to avoid these irritants.",3,2023,05,13
35,Grand. Marina,"just exactly what I need for 3 nightd b4 i wander around Spain.. its my 3rd Stay.. but why do I always pay top price and never get offered a good deal. seems disloyal to me

35,"Misleading 5* hotel, Overpriced travelodge.","Disappointed I have to write this review as I had such high hopes in recommending this hotel to travel clients but most unfortunately wont be due to but was let down from the start. Room had an awful view of office blocks so no privacy, windows were not even able to open so no fresh air. floors were stained. The spa bath didn't even work, shower leaked. 
Do not expect a lay in here as you will get woken up by housekeeping by cleaning as the walls are paper thin you can hear everything - talking, doors being closed, opening and closing of drawers although it sounded like they were slamming everything as the walls are so thin.
in regards to the amenities there was not a rooftop bar as advertised, pool could only fit 10 people in for a hotel of this size its shocking but was unable to use it anyway as it was closed off also. No actual spa onsite, someone comes to your room but for the price you would pay for the service I would expect the full spa experience especially for a 5* hotel!
Gym felt really dated and limited also with the spa facing the showers which I found odd.
Breakfast buffet offered a reasonable cold selection but a very poor hot selection but would expect a sit down breakfast being 5* not cold meats and cheeses for breakfast, Didn't even get to eat breakfast on the last day as was no tables and lack of food so walked out as it wasn't even worth it. in my opinion there wasn't the multiple restaurants as advertised just different seating selections. 
I personally just feel very mislead in what I received to what I saw via there website, A very overpriced Travelodge in  opinion. most defiantly not 5* quality. 
Would not go back here and unfortunately will not be recommending this hotel to my travel clients who expect 5* luxury stays - this is not that. ",2,2023,04,30
35,"No 5 stars, maybe 3","It was much worse that I expected, there is battered furniture, stained chairs and moquette, horrible runner of 90's. It was impossible to sleep - too noisy, I have heard TV of neighbours, talks etc. The floor of balcony isn't stable and not clean, we hadn't any desire to go there. Another thing to adjust - a leaking water faucet. 
Just a thing I liked is a breakfast - good selection and pretty place outside and nice staff - helpful and smiling. But horrible coffee and depressing view from a window... 
",2,2023,04,24
35,Great pre-cruise hotel,"We stayed here before departing on a cruise. Spacious rooms with beautiful views of the city. Easy walk to dining, shopping and everything Barcelona. Nice bar on site. The best shower ever! Really well appointed. Lovely staff. Would definitely stay again!",5,2023,04,10
35,Fantastic hotel,Fantastic hotel. Great location next to cruise port. Staff are excellent. The 3 rooms we got were better than we booked. Fabulous upgrade. Huge balcony looking on to the marina. Rooms were huge. Bar was lovely and breakfast was the best selection I’ve seen in any hotel. Look forward to returning soon.,5,2023,04,10
35,"Definitely not 5*, rooms look tried the bath was dirty and broken, couple of the staff so far have been in helpful.","Not 5*, reception poor service, given the wrong room at check in then the alternative room they offered had a view of a building site,said the hotel was full so there’s nothing they could do,wish I would of booked somewhere else in Barcelona.",1,2023,04,08
35,A very good experience!,"I booked an overnight at the hotel as we were boarding an Azamara cruise that departed from Barcelona. The cruise ship was literally next to the hotel so a one minute walk. The room was spacious with a balcony and the bed very comfortable. A drink in the bar late evening was very pleasant. Staff were efficient and friendly. We couldn't open our room at one point and when I went to Reception, the General Manager looked after us and even came up to the room with us to ensure the problem was solved - most impressive. We were able to eat the included breakfast outside in the sun and it was very pleasant indeed with a good range of hot and cold food and bottles of Cava available. We asked for a short extension to the room and were granted a late check out to coincide with our embarkation. The hotel was a good choice and for the convenience we wanted, we couldn't have been more pleased.  ",4,2023,04,04
35,Excellent ,"Excellent. I travel a lot but this hotel is worth speaking about. From the moment we arrived, We were met at the door, with smile and help.
The reception staff were equally wonderful and helpful.
The room is fabulous... comfortable and very clean. With everything you need.
Just 5minute walk from las ramblas and over looks the water.
We originally booked a hostel for £170pn...this room is £220 Inc breakfast... definitely worth the extra small amount.
I couldn't recommend it enough.",5,2023,03,31
35,One day we come back!,"Me and my partner stayed in this hotel from 10.03-13.03.2023. We do travel a lot around the world, but this hotel we found one of the best. Clean comfortable room, friendly personal. We would like to express our special gratitude to the receptionist Alexandra , who really did her best to keep us happy. I can not help mentioning, that the restaurant was open for breakfast till 11 am, what was giving us a possibility to get a longer sleep in the morning. 
May we ever visit Barcelona, we definitely choose Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel again!",5,2023,03,22
35,Disappointing stay,"The Staff in the reception was really unfriendly from the first day. Sea View Room in 5 stars hotel with many many defects (for example at least one gush of burning hot water followed by freezing cold water every 30 seconds during showering, loud knocking noises on the wall until 3 O’clock in the morning, 2 small water bottles as a welcome and that it and calling the staff didn’t really change anything ( for example: the hot water thing was in the whole hotel !! ) Room Price for the night was around 242 without taxes (760 Euro for 3 nights). Sadly disappointing stay, the worst in my life.",1,2023,03,15
35,Birthday weekend away!,"Stayed here for the weekend with my other half as a birthday treat, room was lovely, en suite was amazing with a fantastic shower! Whole hotel was spotless and the staff were amazing and very friendly and helpful. Can’t wait to visit again! :)",5,2023,03,11
35,The buffet breakfast is very tasty and delicious.,The Hotel Eurostars Grand Marina is located in next to the Mediterranean Sea and very nice location. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. Just walking distance 2 minutes Christopher Colombo statue is locate and it is the start of the Ramblas walkway. ,5,2023,02,04
35,Everything good accept breakfast,"Breakfast was loads on offer but a cooked one was not good.
Fried eggs were hard.Scramble eggs tasteless,  baked beans like warm  and no bacon, had not run out did not cook any. Coffee was disgusting, TEA everything accept YORKSHIRE TEA.
Rant Over",3,2022,12,23
35,5 Stars All Around,"I only stayed here for one night, but that was more than enough time for me to experience the outstanding customer service of this hotel. 
The purpose of my stay was for a cruise to Italy departing from Barcelona. I travel a lot so I am usually very well prepared for everything, but this was a last minute trip so I did unknowingly slack a bit. 
This first became apparent when I realized I had forgotten my US to Euro electrical adapter. A simple walk the front desk took care of that really quickly when they simply opened a drawer and handed me one. Now that type of service may be good for three stars, but hold on, there’s more. 
Now that my phone was fully charged I decided to head out exploring, and that’s when the location of this hotel came into play. It was fairly late in the evening when I headed out, but the local nightlife was still alive and well. There is PLENTY to do all within walking distance of here. So now we might be up to four stars. 
Here is when they earned five… I returned to my room and was getting ready for my cruise when I realized I had left all of my boarding documents in my car… back in Washington DC!!! I immediately went into a controlled panic and tried calling the cruise line. Nothing. Went through my emails. Nothing but a confirmation number. Then I walked to the front desk where I was told calmly they would take care of it. I forwarded them my email confirmation and minutes later they returned with all of my boarding documents. Don’t know how, but they were there. And that my friend is why this hotel received five stars. 
A special thanks to Albert, Julia, and the rest of the Eurostars team. You guys were amazing!!!",5,2022,12,14
35,Nice hotel but service inconsistent. Great location. ,"This is a nice hotel in a great location. The city suite room we stayed in had a nice separate living area and the bed was huge. The travel cot provided for our toddler was also good quality and bedding was provided for it. Breakfast was great - huge selection of food. The bar area was also nice and relaxing.

However what let this hotel down was the service. Our room was not ready when we arrived gone 7pm and they took extra time setting up a travel cot, which was annoying as we had a tired toddler and we’d contacted them ahead of time specifically to ensure this ran smoothly. Room service was usually slow too, and while there’s a coffee machine provided, if you drink tea you have to ring down for tea bags and milk, which is a bit annoying.

Also, the pool was closed (November). This was not stated as a seasonal pool on the website so this was disappointing.

We wouldn’t rush back but it was a nice enough hotel. Great if you (or your toddler) loves boats and heavy machinery as lots to see near the port!",4,2022,11,14
35,Unique,"Everything was more than great,the reception the room  the size of room is huge the bathroom the tub the shower great ours was family room you could separate the suit with drawing door ,the breakfast Everything awesome the terace view  of the  room was splendid you could see the whole barcelona withe sea view besides the location of the hotel 10 minue walk to la Rambla,very close to hop on hop off station thanks for the kind friendly reception who were so supportive and helpful",5,2022,11,14
35,Enjoyed our stay,"We really liked this hotel, good sized comfortable room, cleaned daily to a high standard. Excellent breakfast. Very good location, close to the beach, La Rambla and overlooking the marina. Taxi rank right outside and bus stop, including the hop on hop off bus. I don't think it deserves the poor reviews from others!",4,2022,11,12
35,.,"Bad service, the room was not ready in time. The restaurant had poor service and tasteless food at an overpriced price. would not choose this hotel again.
 The pool area was not at all as it looked in the pictures. the pool was also closed during our entire stay for no reason.",2,2022,11,07
35,Not a five star hotel,"Is supposed to be a five star rated hotel but is not. Poor service, restaurant service is the worst, and the food, not to be suggested. Good breakfast however. Not in a good place if you are in Barcelona for sightseeing since it far away from everything but the marina.",1,2022,11,06
35,Great hotel by the pier,"The hotel is by the pier, good size rooms. Easy to move around. You can walk to anywhere. It has a good reception area. It has amazing staff that are always willing to help. Food not so great. The views are nice. I booked a suite so my room was soacious with a lounge. I enjoyed my stay",4,2022,10,22
35,Average hotel in a great position ,"The hotel is in a convenient location for access to various shops and restaurants, the Maremàgnum shopping centre, the Hop On Hop Off Bus (World Trade Centre stop) and La Rambla. It's also only about 30 minutes walk to the beach. We had premium sea view rooms which had lovely views across the water and we even had a warship docked outside our windows for some of our stay, which provided entertainment. But the sea view rooms on the opposite side of the hotel (the right side, as you look at the hotel from the front) would have had their views blocked by enormous cruise ships, so beware when booking a sea view room. The rooms are outdated and could have nicer furniture and the carpets in the corridors to the rooms are severely stained in places and need replacing. Guests are provided with a pod coffee machine in the rooms, along with a kettle, tea bags of various flavours and sugar - but no milk! You have to order milk on room service, which is quite ridiculous! Breakfast is served on the 1st floor - there is quite a variety of food but a lot of it doesn't have much flavour (the scrambled eggs, Spanish omelette and chicken sausages were bland, the bacon was swimming in fat and grease and the pastries didn't have any flavour either). The saving grace was the carrot cake, which was quite nice.  The staff at the front desk were very helpful and even printed our boarding passes for us. Overall this hotel is not bad and I would stay here again for the convenient location but be advised this shouldn't be a 5 star hotel.",3,2022,10,20
35,"If, like me, you are fascinated by ports and ships - go!","We managed to get a room overlooking the quay where the cruise liners dock and this gave me a fine view of the port.  The terrace on the hotel's roof is disappointing and the tiny swimming pool derisory. We had one meal in the hotel's bar which was good as it included a perfectly grilled steak on the outside wood grill.  The front of hotel staff could not have been more helpful and their advice as to where to eat was perfect.  The problem with this hotel is that all the staff work hard but have no backup from the management. There were several thing that did not work properly in our room and when we asked for Housekeeping to come, no one appeared.",3,2022,10,13
35,"Great View, but HORRIBLE service","I booked (and pre-paid) for 3 nights in a Superior Double/Twin Room with Sea View in which I selected a King Bed and based on the photos the room had a specific spacious layout I liked. The room was definitely not what was advertised and was the smaller version with 2 twin beds (which is priced differently). Upon calling them to switch rooms, they told me this won't be possible till the next day. It was a long day of travel and I decided to accept my fate - but the bathroom had plans of its own. The shower window was broken and water leaked all the way into the bedroom. I had to request several towels for the floors and to check the bathroom, but nobody did. The only thing keeping me there was the nice view out of the window of the room I certainly didn't choose.

On the 2nd day, I was moved to a much larger room (the one I actually booked!) and the views were stunning. The bathroom was great with both a rainfall shower and tub, with no leaking issues. I also had a king bed! So far so good. Problem was I needed to ask a question about taxis and the reception did not answer after calling several times. There always seemed to be a lot of them frazzled but surely one can answer...?

The third day, which was my last, something strange started happening to the TV. My TV seemed to connect with another room and they would be switching channels, playing their youtube videos and exiting whatever media I was playing. At some point, the user's name appeared on my screen and they started playing disturbing clips and one specifically relating to my country - which obviously freaked me out. I called reception about this and they did not seem like they knew how to help. I called again to check if they spoke to the user (which I gave them his name) but they did not do anything. This TV table tennis continued till 1 am. I booked this place to relax and enjoy my time in bed before my flight tomorrow, not to fight over the TV with my neighbor behind the wall - who I was certain knew where I was from and was playing games with me now. 

After all this drama, I just wanted some water. Room service said it would cost over 7 Euros. I was not accepting that and believed I should receive a complimentary small one considering all my troubles that night. I rang reception and there was no answer. So I went downstairs and spoke to the man at the front desk. I informed him about the water and also asked if anything was done about the TV situation. He immediately gave me attitude and then said that he picked up but I didn't answer and started to get defensive and aggressive with me, which was really rude and unnecessary. Considering I've paid to be here and on each day had some sort of bizarre experience, he should be polite and civil. Instead, he was quite short and even said that I should get a max of 2 bottles but begrudgingly went to get me more. 

Look - the hotel is really nice in itself. Very big. Decent rooms (go for the bigger ones with sea view!). And some staff members downstairs like the bell-hops and concierges were lovely people who helped me when it came to luggage and arranging cabs with pure class. The people at the front desk though need a course in hotel management and customer service. We get it - you're tired and dealing with requests can sometimes be a pain, but the shortness I experienced tonight from the man at the desk was not necessary. It felt like he was ready to slap me. For a hotel of this caliber that is not ok. I was literally telling him that my TV was being hacked by the neighbor and I would like some water to take my medicine. Surely I'm not that horrible of a guest!",2,2022,10,04
35,"Excellent stay, regardless of some detractors views.","Booked 1 night due to it’s proximity to our cruise ship, as it is literally about 50m to the South Terminal N quay.
Detractors saying it was not 5 star anymore are rather over critical in my view.
We stayed Sept. 25, and all I can say is that check in was easy, our request for a high floor was met. The room was extremely spacious, clean, and well appointed, with sofa and 2 comfortable chairs. All rooms appear to have a balcony.
We arrived late so had no dinner, but the breakfast and service on the terrace was excellent. The array of buffet choice was as good as it gets.
The roof terrace is sensational with views of the port, Barcelona over to the Gaudi's Sagradia Familia.
It is true that this has dated a little, but it's still a very good hotel, and we would gladly stay here again without a cruise on our itinerary. It is just 10 mins walk to La Ramblas.
A minor point, but in the bathroom the tiling on corners doesn't have the usual edging strip; it actually has recessed polished tile edges (see pic), which I have never seen before, so whoever set the spec and budget for it's build was not thrifty. Marble abounds.
Staff readily gave smiles, and were helpful, so I take it as I find it 
One final point regarding room choice 1 night ok for internal atrium view room, any longer ask for an outside room.
All views from the roof terrace.",5,2022,09,27

35,Chris Maunder,"Visit did not bode well whilst checking in, when another guest threw his key card at the receptionist and stormed out!
No way is this hotel 5 star I would say 3 perhaps a low 4 at best.
Reception are not the slightest bit interested in any of your questions.
Our room was not serviced for three of the seven nights! Can you believe that in a 5 star hotel!
Our room 403 was ok but tired and could do with an update.
Room is very noisy at night as there is a ferry ship and a cruise ship docked either side of the hotel with engines running late into the night.
Breakfast is very good but entirely self service without either tea or coffee being offered at the table.
My best advice is to avoid at all cost.",1,2022,09,13
35,City break supposedly 5* absolutely NOT,"Visit didn’t start well with visitors to hotel throwing keys at receptionists then we realised why DO NOT come here if you want 5* I would rate this hotel at best 3/4* as bedrooms do not get serviced everyday
No help on trips at desk/reception

Everything overpriced for quality 
Breakfast good but you have to serve yourself completely and search for cutlery etc 
Wouldn’t recommend this hotel at all",1,2022,09,13
35,NOT a five star hotel barely a 3 star,"This hotel is very worn out if they had a five star rating it may have been decades ago when standards lower. Perhaps they forget to update their advertising and this is concerning then for Barcelona ratings that there is no governance on the hotel ratings. Noisy noisy hotel, poor quality on all aspects of the stay.  Suggest you book wisely and read more reviews of the same poor experience.",1,2022,09,12
35,"Do not be fooled, this is NOT a 5* hotel","Whilst it charges 5* prices, this is not a 5* hotel.  Upon check in the staff seemed more interested in speaking to each other than helping the clients (and there were about 6 people behind the reception).  I was asked to wait 5-10 minutes and to come back for my room keys, I came back 20 minutes later and was told my room still was not ready.  

Once received, no instructions were given on any of the amenities (although the rooftop bars were closed anyway).  

Decor is very old and faded, the carpet was very dirty on our floor.

There are much better cheaper hotels in Barcelona.",1,2022,09,05

35,Below expectations,"Not all the lights work, not all of the receptacles have power. The tub/ shower drain requires removing broken plug. One of the sinks takes 5 min. To drain.  Check in took over 30 min. Once clerk was available.  Denied room charge at rooftop bar, because credit account wasn’t set up, though typical credit card run for incidentals was performed st check in. When requested to speak with manager, told there was none on duty. That speaks for itself.",1,2022,08,19

35,Stayed for 2 nights before our cruise in June,"Stayed for 2 nights before our cruise in June. Saw mixed reviews but happy to say we had an excellent experience.  Room was large for our family of 4 (2 twin beds and a pull out double couch) and a really large closet, bathroom and entry area. Had late lunch on the second floor (tapas) that was very good. Also ate breakfast 2x at the buffet and it was amazing! More expensive than we usually spend on breakfast but a great value for the money! Location was great. Would stay again.",5,2022,08,09
35,Certainly not the best in town,"This hotel is nice, at least my junior suite, but they decided to reduce air conditioning putting all the clients in a big oven in the breakfast restaurant and in the lobby. The rooms are also very hot and the very weak air conditioning system stops every 15’. If their system is down or if they have decided to follow I don’t know which stupid environmental policy they should at least warn their clients upon reservation. They didn’t do so.
The service was also very poor even if the room was quite clean. No way to give your room number in order to pay your drinks … it doesn’t work!
The swimming pool is so tiny that it’s not a place you can enjoy. Obviously during this very hot summer all clients are trying to get some freshwater consequently this place was overcrowded.",3,2022,08,01
35,"Over-occupied hotel, noisy and lack of customer service - AVOID AT ALL COSTS","Our stay was booked on a ""Romantic Special Offer""; a queen bed and a premium price were charged over and above the room rate. The expectation would be maybe a nice view, balcony, maybe a neat towel arrangement on the bed in the shape of a heart or something HOWEVER we were given the key to a room with two single beds. 

The hotel reception said that this was the best they could do and, likely in an attempt to compel us to stay, told us no other rooms were available and if we wanted a double bed, they would need to find us another hotel. We agreed and arrived at the reception to be told that there actually was a room with a view on the 6th floor. Please see the photo. 

Sadly our evening and night were ruined firstly by the over-occupied rooms opposite, leaving their doors open throughout the night to let their young children run riot and secondly, the view was that of the side of an eight-deck cruise liner, as tall as the hotel. You could open the window and converse with passengers on the 7th and 8th floors. A manager would be available in the morning to complain, so we tolerated the situation.

The following morning we attended the reception to be told no manager was available until around 11 am, then at 11 am were told that a manager would be available at 3 pm. Coincidentally the time our flight leaves for the Middle East. 

We left our details and phone number; sadly, no one from the hotel has called or replied to our emails which is a huge disappointment. 

I recommend choosing any hotel other than this one - AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",1,2022,07,27
35,Re book somewhere else if you're booked here,"Stayed for 2 days for our 25th wedding anniversary. 

Booked a suite, we changed rooms 4 times as the room they gave was dirty, NOT a suite, the final room we accepted was also well below suite standard. They had no more rooms.

They were absolutely unhelpful. The entire hotel is tired, dirty and is absolutely not represented by the 5 star given.

I would suggest rebooting somewhere else if you're booked here. 

The breakfast was passable, the bar had limited choices.

We would never stay here again",1,2022,07,25
35,"Nice , modern and spacious ","Rooms are impressive, spacious in comparison to the European standards , the roof top is charming with amazing views , location is not that great , a bit far off from most of the attractions unless u re up for walking , breakfast is great with good variety , specially the pastry section , all in all was a good experience ",4,2022,07,15
35,Really poor - very surprised,"So this hotel has a 5 Star rating but it is definitely a 3+ - not quite a 4.
The suite that we had although large was (is) very dirty.
There are dead bugs under sofas that haven't been moved to be cleaned underneath for a long time.
Shelving is covered in dust.
Hand pulls are missing on doors.
The carpets in the corridors are filthy, stained and tired throughout.
Wires are hanging down the walls from the TV.
The electrical system needs some attention - you turn off a light the TV turns off. You turn on another the music system comes on.
Came back from a rather draining experience in town to have a cocktails and food on the 8th floor at the bar and despite there being only approximately 6 tables occupied and asking 3 times we were unable to even place an order for food and drink and left after 40 minutes of being ignored.
Overall - poor.",2,2022,07,04
35,Forget this place if you expect a marina,Not at all as advertised except for waterfront rooms which they post on their site.   We reserved such a room and had email chain concerning this transaction.  This was a month and a half in advance of our visit. Of the two clerks we spoke to no interest was shown in looking at that.  The room is not clean and not worth the 350 euros cost.  Guaranteed NOT five stars.  Our view us like a concrete jungle.  This is a harsh review but it is a valid one. See attached photos balcony has no furniture and is dirty…unless you plan to jump?  No value.,2,2022,06,20
35,Fantastic stay,"We were staying prior to a cruise, and after reading some of the reviews I was nervous, I did contact the hotel to talk about my concerns.  However I shouldn't have worried we had the most fantastic stay.

I don't think I could have picked a better hotel in both location and service, the staff were fantastic very friendly and nothing was to much trouble.

Breakfast well what can I say one of the best breakfast's I have ever had it was a buffet style but they had so many options the food quality was high.

We had a drink in the bar which was reasonably priced and again the staff were really helpful.

Our room we had a suite which looked out over the city wow, it had a rood terrace which we loved and were we going onto a cruise and literally woke up in the morning almost being able to touch the ship.  I guess I would agree with some that the rooms are somewhat dated however they were clean and fresh and it didn't impact our stay.  

I would totally recommend this hotel if you are off on a cruise particularly if you are on a Virgin cruise as she docked next door.

To round up the hotel is in a great position a short walk to a shopping centre with shops and restaurants and about a 10 min walk from the main shopping area La Rambla.  The staff are amazing and the breakfast is a must.

I was worried prior to going because of some of the reviews however I am glad that I ignored them and booked we weren't disappointed at all we loved our stay.",5,2022,05,26
35,Would not recommend!,My husband and I stayed here after getting off of the virgin Cruise so we had a day to rest before flying back to the US. The hotel is much older than it looks in photos and the lobby is hot and stuffy. Our room was not very clean and in fact had an old bag of nuts in a drawer from another guest. The bed was incredibly uncomfortable and it has wood floors that echo so you hear everyone else in the hotel all day/night.  We had one roll of toilet tissue and had to call for more the next morning. The breakfast buffet was subpar and a fire alarm kept going off on our floor over and over. We were not impressed at all by the hotel or the staff. For the price it was definitely not worth the money.,2,2022,05,24
35,Needs a bit of TLC..,"We booked a weekend at the hotel as my partner was staying there earlier in the week for a work conference so I flew our to meet him on the Friday.

The lobby is lovely. Fresh, cool and light. Reception staff were kind and welcoming. 

The room however was a little disappointing..it was clean and bed linen fresh however the room was run down. There was lots of scratches on the wall from what I would assume is cases coming in and out...the walldrobe door had dropped meaning it scraped and marked the floor. There was a lot of mould/limescale around the bath as well which can be easily fixed. Furniture also old and needs reupholstered or replaced.

We also found the shower very inconsistent often going hot and cold.

The view over Barcelona and tbe port however was amazing!! Like a picture. 

We also found it odd how no milk was provided..so we had to nip to a nearby supermarket for some so we could have tea and coffee with milk.

Our biggest disappointment was we had booked the hotel restaurant on our first night...we went down and saw the sign to the restsrunt to the right which was where breakfast was set out and the other side was the bar. We were a little confused where the restaurant was..there was staff there but noone looked up to great us or ask if er needed help as we definitely looked confused..we ended up walking round to a pizza resteraunt (Gino's - which i have also reviewed).

Breakfast each morning was pleasant.. lots of choice and variety. Although the coffee machine was not good...cappuccino was just milk with tiny tiny bit of coffee. I tried coffee milk the next day on the machine which was a little stronger. If you want a strong coffee I'd recommend getting it out during the morning.

Overall it was a good stay but we wouldn't stay again..we would choose somewhere a little closer to the action.",3,2022,05,21
35,Beautiful but not a quiet place,"Beautiful hotel. But …. Very very noisy room. Birds way early, construction and ships coming in.  Room 445 front of building.  Hopefully other side was quieter    There was a high conference there and was loud all over.     Not a quiet place   Would  not go back.",3,2022,05,13
35,Terrible attitude to the guests!!!,"We are currently at this hotel. We arrived five hours ago and we still haven't been checked in!!! To all our questions the staff answer that the system does not work and they do not know when it will work. The staff is reluctant to talk to us and to do anything in such a situation. Moreover they are rude. We had a long flight, we are very tired. But the staff doesn't care about the guests. We have never met such an indifferent attitude at any other hotels!!! Terrible attitude to the guests! They don't even offer compensation for such an inconvenience! It’s not known for how long more we will have to sit in the hall waiting for a room.",1,2022,05,12
35,Pity - could be so much more,"Nice hotel - felt a bit clinical
Staff were amazing and check in was painless 
Breakfast was very good but ran out of melon at the 1030 mark as breakfast finishes at 11. 
Room had lovely bed, clean linen but…..and here’s the reasons I wouldn’t stay again 
• pool was tiny and no communication in room or otherwise of opening hours, towel rental etc 
• restaurant and bar was just empty. A piano man playing to nobody - again no communication where I could eat, what was on menu, hours of opening. I saw the name of restaurant in the lift and that’s how we found it. 
• no idea of what room service was available 
• housekeeping keep knocking in morning despite a ‘do not disturb’ on the door 
• tried to get a late check out as my flight was leaving at 11pm and was told it wasn’t available. However when I booked a room and paid for it @ €160 the room became available

It’s a pity as the hotel has so much potential to be a real 5 star hotel Where guests will fill the bar and restaurant and don’t want to leave",3,2022,05,05
35,Lovely setting and great bar/restaurant - suite needed some maintenance,"We loved this hotel overall, it's in a great location and has a really nice feel to it. We spent our evenings in the bar and loved the ambiance.  The food was good, the breakfast was exceptional, the staff were attentive and we especially enjoyed the piano playing and the operatic performance in the bar on an evening.  Also, the Irish coffees were the best!

We had a suite and felt that the repair and maintenance could have been better.  Our TV in our sitting area wouldn't work, one of the ceiling lights was continually flickering, one of our fridges didn't work and some of the fittings/furniture had been damaged.  Not what you want when your paying top-dollar and even after pointing some issues out to the maintenance person, nothing was done about them.

The pool on the rooftop was being refurbished, so we didn't get to enjoy that, which was a shame, but there was a substantial gym on the top floor, which I probably should have used instead!

Despite the minor maintenance issues we had a lovely few days here at this hotel which was a great base to explore the city and we would stay here again.",4,2022,04,25
35,"Barcelona , we will be back :)","It was a nice hotel with good breakfast . The location is good, short walk to La Rambla and many other interesting locations. We had a room facing the city and could see La sagrada familia from our balcony. Pablo, the frontoffice receptionist was extremely helpful kind and friendly with us throughout our stay there. A big thank you to him for doing his job so well!!",4,2022,04,07
35,"Nice location, lots of technical problems...","Freezing cold in the rooms, heating not working, my mother had to sleep in her sweater 3 nights, as she was freezing. I reported it twice to the reception, they promised to fix it, never happened. Awful! Water temperature in the shower jumping from freezing cold to boiling hot, not possible to set it on warm at all. Reported it to the reception, nothing changed. Awful smell of sewage permanently in the corridors. Good breakfast, very nice piano bar and The Corner restaurant. Overall an average 4* standard.",3,2022,04,05
35,"Bad experience, avoid","This is one of the worst 5 stars I have stayed in. 

Checked in last night, the room still had plasters left from the construction/maintenance work, changed to another room with air con not working.

Breakfast buffet has no table service, instant coffee, no hot food can be ordered. And we were chased to pay for the breakfast before we even sit down, saw the same happening to other tables - hotel must be worried about people do t pay..?!",2,2022,03,31
35,Second stay at the Grand Marina.,"This was our second time staying at the Grand Marina and it did not disappoint. Great room,  great food and very pleasant staff. The location is great because of its proximity to Las Ramblas and its countless bars and restaurants. We will be returning later in the year.",5,2022,03,30
35,"Excellent stay, wonderful staff, great hotel","We have always had excellent stays in Eurostars Hotels in Spain, so our expectations were high for this visit. We were not disappointed! This hotel was great. Staff were wonderful, helpful and ever so friendly, really going at length to make sure our staff was superb. I had some specials requests and they were all dealt with with amazing friendliness.  I must especially mention the fact that we had a stay booked in February, but we could not make it because of a very late flight cancellation Friday evening. Although the free cancellation period of 24 hours had passed, the hotel did not charge anything after I explained the situation via email.

I booked the the City Suite, which was very spacious and has a very nice view on a lot of the interesting sights of Barcelona. The Transbordador Aeri del Port passing overhead. The breakfast was very good with plenty of choices and some very good pastries on offer.
les Drassanes

The hotel is conveniently located just down the road from the Barri Gotic (Les Drassanes), next to the the marina and just of La Barceloneta. ll within a 30 minute walking time or with perfect public transport options. My only points of feedback are our room had the power sockets on very strange, hard to reach places either under tables, our desk or too low by the floor to reach and charge your device. Also, a smart tv would've been nice.",5,2022,03,27
35,March Meeting,"4 day stay for a conference. Nice, modern hotel in the harbour area. Decent rooms although my room overlooked the ferry terminal with throbbing diesels into the evening.
My one criticism would be the bathroom as the space to enter the batch was limited and required care to avoid a trip",4,2022,03,15
35,Disastrous!,"Most of the rooms overlook an office courtyard. Lack of attention, there is no hair dryer or bathrobe. The plugs are on the floor and far from tables, the minibar only contains a sad chocolate bar, a single blanket, there is no information about room service or how to call reception from the room, a scarce buffet and very bad fruit. a very bad experience",1,2022,03,15
35,Absolutely fabulous! Superb Customer Service and Buffet breakfast!,"The customer service is impeccable, the staff is professional,  warm and helpful. The breakfast buffet is excellent and like an epicurean delight! The facility is spotless and smells wonderful. The breakfast is hot, delicious and tables are laden with the most delicious fruits, breakfast items and desserts. Anna, the host of the buffet is professional and greets you with a huge smile and seems to know many of the guests. We came a bit before the buffet closed and they were out of oatmeal and she made sure we have a beautiful bowl of oatmeal with strawberries served to us. Anna is a very attentive host and the entire staff get along well and are very attentive. Luciano, Bibliana were also superb at keeping our table clean, providing coffee, water and anything we needed - Excellent! Jenny and Victor at the front desk went out of their way to help us with tour business needs and tickets for hop off and hop on transportation. Marco went out of his way to take our luggage, find convertors, and attend to all of our needs. ""Big Pablo"" and Nicholas were also exceptionally helpful and professional.  We had a slight problem with our sliding door and the repairmen , Jorge and Henry were very professional., The front office female Manager was Excellent and responsive, too. The suite we had is beautiful and spacious and the wood that is on the walls and in our room is gorgeous. We have a patio with a great view and our amenities are wonderful and the bed is wonderful and allowed us a restful sleep after traveling 36 hours. We are so happy we chose Eurostars Grand Mariner because we  don't need a car and can walk 5 minutes to the City Square! Lovely, Lovely, Lovely!",5,2022,03,05
35,Only thing about this 5 star hotel is the price,"I have to say we were very disappointed in the hotel considering it cost over €250 per night. The front desk and staff in other areas were very nice helpful and friendly. There were no bathrobes in the room, which large and the bedroom part was nice, the mini bar had no alcohol drinks in it, there was no hotel information in the room we had to ring down to find out the room service menu was a QR code in the fridge. The bathroom needs work there is mould around the top of the bath and the sink I will send photos. The toilet paper holder was broken and for that price we didn’t even get a view only the court yard. I did say I’d pay for up grade but was told there were no rooms left.
I paid for secure parking but managed to get a parking spot in front but was still charged even though I didn’t use the underground parking.
The breakfast was good with a large selection. The gym area was closed this morning.
So in all a disappointment for the price should have been €100 a night less. We’re in a hotel in Zaragoza now at € 95 a night it’s a lot better nice city hotel.
Sorry if it’s not wanted to hear but there the facts",3,2022,02,28
35,Ok but aging,"Went there unexpectedly, the taxi told us it’s a big hotel and should probably have room. So we didn’t plan the trip here.

Pro
- good breakfast, very big variety hot and cold 
-big hotel, big room size 
-clean
-good location, you can walk anywhere basically… food street, market, bay

Con
-the hotel is aging but not too shabby. I mean all the functions still there. You can feel by the design and stuffs that’s it’s been there quite sometimes.
-the ferry pier thing is right in front of the hotel so if you’re a light sleeper you may be annoyed by the slight sound of the ferry in and out.
-There’s a pool but lots of bird poo on the rooftop bar thingy and kind of empty actually but you can see the whole view of the bay which is quite a pity they don’t do anything much with it.",3,2022,02,15
35,Not a 5* hotel!,"The junior suit with balcony we were allocated was dirty and most of the furniture was. Chipped.
Balcony looked into the works trade centre offices.
No instructions on how to work anything.
Only good thing about the room was it’s size.

When we approached reception about the room, one member of staff was very rude and said he would give us our money back.
Staff eventually agreed to give us another room the next day.

This room was much better and staff has made an effort by leaving cava and strawberries for us.  However this might have been due to my niece (who speaks Spanish and has been a resident of Barcelona for 20 years) talking to them.

The earlier check-in and room upgrade does not exist.  I had emailed before hand and was advised in the day of arrival that this was not possible.

Breakfast - is lovely with much choice however the warm food was cool.
However cava was available.

The rooftop pool had bird poo all around it!!

Outdoor seating area next to the restaurant was nice!

Definitely not a 5 star hotel!",1,2022,01,09
35,"Not in a good shape, Renovation required.","The hotel is not in a good shape, Renovation required. So was the door to the bathroom out of order. Not nice at all. 
Breakfast is very nice.
Room is noisy in case a cruse liner is at the dock - quite often.",2,2021,11,01
35,"Great deception, need refurbishing and new look.","This hotel has nice location just next to World Trade Center, near cruise ships port and near the most touristic zone of Barcelona- las Ramblas. And the staff at the reception is very professional and attentive. This is positive side of the story. 
The negative side is that this hotel is very far away from being “five star grand lujo” as they claim to be. The floor in the corridor was dirty, nobody clean it in the whole day. The plastic glove lost by somebody from cleaning was laying in the middle of corridor for over 5 hours. The bathroom needs serious refurbishment, starting from bath itself with suspicious black spots on the edge. The decoration wood on the lateral part looks very old and unfashioned. There is no soap holder. The “big variety” of tea and coffee is just 4 capsules of coffee and 3 green tea teabags. I asked for simple black tea and they told me they don’t have it. Finally, 10 hours later, late night, they delivered 4 teabags of black tea. So, we felt ourselves cheated - for the price of 5 star grand lujo (luxury) we just received quality of 3 star hotel and confusing smiles of people from reception. Really the price do not deserve this quality.",3,2021,10,31
35,Worst 5 stars hotel - never again,"We choose this hotel based on the location and official stars.
Unfortunately the experience was the worst we ever had in a 5 stars hotel.
Minibar empty. 
Five times ask them to refill it. They finally bring something after one and a half day and three unpleasant discussions with someone at the reception. No supervisor or manager available to talk to. Finally they bring just four juices and not even one bottle of water.
Room was kind of clean, but dirty coffee cups, no toilet paper, no refill of coffee capsules.
All three beds are really uncomfortable for all four of us.
So, never again at this hotel.",1,2021,10,29
35,Used *to be a 5* hotel - no longer!,"We have been using this hotel in Barcelona for at least 15-years.  It has always been outstanding.  But something has happened to it.  When we checked in (22:30 hrs) we were told that the restaurants were closed, but there was room service.  We got to the room and tried room service.  No one answered the phone.  No one answered the phone at reception either.  We went back down to reception to get a menu for room service and to place the order.  (The hotel is using QR codes now, so you have to know to have a smart-phone with QR decoding in order to see anything of the hotel - menus, other info, etc).  Prior to our stay someone had broken the hand-held shower holder.  I requested that it be repaired, which happened the very next day (good job!).  Whenever we went to reception for anything (change money, request tissues, ask for the room to be cleaned early, etc) we had to wait and wait, as there were always insufficient numbers of receptionists for the number of guest inquiries (check-ins and outs, etc).  There was no information given about Spanish National Day when all of the stores were closed.  We found out when we saw all of the storefronts boarded up.  When we went to have an afternoon snack we were told that the only restaurant was on the roof.  We got to the restaurant/bar which was closed with no information except that it was closed.  Any information available in the lobby was only printed in Catalan (not even Spanish) which is improper for an international 5* hotel.  Lack of information, lack of staff, and general malaise made this our last stay at this hotel, even though the rooms are large and nicely furnished, bellhop service was outstanding, and they have the best breakfasts in the area.",3,2021,10,19
35,"Not worth the money, not a 5* Hotel","We booked a Superior Triple Room back in 2020 but due to Covid it was postponed. 
We got a voucher from Eurostars worth the money we paid and we rebooked the Hotel for September 2021 for 400 Euro more than what we already paid. 

Since it was a 5* Hotel we expected a lot more than what we got. 

When we arrived with there were three receptionist, while one was talking to another guest the two other didn't give us any attention. 

We were told that check-in is at 3 o'clock (We asked for an early check-in in advance; other Hotels offer to call you when the room is ready at least.) and that we should return then. Nobody offered us to leave the lugagge at the Hotel, they only reacted when we asked them about it. They also didn't ask us if we wanted a map or any recommendations. We had breakfast included which was not mentioned either or anything else about the Hotel and its services.

The room itself was very spacious which was positive. 

But it was not clean and everything was worm off. The Bathtub is covered with a wooden panel but there was some kind of mud coming down. There was mould on the tiles. The cover from the shower head fell on my head while showering. There were rust stains on the floor. 

The cups offered with the coffee machine were dirty and they just cleaned it with water instead of bringing new clean cups. 

We asked for a wine bottle opener and wine glasses at the reception but the lady told us to call the room service. The room service didn't speak English and it took a long time until they understood us. 

The Breakfast Buffet was really good, they offered a lot of different stuff and the Staff was friendly.

The Hotel is located near the port and you can easily walk to rambles but there's also a Bus Stop right infront of the Hotel. 

We took a drink at the rooftop bar but the drinks were horrible. They didn't have half of the cocktails on the menu and we the drinks weren't decorated in any way. No straw or fruits, no ice cubes. They didn't really taste good and one drink was not the one we ordered. 

All in all we wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, especially when they're looking for a five star Hotel. It was really disappointing.",2,2021,10,01
35,Nice hotel but rip off antigen covid test!,"Stayed in this hotel for business and the hotel itself is very nice. The location is great as its 10 minutes walk form las ramblas, 30 minutes walk from the beach and is very easy access from the airport. The roof terrace is great, and the food served there on the barbecue excellent.
The rooms are nice and comfortable (lovely beds) one negative point was that my room was missed by housekeeping on the first night (I heard from other people staying there I wasn't the only one) that was disappointing considering this is a 5*!! the pool is very tiny and looks better on the pictures than in real life (you cant properly swim in it)
What was very disappointing was that we asked advice about getting our antigen guests and the reception said we could get a test done in a laboratory for €50 or they can get one organised in our rooms for €60 each. We thought it was ok for the convenience. However, the next day we found out we could have got the exact same test from the chemist next door to the hotel for €15 but unfortunately it was too late as we had ours done.",3,2021,09,23
35,Nice hotel with an excellent chef Alberto,"Nice hotel with amazing chef Alberto who was absolutely fantastic with outstanding service to vegan guests like us. It was super surprising that that chef took such an excellent care of us. While on at her man from the service said: “That’s all we have what you see in the buffet”. Apparently not much for vegans. And when chef Alberto approached us and asked what we would like to eat, immediately, he went to the kitchen and made an excellent breakfast for my husband and me.
The room was nice, with minimum necessities for a 1 night stay. Another person who gave us an outstanding service was porter Jordi. We would like to thank him as well for his wonderful care at our arrival.",4,2021,09,05
35,"Tired and unattractive, but some positives","With the impression that we would be staying in an Executive Suite in a great location and in a 5-star hotel, we were a little disappointed with our general experience and I think that a lot of their services were below par with this in mind.

Pros

1.  The location is very good - we were in fact travelling from Barcelona’s Balearia port the next morning so the hotel could not have been better placed with this in mind. Even if you weren’t travelling on the ferry, the hotel was not far from the beach, restaurants, or any other sites in Barcelona, so we were very pleased with the convenience of this.

2. The breakfast was very good too - there was a great selection of food available, and the rate we paid for the breakfast was also very good. 

3. The service in the hotel was largely very efficient and warm. When checking in, when at breakfast and whenever we had an issue/question, they were always happy to help and did so with ease. 

Additionally, we felt the price for the room was good.

Cons

Although there are definitely some other teething issues with the hotel, I want to address my biggest disappointment with the hotel. As is with some other Eurostars hotels, the rooms and overall design is very dull and business-esque.  This was very apparent in the room and even the exterior of the hotel, where it was quite ugly, and also matching this the rooms were very worn and torn. This made the hotel seem tired and unattractive, which for a 5-star hotel, made it quite disappointing.Additionally, in such a promising location, the hotel really congested the light and modern feel of Barcelona.",3,2021,07,14
35,Great location,Great location with only a small 5 to 10 minute walk to the Rambla. Average rooms but clean and tidy. Pool was ok but on the small side. Breakfast was fantastic with a good quality selection of food. The only negative is that it was over priced but you are in Barcelona in a prime location to the city and the airport.,4,2021,06,27
35,Best location and conditions in Barcelona,"A 5 star hotel without question! The location is impeccable, the accommodation and dining conditions are excellent, the staff is impeccable. Rich and diverse breakfast. A special mention for Judith and Bibiana *****.
Rooms with a balcony facing the city are unique.
The top floor terrace offers a dream image of Barcelona.
We will gladly return to this hotel at any time.",5,2021,05,21
35,Wonderful hotel and top class,"I got very nice experience with Eurostar Grand Marina. It is my fifth time to choose Eurostar hotel Brand.The hotel location is super, near all monuments landmark in Barcelona. The ferry terminal to Balearia islands is just next door. The metro station is few minutes by foot. The hotel restaurant make delicious food and the breakfast there are lots of choice. The staffs are very friendly on the reception and restaurant. The room is quite big and with wonderful view over Barcelona Marina. This hotel is best choose for my this trip  and will be sure stay the same hotel when I come back Barcelona.",5,2021,04,22
35,Great gym and great coffee!,"I was referred to this hotel, after having booked at sister hotel Eurostars BCN Design which is closed for maintenance. I have been positively surprised and rate their gym (must be booked in advance/CV19) as very good with Technogym machines and space! The breakfast is sit down and get served type in these CV19 times, but the coffee is really good and stands out. The service in the hotel has also been very good by all staff. The location and views from this hotel, including the top floor is also remarkable!",4,2020,10,22
35,"Work trip. Great location. Pretty standard, nothing special. Great rooftop bar.","We visited in August 2019 as a work group for a social. The hotel is clean, in a great location and has a nice rooftop bar. It really isn't anything that special but if you can get a good price like we did it is worth the stay. 10 minute walk from great restaurants and bars.",4,2020,10,13
35,Scammed and feel ripped of,After  being closed for months and then only partly opened refused to refund in whole or part the deposit. Feel conned and says a lot about the hotel and the way it looks after and thinks about its clients. Terrible PR. Seems others have have financial problems with them,1,2020,09,26
35,Mary on check in,Hi I stayed at the hotel with friends we had two rooms one was the extra large room and was well one was a normal room beautiful balcony with amazing views when we checked in because we had two rooms booked Mary upgraded us to a higher rate room free of charge and also was very nice person and enjoyed the stay at the hotel would definitely recommend it very clean design of the hotel is like a ocean steamer beautiful recommended,5,2020,09,17
35,Check credit card transactions ,"Stayed at this hotel for two nights and loved it here, only problem was they charged my credit card €44 for absolutely nothing and I have been chasing them for a refund for 6 months now. Not happy at all with this as even after calling Barcelona from England I have been ignored several times. Even booking.com have been awful at resolving this issue. 
Lovely hotel and staff, just check you haven’t been scammed by them for unlawful deductions from credit card.

Won’t stay again due to this. Feel scammed. ",1,2020,08,10
35,Witheld my payment for 5 months after closure,"Booked this hotel in Feb for a three night stay ion May. Hotel was closed by Government but  the hotel initially refused a refund, stating that their office was closed (despite accepting online bookings for August onwards!) After many Emails and phone calls,which got no result, I opened a refund claim via Mastercard, the refund then appearted on my bank statement in days!  It was clear that the Hotel was  quite able to ignore me.. but not Mastercard!  The test of a good hotel?business is how  well they treat their customers when things go wrong. Eurostars Grand Marina fail this test completely.",2,2020,07,27
35,Awful Customer Service - Do Not Book,"I cannot comment on the hotel itself as we never made it to Barcelona, however I can tell you the customer service is absolutely horrendous with this hotel. I booked a family holiday to Barcelona last year (August 2019), however 72 hours before we were due to fly to Spain, our flight was cancelled due to industrial strikes action at Barcelona airport. 

Their were no alternative flights to get to Spain and the hotel point blank refused to refund our hotel payment which we had paid in full for six people. Even though I explained to them that our flight is cancelled due to strikes they refused the refund and said they are under no obligation to refund it. They could have easily refunded it if they wanted to but chose not too.",1,2020,06,23
35,Feel scammed,Watch out for this hotel - happy to converse while they’re trying to sell you a room upgrade but reading and ignoring messages as soon as I ask whats happening to my booking with the Spanish lockdown. Looks like I’m being refused a refund.,1,2020,03,22
35,Over Promises; Under Delivers - Be warned!,"The Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel, Barcelona oversells itself. I have stayed in many great hotels but this is not one of them.

I visited in February in half term with my two older boys (11 and 9). We spent five nights at the hotel. Barcelona itself was amazing and we had a wonderful time. However, there were many problems with the hotel.

On the first night, our room smelled of cigarettes, having not smelled like this when we checked in earlier. It must have come through the air conditioning. There were also bubbles in the bath as if someone had taken a bath. He bed sheets were all clean and in a good state but the room was dusty.

The next day when we got back from Camp Nou, the room had been cleaned and one of my son’s soft toys, which he’s had since birth and which went into surgery with him when he was 2 days old, was missing. We turned the room upside down looking for it but couldn’t”t find it anywhere. The soft toy has huge sentimental value to my son and to us all in the family. He was heart broken. The room also stank of cigarettes again.

I reported this to the front desk who were very friendly and changed our room because of the cigarette issue. They apologised on behalf of the cleaning team and promised to do everything they could to find the soft toy. 

At no point we we given an update of any progress. We had to chase the staff to find out if anything had been found. Each time we went to the desk we spoke to a different person as the staff rotate so often. They all promised to do everything in their power to find the toy. Then a lady called Christina (a manager) said she would take it on personally and was very friendly but still nothing materialised. 

The rooms was often not cleaned properly and there would be empty bottles and bits of paper lying on the floor which we had left on the bedside tables. He cigarette smell continued throughout our stay.

The walls are also incredibly thin so you can here every door opening and closing and you can here the TVs in the neighbouring rooms, or the voices of upset children, when you are trying to sleep. Also, the ferries in the terminal outside the hotel are unbelievably loud. Their engines are constantly running and they make this pumping pulsating sound which fills the room.

All around the hotel there are terrible odours like drains. In the reception area, by the lifts, down the corridors, up by the gym, in the seating area next to the overpriced bar. It is awful.

The breakfast buffet is terrible. It looks OK but the staff forget to bring you drinks when they have taken your order; the pancake machine runs out of mixture and is not replaced unless you request it; there are no bowls by the create your own yoghurt\granola\fruit station so you have to walk 50 metres through loads of people to the opposite end of the buffet to get a bowl and then back though all the people again. The coffee, if you can actually get one, is luke warm and bitter. The layout of the buffet makes no sense and you constantly have to move around to get what you need because there is no logic to the layout.

And then there’s the “swimming pool” on the roof terrace. We knew it was going to be closed given the time of year, but it’s minuscule! How they can call it a swimming pool is beyond me. The private pool in my Dad’s French villa, about two hours away, is bigger! My kids laughed out loud when they saw it and joked about it being hot tub!

This is not a 5 star hotel. It looks like one on the website but it is not. The noise, the smells, the chaotic layout of the buffet, the poor cleanliness, the loss of deeply sentimental personal items which they took responsibility for but fobbed off with cancelling my €50 charges (I paid for everything up front), the strange little pool, the list goes on.

Given our experience, I cannot recommend this hotel.",2,2020,03,10
35,"Amazing room and view, but service was very basic.","This was the hotel that made we want to come to Barcelona for my 30th, I fell in love with a Marina Suite, which my husband paid for my birthday present. Unfortunately there was no availability for my actual birthday, so we arrived the day after.
The room did not disappoint, it was huge, separate sitting room area with table and chairs, a sofa and TV. 
Main bed was HUGE and so comfy! with another TV. There was also a coffee machine, vanity table, well stocked mini bar (felt this should have been included for a suite we paid £300 for one night) We also received complimentary water as we booked direct. 
The balcony was lovely with a lovely view over the port and city, we watched the ferries coming and going at night time, but they were quite noisy, one even played music as it was leaving at 10pm. It's a shame a small table and chairs wasn't on the balcony though.
Bathroom had a lovely shower and big bath. Usual toiletries provided and a hair dryer.
Lovely touch was the cava and cake which was waiting for us in the room when we got back after dinner, Thank you very much for this, we really appreciated it.
Breakfast was amazing and i will never forget the amazing sugar coated croissants filled with custard, I'm going to crave those the rest of my life!! Huge selection of everything you could want!
We went to the roof top which had an amazing view, but disappointed that the pool wasn't open, for a 5 star hotel maybe it should be a heated pool so it can be open all year round, we definitely would have used it.
But the biggest disappointment was the service. It was very mediocre for a 5 star hotel. We were not made to feel like we were valued, and when you have paid a high price for a suite, you do expect to be treated well. There was no welcome drink offered, which again, for 5 star it should have been. It felt very much like they just wanted to get you checked in then onto the next person. We weren't told where the lifts were to get to the room, times of meals, or breakfast the next day etc. 
We were also told at check in our daughter's bed would be brought up about 7pm. We waited till just after 8 and still no sign so we phoned, the lady said they only bring them up when you call for it, which is not what we'd been told at check in. We then waited another 35 mins before it arrived.
All in all, the room was gorgeous and deserves a 5 star review, but with the poor service probably, it wasn't worth the £300 a night price and has brought my rating down.",3,2020,03,09
35,Excellent value for money,"Had read some bad reviews of this hotel before we went so I didn't know what to expect. The lobby of the hotel is not charming at all and has a very cold vibe but the rest of the hotel is so much better. All the staff were amazing and very service minded. The check in went smooth and we got a lovely and spacious room overlooking the city of Barcelona and the Harbour. In the room there were slippers, coffee and tea facilities and water bottles. The bathroom was gigantic with a really big bathtub and small bottles of shampoo etc (not amazing quality of the products). The bed was very comfy as well as the duvet. The hotel isn't new and it would need some touch ups but taking into consideration what you pay for the rooms the quality is amazing!
The breakfast was great with a big variety of hot and cold dishes. The coffee was served at the table and we could order eggs, pancakes etc.
All in all a very pleasant stay and the hotel is located very centrally. You could hear absolutely nothing from the neighbors or from the traffic outside.
I wouldn't hesitate to go back!",5,2020,03,09
35,Outstanding,"Just perfect, service, comfort, staff, room, everything.
I would dearly love to go back!
Arrived quite late & it was chilly, so decided to stay in.
Complementary bottle of wine in our room. Bar snacks not over priced.
Excellent tea & coffee facilities.
Complementary water.
Superbly comfortable, huge bed.
Couldn't fault any aspect.",5,2020,02,27
35,"short stay during business trip, will come back for longer stay","to list up some bullet points: very friendly, quick, modern, clean and in good condition, nice and opulent international breakfast, nice hotel bar, nice view, nice location if the hotel for trips to oldtown, la rambla e.g., nice gadgets in the rooms and across the hotel.
Even if I think about it really strong: There´s almost nothing to complain about or that has to mentioned for this rating. Top! Will be glad to come back and stay (private) a few days longer! Thanks to the Eurostars team Barcelona!",5,2020,02,20
35,Space next to the city,"We stayed for the weekend, mixing business with pleasure. The hotel is right in the port but part of the interest were the ferries that came  and went. It made an interesting change from our usual city centre hotels.
 Close to the bottom of Las Ramblas, with spectacular views of the city, the rooms are spacious with very nice bathrooms(we had a spa bath and jet shower) 

Although we didn't have a balcony we had armchairs to sit in to drink our cava and watch the night lights of the city come on.  Easy access to taxis took us out to dinner in the city centre. That said, the bar food  
was very good with quick and pleasant service.

The overall feeling was one of space and water. If you don't mind not being on the centre of the city, you might want to try it.",4,2020,02,14
35,Large Room and Great View,Great view of cruise ships and the marina.  The area is a little touristy but that means there is plenty to do.  The room was very large especially for Barcelona. Large and modern bathroom.   Nice little coffee shop next door for breakfast.,5,2020,02,11
35,Worst room I ever had,"The maintenance on this room ist poor.
I had a broken shower.

I talked to the service 3 Days in a row.
Each day, the service promised, that will be fixed. But nothing is happening.

I cannot recommend it.

Also the rooms are not noise prove. I hear every night my room neighbor Skyping from 1 to 2 AM...",1,2020,01,28
35,Lovely hotel in a great location,"Beautiful hotel, in a great location. The view from the sea view room was amazing, we stayed in room 515 on the 5th floor. You had an excellent view from of Barcelona City from this side of the hotel. Breakfast had a big variety and was always kept well stocked. The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5, is because we visited the cocktail bar on one of the nights, the cocktails were simply awful. The cocktails were fairly expensive at €14. I don't mind paying this if they are good, but the 2 we ordered were terrible. The following night we got 2 cocktails in an Irish bar for €15 for both, they were much better. When we visited the cocktail bar, there was only 2 other people there. I wondered why it was so empty, but upon tasting the drinks, I quickly understood why. It is an awful pity about the bar, because as a 5 star hotel, it has so much else going for it. I would visit this hotel again, but probably would go outside for drinks again on my next visit.",4,2020,01,16
35,Amazing,"We stayed at this lovely hotel for one night to watch the football for my husbands 30th Birthday, on arrival we were greeted by young man on the desk who checked us in, he then told us as it was my husbands birthday they upgraded us to the presidential suite. The room was absolutely incredible with amazing views over Barcelona. This really made my husbands birthday special. So thank you very much Grand Marina! We will be back ☺️",5,2020,01,04
35,New Years break,"Stayed at this hotel from 30/12-03/01 and found it to be a very good experience. The hotel is close to the marina, ramblas and walking distance to Port Olympic and the beach. We didn’t make much use of the facilities as the city was so close but the bar area seemed fine, albeit a little quiet when we had a late night drink. The staff were pleasant enough and dealt with any queries we had. There was also a taxi rank right outside, a stop for the open top bus tours and a metro station less than 10 minutes walk away. We were also fortunate that the Port Vell Christmas market was still open and this was also close by.

My main issue is that the family rooms seem to be joined by a connecting door to the next room! Whilst it was locked, you could hear everything going on in the next room! 

I would certainly recommend this hotel though. ",4,2020,01,03
35,Perfect pre-cruise stopover,"Stayed one night before embarking a cruise ship. Room was clean, spacious and had a little balcony but the balcony was very small and had no chairs. No big deal as we only briefly used it. Friendly bar and reception staff, who kept our luggage for us in the morning before we embarked the ship. Breakfast was good, with a variety of food available. Overall a good stay and definitely recommend for a pre/post cruise stopover",5,2020,01,02
35,Harbour Side Stay,"Nicely located hotel for seaside walks and easy accessible from the center. Worry free check in- and out, friendly and helpful staff. Clean spacious room with comfortable bed. Large outdoor lobby area.",4,2020,01,01
35,Business Hotel,The only reason we stayed here was because I was attending a conference at their conference center (world trace center). While perfectly acceptable- in that it was clean and comfortable- I would not stay here again given that it is at the foot of Las Ramblas- and pretty far from anything other than the port and Las Ramblas which is very touristy and not particularly safe. ,3,2019,12,31
35,Right by the cruise ships departures.,A good well situated hotel who do go the extra mile. Booking vital as it gets very full and lots of different prices. I tried Booking.Com and they had no availability but I tried the hotel direct and they did online with a discount. Stayed there several times and not been disappointed with the hotel or rooms. Food not so great but pleant of very good nearby restaurants.,5,2019,12,10
35,It's not about Money it's about the humanity touch of the hotel's top management,"I had a booking in this hotel and due to my illness i had to cancel my trip 
though my booking was non refundable i have sent an email explaining the reason why im canceling and attached my medical report as well and honestly i didn't expect to have a positive feedback for a refund as most of hotels do! but despite that the hotel suggested to amend the dates until i feel better to travel or they will refund me the full amount
Because i couldn't decide the alternative dates i asked for refund and they happily agreed to proceed with it in next day, after that with two weeks i re-booked in this hotel and i had one of the best experiences ever 
Thank you Eurostars for this amazing treatment and for being so cooperative in my case
Finally ""I believe this hotel deserve to have a ranking 50 not 325!""",4,2019,12,10
35,Needs to be inspected for security,Whilst this is rated as five star the hotel has little care for its customers and stick to black and white policies to avoid being caring for customers. I would avoid booking at all costs and I am sharing the experience with my contacts at Dirección General de Turismo as there should be some escalation here of the hotels five star rating,1,2019,12,05
35,Not a 5 star experience,"The hotel was okay-ish, but at best a modest 4-star. Electricity point in the room hanging loose, warm breakfast dishes were cold, in the gym no water, towels and supervision, wrong receipt that we had to follow up with admin ourself.",2,2019,12,04
35,Stay away from this hotel! ,"Unfortunately,we were caught in the middle of the demonstration which was a mile or less from the hotel. It was our second day and we were having our annual trip which means we did everything we could to ensure having a pleasant and peaceful time.
The hotel's service was greatly affected by the demonstration i.e there was neither laundry service nor massage service, nor others. Therefore, we decided to call our embassy to get their feedback about the city's matter & they communicated clearly that we better leave the city immediately. Accordingly,we informed the reception that we would be checking out early tomorrow due to the circumstances & we were told to  to discuss the matter in the morning since the reservation team were off or something like that. Next morning,we checked out our 3 suites and asked for a full refund for the remaining period since it was not safe to stay in addition to the fact that even hotel's services were affected, but the receptionist wasn't positive at all, but promised to convey our demandsa to the concerned personnel.
On the other hand,my friend sent an official email to the hotel and there wasa no response AT ALL while I have personally received an email from a person named Cristina informing me that they cannot refund the booking due to the booking policy and when I replied to her she simply acted with full ignorance. 
What kind of well-repued 5star hotel deals with his guests like that?
I would personally advise you to stay away from this hotel",1,2019,12,01
35,Lovely hotel shame about breakfast,"Stayed here for two nights very good location an easy walk to the bottom of the ram las ,room was very comfortable and decor was luxurious.the only thing that spoiled it was cold food at breakfast,the selection of continental breakfast item s were very good ,I selected bacon egg and mushrooms when I tried them they were very cool 
The waiter asked if things were okay,I explained that the food was cold.he said he would speak to the kitchen,he came back a while later to say that the food was now hot ,by then I had eaten something else .although the waiter had dealt with the issue I was surprised that a simple thing such as cold food should happen in this standard of hotel ",4,2019,11,28
35,Pictures are fake,"First of all, the pictures on the website are fake. Not real at all. The seaside picture is absolutely nothing. At the reception there was a lady talked rubbish not very helpful person. She thinks I am staying in own her hotel. She forgets I paid £159 per night. The Front of the hotel a massive light house tower, it is never in the picture. Nothing likes on the website. Not worth for £159 per night. Restaurant food wasn't nice at all, you have to go out for the dinner. £45 for the pizza and chips. You can't relax in the hotel. Only we enjoyed the breakfast! Not a five star hotel maybe three star.",2,2019,11,24
35,Outstanding getaway,"We have just had the most wonderful stay at Eurostars Grand Marina. My partner and I spent the last four days at this amazing hotel, and our experience has been excellent. We arrived to the hotel late in the evening, there was a lovely lady at the desk who checked us in and explained us all the facilities in the hotel. She offered us a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe room on the top floor of the hotel and I must say...the views of Barcelona were just fantastic! The room was spotless, and room service brought us a lovely bottle of cava with a card from the hotel wishing us a happy anniversary. 
We could not have chosen a better spot to celebrate this special occasion. 
We have been exploring Barcelona and eating the most amazing Mediterranean food. The restaurants that were recommended to us by the staff at the desk were really good, and so it was our dinner at the hotel last evening. A lady called Bibi at the hotel restaurant served our table. The service and the food were first-class.
Sadly, We had to fly back home today. 
A very pleasant young man, I think his name is Angel?, checked us out, and organised our early take away breakfast. A really nice touch to end our trip. 
It’s been amazing! We will be coming back for sure.",5,2019,11,21
35,"Deposit never refunded, still waiting!","When I checked into Grand Marina on 10/31/19 I was informed that a deposit was required.  I explained the entire bill was paid in advance so I should not have to put a deposit down.  I was told by the front desk it was their policy. Reluctantly, I gave my credit card for the deposit to be withheld.  The deposit would be refunded on checkout which was 11/2/19.  As of 11/21/19 I am still waiting for my refund! I submitted a follow-up email on 11/8/19 and never received a response. I called on 11/12/19 and spoke to Liz Hernandez, she indicated it was an over site. On 11/13/19 Liz sent an email indicating that the refund was process and it should take an additional 5-10 day!!! I've waited almost 3 weeks for my refund and now I have to wait an additional 10 days.  I feel that this is a scam and a fee charged to international travelers knowing that it will take many unanswered attempts to get their money back.   I will never use this hotel again or recommend it to anyone.",1,2019,11,21
35,BEST ROOM IN BARCELONA ,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel both before and after our Mediterranean cruise. The room that we were in for the night before the cruise was nice, I think that it was on the 5th floor and facing the courtyard. Room was quiet. For our one night stay after our cruise, we were early to arrive and check in, as our ship docked at 7:00AM. We were able to at least store our luggage, and when we finally DID check in, the clerk at the front desk advised us that we would have an upgraded room, because we were not able to check in when we arrived. Imagine our surprise when we discovered that we were upgraded into the hotel’s PRESIDENTIAL SUITE!! In a word....THE biggest and BEST we have ever stayed in!!!! Too bad that we only had one night to enjoy it!!!! Will go back if ever in Barcelona again!!!",5,2019,11,20
35,The unsafe hotel in the world,"My family and I went on holiday to Barcelona in the summer and decided to stay at the Eurostar Grand Marina hotel for a night. Right after we checked into the hotel in the afternoon, my family and I decided to go out for lunch and to see the beach. We had barely left the hotel when our hotel room got broken into by strangers and they stole all our belongings along with the hotel safe where we kept our money, jewelry and passports. 

These men literally walked into the hotel and broke The door with a ripping bar, removed the safe from the wall and carefully packed it into our luggage, pack our shopping bags and walked out of the hotel. The hotel security team and the hotel staff claimed not to be not aware of the burglary whilst it took place or afterwards until we got back and complained. It was after we complained that they took a look at their cameras and saw the whole robbery on tape.

After the robbery were stranded in Spain and the hotel offered no help or assistance at all to help my family and I get out of Spain let alone refund us what we have lost due to their negligence and security lapse. To my surprise the hotel are not trying to take any form of responsibility for anything.

35,nice modern hotel,"Located in the World Trade Center building, very modern hotel, about 5 minute walk to La Rambla pedestrian street, where you can find all restaurants and coffee shops. It is near the see, but no room view to the see,",3,2019,11,09
35,"5 Stars, but close your curtains","We stayed at the Grand Marina hotel and really enjoyed the convenience of the location ( 3 minute shuttle bus to cruise ship), first class accommodation with a fantastic breakfast that was included and short walk to downtown.
Be aware it is located right on the marina so you have cruise ships pulling in with passengers coming and going. I would still recommend this classy hotel.",5,2019,11,05
35,Canceled rooms ,"They canceled the rooms without notice and wanted 3700 euros for 5 nights. 

Stayed one night and booked another hotel. 

We are 6 persons and will never return to this hotel ever for bad customer service",1,2019,11,04
35,"Fantastic location, service and rooms ","We arrived late afternoon after  flying through three different airports and nine time zones. Though we were slightly catatonic, the front desk staff (Mary) was a pleasure to deal with. And Hector, the bellman, was waiting off to the side, ready to help at the drop of a hat. Both greatly appreciated. 

We had dinner at the hotel's small restaurant and it was quite good. The wine we chose was excellent and the appetizers were fanatic. The entree, was underwhelming unfortunately.

We headed back to our room to decompress from the previous 30+ sleepless hours. But we were in need of a converter ( how did I forget this) for our cell phones and laptops. Plus the TV was not working. And to top it off, we also need extra towels. Front desk was beyond accommodating. Within five minutes, all three small issues were rectified and all with smiles. 

We had the breakfast buffet the next morning. Worth every penny. Incredible. The sparkling wine was a nice addition.

I cannot recommend this hotel enough. ",5,2019,11,03
35,TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT,"I have booked in this hotel before thr strike hit Barcelona and they costed me lot of money, on arrival to Airport there was no taxis due to the protests in the streets, i called hotel to send me a car for 5 hours and their response was simply ( WE CAN NOT SEND YOU A CAR ), i had to take a domestic flight to Palma De Malorca just to spend the night there, And when i asked for a refund due to the strike in the city they simply refused, They are cheaters and non professionals at all, very bad responses and very negative attitude, i do not recommend this poor property to anyone",1,2019,10,24
35,Excellent location,"Beautiful hotel close to Las Ramblas, Port Vell and Barceloneta Beach.  The hotel is well maintained and beautiful. It is walker friendly with easy access to all the sights. The staff was friendly and helpful.  Other reviews me toned some noise being so close to the port, but we didnt hear anything outside the windows. Deducted a star because of carpet cleaning in the hallway outside of our room at 0900 that lasted 15-20 minutes and woke us up when we were trying to sleep in.",4,2019,10,17
35,Not 5 Star!,"Do not book this hotel for a special occasion. We arrived on our actual wedding anniversary to be informed they didn't have a reservation, despite the hotel trying to take full payment a week before arrival and their order confirmation stating payment at hotel. Communication at front desk was difficult. We booked a superior sea view, couldn't fault the view, however the room felt dark and shabby. The bathroom requires a complete refurb, it had an old non functioning Jacuzzi bath and shower screen with cracked old grouting, which looked filthy. Pictures on their website show beautiful light and airy rooms; guess we were given the most basic! I had ordered the Romantic Getaway, so the cava and strawberries should have been in the room on arrival, they arrived an hour later just as were going out. The roof terrace could be fantastic, but there were no staff available to serve drinks, so we went elsewhere.  Felt the hotel is geared up more for conferences and corporate clients. 

However, the location is very good away from the noise and bustle of La Rambla. We felt the breakfast and serving staff were excellent and very attentive. We also booked a Gourmet dinner, which was fantastic and served in a small dining room. Jaun the sommelier had excellent knowledge, and made the whole experience enjoyable and first class. Barcelona is a fantastic city, just don't book this hotel, it's overpriced and over starred!",2,2019,10,13
35,Great location terrible management !,"We booked a four night in a stay in a deluxe room on line. It was quite pricey.The hotel is centrally located on the Barcelona waterfront with excellent views. Our first problem began with them declining our credit card twice before we ever left home. Nothing was wrong with the card. I finally had to call them to straighten it out and was assured that everything was fine. Then, the day before we left the U.S.,they did it again! When we checked into our room and tried to call the desk, our phone didn’t work. When it was fixed later that evening we attempted to call room service for almost an hour but nobody answered.I finally went down to the desk to see what the problem was and discovered they only had two people manning the desk and the phones! This is a large upscale hotel and the employees were simply overwhelmed, and couldn’t answer the phones and work the desk as well. I felt sorry for them. At this point a lovely young woman came to our aid and actually gave us her personal phone number. She apologized profusely and told us candidly that what we experienced was a common occurrence. My wife and I are seasoned travelers and thought we’d seen it all, but this took mismanagement and incompetence to a new level! We paid a lot of money for an experience that was anything but what we expected...did I mention that the first night we were there our air conditioner/heat didn’t work!",2,2019,10,11
35,Lots of better options in Barcelona,"I rarely give one star ratings.  But I don’t recommend this hotel at all. It’s highly priced and low quality.  Specifically, the towels are old and thin, the pillows are thin and cheap and many of the floors don’t smell good. The workout room is outdated and small.  The front desk service is really slow as noted by other reviews.  The staff isn’t trained well.  The rooms are thin and you can hear every noise in the hall including  doors opening and slamming.  The tv options are limited to almost non existent. The breakfast is average.  The food in the bar is overpriced.  They still allow smoking on some of the floors which I think impacts the entire hotel. 
It is true that you can see the water from some rooms. And it’s easy to walk to many places.  It also could be convenient if you are taking a cruise.   The shower is also of high quality.  But based on all other factors, there are better hotels for the price point.  
",1,2019,10,09
35,"Very poor, no idea how to operate in the 5* market","This is not a 4* hotel. It has a corporate feel and no doubt would be suitable for those on expenses and not looking for service, but certainly not suitable for those who are looking for a luxury break or at least a five star experience.

I booked a city suite and having looked at all the living areas on the photographs of the hotel expected sofa, chairs etc. When we arrived the sofa bed was made up into a bed and had no seats. Nor was there seats on the balcony. I asked firstly for 2 extra pillows and 2 seats in the living room and explained that there was nowhere to sit. Guess what they didn’t arrive.

The following day I asked once again for 2 extra pillows and again explained that having booked a suite expected somewhere to sit. I was told that not all suites had chairs and not all were like the pictures on their website. I asked if they could move chairs out of other bedrooms as I noted that all the bedrooms had chairs. Eventually we were given 2 iron outside seats with no pads. I again had to go to reception to say this wasn’t suitable. Further, the pillows that they had delivered weren’t pillows but were bolster cushions. Given they had a pillow menu I couldn’t understand the difficulty in asking for 2 extra pillows as the 2 I had were flat.

Later when coming back to our room we found 2 Office chairs had been delivered and another 2 bolder sausage like pillows delivered. Really, this was meant to be a 5 star establishment and one can’t get 2 extra pillows and have a room that was as advertised, i.e. chairs or somewhere to sit in the living area! Which is why one books a suite in the first place!
I gave up after that.

The breakfast whilst nice it was hard work asking for tea or coffee. The tables were never cleared and one had to pile empty dishes to one side when getting something else from the buffet.

I was so disappointed in this hotel and can’t believe how amateurish they are. Perhaps had it been a 3 star I might not have felt so aggrieved, it was meant to be a special occasion which was totally ruined by the inefficiency. Never again, I would suggest another hotel.",2,2019,10,07
35,Not at all impressed,"Arrived here having paid substantially more for a Marina Suite. We arrived on a flight from the UK at 5pm and then I Queued for 35 minutes to check in.  Imagine my surprise when they say there’s no room ready for me !  Check in is from 3pm but apparently they have no suites ready. They want us to go to the bar for a drink but we’ve been on the go since 6am and just want our room. Eventually at 6.15pm we got a room key. Room 547.  I’m not convinced this is a Marina Suite. It’s pretty bare and nothing out of the ordinary. You cannot sit out on the tiny balcony and as I look at the hotel, it seems no different from standard rooms. Complete waste of money.  The guy at reception insisted it is what I paid for so there we have it.  I wouldn’t stay here again, not at these prices and long queues at check in etc. Not 5 star treatment.",2,2019,10,05
35,"Nice People, Great Location but process issues","The people that work at the hotel are very nice and very helpful but they are saddled with equipment that doesn't work and processes that don't work.

I had a hard time connecting to their wifi and it took forever to finally get connected. The website states and iron and ironing board in the room. There wasn't one and I asked that it be sent to the room. The first iron wasn't working. The second iron was so old it kept blowing the fuse in the room causing the room to lose power. After resetting the fuse several times, they finally brought me the third and working iron.

Even after I paid a deposit upon check in for incidentals, my first night I ordered room service and was told I had to pay then in the room for dinner - that I couldn't charge it to the room (even though my colleagues could). At breakfast, I got the same treatment - again..my colleagues charged it to their room. When I asked them to check with the front desk - they finally got it squared away, but clearly communication is lacking.

The view is great from the rooftop bar, the people are nice - but I was so annoyed the first night - I vowed to not stay here again. Lots of other options in Barcelona.",3,2019,10,04
35,Very average,"I booked our trip through Hotwire - where the hotel was labelled as a 5 star hotel with ocean view. Paid close to 250 USD per night. 

Room was quite small - had a small window facing the ocean with no balcony. Rooftop bar was closed the first night due to rain and the second night it was open but the bar had no servers and they had no cushions on their seating. They also did not include breakfast for us which is marketed as well (I believe it was $30pp)

Our experience was extremely mediocre and disappointing considering we thought we were going to a 5 star",2,2019,10,02
35,Great stay at the Grand,"Stayed here for three nights and had a great time.  Staff attentive, breakfasts really good and nice touches like a bottle of Cava in the room on arrival.

Good location, easy access and very clean.  Rooms spacious 

 Good Job!",5,2019,09,30
35,Conveniently located and comfortable,"We stayed at the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel for 2 nights in early September. It was only about a 20-minute ride from the airport, perfect after a long international flight. The location is beautiful, and we were able to easily walk to the tourist destinations on Las Ramblas. The room we stayed in (#341) had a large, comfortable bed in a room that overlooked the marina. A sliding glass door opened onto a small balcony, but I was disturbed o find that the door could not be locked or secured. Additionally, the main entry door to the hotel room itself (from the main hallway) seemed to have been damaged (maybe even kicked-in) in the past so it was very difficult to close and lock. We did not want for towels and hygiene items during our stay, and there was always plenty of hot water for showering. However, the set-up of the shower itself was problematic. There was no threshold that prevented the shower water from draining down the shower door and pooling on the floor outside the shower, just in front of the toilet. When stepping out of the shower, we were essentially stepping into a wading pool on the bathroom floor.  The best parts of the hotel, besides its' convenient location, are its' bar / restaurant area where breakfast is served, and the rooftop terrace restaurant. We very much enjoyed dining there and looking out over the city as the sun set. We plan to visit Barcelona again in the future. I don't think we would be opposed to staying at Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel again, but it does have some things to work out, at least with regard to this particular room.",4,2019,09,26
35,Good experience ,"This hotel is very good for anyone who may be cruising out of the port, likes a clean, well kept hotel and wants to be away from what I’m told can be a noisy experience at hotels in town. We were able to check in early which was very much welcomed after our flight from the US. The roof top views of the port and particularly Barcelona at night were terrific. Roof top bar service along with a restaurant on site for breakfast/dinner and a “barbecue” at night on the rooftop were also great when we didn’t want to travel off site for food. The only negative during our three day stay was a half hour late wake up call (to supplement our alarm) which could have made us late for a previously booked tour. Other than that, we have no complaints and felt safe as well at this location. ",4,2019,09,25
35,Bad location.  Next to Music Stadium.,"If you enjoy not being able to sleep from 10 PM to 3 AM because the hotel is adjacent to a music stadium, and enjoy paying $30 for breakfast and being a 20 minute walk from anything in Barcelona (the hotel is at the end of a pier 20 minutes from town), you will love this place.  At 2 AM on the second night, the manager at the front desk doesn’t offer to move us to a room on the quieter side of the hotel, but tells us that every hotel in Barcelona is like this and recommends that, “we go find another hotel.”  PLEASE FIND ANOTHER HOTEL.  Horrendous service, bad location, next to music stadium.",1,2019,09,21
35,Not a 5 stars hotel and certainly not GL,"If you are looking for a quiet room , NO
Or the Noise  is coming from outside , the cruise boats let their oil engine on , or from the room next to you !
If you are looking for some attention from a 5 stars , like the  down service or a fruit basket or a welcome sweet, forget it 
If you need a bathrobe, when you get one , hold it of you stay more than a day, disappear each  day . 
If you need to call the reception , it can take more few minutes .... if you want to speak to the manager , impossible  NO! Then if you want to spend money , do it , it is a cash machine , but bad service. 
I had a conference at this location, next time , I’ll take a taxi and pick up W or Arts or  any other hotel from Accor group ! Not happy at all , cannot recall it happens to me ! ",1,2019,09,21
35,Fabulous Hotel,"From the moment we arrived our experience at Eurostars Grand Marina was excellent.  Fabulous room, amazing views from the balcony of both the city and the marina.
Perfect location for exploring Barcelona and an ideal location for a pre / post cruise stop over.
Breakfast was lovely an excellent selection, all staff we met were very helpful and friendly. We will defiantly return to this hotel.",5,2019,09,19
35,Grand Marina deserves all the stars!,"Fantastic hotel in a great location.  I was also lucky enough to get an upgraded room and so had pretty much a suite.
Everywhere was spotlessly clean.  Breakfast had a huge range of choice and even a gluten free section and the complimentary cava went down very well too!  In the evenings there was a nightly BBQ on the roof terrace, which had amazing views of Barcelona.
My tip in the evening is to take a detour and go to the 1st floor as they had complimentary pick and mix candy!!
Outside the hotel you can catch the hop on hop off tourist tour bus and also the local buses.  The metro is only a 10 minute walk away and takes you to all the central points of interest.  I would download the city mapper app and use all it to make all the public transport connections easily.",5,2019,09,14
35,This hotel has got it right ,"This hotel has got it right in every aspect. Friendly reception and bar staff, modern rooms and the Corner Bar/Restaurant offers delicious food. Our room was very spacious, clean and quiet - the bed large and very comfy and the bathroom clean with a bath and walk in shower. We really enjoyed the food in the Corner Bar - do try the chocolate Coulant - and the pianist playing relaxing jazz made the evening perfect. This hotel is also good for disabled people as access is on ground level and the whole hotel has spacious halls, corridors and lifts. It’s also well situated on the port and not far from the famous Ramblas. As we pass through Barcelona quite a lot, we’ll definitely be stopping here again. 

",5,2019,09,10
35,Nice stay,"Nice room in a nice hotel. Conveniently located with a 10 minute walk to the Main Street La Rambla. Next to the harbour which our boys loved as they could watch the big ferry’s dock. I booked this hotel as it had a pool, we stayed in April and the weather was nice, but the pool was closed. We were disappointed at first, but when we went to the roof terrace for a look around we saw the pool was tiny and not really a pool at all so it didn’t really matter that it was closed.",4,2019,09,08
35,6 nights,"Location... great ...Staff helpful and friendly ... rooms comfortable and exceptionably clean 
Breakfast great choice and well presented 

But
Pool .. too small ...gym way too big ..silly design on 8th floor
Rooms on front have a great view of the city rooms on back look into offices and are gloomy and unappealing .. balconies are unusable not cleaned and have no seating in them ... not that you would want to if your room is on the back of this hotel

Apart from breakfast the food is atrocious .. 

Choice of an expensive burger/ barbecue on the roof served cold  ... or an expensive burger/ or nothing appealing in your room /or a cubby hole restaurant in a dark corner with an uninteresting overpriced menu downstairs on first floor 
Such a let down 
Not every one wants to have to go out every night eat !!!

Nothing at all Spanish on the menus .. no tapas anywhere ... not even on a lunch time Menu in The small pool area  

There is an extensive waste of space in this hotel which is basically a bed and breakfast establishment 
Such a shame in such an amazing location in such an amazing city",3,2019,09,06
35,fantastic 3 days there,"the room was very nice, huge, very clean;
the staff was exceptional and supportive in all our queries, also for external activities
with our littel kids we appreciated the very child friendly way staff was interacting",5,2019,09,04
35,Amazing location ,"We stayed here for a few days as a family in the summer. The location was just superb and the hotel felt luxurious. We had an initial issue with our room but that was swiftly dealt with. The staff were very accommodating and the rooms large. 
We ate at the hotel and the food and service were amazing, with vegan options and the outside dining was perfect in the evening. 
They also had a roof top bar which had the best views of Barcelona at night. Would recommend. 
",4,2019,09,03
35,Amazing Stay,"Thoroughly enjoyed my 4 day stay, the hotel has great service and is in a great location. The room exceeded my expectation. 

Rana was an exceptionally good host and makes amazing cocktails! Be sure to visit him at the poolside bar!",5,2019,09,01
35,Beautiful Hotel Wonderful Staff,Can't say enough was up on business and truly wonderful hotel. On top of that the staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome. Bravo on outstanding customer service. Hotel is in a fantastic location that is in walking distance to everything,5,2019,08,31
35,HOTEL WITH COCKROACHES AND MICE.,"I was las months in this Hotel, located at Barcelona World Trade Center, near to the peer. It was a horrible and disgusting experience: The security guard for the staff, a horrible old man, he doesnt attitude for personal relations. A horrible guy. Then I stayed few nights, every piece of the hotel is infested with cockroaches, every where you go: cockroaches. The room service office infested of cockroaches. Some mice I saw as well. This hotel is not sanitary approved. This hotel must to be closed now... and the old guy, security agent, should be fired.",1,2019,08,27
35,Decent hotel but not 5*,"This is a nice hotel but it’s not on the level of 5*.

The rooms are a good size so are the bathrooms. The staff are fantastic.

Location is brilliant, there is parking under the hotel.

The buffet breakfast is not worth the 27.50€. The food is just average, there is not enough seating with shade either on the terrace or inside. It felt too crowded.

The pool on the roof is a bonus but needs to be treated for black mold. The food in the pool area is low quality.

Worth staying in but don’t come thinking it’s 5*",3,2019,08,26
35,Decent hotel ,"The rooms were spacious but I personally don’t think its 5 stars. More like 4. 
Breakfast was good view was nice over the marina. Location is good and near public transportation. 
The main reason I didn’t like the hotel was they constantly try to up sell you (especially the rooms)",3,2019,08,23
35,No provision for rain ,"Sat in the fabulous terrace bar ordered drink eventually  slow service and the heavens opened. -  no drinks and no where else to go - a hotel this size and star rating should definitely have alternatives if the weather turns  the decorators are in the cocktail
Lounge even though reception are telling everyone to go there  for a drink - after a long hard day wandering around a beautiful city all
We wanted was a relaxing drink before bed was that too much to ask if a five star hotel !! ",2,2019,08,15
35,Very  Disappointed,"I was looking forward to staying at this hotel but very disappointed once there.
The room was very basic, the TV had cables dangling down the wall to the nearest plugs.The walls were very thin as we were kept awake by strange grunting noises from the next room.
The lifts were poor and sometimes we had to wait 4 or 5 minutes to use with a push chair. The corridors were dark.
The only good point was the bed was very comfortable.
In reality this is purely a business hotel and not family friendly",3,2019,08,10
35,Nice but dirty hotel,"Definitely not five stars. Rooms are a normal four star hotel, cleaning is basically non existent and the rooms are very dirty, you get new towels but they are not of a five star quality. Our bed had big spots on the sheet and when complaining we were informed it was clean until we dragged the cleaning staff into the room and they then changed the sheet. Breakfast is an average buffet, the fruit was one day definitely not fresh. The staff is very friendly and the position of the hotel is great, right in the marina. The phones in the room did not work and were never repaired despite us informing  three different members of staff. We then called reception on our mobiles but they did not pick up anyway. We had seaview which is actually marinaview, very nice. I would maybe come back because of where the hotel is situated, five to ten minutes' walk from the hustle and bustle but expect it to be dirty and not luxury. Pity with the lack of hygiene because otherwise the hotel is a normal and ok four star business hotel with a small outdoor pool on the eighth floor.",2,2019,08,08
35,Wow ,"The hotel is beautiful and has complete facilities, and the price is not high. The transportation is a bit inconvenient. It is not too far from restaurants. Really  enjoy  with what they provide during my stay.",5,2019,08,07
35,WORST HOTEL STAY EVER,The worst service ever one of thier excuses was that they dont have time very bad rooms too old to be a 5 stars hotel i give a maximum of 3 i don't recommend it for anyone i asked to put my electric car on charge after 30 minutes i discover that the car is still on the door and no body touched it most of the times they dont answer the phone,1,2019,08,06
35,Beautiful and a great location!,The Eurostars Grand Marina was beautiful and up to the standards of a Eurostar hotel.  We arrived early and they were able to put us in a room.  The location was great for sight seeing and the marina.  We were walking distance to the Columbus monument.  I was sick and the hotel staff was great in securing a doctor to visit our hotel room.  The pharmacy was right out the front door so I was able to fill the prescription.  When we got back from dinner our welcome wine and chocolate strawberries were waiting for us!,5,2019,08,06
35,Shahenaz Sabban,"I booked the deluxe suit sea view and expected good service .I left my room at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and put the cleaning signe on ;came back at 9 found my room undone ,when I phoned them at the reception  they sent them to clean the room ..it was very unconvinet as I was tired and needed to come back to a clean room.
The TV in the seating are was un programmed and they sent the maintenance to programme it while I was a room which took him 25 minutes of unconvincey for me .Also the TV in the bedroom had only Spanish channels although they said they had other channels..which also the maintenance man had to programme..I did not accept such poor services for the money they charge.",2,2019,08,03
35,"Great hotel, especially Rana in the pool Bar",Great hotel and what made our visit a lot better was Rana from the Bar who gave us excellent service. Angel from the reception was great as well. The breakfast was 10/10 and the view from the rooftop was magical!,5,2019,08,01
35,Very Poor,"Poor service. Rooms not clean. Housekeeping team is worthless. Room was in a total mess for 2 days despite of the fact that it was cleaned by housekeeping team.
Moreover, there is very less insulation in between the rooms.",1,2019,07,27
35,Disappointing ,"Poor housekeeping team as during our 3 days in this hotel, the rooms were not cleaned properly. Used tea/coffee cups were not replaced with the new ones. When we requested for fresh cups, we were told to pay for the same. It was very shocking. Moreover no complimentary water was given in the room. Overall a very very disappointing experience.",1,2019,07,27
35,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed here overnight as catching ferry to Mallorca, hotel lovely and clean, bright and spacious, great location as in port.  Room was large and spacious (we had a suite).  Breakfast very varied with dairy free and gluten free options. Secure parking available and staff extremely friendly and helpful.  Will definitely be coming back here again for a longer stay. 🙂",5,2019,07,23
35,nice location,"We stayed here for 2 days...it is at the 10 minutes walking distance of La Rambla Street...the walk is also very good.
It is surrounded by dock area...all cruise go near by. If you reach on the roof you find magnificent view all sides...pool is situated at pool side only. the Breakfast was especially served for us being vegetarian. the service was excellent and they arranged us in separate room area on round table. you can get taxi very easily and all hop on hop off buses go from this area only. The reception area/people very less...as per number of rooms they are serving.",4,2019,07,22
35,City break for four days,"This hotel is convenient for city of Barcelona, transport stops outside hotel.   We walked into centre via Las Ramblas a must see.   The hotel is very clean with great views over the harbor.   Breakfast has great variety and the roof top bar views are fantastic.",4,2019,07,22
35,Nice👌,"We had the pleasure of spending 3 nights at the Eurostar Marina. All in all, we had a very nice experience. Quick and pleasant check in, service minded workers, clean rooms and good food. The only thing that pulls a little down is that you hear everything going on in the hallway when lying in bed. Must give extra praise to Rana and Badar in the bar on the 8th floor. very nice people, with a smile on their mouths.",4,2019,07,20
35,Good for business too,"We stayed 3 nights for a business meeting and were very comfortable and well looked after. This has more of a holiday hotel feel to it, but as business guests we had no complaints. The food was better than average and the rooms comfortable and well equipped. ",4,2019,07,19
35,Great!,"Had an amazing stay for three nights at the hotel right from check-in to check-out. Breakfast spread is excellent and staff are very friendly and very accommodating to requests. I stayed in grand marina suite and the view of sea and city were stunning. Housekeeping staff were excellent.
The wifi and phone was not working in the room hence giving them 4 stars else would have given them 5 stars.",4,2019,07,17
35,Beautiful hotel overall but bar experience needs some small improvments,"Loved my room, large, modern, clean comfortable  - looking out at the boats etc.  Good breakfast experience,   but Bar was shut at 11pm even for residents  ( there was the option t o use room service but  beware if you want a G&T as  it was 40 euros from room service for a standard gin)",3,2019,07,15
35,"Good location, beautiful views, the best brunch!","Eurostars Grand Marina is a great place to stay.  Very business like and professional.  The front desk staff was the most friendly and accommodating.  So, I never eat hotel breakfasts/brunch--but my husband just made me look at it first before we went somewhere else and I am SO glad we did!  It had a HUGE selection and had really great options.  Much more than the usual yogurt, bagel, toast, waffle/pancake scene.  They had fruit, charcuterie boards with delicious cured meats and cheeses (including goat and sheep cheeses).  Also, they have a roof top pool and are right next to Madness Coffee which is my fave coffee shop we went to in all of Spain!  Just a note, in a room with an adjoining door, we could hear the person next door talking on their phone when we were in bed.  But, they have a cool bathroom/shower set up and complimentary slippers.  Haha!  I would stay here again if we were in Barcelona proper.",4,2019,07,14
35,Avoid at all costs!,"I have never written a negative review before this one. I tend to like to compliment, and find the positive, specially when traveling. But this hotel is unacceptably dirty. 
We arrived late for one night before leaving for a cruise. We had three rooms booked as we are traveling with extended family. 
We had asked to be on the same floor, which they did not honor. 

One room was the least bad. The tables were dirty, but overall it was fine. 
Another, the sheets were damp. 
The third was an abomination! The bathroom had not been cleaned- we had fecal matter and pubic hairs and the shower had hair all over it. 
At nearly midnight, we were offered to wait ‘30-45 minutes’ while the room was cleaned, and only after insisting, we were switched to a much smaller room. This was was passingly clean, but the floors were tacky  underfoot. 

The walls are so thin we could hear everything in the hallways, and nearby rooms. 
They are very understaffed for the volume of travelers. We had a dinner and breakfast and both the waitstaff were overwhelmed by the number of customers. 

I could go on, but, I think you get the picture. Just avoid this place!",1,2019,07,14
35,DON’T GO THERE !,"Soooo bad that it made me write my first review. My family and I were there for 2 nights on and off a cruise . First things first , the room was so dusty it gave my daughter a chest allergy , sheets not very clean.. very unpleasant staff, they did not even apologize for giving us the room at 1.30 pm instead on 12. Very loud cleaning staff and no sound isolation
Between rooms . Not recommended , and the family suite wasn’t cheap ( 600$ a night !) 
What a shame for such a nice location !",1,2019,07,12
35,Great venue and not as expensive as you think!,"Time it right and you can get a good room here for less than €200! Good rooms, great service and great location as part of the trade centre. They have Mini Mokes for hire as well as run arounds! Great coffee shop right next door as well!",4,2019,07,09
35,Don’t Book,"We booked a room 5 weeks in advance, only to get an email 3 days before our reservation that our room has been cancelled. The hotel claimed they credit card didn’t work, however we called our credit card company and they informed us the hotel didn’t try even once to put the reservation through. We called the hotel to speak about the mix-up, I thought they had just tried the wrong card number by accident. The staff were rude on the phone, when we asked them to confirm the card number they refused. We asked them to run our card again, they refused. We paid €556 when we booked 5 weeks ago, they said we could rebook for €795. Coming from Canada with Canadian $ that is a huge price increase for something that wasn’t our fault. They were unwilling to give us a more reasonable price of even €600. The hotel wasn’t interested at all in trying our credit card again to see if the problem was on their end. We called the hotel immediately after they sent us the cancelation email. We rebooked at a better and cheaper hotel in Barcelona. Be careful with your reservations at this place, or better yet don’t book at all.",1,2019,07,05
35,A good location for boat lovers,"We stayed here as a family of 4 in a suite, the room had a fantastic large queen size bed next to the bathroom and a sofa bed in the lounge that was not the most comfortable but as the bedroom was darker we put the children in the darker more comfortable bed hoping they would sleep on in the morning. Staff were friendly and welcoming and the breakfast buffet was one of the best I’ve seen a very wide verity of items to suit all tastes. The location is good for being a tourist as the hop on hop off busses go right past the door,.",5,2019,07,02
35,great place.,"Hotel is clean and room is large., Breakfast was wonderful. Lots of choices. Hotel is close to the port if you are going to a cruise. Close to Las Ramblas where the actions. Walking distance to all tourist spots. Quiet.
They serve chanpagne with breakfast. Check in and check out is a breeze.",5,2019,06,27
35,Amazing Weekend ,"
Stayed here for a short break in May and we were truly impressed!! The hotel is in a good location not far from Las Ramblas so everything was within walking distance. The rooms were very spacious and very clean and no request was too much . The breakfast buffet had a good choice to cater for any taste and the bar was a good place to relax . We had rain a couple of days so the reception staff provided us with umbrellas which was a nice touch . All the staff were very friendly and helpful so we shall definitely stay there again when we visit Barca again .",5,2019,06,26
35,Not a five star,"We booked 3 night stay. Great check in and quickly to room,good location next to cruise port. Room facing front of hotel on 5th floor.  Problem after first night we vacated the room by 9am returning at 16:00 to find room not serviced. Spoke to lady cleaning along  our corridor, as there was no answer via housekeeping explained the situation and that we had no dry towels and we would go to bar to enable them to have access.We went to bar and after 45 mins returned to room where still no dry towels or room cleaned. Partner went down to reception to complain and was offered complimentary drink at bar. The following evening on redeeming the drinks we were told it was only valid on specific drinks, suggesting that this is a common occurance as another gentleman was at the bar redeeming his.Room was eventually serviced after we left at 20:00. There is clearly a big  problem within the housekeeping department that need addressing as on closer inspection there was think dust on various windows and furniture in the room. On a night the room was extremely bright from the outside lights shining into the room and curtains that did nothe close and we're for show only. Breakfast OK but as a five star I do not expect coffee from vending machines. I would not have written this review if the hotel was an star but if it is a five star then my expectations are higher and other 5 star hotels in have visited far outshine this hotel.
",2,2019,06,24
35,Staff lovely. Hotel poor,"This is simply not the five star property it claims to be. Old furniture, ac and heat that blew hot and cold all night, light switches that didn’t work (finally unplugged the bedside lamp). 

Rooms are good sized but soft and hard furnishings are more than tired. The staff is lovely but I still say stay elsewhere. ",2,2019,06,19
35,Saved by Julia,"We had a couple of bumps in our stay due to booking through a third party. I would have given an awful review had it not been for Julia who sorted everything and recompensed is for the problems. Sometimes things just don’t go to plan at hotels and at that point, the most important thing is how they handle the situation and sort it out. It’s rare to see a hotel care sufficiently these days to adequately sort the problem out, especially when they can fall back on their name, location or stature, I’m so glad to say that we were impressed with the handling in this case. 

The hotel is lovely, it may be a bit old fashioned compared to a couple of other hotels in Barcelona but it is classy, stylish and comfy. 

FOOD: The breakfast is INCREDIBLE. It doesn’t matter what kind of breakfast you like, they cater for it, whatever it is. The spread for the buffet is absolutely huge, possibly one of the best in terms of options I have seen. I was ill during my stay so I had two nights of room service, the first night was probably in the top three for quality I’ve ever had, the food was absolutely beautiful and stunning. The second night unfortunately was poor with way too much salt, but Julia sorted this out for us too. 

Overall, what could have been a “never to return” review has been turned into a “will return” review",4,2019,06,13
35,Great view from our room,"Our room was 338..great view of all the cruise ships saw one make a 180 degree turn was amazing..The young trainee Lucas who registered us in would be a great asset to the Eurostars team. He was attentive efficient and even offered to accomodate us for the breakfasts even offered us a ""picnic basket"" for breakfast on our last night as we had a really early flight. Our room was not ready and I think he got us an upgrade on the room. Joel was also very helpful. Service at the bar and restaurant needs to move up a few notches as it does not fit in with the 5 star rating of the hotel. I only wish they would have the electrical outlets at eye level rather than under the table etc.",5,2019,06,02
35,Stayed here recently.......,".....and found everything to be up to scratch.  Comfortable beds, lovely bathroom, nice bar, great breakfast, draughty lobby, great location. No complaints!  It was very handy for a walk along the front to the restaurants which we had visited on a previous occasion.",5,2019,05,29
35,5 Stars BUT----------,"Nicely located hotel,manager I hope her name was Christina took excellent care of us upon check-in. Except for Her the front desk that Friday morning was inept. Luggage piled everywhere. Great spread for breakfast although food a little cold. Hotel is nicely located for tourists-hop on bus just a block away. I suggest room 805 absolutely beautiful with views f the Harbor and city. I would stay here again.",5,2019,05,27
35,Nice place great location,"This is a great spot for a night or two. Location is ideal on the Ramblas and easy walk to everywhere. Nice pre or post cruise stop over. ATM, convenience store and market are close by. If you are taking a taxi to the ship or airport, grab it yourself at the curb, there are plenty and you will save a 7 euro booking fee the desk clerk won’t tell you about.",4,2019,05,26
35,Low Stars for Eurostars,"We had high hopes for our rather high priced hotel in Barcelona, Spain. But our expectations were not met. 
Pros: Location / Christine, the night desk manager. Nice room.
Cons: For whatever reason??? Room was not cleaned/ beds made up even though we called the front desk twice. 
We left the room at 8:00. We returned at 15. No service but front desk promised to take care of it. Sure they would!!!
When we came back at 20. Nothing was done. 
For $200 per night, we expected more. We didn’t get it.",3,2019,05,20
35,Location ,"We where at this hotel for a conference. Check in was easy as the conference personal had it all prearranged. The rooms had all necessities iron, ironing board, safe, hair dryer. We where over looking the court yard. The breakfast had everything and more for what a person needed. The staff I would have to rate mid range. Of course you have great service then other times it was an epic fail. The pool was smaller than expected. The location is perfect for easy walking to many high points of Barcelona. We expected more from a 5 star establishment.",3,2019,05,19
35,Bad service,"The hotel is nice location is ok but the customer service is bad. 
Housekeeping very bad. You have to ask for tissues, towels, shower cup, etc . 
The font desk is not helpful . Is a good 3 stars hotel. Definitely not more. ",2,2019,05,18
35,Our impressions after a six night stay,"We stayed in this hotel during our 6 night visit in Barcelona in May 2019. 

While i was searching for hotel via internet my concerns were to book a five star hotel not only close to places of interest like the Gothic Quarter, Sagrada Familia, Casa Mila etc  but also located in a district where our 2 y.o. son could have daily walks and where after the daily activities we could easily find nearby good options for dining. Based on these factors i narrowed down my search and concentrated on Marina district. Where the options were  Eurostars Grand Marina, W Hotel and The Serras Hotel. Based on availability and financial comparison of these i decided on booking two connected city suites in Eurostars Grand Marina. Our return flight was at midnight. Therefore i decided to pay one of these connected suites one more night so that we would have a room for all our needs till our check out from the hotel. Both the connected city suites for 6 nights and one of them for the 7th night for in advanced fully paid. I received a confirmation from the reservations department following the booking. I also informed them that our arrival time shall be at 3pm.

On the date of our arrival our flight had delay and we were in the hotel around16:15-16:30. It took me nearly half an hour to explain the managers in the reception about our booking of the connected suites for 6 nights with one more night for one of them.(regardless of the fact that i had the confirmation letter from the hotel in my hand) We were also told that one of the rooms were ready however the other still needs to be cleaned. We therefore had to wait till 17:30 to get access to the second of the connected city suites. 

Even though we had to wait for the cleaning we found out the it was not done properly when we saw that our sons light coloured socks were covered with dust and dirt after running around the room.

Some of the room amenities needed repair or replacement but i decided not to pay too much attention on those since we were mostly our of the hotel after breakfast till bedtime. Also almost everyday we had minor issues such as missing towels after cleaning, running out of toilet paper etc. 

During our stay whenever we needed some sort of assistance like booking a restaurant or arranging a car etc i tried to avoid peak hours of reception during check in and check out. Otherwise since there was no separate concierge we had to line up with guests checking in/out. 

The breakfasts were good with a large open buffet. We never had to wait for a table. 
I was totally satisfied with the location of the hotel. There were many good restaurants around. Hotel was walking distance from majority of cities touristic highlights.
I read reviews before booking that the city side suites view is spoiled by the cable car tower. However i found out that these city view suites were not only have a view of the historic center of the city but they also had a sunset view. A photo of the view from the room is attached below. 

I believe that the above mentioned critics of mine are mostly related with insufficient amount of resources in the hotel. The reception services could probably be improved by increasing the number of receptionists working. A separate concierge would be good for visitors in order to avoid them lining up with guests who are checking out or checking in in order to ask for help to book a restaurant or to arrange transport etc. Some investment is needed to freshen the rooms.",3,2019,05,16
35,Great stay,"This hotel is a good stop gap for a short stay. Located at the top of Las Ramblas, short walk into the city. Quite an industrial area next door to the port where cruise ships and ferries dock. A business hotel. Very clean and well maintained. Very friendly staff. Rooms lovely. Breakfast was plentiful, something for everyone. Overall a good stay. Wouldn’t recommend for a holiday hotel. Nice for weekend base .",5,2019,05,13
35,Good hotel in a great location,"Stayed for 1 night whilst on business in Barcelona. 

The hotel is nice, and the rooms are good too. Not exceptional, but good. 

The two best things about this hotel are the location and the breakfast. 

Would i stay again - yes.",5,2019,05,13
35,beautiful city,"First time in Barcelona, and loved it, what a beauty
Now the hotel, great location, great building, suppose to be one of the prestigious hotels in Barcelona, well i beg to differ, not quite a 5 star, none the less overall an enjoyable 3 days there.",4,2019,05,08
35,Very nice Hotel,"We loved this hotel. It is right on the water, and so close to the cruise ship dock. You are near the market and restaurants, buses. The room was very nice and clean. They have breakfast that was very good. A great selection to choose from. The staff is all very nice and always there to help with anything. There is shopping right out side the door too. All in all we were very happy we stayed there. It was our anniversary and they had a cake and champagne set up for us when we returned from the days ventures. It was very nice.",5,2019,05,08
35,Nice hotel,We stayed here before our Mediterranean cruise.  Very nice hotel.  The room was very nice and comfortable.  The staff was extremely helpful.  The breakfast buffet was included in our room rate and it was very good.,5,2019,05,07
35,Good Pre-Cruise Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel with my family before embarking on a cruise from Barcelona, and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. 

Arrival+Room
Upon arriving at the hotel, we had a quick and easy check-in and our room was already prepared to accommodate our three-person group. The sofa-bed, which was quite comfortable, was already made and the room was still very spacious and comfortable. From our room we had a beautiful view of the city, and the room's walk-in closet and large bathroom were also highlights. The room was very clean.

Location
There are a few ship docks/terminals right outside the hotel, but we had to take a short taxi ride with our luggage to board our ship. The hotel is within walking distance to many restaurants and attractions in Barcelona and the city tour buses, which allow you to see the rest of the city, stop right near the hotel entrance. 

Food
We ate one dinner and one breakfast in the hotel, and both meals were delicious. The dinner and drinks were a bit expensive, but the offerings were well-prepared. The food on the breakfast buffet was diverse and well-prepared and the counters were clean and well-stocked.

Facilities
The hotel's fitness room is somewhat small, but well-stocked and clean. It not only has dumbbells, yoga mats, and treadmills, but it also has other machines for lifting and cardio. There were also sweat towels and locker rooms for use with the fitness room. The hotel has an outdoor pool, which seemed to be closed during our visit, and a spacious roof-top sitting area.

Service
The hotel had very good service. We needed to print a few documents before our cruise the next day, and they allowed us to use their printer to do so. They also granted us a flexible late check-out.",5,2019,05,06
35,"Theft at the lobby, hotel staff were not helpful nor care at all","My husband traveled with group of 40 people. While checking in at the lobby, his cabin bag was stolen. The hotel staff didn’t care at all and refused to show the CCTV. The staff told the tour guide that the security manager already went home and the CCTV couldn’t be accessed until the next morning. No help or care from the hotel. My husband and the tour guide went to the police station to report the event.

The next morning, the hotel staff refused to show the CCTV without the police’s order.

The hotel staffs were not cooperative, did not care at all! There was only 1 security staff or porter to help with the bags.

Beware and avoid this hotel!

",1,2019,05,05
35,Excellent location and great hotel,"I was surprised by the negative comments about this hotel, so I thought I should share my experience. 
We stayed for 3 nights visiting our 4 year old grandson who had just moved to Barcelona.
The hotel staff were efficient and helpful. 
We were upgraded to a premier room - which was clean and modern. Although it had a balcony (207) - forget the view - go to the 8th floor for a fabulous view of the city. Yes drinks a bit pricey as is the bar food - that is what you pay for this type of hotel. Breakfast was excellent. Complete choice and range. 
Taxi from airport €30-35. No Uber in Barcelona anymore. 
We booked direct on the hotel website - gives you a free breakfast - definitely worth it!
We will stay again. Great location. ",5,2019,04,29
35,The best location in Barcelona,"I stayed three nights in this place. Since the hotel was close to the water I  expected a sea view, but my room was in the second floor and I could only sea a roof top/parking place. However the room was quite nice, the beds were comfortable and the meeting room and the terrace in the 8 th floor were fantastic  The breakfast in the hotel was very good. Unfortunately the electricity went off twice in the room when I did some ironing. 
Not before the electrician brought me a new iron the light worked well again. 
On the departure day I extended my visit for half of the day which was perfect.",4,2019,04,23
35,Pete's 60th adventure,"Booked this weekend away as a birthday present for my husband. We have very high standards and I wanted everything to be right for him. Lovely hotel, clean, with welcoming and very helpful staff. Breakfast was lovely with lots of variety of food and excellent service. Beautuful room with all amenities. Just one fault, tea coffee and milk not replaced and dirty gin glass left for 2 days, otherwise would have been 5 stars.",4,2019,04,18
35,Average nice hotel,"We arrive early and the room is not finished before 3pm - which is quite normal. 
We get a voucher with drinks and referred to the bar which is closed. 
It`s a pretty big room and everything works ok. The room is centered on the backyard and it is an industrial touch to the style. The room is large and baths ok. This is a totally ok experience for around 80-120 euros. But this is not a classic five-star experience. Quiet ok - if the price is low, but not a hotel that creates the impression. It is like an airport hotel with no charm and heart.",3,2019,04,14
35,Short family city break,"We stayed at the Marina for 3 nights at the start of the half term week. We had a standard suite overlooking the city and was a large room with beds for all 4 of us. The bathroom was huge and also really liked the big shower and bath with jets. The staff were extremely polite and the breakfast choice was huge with a mixture of cooked and cold food. Perfect location for walking into town or along the marina to the restaurants north up the coast. 
Not sure what happened with other guest but we would definitely return to both Barcelona and the Eurostar’s Grand Marina. ",5,2019,04,13
35,First and last time in this hotel NEVER AGAIN,"The staff at reception had no choice to deal with their customers as numbers because it was obvious the management have not a clue how to run a 5 stars hotel.
Every single problem accur we had to wait a full day to be solved, as management during week-end seem not to be available at all because somewherelse at a convention.
We stay only 3 nights but we really want the end of our stay there as we where very disappointed with everything advertise in their website but not available.
After so many years travelling to Barcelona FIRST AND LAST TIME in this hotel, the owners should teach to their management the meaning of HOSPITALITY",1,2019,04,13
35,AWFUL HOTEL *1,"After many trips to Barcelona over the years, I can say this is the worst hotel i have stayed in..

I took my wife there for a weekend break, upon our arrival, i was told that the room i had booked online was not available and that i would be staying in 1 half the price...eventually I was told i could have a similar room... when we walked in , it obvisouly had not been cleaned, it was filthy, and there was what appeared to be a blood stain on the sheets..

I visted front desk, and I have never experienced rudness like it, i was told to email head office, eventually we where moved yet again...

This is not a 5 star hotel, both in service and accommodation,  would never stay or recommend this hotel to any one...",1,2019,04,10
35,Definitely NOT a 5* hotel - 3* at best ....,"I have traveled extensively for my work over the years and feel compelled to write a review of this hotel as it was appalling.  Upon check-in I was told my room wasn't yet ready despite it being 7pm and 4 hours after the designated check-in time, bad start.  i was also informed that the pool and rooftop bar would be closed throughout my stay which was annoying as one of the main reasons for booking this venue as I wanted my colleagues to enjoy a post work drink on the terrace. Breakfast was ridiculously expensive and inedible.  I have visited Barcelona on numerous occasions for work and this was the worst trip ever - I will not be back!",1,2019,04,08
35,AVOID!!!!,"So disappointed with this place ! Have not had such a horrible experience in 5* hotel ever before! Arrived at 6pm room not ready even though check in is 12-3pm, reception staff was so  useless, all smiles and forget to do anything you ask them. Hotel is at best 3 star not 5 as it says. Pool and rooftop bar closed throughout stay. Although advertised as hotel with heated pool! Breakfast absolutely disgusting and at €27 is way over priced!!! They even charge for the tea and coffee in the room. I’ve visited Barcelona many times before and this is the worst hotel I’ve ever experienced there, or indeed anywhere. Completely mismanaged hotel.",1,2019,04,08
35,"Good , but....","Nice hotel, clean, extremely comfortable bed, but not internet except in the lobby, and the front desk gave us incorrect information as to where our ship was docked. All in all, a good experience, and ever so convenient if you are taking a cruise from Barcelona.",4,2019,04,07
35,Nice experience in convenient location,"We enjoyed our stay at Eurostar’s Grand Marina Hotel. We had booked the wrong date and the staff was helpful to sort out the booking even though we booked through an third party online agent. We had a very nice, spacious room warbling around and looking out to the sea. The location is super convenient within walking distance of Ramblas. ",4,2019,04,06
35,Warning - your personal stuff gets stolen at this hotel and the hotel management doesn´t care,"I stayed at Eurostars Grand Marina from the 7th to the 8th of March together with my children. When I checked out I forgot a airport security plastic bag with toiletries and medicine as well as a make-up purse with jewelry. The plastic bag and the make-up purse was lying next to each other at the bathroom. 
My husband called the hotel the 8th in the evening, and there had been no reporting of the missing items. Then he visit the hotel the 9th in the morning, and there had been no other guests in the room since we checked out. The hotel door had been locked at all times. My husband again explained that the plastic bag contained medicin, and 10 minutes later it was found, The make-up purse was not found. .
In the following weeks we both wrote the hotel several times and asked to be connected with the hotel management as well as the policies, but we got no replies what so ever. The hotel is completely ignoring our requests. So one thing is the theft - it might happen - staff is perhaps underpaid - but the lack of response from a hotel rated with 5 stars is even worse. I honestly believe you should reconsider if you are planning to stay at this hotel.",1,2019,03,24
35,Good base for short time visits,"The location is great to reach a lot of tourist destinations in a short time.Short walk to Rambla, to port, Aquarium,Montjuic, Barceloneta and good restaurants. To metro it is like 15 minutes walk but no need as there were always a lot of free cheep taxis in front of the hotel. Airport transfer was without any problem.Check-in was fast. No bothering with any hotel forms. Ordering two rooms on the same name I would expect automatic allocation at the same floor but the small misunderstanding was solved and we got soon the rooms we wanted.It is worth to request the port and city view which is amazing from the higher floors.The big trajects were a bit noisy but was great to watch them arriving into the harbour. Corridors smelt a bit strange but in the room was everything perfect.The only problem was the noise from some groups of guest comming from parties and knocking on the doors in the mid of the night to have some fun. Room equipment was nice and refurbished. No damages and always well cleaned. Minibar was always full of different drinks. Shower is equipped with massage jets and the same is in the bath. Hotel bar was great with live band and great young always smiling waitress with a fast service.Disappointing was breakfast. Choice corresponds to 4*. The young staff needs there more training from other hotels and some stronger leadership.Tables were cleaned first after guests arrival even the had nothing to do and the left there still dirty tableclothes and cutlery and seats full of crumbs. We must always wait ca 5 minutes.All were very slow and always chatting to each other.The only functional staff were a couple supplementing the food.Coffee&tea as selfservice.No fresh egs and omelettes corner. It is a pity that in the hotel is no indoor pool and only very small one on the roof opened first in May. There is a well equipped gym. Overall feeling was 8 points of 10.We would like to return travelling to Barcelona.",4,2019,03,24
35,Perfect Stat,"I booked this hotel after a disastrous stay at a smaller hotel in Barcelona, so this was last minute booking. It wasn't too expensive, but it was worth every dollar. Large bathroom, large bedroom with a comfortable king sized bed, and a large living room. The room had a beautiful view on the front of the hotel which you could see the city from. My biggest rave, is that the entire room was clean. The hotel itself is great too, you can't beat the rooftop view, it's a must for couples. 

My only negative comment is the front desk personell gave us wrong information on which train to take to the main station. We almost missed the last train out of Barcelona. So, I'll still give it a 5 since he was probably just a moron.",5,2019,03,19
35,Great Location and Lovely Hotel,"Great Hotel, the staff are very friendly and the location is perfect. It's very handy to walk into the main strip or catch one of the city busses, as they stop almost outside. The concierge is great and full of knowledge. The accommodation is lovely and very clean and the breakfast is wonderful - a large buffet that sets you up for the day!",5,2019,03,19
35,Great Hotel and handy for Cruise Port,"The Hotel is clean, food very good and the staff are superb.

The Hotel is within walking distance of the Cruise Port and la Rambles. We stayed 2 nights prior to a Cruise and the taxi from the Hotel to our Cruise was Euro 10 for 2 adults and two cases.

The Hotel has great view over the City and marina and we will definitely stay here again.

Finally Big Bus Barcelona stops right outside, also within 800 meters is the Cruise Shuttle Bus that costs Euro 3 per person to take you to your Cruise Ship.",5,2019,03,17
35,Very clean hotel,"A very clean hotel with large room enough for a couple.
A modern style hotel, well equiped.
The location is in a small and quiet street.
Breakfast is added cost but reasonable.
The reception desk is available all the night.",4,2019,03,14
35,Grand style and security ,"I chose this 4 star hotel because of its proximity to the cruise port. It was a pleasant surprise to get a harbor view on a higher floor.
The room was large and well kept. The view was amazing and the staff were friendly and welcoming as well as multi lingual. 
The breakfast is a little pricey but well worth the price. ",4,2019,03,12
35,Great location - brilliant staff,"I booked a family room at the Eurostars Grand Marina hotel mainly based on the location which is close to the bottom of La Rambla.  We arrived too late to go out for dinner so ate in the hotel bar which was great.  Our room was spacious, clean and everything that we needed for a family of four with an 8 and 11yr old.  However our room was connected to an interconnecting room which was being used by another family, unfortunately the other family proved to be really noisy and kept us up through the night due to a loud TV,  incredible snoring, singing in the shower at 6am amongst other things.  
After a day walking around the city we came back to the hotel and casually enquired whether or not our room neighbours were still booked in or had they left?  Unfortunately they were staying for the exact time period that we were booked in.  We asked if it were possible to move room.  20 mins later, Pablo from the front desk, came to find us and he had managed to sort out a new room on a different floor.  The whole team couldnt have been more helpful and understanding - we werent cross or demanding a new room we just asked if they could see if there was anything that they could do.
On top of this, the team on front desk arranged a little birthday cake for my sons birthday which fell on the day we checked in.  They helped us to find a place to eat which was showing El Classico, they recommended an amazing Brunch place and all in all made our stay even better.
The hotel location was perfect, everything inside it was at least to our expectation but the staff, from the front desk, to the bar were amazing.  Thanks so much guys.",5,2019,03,04
35,Great 4 day break,"4 night city break, room was huge with a great size bathroom., The bed was really comfy. The hotel is in a perfect spot right at the port and about 10 mins to La Rambla. Good choice at breakfast for everyone. Hotel bar is extremely expensive",5,2019,02,28
35,Corporate suit[e]s,"Stayed here as part of a visit paid for MWC19. As expected it was very corporate / business orientated with a slight cruise ship corridor feeling to it. I wouldn’t call it 5* as my towels weren’t even rearranged each day (happy not to have them washed for ecology reasons) and the in-room coffee pods not topped up each day (I’m not sure whether the €5 price listing on the mini-bar for coffee was for these or not as a company was paying for my room so never saw the final check-out bill). However I don’t want to lay blame on the room maid staff as they probably have a hard enough time of it as it is. As I didn’t book my room, I wasn’t able to specify a room with a view, instead getting a courtyard to look at instead. Contrary to other comments however I found all the breakfast waiting staff to be pleasant, smiling and happy to assist with any request. Breakfast itself was plentiful with lots of options. Location-wise there was plenty to see and do near enough and whilst I saw plenty of ferries coming and going, wasn’t overly aware of noise from them. ",4,2019,02,27
35,Wonderful staff,"4 night business stay during MWC

Room was spacious and as good as you would expect. Got a marina view, a plus, but the seagulls were really annoying (they sound like stray cats fighting sometimes)

Breakfast was amazing as well

The real stand out is how wonderful the staff were throughout. It's a very busy time but they were always accommodating and helpful

The one major downside was my sink was clogged and I called every single day for them to fix it and they neve did. That should drop this to 3 stars but the staff were so great I give it a 4",4,2019,02,27
35,Perfect for business trip! Great location!,"I stayaed at this hotel on a business trip. 
The hotel is very big. The room was fantastic , nice , fresh and big. The bed was comfortable. The breakfast was very good. The location of this hotel is perfect. You can easily reach to La rambla by 10 min walk or to the port. Easy access by walk, metro. 
The only thing that I didn’t like about this hotel was the building that you have to take the elevators and it was busy during the morning and afternoon and you couldn’t access the stairs! That was strange. 
It is perfect for bussiness trips.",4,2019,02,24
35,Worst 5 star hotel ever been,"We were here in October for 4 nights with friends, with kids. We booked this hotel mainly for it’s pool and proximity to the center and beach. And of course because we wanted a luxury hotel.
It was a great disappointment that the pool was closed because “it’s not the season”, they said. It was 25 degrees, the whole week. Besides that, it wasn’t mentioned on their website! 
Our view was roof/ building view, very ugly.
There was nothing to do, bar was closed due to private parties.
Maybe a good hotel when you’re on a business trip, but it’s a hotel without any atmosphere.
I forgot my e-reader and called immediately when I found out after checking in at the airport for our flight back home. It took us 2 phone calls and 12 emails (!) with our credit card details to get it back after 3 months! When I got it back it was broken! Very bad customer service... Don’t exactly remember what we paid per night but it was around €250 for the two of us. I’ve been to much better and cheaper hotels in Barcelona!
",1,2019,02,24
35,Four Star Standard Surrounded by Noisy Cargo Ships,"This hotel is a very standard four star with higher pricing. First the good things - good location a few minutes from the busy Rambla and Gothic Quarter. Extremely helpful and polite staff in the lobby (receptionists, bellmen), large breakfast selection (variety of Spanish cheeses, fresh orange juice, etc.), nice size room (stayed at superior double with sea view). And now the bad thing: the hotel is right in the middle of Barcelona port which means huge cargo ships right below your window (why did I pay extra for the sea view?!) with their engines on all the time. The constant noise day and night was unbearable.",3,2019,02,13
35,Great stay in a lovely hotel,"This is our second visit to this hotel. It’s is in a perfect location close to everything. Very safe location with fantastic views of the sea and city.  The room was immaculate and large with a nice sized balcony,  All of the staff we encountered were polite friendly and couldn’t do enough for us. The bar drinks and food were reasonably priced. The breakfast was plentiful and lots of choice. I would recommend this hotel. My only disappointment was that on Floor 8 the pool area has been left without maintenance over the winter months and debris and rubbish along with worn sun beds were visible. This is not to a 5 star hotel standard.",4,2019,02,11
35,Wonderful stay,"I liked the location of the hotel and view from my room. I liked the size of the room and bathroom, given average sizes of rooms within Europe. Breakfast was great.Overall I enjoyed my stay. Not sure why there are few negative reviews from some of the travellers. I didn't find any wrong.",5,2019,02,04
35,Pathetic service. ,"Hotel room does provide good view of city but there services are really bad. They charge for Water bottles that is 7 euros per bottle. My eyes got opened when I asked some cuttrly for my room the Room service department asked me to pay 10 euros for the same....
In off season they behave to guest like that I can think of how they will do that if season is on peak.
Stay away from this hotel for their room service. ",3,2019,01,26
35,Weekend away,Cannot fault the hotel. Rooms are nice and well maintained. Free bottle of bubbly on arrival. We also got another as it was a birthday for one of us. We didn't complain when a 3rd bottle arrived. Presume this was a mistake but a pleasant one. Location is good. Breakfast is great and staff all very helpful. Only gripe is the taxis were on strike and they charged us 88 euros for a private shuttle to the airport. Uber wasn't operating and they are under 30 euros. Would defo recommend friends of they are away for a weekend ,4,2019,01,22
35,Fantastic hotel ,"Incredible hotel, stunning views & fantastic location.
Spacious room with lovely views of the marina. 
Staff very kind & welcoming, couldn’t fault them at all.
Room service did a lovely job! If you didn’t want them to clean in the morning you can request a time. 
Free cake and champagne on arrival. 
Overall our stay was lovely & we would definitely go back!
",5,2019,01,22
35,hotel services,"We chose this hotel is it’s location, which is right at the world trade centre and next to the cruise terminal, hop-on-hop off bus stop about 3 minutes walk from the hotel and within walking distance to La Rambla. We stayed 2 nights with breakfast included. Lots of varieties of food to choose from. Hotel is cleaned and quiet. But the only negative side is their poor services. I have to say-no services at all from the front desk. My first encounter was, no bus boy to help bringing our luggage in after arrival for check in and to our room.  Second encounter was, we cannot log in their wifi by following the instructions. I called the front desk, they said will send somebody up to help. Guess what, after patiently wait for 1 hr. and nobody showed up. we ended up to bring our devices all the way down to the front desk and get help. Thirdly, we found our TV remote did not work and called the front desk for help(it was about 10pm). The service man did not show up until 11pm.  I have to say this hotel needs a complete management overhaul!
After we check in hotel and got the wifi sort out, it was already 5pm. The front desk ladies do not keep themselves up to date about their own town events. They sold us 2 days hop-on-hop off bus tickets without telling us the next day bus will stop running after 3pm due to parade! The front desk ladies also told us to wait at the wrong side for the wrong bus which ended we missed the bus and wasted more excursion time for the rest of the evening on our first night! We do not think we will come back to stay!",3,2019,01,14
35,"Spanish-hating hotel, don't stay here if you speak Spanish instead of Catalan","We stayed in this hotel during New Year. While the hotel facilities are very good, the personnel was terrible to us and completely un-welcoming. We speak English and Spanish. Upon check in, we spoke to the receptionist in Spanish, but he refused to reply to us in the same language, insisting on using Catalan only (which we did not speak) or English. That was surprising, since Spanish is the official language of the region. Every time we spoke Spanish, we got a reply in Catalan which we did not understand.  We received the keys to our room, only to find that it was completely dirty. We returned to reception to get a new room, and got the exact same treatment: refusal to speak Spanish. During check out, we had the same problem. For example, we were waiting to collect our suitcases from luggage storage after check out, and the clients that spoke in Catalan got preferential treatment over us. We had arrived first but waited more than everyone else. During our entire stay, we felt like second-class citizens because we spoke Spanish instead of Catalan. We stayed in the hotel during the Christmas holiday season, and felt completely unwelcome, even hated. Other than this, the hotel is good, well located, with great rooms are facilities.",1,2019,01,03
35,"Filthy, filthy and unsafe","Granted New Year Eve was two days ago, currently noon on the second, the hotel was filthy around the pool and rooftop deck.  

Not just filthy but, unsafe, broken glasses on the roof top so that the seating area was not safe to occupy.  When the staff was notified the broken glass was still to be found, this hotel does not give a damn about customer care because it has abundant bookings due to cruises.

Besides glass littering the advertised rooftop veranda, the chairs were litterd with bottles napkins, full ashtrays and other party waste.  Best of all, the furniture was dotted in an abundant manner with bird droppings.  This hotel is filthy.

In the room we had room service clean the room between nights, the towels were wet that were folded and placed in the bathroom, given the rest of the experience, I would guess they simply refolded the towels from the floor we showered with and put them in the bathroom.

Carpeting in the halls were dirty with trash both upon arrival and the next day.  

Our room floor was dirty but, best of all was the dismissive attitude by the management we spoke to about the glass and filthiness.  This hotel is terribly mismanaged and filthy.

The Marina view is nice, too bad the roof top areas had so much trash and debris.  As someone who stays at Intercontinental, Pullman brand and the Renaissance here in BCN multiple times each month of the year I can assure you this hotel is trashy and has very poor customer service and deserves a two or two and a half stars.

In Thirty years on substancial international travel I have never met managers so disinterested in removing what would have easily cut my wifes foot the night before had we opted to look at the city lights or the stars.  I will never stay here again and if you do you are wasting your money.",1,2019,01,02
35,Outdated Corporate Hell-hole,"In the top two worst hotels I have ever had the misfortune to waste my money on. Please take notice of this review and avoid the same let-down. This hotel is soul-less, out-dated and unwelcoming. Its five stars on paper but you get a two-star service with rude staff at every turn. Let's start with breakfast which I imagine is worse ambiance than Guantanamo Bay prison. Staff are seemingly rushed off their feet, running around with walkie-talikes which blast around the high-ceiling room in the most awful way. The acoustics are like being in an air-craft hanger. I have no idea what they are running around for, they don't serve you and when someone attempted to 'set' my table they simply threw the cutlery and other items on the table in a hap-hazard arrangement, likening to a Picasso portrait. The food is dire, bland, disgusting and stale. The coffee comes from a machine which is constantly empty. It's just awful and I stopped going because it was a crappy start to the day. Next up, The internet connection in the rooms is a joke. I could barely write this review let alone stream anything. The rooms are a Lyncian corporate hell not updated in the last few decades. The made two beds for us in our room even though we are a couple, which is let's face it a mico-homophobia. The toilet has no toilet brush, there is one pair of slippers for the two of us. Both pools out of action, they refuse to put the air-con on in the gym. There are no cups for the water dispenser in the gym. They give you no water in your rooms and there is no way of using the coffee machine in the room as a result, unless of course you want to use the 3 euro tiny bottle in your mini-bar, which by the way is ridiculously expensive for cheap products. Room service is also very expensive for the type of hotel it is and I can imagine its just as bad as breakfast so I avoided that. The reception staff are patronising when you ask for any assistance or help and the whole reception stinks of cheap perfume which they pump around the place thinking it's welcoming. The building itself is bloody ugly too. Avoid avoid avoid! Don't let them ruin your trip.",1,2019,01,01

35,Very Comfortable stay ,"We had a very comfortable stay at the Grand Marina Hotel. 
Initially as you enter wasn’t too impressed but on hindsight and overall it was lovely.
Check in with Pablo was quick & easy.
No bell boy to show you around or take you to your room however we soon realized the hotel was easy enough. Nothing special in the room to work out.
The proximity to locations was easy to get around.
We purchased tickets from the front desk for the tour bus €30 a person for the day. Great value for money.
The Red & Blue routes, off & on the buses for the day which ended @7pm.
Picked up the 1st bus right outside the hotel and of course we got off there too.
There’s a lot to see in Barcelona. All passengers are given headphones, chocolates and guidebooks on entering the buses. 
16 languages to choose from.

MareMagnum Mall is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel.
Lots of shopping and restaurants, fast food and gourmet.
A 5 minute walk to the Columbus column & The Rambla, the vibe of the city.
Breakfast in the hotel is one of the best, serving Cava every morning, quite impressive.
Our room was always cleaned by the time we returned from our day trips.

Thank you to all the helpful staff especially Pablo, Anna & Julia. Wish we knew all the names.
Check out was easy too.
Happy New Year too All the Staff from the Palmer family.

35,Nice hotel but just falls short of 5 star,"Friendly,welcoming staff, excellent service, spotlessly clean large rooms. However,we paid for suite with marina view bit were given one on floor 2 and the view was obscured and the balcony overlooked a brick wall. Drinks very expensive and we were charged for use of the coffee machine in the room,

Breakfast was  very good and lots of choice.

All in all it was a nice stay but falls short of other hotels of similar price",4,2018,12,20
35,A good hotel ,"We stayed for two nights on a short weekend break to Barcelona. The hotel is clean, the rooms are large and the staff friendly. It’s a good hotel - it says 5 stars but then they charge you for coffee in your room which I don’t expect for 5 stars. The breakfast was very very good with a massive selection all well prepared. It’s a good hotel for exploring, a short walk to Las Ramblas with shops and restaurants. 
I think the hotel is probably better for business travellers, however we still enjoyed our stay. ",4,2018,12,09
35,Amazing Hotel and excellent staff,"I arrived early Saturday morning and the staff said they would upgrade my room and it would be no problem! 

Well the upgraded with to their top suites, amazing views.

Not only was the stay perfect but the staff were amazing, nothing was too much! Even the house keeping team were very helpful- thank you ",5,2018,12,09
35,Hotel stop over before cruise,"Stayed over night in this hotel before our cruise, you can see the cruise terminal from the hotel. The hotel was lovely we got upgrade and the room was very large lovely size bed very comfy had a view of Barcelona the bathroom was huge and all in all loved it. Our breakfast was included and there was lots to choose from. The only thing which tainted our trip was the taxi rank outside. If it wasn't for the fact that we had a lot of luggage we would have walked to the cruise terminal but we got a taxi out side the hotel (we should have asked reception what the going rate was) it took all of 5 minutes at a cost of 19 Euros that was scandalous and let a bad taste in our mouths. So it you stay there the hotel is great but be careful of the taxis?",4,2018,12,06
35,Very Nice,"Stayed here for one night, it is attached to the World Trade Centre at the port.  It is not far to walk to the centre and I had a lovely sea view.  The room was large and airy.  The bed was comfortable and I got a good nights sleep.  The bathroom was a good size and the shower was great.  The room was spotless.  The staff were all lovely and very helpful.  I had breakfast and it was very good and there was a good selection.  The wifi was a bit spotty and they charged for bottled water in the room, most places give you a complimentary bottle now.",4,2018,11,30
35,Good for Business,"The hotel has a good location at Barcelona Marina.
15 minutes walk from La Ramblas.
Quiet place if your room is not located by the Port.
Very good breakfast and friendly staff.
Housekeeping and room cleaning great
Luck in checking room maintenance.

35,Very nice,"Very nice hotel located at the WTC in Barcelona. 
The city centre can be reached on foot from the hotel. 
The hotel is a 5 star but the rooms are showing signs of use, but are still okay. Bed is in the direction towards hard, which I like so I slept very well. 
The receptionist was very friendly at arrival and check out was done swiftly. 
I did not try the restaurant during this stay. ",4,2018,11,24
35,"Missed information,  communication and room","To say I’d come back to this hotel would be a lie... Looks nice from the shell but deep down absolutely dreadful...

On arriving everything seemed ok at first but to only realise that a vital peace of information had not been mentioned to do with ‘City Tax’ 
What is city tax to be procise? only for the hotel staff to first say it’s a city requirement not charged by the hotel then to try to show us the hotel terms regarding additional costs... How on earth does this make sense??? No where in the hotel states anything City Tax... Complete SCAM... So after refusing to pay the Gentleman asked me for my credit card details after which they already took from me at the start of my visit... so if you think I gave him my details again then he had another thing coming....

Secondly... The handle falling off the window in the room, the jacuzzi bath with no jacuzzi then to realise bits of tile in my bath or quite possibly disgusting lime scale...

So if you still decide to stay here, Looks may be deceiving and definitely judge this book by its cover...

Finally look out for another 1* review from another paying guest a lot lot worse

BACK TO LONDON WE GO",1,2018,11,11
35,Great 4 night stay,"Loved the hotel and location staff were super helpful and friendly, reception ordered taxis and booked reservations for us no problem.
I would class the hotel more 4 star than 5 and I didn't agree with the coffee charge in the room but they removed the charge when I brought it up. There was a bit of noise on the corridor one night from some inconsiderate arrivals I presumed, the noise does seem to carry from the corridor to the room easily a few signs may help.  I would recommend the hotel based on our experience and will stay again when in Barcelona.",4,2018,11,10
35,Not worth the money,"Found it ridiculous that a 5 star hotel charged for water and tea that’s in the room, €3 for a cup of tea in your room, been to 2/3 star hotels with complimentary tea and water, very overpriced paid €550 for 2 nights, requested a sea view and was given a view of a metal cable cart stand on the first floor, it did have a good Location however there are many air b&b’s in the area and hotels for much cheaper, I splashed out on a 5 star hotel for my partners birthday but it was not worth it, wouldn’t recommend, definitely not for a tourist visit to Barcelona!",2,2018,11,06
35,Hotel I can’t recommend at all,"Air condition in the room didn’t work, the air con in the breakfast room freezing cold as in the lobby.
Ordered room service at night, three times in a row the meat {chicken and beef)  was raw, we had ordered well done. 
 Mattresses not good, my wife and I both woke up each morning with bad back pain.",1,2018,10,28
35,Very nice hotel and great location,"We were there for one night before a cruise. Great location. Super staff. We were upgraded to a suite because they had trouble finding our reservation.Very nice and modern rooms, small balcony and very quiet.",5,2018,10,27
35,Perfect and double perfect if heading for a cruise,"We needed a hotel pre cruise departure, while we still needed to taxi to the port from here it was the closest location.  It has great water views and views back to the city.

We were upgraded which was a nice treat and had a room with superb views!  All looked very impressive.  A nice walk into town for dinner and sight seeing and easy departure the next morning.

Lovely furnishings everything looked impressive and check in and out staff were VERY friendly.",4,2018,10,26
35,Soulless ,"Booked a 2 night stay for a weekend getaway.  Hotel was soulless, almost corporate/office like, cold.  No water in the room, bathroom was dirty, only tv channels were news, no lounge area, 2 teabags & they charge for coffee pods, rooms are dated, no light near the dressing table.  The hair dryer was comical, blowing in hair with my own breath would be quicker. When we checked out they tried to charge us for parking we didn’t have.  Wouldn’t stay again or recommend.",2,2018,10,23
35,Amazing hotel,"I've stayed here on a few occasions throughout the years and it's one of my favourites; really lovely setting in Barca's marina, tucked away from the city noise, with a big shopping centre within a 10 minute walk. It's also roughly a 10 minute walk to get to La Rambla as well and transport links to the rest of this wonderful city are good. The hotel is very modern and the rooms are very clean and comfortable. The staff have always been very helpful and the breakfast is delicious! There are also great views from the rooftop, where the outdoor pool is situated. I cannot recommend this hotel enough!",5,2018,10,22
35,Very beautiful panoramic view on the rooftop,"Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel has very beautiful panoramic view on the rooftop, the hotel is in very good location in the marina site adjacent to cruise’s port berthing area and easy to find transport (e.g. buses) to visit most of tourist’s attraction sites including shopping, the room was specious. The hotel is good for short time business but not good for leisure, the hotel doesn’t look 5-star to me, the restaurant and the pool are very small and the lobby with front desk looks like 3-star hotel",3,2018,10,11
35,Good as a base but nothing more,"The good points - modern hotel, clean rooms, good base for exploring.  The bad - a tiny restaurant for dinner, very poor bar service, no evening turn down, no free water in the room, no robes unless you ask, poor quality towels.  A good business hotel but no for leisure.",3,2018,10,10
35,Central Marina Hotel,"Stayed here again last night after catching the ferry to Barcelona from Mallorca. Perfect location 50 mtrs from the ferry and is a well priced 5 star hotel with lovely rooms. Ate in the bar as the restaurant, although moved, is still not very appealing! Bar food was good with a nice bottle of house red and a live piano player just finished our day well.",4,2018,10,10
35,Marion,"Beautiful hotel with fantastic views of the bay. A real wonderland at night. Exceptionally friendly helpfull staff. Rooms were bright, spacious and comfortable. The food wasafety lovely. Location was great.  It is a fabulous hotel.",5,2018,10,09
35,Not quite a 5 star but an enjoyable stay,"I stayed here with my husband for 3 nights. Check in and check out easy and quick. Nice clean room, although surprised to see coffee is at an additional charge and there is no free water included- i would expect this of a 5 star hotel.

Breakfast was enjoyable, with lots of choice but I did feel the tables were far too close.

Hotel itself is in a great position and everywhere is walkable. 

If returning to barcelona, I am not sure I would return as I am sure there are nicer 5 star hotels that have a bit more to offer. We had an enjoyable stay but if did feel something was missing.",3,2018,10,08
35,Not good enough for a 5 star hotel ,"It’s a nice, clean hotel with friendly staff with perfectly cleaned room every day. The room was very spacious with a nice port view. 
But ... in comparison with other 5 star hotels it was missing something... maybe included breakfast in the price or conditioner or free water or no extra costs for your coffee in the room ... just something that would let you know that they tried to make you feel great and went the extra mile. ",3,2018,10,02
35,Not very good for a 5 star hotel ,"Okey, so we were here as a couple for 10 days.
I ordered every extra package they had.
Romantic, VIP, tourist  etc etc.
When we arrived we had to wate  for 3 hours for our room to get ready.
We were supposed to get Cava and strawberrys in our room on arrival. Welcome fruit and much more.
We got none of it Even tough we complained for 2 days.
We paid something like 300 euros for all of the extra and got nothing.
After 3 days er started getting the stuff wich was really mediocre.
The people in charge of the vip if there are any. Should be fired.
They tried to make up the mistakes with free water.
I paid a total of more then 2200 euros for the hotel stay, and they gave us water. Like thats gonna do it.
Next time in barcelona we will choose other hotel.
The breakfast is great. The people there are Nice.
But they seem like they work in a 3 star.

35,Lovely Stay ,"FAB hotel, nice upgrade to a city suite. Hotel /room was really clean, friendly staff. Expensive breakfast at 30€ so we didn't try it. Disappointed at been charged for the coffee we used in the room, no instant coffee only pods, we found out these were chargeable at 1.5€ after 3 days  not good for a 5* hotel.
Location is just 10mins from the center...seems like miles tho when your feet hurt so be warned! 
Photo's  view from the top of the hill opposite to the hotel and view from second floor front facing room of the town
Top Tip:
Stop and hop was well worth the money, its a great way to see the city and it stops right outside the hotel. 
*Bring yur own coffee!!!

35,Had not got our reservation when we arrived,"We phoned on the morning prior to our arrival and a debit card number was taken to reserve two rooms.  When we arrived the next afternoon, they had no record of our reservation.  They found us two rooms and we had to wait a long time to have them cleaned and get our keys, wasting most of the afternoon waiting in reception, the views were not good, but rooms were clean and modern, I would imagine it would be a great hotel if you were going on a cruise from Barcelona.  Upon our return we found that the hotel had also debited our account for the deposit on two rooms when we had phoned the day before arrival, We have phoned and e-mailed asking for the deposits back, but we have yet to receive any correspondence back.",2,2018,09,17
35,Lovely stay with Marina View,I stayed 10 nights in an Airbnb in Barcelona. It was ok but I missed the comforts of clean towels and friendly staff. I moved to Eurostar for my last two nights. I woke up to a beautiful Marina view. I enjoyed the location and breakfast. Very friendly and helpful staff.,5,2018,09,16
35,brilliant hotel,"I stayed here in Sept 2016

It was a lovely hotel, the rooms were clean, tidy and imo they were up to date. 

The staff were so attentive and very helpful. There was a few excursions we wanted to do which were full / or had stopped due to the season change. The staff showed us ways round this and ultimately saved us a lot of money. 

We ordered room service too which brilliant - we ordered a fruit salad. Probably the most expensive one I've had but 100% the tastiest and freshest selection of fruit.",5,2018,09,12
35,Convenient Hotel for Cruises,"We stayed at the Eurostars in July prior to a cruise.  It is very conveniently located- you can get a  bus to the ship for 3E within walking distance.  You can also easily access the Barcelonetta or the Ramblas for dinner or other attractions.  The shower was one of the best and largest we have ever had and we had a room that was like a suite because my daughter was supposed to join us.  They have a nice outdoor bar upstairs with good views.  Note that although there is no nearby place to buy wine to bring on your ship, there is a shop in the terminal by your cruise ship.",5,2018,09,08
35,Ruined our honeymoon,"After seeing a lot of great reviews - we booked a City View Suite for our honeymoon a month in advance. Upon arrival we were made to wait 20 minutes before being given a room even though we had arrived at 9 30PM. We were given a 2nd floor Suite with a 'city view' which was just a view of the park - no city to be seen anywhere. We requested a higher floor which was not available that night so we had to make do with this for the first night. The second day someone rang and offered to switch our room to a higher floor but the bed will be two singles joint together(but you can't tell she said) - well of course you can tell - thats why we have king size beds. After refusing this - she rang again a few minutes later with an alternative which has a king size bed this time. Even though it was a bit of a nuisance to pack 3 suitcases again(we were there for 10 days) - we were delighted to receive a higher floor room with a better view. AFTER packing everything and moving upstairs - we realised that this room seemed to be out of operation for a while as it was not as clean as the first one. It was also missing the coffee table and a lamp in the lounge. We complained about this to the manager who said that our suite did not come with a coffee table - what an absolute joke. All suites have this facility as per their website and so did the one we were given the previous night. The manager insisted that this room did not come with a coffee table and that we had been UPGRADED to a Marina view the night before. We were adamant that this was not the case and we were given a City suite the night before which had a coffee table. After a lot of going round in circles - they brought us a coffee table and a lamp. To our shock - when we go to sleep at night - this bed is not a king size but a joint one of two singles - exactly what we denied in the morning before switching. The balcony had loose and broken slabs causing myself to SLIP and INJURE my back.

When we checked out - the girl asked us how the trip was and continued to do her work without paying any attention to the complaints or our poor experience. She didn't listen let alone fix things.

We had forgotten two photographs we purchased on a boat tour in the room so I called the hotel concierge to try and get them posted to my UK address. I am not claiming to be a postal services expert but a quote of 54 Euros to send something less than 50grams is ridiculous.

Please save your money and do not bother with this hotel. They have absolutely ruined our honeymoon.",1,2018,09,04
35,Cruisers convenience but.........,"On a one night Cruisers recommendation I booked this Hotel for a pre cruise 5 night exploration of the vibrant City of Barcelona.
It is high season and it is expected that the place is buzzing. The facilities of of a five star hotel are all in place. However the Hotel does not perform well.
The staff throught the Hotel give great service but there are too few of them.
 During the breakfast service the few wait staff work very hard to serve and are fantastic 
Because of the high turnover of guests the housekeeping is under great pressure. There is no time for finesse and tho' marginally acceptable it is obvious.
Maintenance is lacking in many areas sadly making a nice facility shabby. Wifi needs upgrading and more English TV channels would be a plus.
The pluses are a comfortable bed, amazing staff especially Jaumei Ferrer who made our stay in Barcelona an adventure to remember. His style, service and attention to detail are 5 star.
Breakfast in the hotel is a gourmets delight, the variety surpassed all expectation.
Food availability at other times of the day is limited.
We are well rested, enjoyed Barcelona but this is definitely a short stay Hotel.",3,2018,08,31
35,Convenient for boarding ships but not otherwise,"This hotel is essentially for people to board cruise ships or ferries, for one or two nights. We booked six nights as we wanted to revisit Barcelona before boarding our cruise next door. 

Have to say this is an unusual hotel. The room has everything you want, but with CAVEATS! More to follow.  There is a small TV, but can only find CNN and BBC, the only channels in English after 5 minutes. There is free wi fi but can only get gmail, Google map and a few others like Tripadvisors. Others from Google's search cannot be connected. There is a safe and even ironing facilities. Two small  bottles of water and two pocket sized tissues  are provided. The bathroom is fully equipped but the glass partition for the shower is symbolic only. We were embarrassed to make a mess of the bathroom floor the first night. The bed is comfortable and the room is neat though small.

The inclusive  breakfast must be one of the best we had and the serving staff very  attentive. You can even indulge yourself with churros!! Alas apart from breakfast for the rest of the day and night a small restaurant serves a small menu of unappetizing fares. Apart from that the alternative is to order tapas and drinks at  the lounge outside it,  or room service.

There is no convenience stores in the vicinity. Only one small eatery which serves breakfast and lunch. There are always taxi outside to take you to La Rambla or beyond to eat.  The manager and the concierge staff are always kind and helpful.",3,2018,08,31
35,Excellent! ,"I stayed here for a business trip to Barcelona. I had an excellent experience at the hotel. The rooms were great and the staff were pleasant. 

I got a room with a sea view upon checkin and the view was splendid! The room was very nice and upgraded to modern standards.

The location was amazing as it was a quick walk to la rambla. And a quick taxi ride to anywhere in Barcelona.

The internet was a bit shaky at times in my room but that might be because it was a corner suite. But it wasn’t terrible. 

The hotel pool is a bit small so it can get full quick but the views from the rooftop pool is amazing!! I would look forward to waking up and going for a morning swim and seeing the city come to life. The pool wasn’t as busy in the morning. Perfect way to start the day before a long day of exploring or meetings.

The staff were pleasant. Language was a bit of barrier with the house keeping staff but they were so genuine and nice. They went above and beyond in every aspect. 

Their room service was delicious and prompt.

I would definitely stay here again next time I’m in Barcelona! ",5,2018,08,29
35,Good location,"Positive 
The room cleaning staff was exceptionally good. The rooms were good in general and spacious.

Negative
Unfortunately there were many.
Starting in order...
1. We were made to wait almost 2 hours before we could check in. This was very difficult considering we were traveling with 3 children. While we were told to wait in the waiting room on top and take refreshments, the waiting room was dirty and there were no refreshments or staff to help us. After waiting for 2 hours no one bothered to tell us the room was ready. We had Go ourselves and inquire.
2. While the rooms were good, they were old. With hard sliding door, tv and phones not working properly. Flooring had gaps.
3. No one helped for another 1 hour to open the connecting door despite calling several times. House cleaning blamed front office and front office blames house cleaning for having the keys!
4. Room service menu is very weak.
5. Front office staff seemed either clueless or were not willing to help much during our stay.
6. Despite informing on everyday basis on the requirement of a late checkout even on a payment basis we were not helped. I had made this very clear in our conversation that my flight is at night and with children I would require a late check out. 
7. After long negotiations on the last day I was allowed 2 hours. This should have anyways been rightfully given without us asking considering 2-3 hours delay by your team to check in!!!

Overall we still enjoyed our stay in Barcelona but that was because the city was amazing. Our stay in your Seville hotel was fantastic but at Marina apart from the positives above was fairly disappointing.

In fact we considered staying for 2 more days if the rates were flexible with us already staying with you but the offer that was given was way to high to even consider!!

",2,2018,08,29
35,Mixed feelings,"We left this hotel with mixed feelings and one decision – next time we choose definitely another hotel in Barcelona.

Location:
This is a reason why many people choose this hotel – to be near the center, in the harbour with sea view. But only half of the building is a hotel, second half is a business and congress center – unfortunately the business offices are the half oriented to the sea – so there are just few room which has at least some sea view, most of them look to the offices. We choose the most expensive room called “Premium room” with balcony – what was our surprise, when we arrived and our beautiful balcony had a view to offices. Really nice holiday to look at work!

Breakfast:
The hotel has one of the best buffet breakfasts we ever experienced in 5 star hotels – in terms of quality and wide choice, great stuff etc.

Rooftop bar and pool:
There is a very small pool you can use but nothing special. If you want to relax in the evening on the roof top bar and had at least some sea view for a couple of minutes, you will be disappointed. The bar itself is crazy – just a couple of chairs and tables in the roof corner which are constantly full of guest, so no chance to use!

Service:
The stuff is smiling and willing to help you all the time, but the management of the hotel is totally ignoring their guest. There was a week taxi strike during our stay in Barcelona. This hotel did not react to this situation, did not try to organize any shuttle bus from and to airport, any try to help their guest! They are more loyal to taxi drivers then hotel guest which is totally crazy! The hotel location is really far away from public transport – you have to go by bus from/to airport, then by metro and about 1km on foot in hot weather in the sun with you suitcases passing the harbour. Not a nice trip in really hot Barcelona weather and the worst experience I have ever had in so called 5 star hotel! When we asked hotel reception how to solve the situation, they offered us to pay about 80Euros for special limo service, while average taxi to Barcelona airport is about 30 Euro! This is totally not acceptable in the hotel which wants to be 5 star hotel!  After my discussion with reception desk, they suddenly offered us to pay half of the price for transport as a hotel. Good for us, not good for the rest of guest paying horrible money to limousine service or passing the harbour with suitcases. 
If you spend in the hotel more than 1.000Euro for a couple of days, another 80 Euros is not a question of money, but a question of principle if the hotel cares for their guest or not. And this is something what the hotel top management is not able to understand.",3,2018,08,26
35,Should be classified as a two stars hotel,"The location is good and the rooms were ok. But the service was the worst we’ve ever had for a five stars hotel. When we arrived to the hotel we stayed outside for over twenty minutes for someone to help us with our luggage. Then, we were surprised that they don’t offer baby bed (crib). One day all the elevators were out of order for over an hour and we all had to wait in the lobby. And finally when we checked out no one came to take our luggage from the room. ",1,2018,08,23
35,Perfect for Cruise,"It did help that the entrance for our cruise turned out to be 100 feet from the hotel. Even still, great large rooms with cool views helped too. Friendly check in and we got an upgrade (wahoo). Excellent breakfast buffet. Huge variety. 

Concierge set us to an amazing restaurant. Very knowledgeable and friendly. ",5,2018,08,22
35,Great hotel and location,"Had a fantastic stay at the Grand Marina.  Excellent hotel in all aspects.  Smooth check in even though we were a little earlier than expected.  Our room overlooked the port area with sea view - modernly decorated and plenty of room.

Really nice terrace on the rooftop - one half is a sun terrace with beds and a moderate size pool.  Large enough for a quick dip out of the heat!  The second halfof the roof terrace is a bar which opens in the evening with stunning views over the city and marina.  We ate breakfast once at the hotel, and it was lovely.  Plenty of choice of food for all tastes.

As we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, a bottle of fizzy wine and strawberries arrived in our room on the first evening - very thoughtful.  All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful, which helps in in securing a fab time at the hotel.

The location is great, located at the bottom of Las Ramblas, overlooking the port and marina.  Easy walk to Las Ramblas and the nearest metro station, but also a nice leisurely walk to the shops and restaurants of Maremagnum within Port Vell.

The bar prices in the hotel are on the high side and we thought they were expensive compared to the local bars.  But none the less, this wouldn't deter us from returning here.  If we ever visited Barcelona again, this hotel would definitely be on top of our list.",5,2018,08,22
35,GREAT HOTEL NEAR LA RAMBLA AND THE PORT,"Loved my experience at Eurostars Grand Marina. The hotel has stunning views of the marina, cruise port and the city of Barcelona. 
Hotel facilities are very nice. Hotel decor Very modern. Good fitness center, Pool is not huge but big enough to enjoy. Pool terrace has wonderful views from cruise port. 

Service is second to none.  Staff very attentive to detail. We were celebrating my husband´s birthday and our 15th anniversary during our stay. They gave us an upgraded room with lots of natural light and with great views of the city and partial view of port.  On my husband´s birthday they delivered a Cava bottle and chocolate to our room, which I thought was very thoughful. 
Location is great too. Very near to La Rambla, Maremagnum,  and walking distance to Gothic Quarter and Barceloneta.  I would  definately stay here again...",5,2018,08,21
35,Very nice hotel the suites are stunning! ,"Stayed at the hotel between 29th July to 2nd August for a couples trip in Barcelona. My partner picked the hotel and chose for us to go in the suite with sea view.
On arrival to hotel it’s a very big grand building set just off the coast on a marina there’s big ships mainly cruise entering the marina.
Hotel reception was busy on arrival and could tell hotel is popular. We were quite surprised as it seemed some ppl were getting orange and champagne on arrival but we didn’t get offered this. We also found the reception staff not overly warm or welcoming more rushing to get us out the way. 
However we checked in and all was well. We couldn’t get into room til around 3pm so we went up to hotel bar and pool area which is on 8th floor. Bar and pool are good. Only issues are the price of drinks are bar is ridiculous - a lemonade cost around 7 euros. And the pool is quite small and there is NO shade. No umbrellas at all by any sun beds which was awful for me as I’m not big sun worshipper. 
Pool staff are very chatty and nice and the food there is decent. 
The pool area has gym and changing rooms which we used as couldn’t get in room both are decent.
Our room was beautiful it was very big like an apartment and we liked how it was laid out - it had two toilets and a large lounge area and big walk in wardrobe which I loved. 
It also had jacuzzi bath and big cosy bed. 
My only issues are it wasn’t a sea view we could literally see a tiny sliver of sea from our balcony and it has very thin walls. I could hear next doors conversations when in bed and their kids kept me up later on chatting and running around. Opposite us had a baby which screamed one morning and was so loud which is a shame as other than this room is so comfortable and clean. 
The cleaner was friendly and said hello and was more warm and smiley then you get in other hotels which I liked. 
Hotel location is good you can walk to las ramblas and there’s a metro locally. It’s also not far to the W hotel and barceloneta beach. 
We had breakfast on one morning which was buffet style and was very good lots of choice including halal sausages, gluten free bread and waffles. 
This hotel was reasonable for the location and beautiful room which lovely pool on roof and mostly friendly staff - except the reception. 
Next door to hotel on corner as you come out on right is a little office where you can hire an electric open air jeep I loved this! Jean who works there is lovely. Highly recommend for getting round the city - I’ll add a photo. 
Only big moan is reception staff need to be more welcoming easy to talk to and also there was a taxi strike in Barcelona whilst we were there we got told it was scheduled and it lasted the whole time meaning no way of travel unless in foot or by public transport - we felt hotel should have emailed us to warn us as when we arrived. As we felt stranded at airport we had to get metro which we had no clue on how to do. It took us around 2 hours to do what would have been 25 min car ride. Hotel were aware of strike as was planned so why they didn’t warm their guests we do not know. Or why wasn’t on website I’m unsure. 
These are my only probs. Otherwise rooms hotel location food cleaners all fab! ",4,2018,08,14
35,Good stay,"I have stayed with My family for 4 nights. The hotel is very modern and new, the rooms are spacious and luxurious but the location is a bit far from la Rambla as you need to walk for at least 10 mins to reach the crowded street. But overall it's a good stay and i loved the hotel.",4,2018,08,14
35,"Location, service & gym","I had a very pleasant stay again at the hotel. There were actually two major reasons why I had chosen again this hotel and those were location that offers very good access by walking to centric locations of the town and you may have great morning walk or jogging heading the shore line up. Another one was related to gym - it’s good and views from the top floor teracces are just awesome. This time I experienced excellent customer service as I had to print, scan, sign and sent some materials. Julia Salvador at front desk made a major positive impact to service. Hotels around the world are not so different as premises - people make the difference.",5,2018,08,10
35,Break,Without a doubt a beautiful hotel in a wonderful city. Service and food first class. The Hotel had a bus service right outside it (If you see totally relaxed) to take you to centre of city. Situated over the Marina it is in walking distance of the beach and city centre without feeling the hustle and Bustle of the city. The best bit leaving the city and relaxing in a room full of quality and a bathroom the size of some hotel rooms. This was just a standard room but a quality to put all over hotels to shame ,5,2018,08,10
35,Good service and breakfast,"The breakfast buffet had a lot of options especially for children. My daughter loved the pancakes. The staff is very friendly and always ready to help. The hotel is 5 mins walk to LA Rambla and the hop on hop off buses stop at the hotel so it’s easy to explore the city
The sea view is very beautiful, you can see the cable car and the cruises porting at the ports. The city is very beautiful too",4,2018,08,08
35,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service! ","Excellent stay! The hotel is beautiful and the staff is extremely friendly and resourceful. I’ve never stayed in a Eurostar’s hotel...to say I was impressed is an understatement. Everything was beyond my imagination. 

The breakfast is excellent, very European (for any Americans reading this)....don’t be discouraged as the food is great and fresh! 

We stayed during the taxi strike and the hotel staff was so helpful to us as we were trying navigate around the city. Once you get the hang of it, metro and the bus are very easy. 

I am big on hotel cleanliness and customer service and they nailed both. I will definitely be back. 5 stars ",5,2018,08,02
35,"The hotel is beautiful but the service is very poor, not 5*","I had a very disappointing stay here. We were staying for 4 days, and unfortunately there was a taxi strike and no uber/cabify for the duration of our trip. As we were travelling from the UK, we had no idea of this until we arrived at the airport and had no way of getting to the hotel. I think it would have been courtesy of the hotel to warn guests travelling from abroad, as this was not a great way to start our holiday. The strike was initially supposed to be for just two days, however it did continue for our whole trip. The hotel did not put on a shuttle to the airport or provide any private hire companies to help. On the day before departure we requested a wake up call for the morning as both of our phones had been stolen and we had nothing for an alarm or to tell the time. This was promised, but the person on reception forgot to write this down so we received no phonecall. When we woke up we were extremely rushed which was not ideal as we still had to get to the airport via public transport. When checking out they attempted to charge us for minibar items when we had not taken anything. The hotel recommended we get the bus to the airport. This involved a 20 minuet walk with 10 suitcases, during which we witnessed two people be mugged, and felt very unsafe ourselves. The walk actually took us about an hour as the wheels on one suitcase had broken so it had to be dragged the whole way. We were extremely exhausted and stressed by the time we got to the bus stop, only to find that the hotel had sent us to a bus stop which was closed. I am just so appalled that the hotel did not put on an airport shuttle service for guests during this time, especially as a 5 star hotel. Also, by forgetting our wake up  call  and sending us to a closed bus stop we could have missed our flight.",1,2018,07,29
35,"Perfect Hotel, Perfect Stay","We have just checked out of this hotel after a ten night stay. All we can say, as people in the hospitality industry too, this is one of the best hotels we have stayed in. The service is second to none. The lady that checked is in on arrival, sorry I disn6't get her name, was fantastic and is an asset to he hotel. It was an excellent first impression. Throughout our stay we were constantly grented by warm friendly staff. The hotel runs like a dream and everything we asked or sought was dealt with swiftly and efficiently. The concierge gentleman is an absolute star. He was dealing with so many unjustifed complaints from guests about he taxi strikeep in Barcelona, what did these guests think he or anyone else at the hotel could do about that.... He should be reward for his upbeat attitude, professionalism and work ethic. I am sure he worked as 16 hour shift to try and help all the guests at the hotel. The room was beautiful, spotless and the housekeeping team do a wonderful job. For my wife's 40th I organised room service breakfast and champagne, it was perfect and delivered on the dot as requested, such a nice touch for the team member to greet me by name when I opened the door. Also a huge thanks to the lady who cleaned up a mess in the roof pool toilets after a child had an accident, team members like her deserve to be rewarded for tasks such as that. All round a huge thanks to all at the hotel  for making my wife's birthday and our trip to Barcelona a really memorable one. We will be back.",5,2018,07,29
35,"Lovely, Updated, Attentive Service ","A first trip to Spain with my 18 year old niece started here. While we arrived early our room was not ready but we were welcome to rest in the lounge area.  We had a very comfortable stay, location was fun and we enjoyed the 4 day visit to Barcelona. ",4,2018,07,29
35,Beautiful Barcelona Hotel,"We made an excellent choice in choosing this hotel before taking off on a cruise. The cruise port is visible from your room. Had a computer glitch when we arrived and had to wait so our room was upgraded to a suite. Staff is very friendly, accommodating, and courteous. ",5,2018,07,27
35,"Fantastic hotel, lovely staff","Booked through another company so got a good deal on this hotel. We were late checking in, about 11:30pm but the desk as still very much open and the staff were extremely friendly and polite, aswell as speaking excellent english. We had a superior sea view room on the 5th floor and the view was amazing. Rooms are big and beds, while twins, are also big and very comfortable. There is a mini bar which is rather expensive but what minibar isn't so we didn't use that. Bathroom is very big and shower is powerful and easy to use. When you are walking around the hotel and see any staff, whether it be cleaners, porters or desk staff, they always greet you and ask how your day is/where you're from etc. We could have felt a bit out of place as two 18-year olds by themselves on a lads holiday, but we couldn't have been made to feel more welcome. Even letters delivered by our tour company were personally delivered to our room. If I ever come back to Barca, I will be staying here, that is for sure.",5,2018,07,16
35,Luxurious,"Superior room was large and very comfortable indeed. Great powerful shower and virtually silent air conditioning. Unfortunately windows did not open but as it was so hot outside, this wasn’t an issue this time. Fit our of room was top quality and really solid. Only strange thing I couldn’t work out in two nights: how to switch off the bedside lights!?! I unscrewed the bulbs in the end. Breakfast was a big selection and on the whole high quality. They are busy and it was full but the staff were extremely helpful and accommodating. There are also outside tables which are lovely. Some of the food was had passed its sell-by date though...notably fresh pineapple on the turn and carrot crudités that were so dry you could light a fire with them. If the management cast an eye on these issues, it would improve the experience. Otherwise a happy stay and location wise, a lovely place to be. 
",4,2018,07,13
35,"Good hotel, couple of issues","Overall it was a good hotel. Clean and friendly staff. We were given a free upgrade. Only a few issues with hotel, these were that the location isn’t the best, the ports and offices next to hotel create a lot of noise, the room was not well maintained and had a leak from shower head in bath and the door to shower didn’t close as it got caught on tile floor. Overall it was a nice place but more a 4* than 5* in my opinion. ",4,2018,07,12
35,A + Overall And ESPECIALLY CUSTOMER SERIVCE,"1. The place is very clean, high end hotel quality that is priced very very well.
2. Customer service is on another level entirely.  My electric bike was stolen and OSCAR WAS HERO. Words cannot express the help this gem of a man did for me. Truly appreciate him",5,2018,07,10
35,Average hotel. Nothing special.,"I'd say this hotel is worth of only 3 stars. It felt like a bigger Novotel. Rooms are very typical big scale hotel with boring interior and with it came with the usual impersonal service, long wait for them to send up your luggage to the room and long lines to get seated for breakfast - and they didnt seem to have enough seating capacity available in the morning as they ran out of tables for the guests. I paid for the breakfasts as part of the room but never got to use them. Check in was very long for a booking that was fully pre-paid. Location is a bit inconvenient for a holiday. Nothing impressive. Average hotel. Far from a 5 star hotel by a mile.",3,2018,07,09
35,Weekend Stay before Cruise,"My family and I were going on a Mediterranean cruise and decided to stay at this hotel for the few days before we had to sail.  The hotel is very nice and clean; the rooms are spacious and comfortable.  We were able to add a bed to the room for my daughter who joined us in the last minute for our trip.  We checked into the hotel early on a Thursday.  Our room was ready due to the fact I had booked the night previous not realizing that our flight would bring us in the next day.  But the mistake allowed us to check in and use the room as soon as we arrived.  We were put on the 4th floor with a view of the back of the hotel and terrace area.  The room was very spacious with a king size bed and a pullout couch for my daughter.  Unfortunately the couch bed was always out so we didn’t have as much sitting space, only a chair in the corner.  The bathroom was spacious, tub/shower in the same room as the toilet and the outer room had the sink and counter.  There was plenty of space for us to get ready each morning.  We had breakfast downstairs on floor 1.  There were plenty of options and space for everyone to sit and enjoy.  They had tables outside as well.  From the hotel we were able to walk to a hop on hop off bus and then take a tour of the city.  We also walked to the Ramblas and old part of the city which took 15 to 20 minutes.  The staff was always courteous and helpful.  You can catch a cab right outside of the hotel.  Sometimes they would be waiting and others you had to wait till one showed up but the wait wasn’t very long.  It was nice being near the port for our cruise.",4,2018,07,09
35,Phenominal,"Truly a spectacular hotel with very kind and courteous staff, a beautiful room, and a delicious breakfast! Perfect for anyone looking to visit Barcelona in style or stay close to port before leaving for a cruise!",5,2018,07,09
35,"Yes, this hotel is a 5-star hotel!","This hotel was fantastic!  Our room had the most beautiful city view of Barcelona ever, the staff was very nice, we were greeted with champagne, the rooms were comfortable and the location couldn't be better!  Definitely coming back to this hotel when in Barcelona!",5,2018,07,08
35,Fab stay,"Great hotel and great stay. All staff were lovely, helpful and efficient. Restaurant was good with fantastic food and breakfast provided  everything you could need. Concierge were efficient and porters and front desk were first class. Hotel is in great position for sightseeing and we will definitely stay again. ",5,2018,07,07
35,Not what it seems,"Family Suite is just a pullout couch when we were told is two rooms, raise out cost by 50%, about 600 euros per night for very average place, pool sucks, nothing like the photos, 24 for bad burger at the pool, so over priced. Not what it seems online.",1,2018,07,07
35,Very good place to stay,"I came for business and had to stay for one night in Barcelona. I liked the hotel because

- the good location close to the city/ Ramblas and to Marina and Beach 

- nice room

- small pool, good fitness room

- very good breakfast, also outside 

Bad:

- Fitness room opens 7.00 am - wanted to do sports at 6.00 am before my business day starts. I went running in the marina and to the beach instead and that was great.",5,2018,07,06
35,"Perfect location, beautiful hotel",If you get one of the sea view rooms you are in for a treat! The only thing that could be improved is the area in front of the entrance. there needs to be a garden and/or a private area in front the hotel.,4,2018,07,05
35,Pre Cruise Stay,"Chose this hotel due to the convenience of the port.  Hotel only 15 minutes from Barcelona airport, this was a two night stay prior to our Mediterranean cruise.  The hotel is in a good location close to Las Rambles, shopping mall and the hop on hop offf Bus is only a two minute walk away.  The reception staff are welcoming and Pablo went out of his way to find me a room with a view of the ocean.  The room was not quite ready for us, he gave us a card with 2 complimentary drinks either at the pool bar or the bar on the 1st floor and we were to return in 10 minutes to get the room card. The room was excellent, a corner room over looking the port. Jacuzzi bath, separate walk in water fall shower with jets. Nice toiletries complimentary slippers. Mini bar, crisps and chocolate to purchase. Complimentary tea and coffee plus two bottles of water.   Very clean throughout the hotel.There is a main restaurant which we didn’t use but did eat at the terrace bar on both nights, the food was cooked and presented well. As you leave the restaurant there are very large glass  containers filled with marshmallows, gummy bears chocolate pebbles and Jelly tots. The outdoor pool is on the top floor where there is a bar for snacks pizzas drinks etc,  there is also another bar on the terrace when the pool bar closes this also serves food, great views of the city and Segarda Familia in the distance.
The breakfast in this hotel is one of the best breakfasts I have ever had. You can eat either inside or outside. The food is well cooked and there is a egg station.  This breakfast is five stars  including Bucks Fizz.
If I were to return to Barcelona I wouldn’t hesitate in booking this hotel its clean comfortable the staff are very polite and willing to help. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.
",4,2018,06,30
35,Not 5 star,"Really not a 5 star hotel. No robes in the bathrooms, tacky packets of tissues rather than a box of tissues over priced breakfast and drinks at the bar (€36 for a Grey goose!) Service not great. Not great surroundings but as long as you don’t mind the sound of cruise liners while you try to get to sleep you should be ok. If you want to use this hotel as a stop over while you wait to join a cruise then fine but otherwise find somewhere else in Barcelona!  ",3,2018,06,29
35,Average,"Stayed here with friends for two night before a cruise, was luckier than the other my room had an incredible view theirs didnt. The hotel staff are not very friendly, esp in restaurant and the bars.the room was basic at best and over priced compared to better hotels nearby.",2,2018,06,29
35,Please read this ...,"First of all I surprised when I arrived the hotel , there is something wrong in the checking In , I arrived at 1:00 and they been told me that my room will be ready after 45 min, so me and my son decided to stay and got the drinks they offered us .

After more than 1 hour I got down to the Reciption and they told me it will take more 5 min but it’s seems they don’t have a good time . After 15 min they gave me the keys and I informed them that I’m need my luggage becouse I need my medicine inside it , the receptionist told me that it will takes 5 min ! 
 I stayed in the room more than 2 hours waiting for the luggage but NOBODY bringing them !
I don’t want to go more for the furnitures and the room it’s self ( this is a different story) it’s small and not nice except the view it’s nice .

The model of the  telephone in the room since 1992 old and nothing mentioned or instructions for dailing to anywhere! Even I tried to call from my self phone Directir to the hotel and ask for the manager and they told me she will call you back and no response!

Later on I went down and talked to the Reception and after going 2 times up and down Ifound the manager. 

I told her about what’s happened and I can see everybody asking for the manger.

I’m very disappointed about the hotel and never ever will saty or book in the future.",2,2018,06,29
35,Perfect stay,"We had a sales meeting there with a group of about 50 people.  The organisation was very good,  all staff from the hotel was very friendly and helped us whenever we need. Nice bar on the top of the hotel offering beautiful view to Barcelona. Very good breakfast and lunch a la carte.",5,2018,06,24
35,Luxurious,"We had a superior room on the 5th floor over looking the city. It was very spacious and comfortable. The bed and pillows were great. The bathroom/shower were very good with good toiletries etc. There was an ironing board and iron in the wardrobe. Also a smartphone for use during our stay. There was a wedding party during our stay and we heard nothing. Great location, near Las Ramblas but away from crowds.",5,2018,06,19
35,Pre cruise hotel,"We stayed here for one night pre cruise. It is an excellent  choice if your cruise departs from the World Trade dock. Varied breakfast which was included in our tariff.  Easy walk to Las Ramblas and we also walked back from Famila Sagrada . We were able to get late check out and consequently just walked our bags over to cruise check in desks at around 12.30.  Would definately use this hotel again pre cruise for the World Trade dock, you just cant get any nearer!",5,2018,06,18
35,Great views over the city ,"We stayed here for six nights, the first night in the junior suite and the following nights in the marina suite as we had booked a deal that entitled us to upgrade according to availability. 

Both rooms were clean and the beds were huge and very comfortable. Our marina suite had a great view over the city and marina, the junior suite was much bigger (with two toilets and a walk in wardrobe!) but with a view onto office blocks. We were told by staff that none of the junior suites have a view, so if this is important to you, don’t book this suite. However, if you prefer to have lots of space the junior suite is better. 

The breakfast was really nice and offered lots of selection everyday. There was even the option to have cava with your breakfast! 

The staff were really helpful and friendly and they were able to give us information about the tourist spots etc.

The location is about 10 minute walk from the bottom of Las Ramblas, and about a 20 minute walk to the beach. There are lots of restaurants in both directions along the way. 

The pool area was really nice with plenty of sun beds for everyone and great views over the city. ",5,2018,06,17
35,Stay was good ,Was alright. Expected better to be honest. Had a weird shaped room and rang up wanting a balcony got a different room was fine the size was fine but balcony was in looking. Roof top is really nice the pool is tiny. 1 beer is 9 euros at the bar absolute rip off. Gym looked good. Wouldn't stop here again for the price it's nothing special to be honest,4,2018,06,16
35,Great location excellent service,"We really enjoyed this hotel, as it was away from the touristy Las Ramblas area, yet a short walk from everything.
Our room was beautiful, spacious and very clean. The bathroom and walk-in wardrobe was perfect. we had a view of the city and ferry-harbour, which we loved. The room's windows and doors seal very well, so we had no noise that bothered us, even though ferries and boats came and went all day and night.
The staff were fluent in English and were extremely helpful and friendly. There were taxi's 24/7 and the Tourist bus stops were a mere 100 m from the hotel entrance.
We did not have any meals at the hotel, so cannot comment on that. 
We will most certainly recommend the hotel to anybody.",5,2018,06,15
35,Great views and great value for money,"This hotel was not necessarily my first choice since I admit not being a great fan of larger Hilton-type hotels.

This having been said, I must admit that my experience was way above the initial reservations I may have had.

The welcoming is very gently and humane. The rooms are way above standard in comparative pricing.

But what cuts it most is the beautiful bar area on the mezzanine that extends on the terrace.

The food is actually surprisingly good and the cleanliness is totally spotless.

The location is really interesting since it combines a walking proximity to both the Ramblas and seafront promenade.

All in all, this hotel packs a great value for money and a more-than reasonable return on pleasure.",4,2018,06,13
35,"Très Bon hôtel,","At the reception there is very qualified people. The rooms are big an new. Amazing terrasse at the 8th floor with gym, sauna, pool and bar. The Hotel is located at the port, five minutes walking from la Rambla, the center of night’s life of Barcelona.",5,2018,06,11
35,"Good location, ok hotel. Avoid waterside rooms!","We stayed for 5 nights in July. The hotel was clean, staff were lovely, pool was small and busy but was big enough for a quick dip. We managed to secure two sunbeds near the pool on the one afternoon we chose to be in the hotel. 

Food at the pool bar was ok, nothing special but hit the spot for a snack. Breakfast offerings were really good; lots of choice and always plenty of Cava for Mimosa's. 

The only real disappointment was that we were given a 'scenic' room as we stayed for our wedding anniversary. We had a view out over the water and the hills to the side, but this was basically looking over the port. We woke pretty much every morning to large cruise ships moored up, playing music and welcoming guests on board and using their very loud horns. This was really annoying. I'd advise to avoid any rooms on that side of the hotel if possible. Or pack ear plugs.",3,2018,06,10
35,Perfect Pre-Cruise Stay,"My daughter and I stayed for one night prior to our cruise.  Our plane landed in the morning and Ivana was more than accommodating in allowing us to access our room early.  We found our reception upon arrival to be warm and helpful. I am a travel agent and tend to scrutinize staff more than the average traveler and was very impressed.

Our room was immaculate.  It was well equipped for a comfortable stay, the bed was comfortable and we were provided with good quality toiletries and little extras.

The location was exactly what we were looking for.  We wanted to be close to all the sites with easy access to transportation, but quiet at the end of the day for a good rest.  I was traveling with an injured foot yet was able to easily walk to shopping, restaurants and sites.  There are always taxies right out side but we chose to walk around the corner for a more creative method of travel.  We hired a rickshaw driver for the evening and morning.  Our driver was Joell and he was wonderful.  He picked us up and dropped us off very close to the hotel.

I would highly recommend upgrading your room to one that has a living room area and view.  We were very pleased with everything and hope to return in the future.",5,2018,06,09
35,great hotel with the best roof-top bar of Barcelona,"What an amazing hotel this is! The location at the end of the harbor makes it very special. The great staff and the very well rooms make it a place to stay with pleasure. Renting bikes is a great option to do to explore the city. The hop-on-hop-off bus leaves almost in front of the hotel. The bar on the roof of the hotel is so great!! The food, ambiance and food/drinks are amazing and give you the feeling that Barcelona is at your feet! ",5,2018,06,05
35,Nice Stay,"I arrived at the hotel in the afternoon...very convenient as it is close to the airport, like 15mins drive. I requested for a early check-in but i guess they didnt have room went to visit barcelona with the red bus which is like 3 mins walk outside the hotel thanks to the concierge team for the info. When i reached in the evening i had told them i booked for a twin room but they gave a king room on the fifth floor which was not good as i was sharing the room with my mum. They then changed it to a twin on the second floor which was a nice room with a balcony but the view was a bit bad..imagine getting happy about a view from tge fifth floor n then coming to second floor. Anyways the room was nice and tidy they really have some good housekeeping staff..i was only upset about a guy from the restaurant i guess his name is Ignasi, this guy is really very rude. I felt as if he is working there for the sake of it. He should understand he is in hospitaly industry and should not be so rude, he wasn't only rude to me he was also rude to all his staff in front of the guest's which really set's a bad image. Apart from that all the staff are really nice both the Anna's, bibianna, rana, Daniel and the night manager really thanks for making my stay memorable..",4,2018,06,05
35,A very comfortable stay,"We stayed for 3 nights in May’18 and this was easily the best stay during our fortnight long Europe trip. The premium category room was very spacious for a family of 3. Hotel has a great location- close to the beach, nice view and with all the amenities including instant cab on demand and HOHO access. To top it, helpful staff particularly the concierge who would walk an extra mile to ensure you plan the day well. Highly recommended.",4,2018,06,02
35,Disappointment ,"Booked this hotel for my family, and they promote if you booked for two nights they offer a cultur ticket, and they been asking about it for 2 days and no results and I have called the hotel and ask them and they say they will reach out for my family to pass it to them which never happens.
Even I have bought with them the VIP package which has no value as they describe as my family asked for what we paid for and they have to keep calling them for 2 hours.
They offer %10 discount if u book in advance 7 days which I did but I never get it! 
A waste of time and money, this hotel rowing my family vocation and for sure I will never book it again or recommend it to anyone. ",1,2018,05,30
35,Great Hotel!,"We stayed for one night after disembarking our cruise. It was very close by taxi from the cruise port. We arrived at 9am we were able to checkin and receive a room right away.  The superior room was huge, with a separate closet space, a huge ensuite bathroom, and sitting area in the bedroom. The only complaint I had was that there is half a wall that covers the stall so when you’re showering the water will soak your floor and toilet.  The room was super clean and the bed was very comfortable.

Just outside the hotel you have access to taxis, rental bikes, and the hop on and off bus. Everything is accessible by walking as well. This hotel is well located! I would highly recommend it and would stay again!",5,2018,05,28
35,Great again,"Stayed there for 2 nights in 2012 and decided to return this year for F1 race. It was great again. Excellent and attentive staff, especially at the Reception. Rooms are well equipped and very comfortable. Selection of wines and tapas at the bar is very good. Located few minutes from La Rambla, overlooking the port and only about 20 minutes max to the airport.",5,2018,05,18
35,Room with harbor view recommended.,"Big, stylish and nice breakfast buffet. We had view of harbor and that was great. Stayed six nights and saw lots of small and big ships passing by. Staff is perfect and we were welcomed with cava. Hurra! Internet is included but unstable.",4,2018,05,17
35,Awesome Hotel,"This Hotel was one of the better ones i ever stayed at. Room was very clean and luxury-like, spacious. Hospitality was impressive, although i only stayed 1 night. Regardless, very responsive and attentative from the moment i walked in to the moment i walked out. If/when i come back to Barçelona, i will be staying again! Wish i was staying longer to actually enjoy the amenities they have to offer within the hotel. ",5,2018,05,14
35,What a SPECTACULAR Hotel View,"This was my first time staying at a hotel in Barcelona and thank God it was such an amazing experience. The hotel was easily accessible. The view and service was beyond spectacular. The restaurants and bars were all sensational. It is perfect for business, family, and/or pleasure!",5,2018,05,11
35,Good location.,"Nice hotel, spacious clean rooms and comfy beds. Beside the port where cruise ships come in.
Fab rooftop swimming pool. Mojitos are fab!! Good location, 10 mins from Las ramblas, bus stops outside hotel.",4,2018,05,07
35,good,"the rooms are big and clean,the breakfast in the balcony was great,staff little bit slow in English, good price for our extended stay.great location near to Ramblas, close to the shore about half an hour walk.",5,2018,05,07
35,Poor customer service ,"We stayed at the Grand Marina hotel for 4 nights. The place showing signs of aging with poor maintenance. Pieces of floor wood were broken which can cause injuries if you are barefooted, the balcony door  was broken and staff claimed that it was “normal” you can see pictures and decide yourself if that’s normal.  The air condition system is poor, it constantly blow air and does not break off when the set room temperature is reached, we wake up middle of the night freezing. We informed the staff and the problem was not addressed. Customer service is very poor. Definitely not going back to this place.",2,2018,04,29
35,Wouldn't stay again!,"Chose this hotel due to its 5* star status and everyone elses reviews of a good location... It is a 5/10 minute walk from the bottom of Las Ramblas, but that road is very long and Barcelona is huge so this hotel isn't a good location unless you're getting on a cruise ship. Room was lovely, but we did book one with a balcony and breakfast included and got neither! Great views from the rooftop bar, but there wasn't actually any bar staff up there or any other customers! So no atmosphere & we had to make our own drinks & take them up there. We also had an interconnecting room, and the door was so thin you could hear the neighbours conversations & their phones going off. On the plus side, it's less than 15 minutes from the airport & there's a taxi rank outside. Overall, i wouldn't recommend. ",3,2018,04,27
35,Nice location,"Room was comfortable and clean. Enjoyed the location on the marina. Walkable to Gothic Quarter.  My only complaint is upon check in our room was not ready and we were told it would be 1 to 2 hours as the former client had just checked out. This was perfectly fine with us, however it was actually about 4 hours. We were exhausted after the over-night flight and a little frustrated by the time the room was actually ready. It would have been better if the front desk had said it could be 4 hours in the beginning.",4,2018,04,25
35,Paying 5 stars for something you'd expect in an average 3 star hotel,"At the reception it was a mess. We waited almost a hour. There was one guy handling the queue, while he received one phone call after another. From what i've heard, it were usually hotel guests complaining about things that were not working.

The breakfast restaurant looked like a cheap all you can eat restaurant. People were waiting for a table, quite a mess too, in my opinion because of the way the tables and the food was positioned. If the weather is not ok and you cannot sit outside, it's way but way too small. 

The room is very spacey, looks nice. a bit outdated in my opinion, but that's a matter of taste. However, 2 bags of tea and 2 of coffee is a bit stingy. Doors and climate control not work good in every room.

I had to insist to not be dropped in a smokers room. I guess 1995 wanted his smoking room back. 

Summary:

a big plus is the location: near the cruise ships, not far from the airport and on walking distance of Ramblas (important tourist spot, although I found it an overrated **** hole with tourist shops selling cheap ****, poor restaurants, beggers, pickpockets, drug sellers,etc). 

Besides that, it's a typical 3 star hotel, but 5 star prices. It's ok for € 100 / night, but it's not worth € 250 + / night.",1,2018,04,24
35,Day light Robbery,"I have booked suit with sea view and I got a room which spacious but overlooking the Port, ships coming and going, noisy and smelly area, not what I expected, however I cut my stay 2 days less, I had to leave, but the hotel charged me with the whole booking, ie 1000 Euros  difference was charged to my credit card, the hotel claim its the policy and no other way but to charge for the whole period. it is total robbery.   this hotel welcomes you fine but you can never leave peacefully. if any one sit in the reception for an hour and watch people checking out. you will hear shouting and people angry, its obvious that some thing wrong in this joint. be careful, they make your holiday hell.  Also they charge 5 Euros for ice buckets !!",3,2018,04,23
35,Good but somewhat overpriced choice for Port Vell area,"Basically a good hotel, obviously convenient for WTC facilities or more generally if you need to be in the Port Vell area. I am not sure if any rooms have attractive harbor views - mine looked out on an inner courtyard and some office space. In most respects the room was good. Although I did not end up using it I was pleased to see that the room came with a steam iron and ironing board. There was an electric kettle and a couple of instant coffee packets. Two bottles of water were provided each day. Good air conditioning (if anything too effective). The room has a power adapter which you can use for free and take with you for 10 euros, in case you forget to bring one with you.

No problems with wifi. The hotel room was reasonably quiet and clean. 

A few criticisms. First, there were really no convenient power outlets in the room. There were two sockets on either side of the bed at floor level under end tables; I had to get on hands and knees to use either, and in one case had to pull out the plug for a lamp on the end table. The only other accessible power outlet was in the bathroom next to the sink, where there isn't much surface space. To use the electric kettle, for example, I had to bring the kettle to the bathroom sink and rest it on the sink edge. 

Second, the hotel offers a breakfast buffet but this was ridiculously overpriced if you don't have breakfast included in your room rate (something like 27 euros for one person). I nonetheless had breakfast one day for reasons of convenience, but I found the hotel staff in the breakfast dining area scatterbrained, disorganized and even impolite, which left me with a negative experience of the hotel and is the main reason I am not giving the hotel 5 stars and considered marking them down to a 3. 

Third, the hotel has three elevators but probably needs a fourth. It often took a long time to wait for an elevator.",4,2018,04,22
35,Group visit,"Came here with a group of friends celebrating a stag do. Staff were very attentive and check in was hassle free giving the size of our group. We booked triple rooms which consisted of two king size beds and a sofa bed. There was plenty of room for three of us. The bathroom was extremely spacious, it was separated into two parts. The first part consisted of a double sink and bath, the second part through a sliding door consisted of a shower, toilet and bidet. You had all the amenities, shower gels, shampoo, hairdryer and fresh towels. For three people I thought this room was excellent value. 
The location is ok, you are about a 10 minute walk from Las Ramblas, which is literally a long walk up take a right and then a left and you’re there. The beach is a little farther approx 30 min walk or a 15 min taxi dependent on traffic. Overall this was a nice hotel, nothing overly special 4 star max, use the hotel bar at your peril €7 a beer and €11-15 for a gin and tonic. 
",4,2018,04,20
35,Fantastic City Break,"Overall a very pleasant stay, with no complaints!

Once we arrived we were checked-in straight away - We had booked a standard double room, however from what I gathered through our conversation, this wasn't ready, however a different room was, which had two singles pushed together. They tried to pass this off as an 'upgraded room' - I'm not sure if it was but we weren't too fussed.

Hotel rooms were great and very well sized. Big room area with a balcony which overlooked the shopping area bay. A bathroom with his/her sinks, a bath and a shower. Also there was a serperate dressing room area. Room was always very clean... but every now and again we could smell 'Weed' - I believe some of the rooms are for smokers..

We only got breakfast one morning (At a cost of 18 Euro each from the reception desk) - Which is slightly expensive but the food choice was great on the morning. 

Free Maps available at the reception desk, as well as free water in the room. There is also a small pool on the roof, and a good sized gym.

Also, they do allow slightly later checkout... Its meant to be 12am, however we were allowed to stay until 2pm.. Although I'm pretty sure the woman next to me was allowed to stay until 5pm... I couldn't be bothered for the argument though.

Would recommend all in all!",5,2018,04,12
35,Hardly 5 star ! ,"I travelled in advance of an event being arranged in Barcelona for my company, checking out the hotel which has been booked for our group of over 30 people ..and finding restaurants etc ... the hotel is a 5* hotel, with the service of a 2* ... both food and drink orders on 3 separate occasions in the ‘corners’ bar were wrong, incredibly poor check in and check out (the system failed on both occasions) and the person on the desk was unhelpful and almost rude when we enquiries about amenities, later when we found the safe in our room had failed and couldn’t be opened they took over an hour and a half and for myself to phone up a second time before someone was sent to try and open it .. then there was the events team who forgot they were meeting us, and the ridiculous amazing of money they want to charge to open the bar on the top floor for our guests ... on the plus side, breakfast was good, a fantastic variety of food, and the breakfast staff were very helpful, and smiley ... seriously regretting booking this hotel at the moment, very impersonal attitude  and behaviour from the majority of the staff ... I do not recommend this hotel at all ....",2,2018,04,09
35,Excellent location ,"I stayed in this hotel two times for 5 nights,beautiful rooms,great breakfast buffet.
Perfect location you can walk 5 min to La Rambla st and restaurants.
Rooms are large and very clean .
If I want to go to Barcelona again I choose this hotel again👍",4,2018,04,04
35,Excellent ,"Nice greetings at the reception, large rooms with a perfect view to the harbour, 5min from La Rambla and restaurants however do not forget to eat in The Corner at the hotel, excellent tapas in the bar menu, would start ordering 2 each because the are not small :-)",4,2018,03,29
35,Next to the sea and 10 minutes walking from the Ramblas,this is not a cheap hotel but quet with perfect service nice spacious rooms and if you want to rock the Ramblas is within walking distance. Mostly you will walk one way to the city on the way back after your RAMBLAexperience beter use a cab. Ask for the cab in the bar as outside during closing hours is a heavy fight to catch one.,5,2018,03,28
35,Great location ,"This place is lovely. Beautiful rooms, great breakfast buffet. Wi-fi that works well in rooms. Perfect location, can walk to the main tourist area but set away from the busy streets. I liked watching all the ships/ferries and cruise liners in the harbour from the hotel. Would defiantly stop again. ",4,2018,03,25
35,"Nice walkable location, clean and spacious room","We had wonderful stay at Barcelona Euorostars Grand Marina, check-in was very fast. We were able to drop off our luggage at the front and go out to visit the city in 15 minutes after arriving. Location is safe and a lot to do and see. The only issue is distance from the beach, it is a long walk. Over all perfect for us, for sure will come back.",5,2018,03,21
35,good hotel and location,"rooms are very clean and tidy , beds comfy , nice bath and shower , hotel bar nice but a little expensive , breakfast has the lot but 33 quid but would fill you up all day very good food , location to all the city on door step , bus tour and taxis outside , you can also walk to the main streets wihtin 10mins for food and drink",4,2018,03,20
35,Very comfortable ,"I stayed at this hotel three nights and on a business trip. I was very pleased with my standard room, which was full of amenities, large and very comfortable. The jacuzzi in the bathroom, in addition to a large shower, was a plus. The hotel looks new and the staff are friendly. I enjoyed the gym and the roof walk with a spectacular view. Reasonably convenient for a vacation as you can walk into the ramblas.",4,2018,03,20
35,Fantastic location for the harbor or business meeting with quick access to airport,"Spacious rooms in large hotel with a very comfortable feel. Great Wi-fi and meeting rooms with windows providing view on the harbor. Also, the fitness room is very clean, well equipped and roomy. The breakfast buffet is delicious. Every staff member is very helpful and multi-lingual. Very well done !",5,2018,03,17
35,The place to stay in Barcelona,"Location: at the marina (👍) as well just opposite of the La Rambla - difficult to beat
Service👍Great
Rooms - very spacious and very bright -👍
+ despite that it is in the very best location - but not actually on the street - no crowds 
around you when you coming in or out of the hotel.But literally in 90-120 secs seconds u r on La Rambla with all it vibrance 
Hence ... you have both of the worlds ",5,2018,03,14
35,Nothing bad but hotel just average ,"Visited here for our honeymoon in March 2018

Location : Fantastic, really close to the main part la rambla. A little noisy as our room was facing inside the complex and the fountains they had throughout the day were irritably noisy. Not the hotels fault however. 

Rooms : lovely but I wouldn’t say they cover the name “Superior” Our jacuzzi bath didn’t work and other than the beds being ridiculously comfortable, I would of expected more from a 5 star.  

Staff : we only spoke to one female when we stayed here and that was the lady that checked us in, she was lovely. Very friendly and spoke very good English. 

Restaurant & Bar : we didn’t eat here as we looked and thought it was a bit expensive. We did have some cocktails and drinks downstairs. I thought it was expensive for the quality of the cocktails and they force dropped popcorn on us with our cocktails which we presumed were complimentary and then charged us for it.

Although the location was amazing for our first trip to Barcelona, I probably wouldn’t stay here again as I think it was too expensive for what it is. ",3,2018,03,14
35,Wonderful Stay,"I stayed here while attending a conference last year. It was, in general, a pleasing experience. 

Location: close to La Rambla, and there is a bus stop just across the front door. 

Hotel service: when they were busy, response time was a significantly slower. Otherwise, quick response time. 

Breakfast: wonderful! 

Staff : very professional and helpful. 

Out of topic: be careful to use taxi service in the evening. One taxi drove me around the city and doubled up the meter.",4,2018,03,13
35,Not a five star,I have stayed in better 3 star hotels then this i found the superior room not superior at all the balcony had no table and chairs the tiles on the balcony moved when you walked . Their was scratches on the wooden floors . They offer free tea and coffee in the rooms no English tea and on 2 tea bags . 2 Half a lagers and a babys strawberry milkshake 23 euros is a joke . The lobbys carpets need a good clean i would not stay here again,3,2018,03,13
35,"Not clean, poor food quality - not 5 stars, slightly delapedated","There for 2 nights, in superior room.Room is not very clean, paperwork old and dirty (brochures, roomservicemenu, menu‘s in restaurant). Lunch in restaurant: lunch for 7 people: very long waiting times, all maincourses were cold, fish was overcooked. Lobby area first floor: dirty. Impossible to turn nightlights off in room (pulling plug only option). Not enough power plugs in room. High likelihood of flooding when showering in bath. Breakfast choice was good.",2,2018,03,08
35,Poor service,The location was convenient and rooms are good. The customer service was not as good as they claim. Calling room service and reception for bottles of water took more than an hour and never reached the room.,3,2018,03,04
35,very good hotel,"we was there in dec 2017 for 4 nights two couples we enjoy much from the room , very clean and with balcony also breakfast was excellent service was good too . we will come again to this hotel in the future  even if it’s a little bit far from the main street in barcelona ",5,2018,03,02
35,Good Place to be in because of View,"Was there for short Two day Trip
Place is nice and My Room Offered beautiful view of Bay and City.
Place is showing a signs of aging/low maintenance though
We did face challenge with Language , but still found staff of ok.
WIFI speed was super
Had all basic amenities expected from such Hotels.",3,2018,03,01
35,Very good ,"It’s a very good and clean hotel, the prices are good (4 days 385€ for 2) and the massage was amazing. The staff was very nice and welcoming. The room was spacious and it had a nice balcony. I recommend 👌🏽👌🏽",5,2018,02,23
35,Great view and location,The hotel is in a very good location and has great view of the city and the sea. The workers are friendly and rooms are very clean and comfortable. Only down side to it was room service food. We ordered multiple times due to work and being tired and they never got an order right. Also the same plate would get smaller and smaller each day.,4,2018,02,20
35,Great expectations but sadly the reality didn't live up to them,"for a 5 star hotel I wouldn't expect damp smelling corridors but on our floor there were maintenance men out on both days and the smell was damp and fetid. On booking in we were assured that if the child's bed was not already made up it would soon be. When we got back from dining out it still hadn't so i phoned down and asked for it to be sorted. 405-50 minutes passed and it still hadn't been sorted. so i went down to reception. 25 minutes later it was made up by house keeping.

As way of an apology reception sent up fruit and a bottle of champagne. Then they phoned to make sure it had arrived ok. This woke up my daughter :-(

Breakfast was lovely. Views were great. Room was exceptionally large

Overall though i wasn't impressed as our stay had been spoilt already",2,2018,02,16
35,Great hotel in great location,"Whilst a moderately expensive hotel, it provides great location at the harbour that is convenient for seeing most of Barcelona via public transport and the gothic quarter by foot, whilst being in a quiet neighbourhood for rest and the ability to shut out the city noise.

The superior rooms are good sized and provide lovely views over Barcelona or the sea. 

The hotel staff are helpful overall and try to meet requests. Room service is good.

Breakfast is buffet style with considerable choice, yet the Kitchen is often slow in cooking breakfast items that are not already in the buffet. The waiting staff at breakfast are good and attentive.However the persons in-charge of accessing breakfast lack warmth and are needlessly officious and stern (not a welcoming way to start each day).

The under-utilised bar apparently has a piano player that did not play on the 3 nights I attended out of 7.

I would recommend this hotel for anyone wishing to explore Barcelona and still enjoy a quieter setting.",4,2018,02,14
35,Close to the cruise port and downtown,Great hotel in a good location. We had a very nice room on the 7th floor overlooking the city for a two night stay. The room was nicely furnished and comfortable. There is a kettle and a selection of tea and two instant coffee packs which we used in the morning. There were two small bottles of water provided free of charge daily. We were going on a cruise and this hotel is a short walk to the cruise bus pick up. It is also a short walk from the Drassane Metro and Las Ramblas. All in all a great location for a cruise or a visit to Barcelona. We traveled from the airport to the city using the metro so this hotel is a great choice for a city visit using public transit. There is a rooftop pool and sundeck but the pool was closed as we were there in the off season. We still sta in the sun on the roof. The hotel is attached to a business center which is convenient for business travelers. We did not use the restaurant but it was busy and seemed to offer a good dining choice although a bit pricey. We did have coffee at the bar which was a nice place to sit and relax.,5,2018,02,08
35,Book directly!,"This hotel is totally underrated. Price is very reasonable and the drawback is you have to walk 10mins to shops or restaurants. In return you get a great view over the harbour. 

They give free room upgrades if you book on their website directly! Our room was upgraded and wow!!

The breakfast was incredible. I expected much less. Best part was the incredible friendliness of the staff at breakfast, a lady called 'March' or something with M. 

Check in and out was very efficient, same as the valet. 

I'm starting to regret writing this review as it will drive demand and prices up!
",5,2018,02,08
35,Great hotel for business,"It’s not too far from Barcelona’s large convention centre and it’s situated as you can guess in the marina. A modern hotel, simple in decor with a small reception area. Staff are pleasant, helpful and represented the hotel well.   Breakfast was good, lunch ok and in evening I recommend trying a local restaurant. My room was modern and clean, a bit small for my liking. Wasn’t too thrilled with the lack of effort of the cleaning service each morning but all in all a good time. Would stay again!",4,2018,01,31
35,Fantastic!!,"What can I say about this Hotel?

Check in was a breeze, the room was fabulous with panoramic views of the harbour, the bed was huge the amenities excellent, the Hotel is located brilliantly in the harbour so a short walk to la rambla, the Beach, the aquarium and the shopping centre.

I would most definitely stay here again if I return to Barcelona without any doubt.",5,2018,01,22
35,Great business hotel,"Great business hotel, pleasant stay. Reception a little understaffed,. but otherwise very attentive. Rooms are good, if bland. Location is OK, very close to ferry terminal though a bit of a walk from main attractions. ",5,2018,01,22
35,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel in the Portugal area of Barcellona. Large rooms, polite service, very clean. Polite service. Easy access to the centre of the city and amenities. The area is secure and very well controlled by local police. Highly suggested for holidays or business trips. There is a good cocktail bar at first floor. ",5,2018,01,12
35,"Convenient, Clean, Bright, great staff!","In town for business I wanted something close to Palau Sant Jordi and convenient to walk into town since it was my first time in Barcelona.  The Grand Marina was an excellent choice.  Super convenient to walk into town and only a 7 Euro ride to the arena.
The rooms were big, bright, modern and clean.  Great internet.  Great breakfast, and the staff on all levels was excellent, especially the front desk.  They got me a room early after an overnight flight and when I had a few minutes on the last day slipped me into a last minute reservation at the Sagrada Familia.

Maybe not the ""old and charming""  or ""small and intimate"" experience one might be looking for in Barcelona but there is a lot to be said for great showers, lots of room, good internet and terrific staff.  There is always a line of taxis outside since its near the ferry terminal which made transportation very easy (no uber available while I was there).",4,2018,01,10
35,OK,"This hotel was not perfect, but it was pretty good.

First impressions were not that great. I was greeted as I got out of my taxi by a lobby boy who stuck very close to me in a rather creepy sort of way. I think I could have managed to find my own way from the taxi, which stopped right outside the front door of the hotel, into the hotel. I didn't even have much luggage with me so didn't need any help with that.

But other than that, the hotel was pretty good, though a little pricey for what you get. My bedroom was a good size and comfortable enough. The bathroom looked nice, but the shower hose had a leak in it which meant that I ended up spraying water all over the floor when I showered.

Breakfast was excellent, though quite expensive if it's not included in the room rate.

The location is not bad. The immediate vicinity is rather dominated by ferry terminals, but walk for 10-15 minutes along the seafront and you're in the pleasant little district of Barceloneta, where there are many good restaurants.

The hotel has a swimming pool, but be aware that it's an outdoor one and is only open in the summer.",4,2018,01,01
35,Great location for cruisers,This hotel was nice and clean.  Check in was easy and we were treated well.  The staff was helpful and answered any questions that we asked.  This location is great if you are needing to go to the cruise terminal.  DO NOT try to walk to the cruise terminal from the hotel.  It is NOT as close as it seems.  We took a taxi and it only took 5 minutes to get to the cruise terminal.  While driving to the cruise terminal we passed people that were walking with luggage in hand and they looked miserable.,5,2017,12,30
35,Fabulous hotel,"We booked a last minute brawl for our anniversary and booked Eurostar’s Grand Marina we upgraded to a suite and my oh my we weren’t disappointed.
Stunning views of marina and cruise ships, excellent facilities, luxurious surroundings, courteous staff. Amazing knowledge from the concierge. Wonderful rooftop pool with masseur on site offering stress relieving treatments. Definitely worth looking at if staying in Barcelona. 

",5,2017,12,28
35,5 Star hotel,"Pretty good hotel. 
We felt welcome from we enter the reception.
Meanwhile check in we got cava.
Receptionist show our room, we got a family room....2 room totally 100 sq 🙀 with connection door....really nice equipment at both bathrooms with jacuzzi in each.
Breakfast in not just some of the best I have seen in Spain but the best. Counted 30m buffet....but not only quantity, also quality food...some of mine favorites cold smoked salmon, jamon iberico, lomo, Brie, different Spanish cheeses, fresh fruits bar,...really nice.
When you eat there is a pianist playing the piano or guitar....

10min walk to metro or Rambla. 

No noises from the ferry’s. 
Great hotel...worth the money. ",5,2017,12,15
35,Safe and enjoyable stays,"I have stayed here a few times now, enjoyed the bar, breakfast, roof top pool area that looks out over the city and the staff is very helpful with touristy info. 
Easy  walk to some fun restaurants and shopping. 
Access to hop on hop off bus is just a block away. 
There is a safe to store valuables. 
 I felt safe walking in the area, but as in any big city ,  I only bring ""out"" with me what I absolutely need, the rest goes in the safe. 
Only negative, the sound barriers are not great ,lots of echo, can hear neighbors and outdoor sounds as if the window was open. Not really the hotels fault, just how its constructed. We didn't lose any sleep over it, just FYI. 
The desk staff speaks very good english but that isn't the case when out and about , do yourself a favor and learn at  least a few words of Spanish { or catalan } It will come in handy , shows you are at least trying , a respectful thing to do.",5,2017,12,01
35,Absolutely Gorgeous! ,"One of a kind experience of Barcelona! The rooms have gorgeous views of the Marina, with the perfect blend of nature's finest mountains, water and greenery. The view from the rooms at night is also breathtaking. 

The pool is tiny, but definitely fun! The gym was great! The rooms, service, and breakfast are outstanding!! 
Walking distance from the city's busiest street La Rambla! 
Highly recommended for couples and solo travelers, loved it! ",5,2017,11,30
35,Hola Barcelona | 1st visit,"Visited the City for a quick overnight stay to celebrate my wife’s birthday with friends. The hotel is incredible in size and sits within a prime spot on the marina. The hotel room was ideal with everything that’s needed, iron, robes, toiletries to incredibly comfortable beds. The coffee quality and lack of milk in the room, plus charge for ice, let me down slightly for a five star. The bar was lovely with music on the Saturday evening, the location was the best part. This hotel has plenty to offer, but feels more like a large corporate establishment, not hitting all the five star points that just finish a place of nicely, although would return. ",4,2017,11,26
35,"Nice, comfortable Hotel","The Grand Marina Hotel is located 5 minutes from the Ramblas, very close to the Marina with quick access to the exit for the airport. 
The Hotel is new, comfortable, room is quite big, and in a good shape. 
Breakfast was nice, 
Recommended for business purposes.",5,2017,11,26
35,A good hotel that could do more,"Good quality hotel not match by its service. Both check in and checkout extremely slow and inefficient. On checkout, hotel had computer failure. After taking in email contact with a promise to forward the bills, hotel was not heard from for a week. After numerous emails to the hotel I finally got my bill. Poor and curt service seems a hallmark. Not likely to stay in this hotel again.",3,2017,11,24
35,Great hotel,"We stayed here before commencing a cruise. Great venue, lovely staff, excellent amenities. The view was from the 5th floor was across the front entrance, cruise ship dock to the left, the sky ride was great to watch. A walk along la ramblas was very easy to get too. The antiques market lovely to walk around. Lots to se and do within easy reach.
We had the tapas and a bottle of wine for supper, it was amazing sitting outside on the patio under the stars. Breakfast was great, the choices very varied including lots of gluten free items. 
I can recommend this hotel and will be making a return visit soon.",5,2017,11,23
35,Great hotel with excellent amenities,"Great 5 star hotel and excellent value. Very comfortable, clean and with pretty much all amenities a 5 star hotel offers. Very friendly staff. Great breakfast for a decent value. Wifi was good, rooms are big and comfortable although they need better bedding. Great jet bath-tub, A/C is strong and works amazing. Area is a bit isolated but close to the center and the Port Vell... Room service is fast and efficient. Stunning roof top area with excellent views, pool, lounge, gym and sauna! I will certainly come back in the future.",5,2017,11,15
35,very nice hotel and staff,"I had a problem with my reservation and it was handle very profesionaly and kindly by the staff especially Alava. I really apreciated the service i received.
Hotel room was very good. breakfeast is good.",5,2017,11,15
35,Very nice business stay,"I stayed at the hotel for almost a week because of a conference. Lovely visit, slept and ate well and especially the staff was very attentive and courteous. I ate at the hotel restaurant most nights, enjoyable. My room at fifth floor was spacious and quiet. Only minuses: it took very long to get warm water (I left the water running for a bit to get warm water) and one one night, Saturday, there was noise from the disco downstairs. In fact quite often when I slept in city center in Barcelona I would wake up to early morning noises from the street - none of that here. It was also easy to get taxis and the hotel is well located. I would visit again!",4,2017,11,12
35,Amazing hotel,"We arrived at hotel today and got upgraded to a suite, our suite is amazing you would not get better anywhere,it's outstanding.its right next to the cruise ship port as we go on a cruise in days time so very convenient.",5,2017,11,11
35,"Best location,poor service ","The hotel is good,big room comfortable bed and pillows,excellent excellent excellent location,modern simple design,small lobby,small small funny pool,
Nice reception staffs,but very bad service room system,if u need something (even they forgot these )u have to pay five euros for each time,its very Unbelievable and unfair,😳and clean room service is not good 
So for its location I'd suggest the hotel and I choose again",4,2017,11,11
35,Beautiful stay,"Spent a lovely couple of nights here, the most comfortable beds and pillows. Spotlessly clean and with everything you could need in the room. We had a family suite which was wonderful. Gorgeous jacuzzi bath and powerful shower. Very helpful and pleasant staff. Didn't eat here. Nice extra special touches, chocolates in room, sweets for the kids when you order drinks in the bar. Overall worth the money. Great location too for the sights.",5,2017,11,08
35,Nice location and very spacious room,"The staff are very friendly.
The location is very close to La rambla (5 min walk). I stayed in Premiere room 706 which has view to the city. The room is very big with a sofa bed and a balcony. The furniture looks used and the hotel needs a renovation but don't get me wrong, the furniture is clean. TV screen is very small. Wifi is good.
No power plug near the Water boiler and you càn see where I had to put it :) !!! 

Tips:
Premiere rooms has only two views. Firstly I was placed in room 530 where it has a view to the offices in the trade center. Ask for the city view. Much better.
",4,2017,11,08
35,Good hotel with very friendly service,"I stayed there for a convention and did in general like the place.
The room was nice however for the target group business traveler not suitable. Why? I had to crawl on the floor to find an outlet to charge my devices... No  USB docks etc. , this is so 1990...

I had breakfast too there whereas I was a bit disappointed. The overall impression of the choice was great but the bacon was soft, the scrambled eggs not really properly done and the sausages I could not really eat after one bite.

All in all some room for improvement, so I might go back to the W next time around.

",3,2017,11,07
35,"Spacious Suite, Centally Located","The place is too big for one pax traveller for me at that time, with various rooms, like TV, walking in closet, shower, dry and wet toilet, and even spacious king sized bed. Totally comfortable. The check in is strict after 2-3pm . ",5,2017,11,06
35,Great Location,"Were staying 2 years ago for few nights. Great location, nice decor, great small pool on the roof. I think bit overpriced drinks at least I remember paying a near a tenner for a pint of cider (Bulmers or Magners doesn't matter). The bar was about to close so whatever.. 
Coming back to Barca next month, but choosing another side of the city - has no plans to stay at the beach this time of the year.",4,2017,10,24
35,Barcelona Short Stay,"this hotel is ideally located, has good amenities with friendly helpful staff.  My room was on the six floor with a balcony which overlooked the front of the building, and offered a wonderful view of the city.  the Twin room was very spacious with separate dressing room,  The bathroom had dual sinks, bath and shower facilities.  There is a well stocked mini bar, also tea/coffee.  There was very little noise at night, slept well.",5,2017,10,24
35,Disappointing,"Came for a weekend break in the city, decent enough hotel but staff not very welcoming or accommodating. Room was very noisy with a cruise liner next to my window. Room was not kept very clean and bed was uncomfortable, apart from that spacious.",2,2017,10,22
35,Anniversary Trip,This was first hotel we stayed at upon arrival in Barcelona. We were blown away the welcome at reception. They spoke english well which made it easy to communicate. We got complementary champagne and chocolate strawberries. We spent 3 nights. Room had view of the port - amazing. The mall is just a walk away. La Ramble is also a good walk away. Best choice ever. Rooms and bathrooms were well kept and cleaned. Wished we could have stayed longer. Wish I remembered the staff's names. Define 5 stars,5,2017,10,20
35,מלון מקסים,I would like to thank you for the perfect hospitality you have enjoyed exceptional service at the bar reception have amazing employees keep them excellent breakfast no doubt I will return to Barcelona I will get you to the hotel Thank you Shirley Ben Avi,5,2017,10,19
35,Has many advantages ...read on,"First the location. On the man made area with either views of the marina and the city or the quad formed by the world trade centre on the seaward side. 
So it is some ten minutes easy walk to Las Ramblas, about the same to the shopping and dining area across the dock area and both hop on hop off bus companies start outside . Some say never convenient for picking up your cruise but unless your ship is docked next to it you still need a taxi, as you would for other hotels. 
Our check in was very good, efficient and welcoming. We arrived about 11.00am, Check  in is 3.00 pm  and we were offered a room but not one with city/ water view so we waited and had coffee and croissants on the terrace on floor 1. A lovely room with views and a terrace,  708 was available by 13.00 hrs and was clean, comfortable and spacious, just as you would expect of a 5 * Hotel. The absence of bathrobes was a disappointment. 
We were in Barcelona as part of our golden wedding celebrations and were meeting up with family who were to join us. 
The staff in the hotel were very attentive and on our first evening with just the two of us, they made it a lovely occasion with great service. So thank you for this, a very thoughtful touch. 
Breakfast, whilst expensive at 27€ was excellent with a very good choice, well presented and you can eat inside or outside on the terrace but watch out for the seagulls swooping down for food....an eagler to scare them away would be a good idea which we have seen in other restaurants. 
The roof top terrace with its very small pool offers a bar with lite bites and little shade from the scorching sun but gorgeous views. 
So out of the hustle of the city, and for us a really good experience, not universally enjoyed by others in our party but we feel that your allocation of room is a very significant andalso  the quality of housekeeping on your floor, but in a hotel of this standard management should ensure this is standard.",4,2017,10,17
35,Brilliant. Amazing views and stay,"On arrival, recieved a warm welcome from the receptionists and some champagne and further to that we got a free room upgrade! Room was very comfortable, facilities amazing and the pool was a decent size too. Would definately recommend the hotel and would stay at Eurostar hotels again. ",5,2017,10,17
35,Convenient and very nice!,"Stayed here because we were getting on a cruise ship and it was very convenient.   We thoroughly enjoyed the convenience to everything and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.  In fact, we were very impressed with the entire stay as we had not expected all that we got.  Would def stay here again.  ",5,2017,10,11
35,Recommend,"This is a nice hotel located near the dock.  Lovely decor.  We tried to book the room online through the hotel's website and when we clicked the final booking, it did not give us any confirmation that the reservation was made.  We waited for a confirmation email and never got one.  Not wanting to show up and have no room, we started the booking process again.  This time it worked and we got a confirmation code, but did not receive the email confirmation until after our stay there.  When we arrived, there were two rooms booked under our name.  So be careful with their website -- they obviously have some technical issues.  The fellow at the desk was not friendly about their mistake and he acted as though he could not understand how this could have happened.  I finally had to tell him that he WOULD credit us for the mistaken booking, and suddenly he got helpful and friendly about it and gave us credit.  After that, things were fine.  The room was nice.",3,2017,10,11
35,Perfect site,"Nice hotel with best venue, close to city Center but quite. It's the perfect combination of  being in Barca and withdraw a bit from all the hectics! Nice hotel bar and pool site on the roof with best view in town",5,2017,10,08
35,Could do better,"+Great location and fantastic views from the room
+nice breakfast and restaurant
- although rooms are renovated, still quality could be better
- no soundproof, can hear every noise of neighbor rooms
- room card demagnetized 3 times in two days...",3,2017,10,06
35,Good hotel right at the cruise port,We have stayed here twice.  Very nice hotel but pricey.  The first time we had an excellent meal in the restaurant but this time the restaurant has changed and we didn't like the set up as much.  Welcome drink at the cafe.  Great location.  Outside bar area in the courtyard very noisy until 3 am. which echo'd through to all the rooms.  Wish we had a water view.,3,2017,10,01
35,Pre Cruise Hotel,"Recently stayed at this Hotel for 5 nights August 2017 prior to joining a Mediterranean Cruise. Requested a early check-in and was in the room 644 by 12 noon. Front desk staff always helpful and obliging.
The room was city facing with excellent views of the waterfront and Columbus Monument which is the start of the les Rambles. The décor of the room was modern and the storage reasonable. The bathroom was very modern with a in-bath shower and separate vanity/dressing area.
This hotel is within reasonable walking distance of all the main attractions with the Hop on Hop off bus situated right in front of the hotel.
My package included breakfast which was very good with a wide variety and excellent service.
The roof top terrace has excellent views of the city centre with a pool, snack bar and separate evening bar overlooking the lights of Barcelona.
My only complaint would be that the Queen bed was only 2 singles pushed together which sometimes would separate if you rolled the wrong way with 2 single bed doona's. As the hotel was right on the Marina sometimes you could hear the Smaller Cruise Ships arriving early morning more so the sound of the beeping noise of the fork lifts unloading the baggage.
Overall an excellent beginning to my cruise.

35,Rest hotel,"So nice to finally find a comfy quiet king size bed in a great spot.Dissapointed we couldn't get a room with a water view but the hotel is magnificent. Large rooms excellent bathrooms ( the best in Europe ) comfy, quiet,nice.",4,2017,09,18
35,Molto's ,"Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel, WTC Barcelona, I have to rate this one very low because of service of cleaning the rooms. Had to wait an hour after being gone all day for maid service. Completely unacceptable to have to go to front desk in order for room to be cleaned. ",2,2017,09,18
35,Good stay over night hotel,"Quite good. Clean, nice staff, really GOOD coffee☕️☕️. The lounge was a bit cold😬😑and to noicy. Breakfast was way to expensive 😵poolarea nice and clean. A really good location if you don't want to live in the middle of everything, like noicy traffick, people aso aso😜. 5 min walk to marina with good restaurants and to the start of La Rambla, and monument cristoffer Columbus monument.",4,2017,09,18
35,First Class,Excellent location great service and superb food and drink   Made to feel very special by the very professional and friendly staff Managed a couple of things missed on previous visits Columbus Column with wine tasting fantastic views and a cable car ride again with stunning views of Barcelona witnessed the Independence Rally with an estimated million supporters certainly seemed like it €25 for a Single Barrel Jack Daniels was expensive from the bar menu an Americano €5 we had breakfast across the road Americano was €1.50 Full English breakfast with coffee and fruit juice €12 Excellent value too    ,5,2017,09,17
35,Great hotel prime location,"Hotel has the best location .. close to la ramblas street and close to maremagnum shopping center .. aquarium is walking distance too
The hop on hop off bus has a station outside the hotel which is very convenient if you are going to use that bus
Room is very clean .. i got city view with balcony qhich was really nice and amazing view both at day and night
Staff are very helpful and friendly
Specious rooms
Highly recommended",5,2017,09,13
35,Nice hotel but €21 for a G&T ..!? ,"My son and I stayed at the hotel for a short break. We were given a nice room with a view of the harbour, very spacious and good quality furnishings
The shower flooded the bathroom floor when used - I reported it and the maintenance team made a fix to the bath surround (overcoming a design flaw) but it still leaked leaving the floor wet (but better than before the repair) 
The pool is small but the roof top area is nice as long as the cruise liner isn't billowing diesel fumes in your direction 
We avoided the expensive breakfast but decided to have some nachos on arrival. For €9 we were served 3 finger sized filled nachos...not what we expected. Nice but more suited to a celebrity masterchef
I was annoyed to be ripped off in the bar. Beer was around €6 which was ok and a cocktail menu detailed Manhatten etc for €14. I thought I'd go for something simpler and cheaper a G&T. It wasn't on the menu. It was very nice but I was annoyed to be charged €21 for the drink. I queried it and the staff embarrassed said it was a 5 * hotel. 
Shame, if they were more sensible with the pricing it would be given a higher rating",3,2017,09,13
35,Post Cruise Pick,"I had decided to stay in Barcelona for a couple of days after disembarking from a 
Regent 10 day cruise. Not knowing anything about the city and looking many options on a map I decided that being on the water but close walking distance to the city center was a good strategy and the Eurostar Grand Marina fit the criteria as well as my budget when searching on Kayak.com. I was very impressed by Eurostar. I arrived very early in the day because I had to disembark the ship at 8:45 so I arrived at about 9:00 and was not at all sure I could get early check-in. Not only did I get early check in but I got an upgrade (without asking) to a great 2 room suite with corner windows. Perhaps it was because of my Platinum Amex. The location was perfect, close walking distance to the landmark Columbus statue which is at the end of Las Ramblas, the long busy market street. After walking up Las Ramblas, there are great shopping streets and a busy square where you can get on many hop on hop off busses to see more of the city. Also Eaurostar is right on the busy Marina, where there are many restaurants to walk to. All in all, a great experience! I would definitely stay there again.",5,2017,09,11
35,Holiday ,"The hotel does not have much of a lobby nor a swimming pool (a big bath tub is more like what they have) 

We booked a junior sweet which was spacious with a narrow balcony . 

The air conditioning was poor most of the time luckily we didn't need it . 

The breakfast although has a reasonable variety was only average . 

The house keeping need to inspect some of the cleaning ladies who probably need more regular bathing . 

The hotel is within 15 minutes walk to Las Ramblas which is convenient . 

Would I go there again ; definitely not ",3,2017,09,09
35,Make sure your room has city views  - and say a big NO to any room that looks onto the Trade Centre,"Stayed here on business. The first room allocated looked onto the concrete office  buildings of the Trade centre so I went straight back to reception and asked for a new room. There was one available with a small balcony offering views across the city.  Yes, view was blocked by the cable car tower but it was way better than the first room on offer.  Breakfast was a buffet that had plenty to cater for everyone- staff remembered you too. And the Spanish guitar that was played through was a nice touch. It is a 10 min walk to La Rambla and taxis are plentiful.  However the pool was tiny and if you went there expecting to do a few laps each day, you will be disappointed because you can't. The roof offers great views and has a bar and a 3 piece band playing, although not a lot of ambience. After a 6 night stay, I thought the 75 Euro charge for a late check out till 4pm- i.e an extra 4h - was excessive.",4,2017,09,07
35,the choice which we had repeated since 2013,"Excellent hotel, location, rooms, food, and service
talking about the staff which I believe is the most important, since you arrive the concierges are so helpful, specially with families and babies.
The reception staff are informative, the restaurant at breakfast are keen to assist, fast and keen. whenever we go to Barcelona we have to stay at the Grand Marina",5,2017,09,06
35,Amazing hotel ticked all the right boxes,"Just had an amazing time at this hotel,roof top pool,cleanliness spotlessly,breakfast choice quality,staff the most helpful I have come across,Zara Sanchez and her double act female colleagues are a star act couldn't do enough for us will certainly recommend and visit again",5,2017,09,04
35,Great Location,"Very good hotel close to both Las Ramblas and cruise line docking area. Check in was fast and efficient,room was large clean and very comfortable but lacked power outlets had to boil electric jug on floor as no power outlet nearby did ask room cleaner about this but he had no English. The view from balcony looked out towards Las Ramblas but was spoiled by tower for cable car. Breakfast buffet cost was around 27 euros per person which was quite reasonable unless you only had cereal or something very light, no a la carte menu was offered. All in all a very good hotel close to all areas of interest. Taxi from hotel to cruise line area was around 5 to 10 Euro although you can catch a shuttle from near Las Ramblas for 3 Euro if you wish.",3,2017,09,03
35,Wonderful hotel ,Absolutely perfect hotel - amazing staff and accommodations! Everything you needed was there and the staff went out of their way to assist you. June is the best month to visit as the weather is mild and it's not too crowded.,5,2017,08,30
35,Great Choice,"Spent 3 nights before our Palma trip.

The hotel was very nice and close to the port with an amazing view.

The location was very central only 6 or 7 minutes walking distance to La Rambla where you can spend the entire day visiting the shops, restaurants and other attractions. The beach was a ten min walk away.

The room was incredible, clean and modern.

Staff were very friendly and went out of their way to assist.

Highly recommended",5,2017,08,30
35,"Great location, but charmless, high-priced, very slow check-in and -out","Very modern hotel in a quiet location on a quay but near the terminus of Las Ramplas.  The room was large and had a nice view of the city.  Check-in took quite some time and although the clerk took our cell phone number, we were never informed when our room was ready.  Check-out had to be done in person and was inexplicably slow.
The breakfast buffet was extensive but expensive, and there was no lower-priced option (e.g. continental breakfast or menu).",3,2017,08,24
35,"Great service, beautiful room","We stayed four nights here at the start of our European holiday. Our room was spacious with views over the port. The area around the back of the hotel was more commercial than we expected but it's only a 10 minute walk to the tourist area with some great tapas bars. A little further along is the beach, again with some great eating spots.
The staff, although sometimes very busy, were friendly and helpful.  The Concierge was particularly helpful. He organised tour bus tickets very efficiently and always provided friendly advice. The rooftop evening drinks were a terrific pre dinner start with views over the city. The only disappointing part was the rooftop pool. Despite the warm weather the pool was too cold to enjoy with limited seating area and almost no shade.",4,2017,08,20
35,"Last minute decision, well made.","After a tough few months, i decided on the spur of the moment to go away. I picked Barcelona, because i had been before with my son but he did not remember it.
As he is currently doing a photography course, i thought it would be good to use Gaudi as an excuse to visit this beautiful city.

I had never stayed in this hotel before, the last time i was far out by the Stadium in the university district.
On first approach it looks amazing, it is a attached to the world trade centre, its hard to know what to expect inside.

We were welcomed by a friendly doorman and reception.
The receptionist asked if we had stayed there before, and i said no. When he checked our booking he said that he felt he could give us a better room even though we had booked a deluxe. I really wanted a twin, as i didn't fancy sharing a bed with my 6'5"" son.
He said he didn't really have any in that category but he would make up for it with a great view, if we didn't mind waiting.

He gave us a glass of champagne whilst we waited, and yes it was worth it.

It was only on the first floor, but it was on the corner and it faced the Maremagnum shopping centre on one side, with the cable cars running above us. I had a perfect view of the sunrising above the sea, so glorious!

It was a vast room, with so much natural light, and space, that i rarely wanted to leave.

The bed was a queen size, but it was so large i always felt alone on it.

I had read some negative reviews before i left, but let me assure you that the staff, the location and the luxurious but homely feel of the place make you feel truly welcome.

I would happily stay again on my next visit.",5,2017,08,13
35,Port location Hotel built to emulate a ship,"Rooms are good sizes, with large spacious bathrooms, breakfast was plentiful on a serve yourself basis.  A reasonable 10 minute walk from La Ramblas. Staff very helpful. The colour coded bus tours stop close by the hotel and recommended for hopping on and off for travelling and sightseeing around the city.",4,2017,08,11
35,Wish I didn't bother..,"My partner and I just got back from a 4 night stay at this hotel and I honestly don't know where to start. My partner is in the military and is currently on a 6 month tour so on his 2 weeks R&R we decided we would go back to Barcelona one of our favourite places and previously stayed at Eurostars Monumetal so thought we'd try out this hotel. It was something we had both been looking forward to for the first 4 months of him being away and I really wanted to make it special for him, I emailed the hotel asking for confirmation of my booking and requested if we could have a nice view. I received no response. I asked the travel company I booked through to do the same thing and they also requested something special to be in he room for us as it was a special occasion as we were celebrating our anniversary late. Again no response. I let it go hoping they would have put something in our reservation notes...After arriving to the hotel at 12pm we were told we couldn't get access to our room till later on which is fine and pretty standard in most hotels anywhere in the world. We were told that when the room was ready we would get a call...I never received a phone call so after 4 hours we decided to just go back. We waited in a lengthy queue while reception staff worked hard under pressure. We watched other people get offered complimentary drinks on their arrival and bags being taken. Once we got to the front we asked if our room was ready which is was, getting the keys took over 15 minutes and at the end of it were just given the keys and nothing else said about our bags or any drink offered. We even witnessed a woman go back for 3rds!! Seeing other people infront and after us get better service was pretty annoying and we felt that it was almost personal. Again we let it go. We went to our room on the 6th floor and it over looked the world trade centre. After paying nearly £900 I was not happy that I get to look at someone's offices. Our bags weren't delivered for over an hour at this point i was more than a little annoyed. Went to reception and asked a very nice receptionist Angelos I think his name was who sorted us out a room to move to the next day which was much better and lovely view and his service couldn't be any better!! He also told me that none of mine or my travel agents emails were on our notes. I wasn't impressed. The next day we weren't told anything about our room only to come back at 3pm and see if it's ready...it wasn't we waited in our room for 45 minutes until I called reception and they sent someone up to take us there who was lovely! The pool was more like a child's pool and the bar over priced for what you get. The roof top could really be something special if they put some work into it and extended it and made it more enjoyable. the pool was out of use for 2 days due to some incident which I think and can only assume children..When we checked out we paid our bill and we're just told to have a nice day while the other guests checking out got asked if they wanted their bags stored and if they could help with any onward travel...i think the service just slipped with us again it felt personal...the whole experience of this hotel really did spoil the whole trip for us and wish I just spent a little more money and stayed at the W hotel for a more personal service and better quality. If there was a way I could get any of my money back I would and put it towards a treat for my partner back in the UK before he goes back on tour. I normally don't like to leave negative reviews and talk directly with the hotel but I probably won't receive a response...I cannot fault the staff I came into contact with as they were so lovely and very quick at any issues and the location is great and the rooms huge and beautiful bathroom, would probably be ideal if you were catching a cruise and only stay one night! my advice would be avoid this hotel much better quality at W hotel or Pullman which is a lot closer to 5 stars!!! ",2,2017,08,11
35,Great location for joining a cruise ship!,"A great location if you are joining a cruise ship from Barcelona port - especially one of the smaller cruise ships as they tend to dock right next to the hotel. A 5 minute walk into town. Rooms are modern, clean and spacious. The bar is nice and has an outdoor area. Bar Food is a bit hit and miss - and not cheap!",3,2017,08,10
35,Great stay,"Our first time in Eurostars grand marina hotel, our stay was great, the room was great service and all the staff was very nice and friendly. We sure are coming back. 

Breakfast and in-room dining services are good. 

All the Staff was good and everyone tries to help and solve our problems and issues.

35,Very good stay!,"Great hotel with very helpful staff. We had a great view on port from the window.

We enjoyed the complimentary drinks and chocolates in the room - nice touch.

The greatest selection of breakfast I have ever seen. However, the service was disappointing. We had to wait for a table, then tea and coffee on several occasions for longer than 20 minutes and we ended up helping ourselves.  

The prices in the restaurant were quite high but we have ordered the room service once and the food was really nice.",5,2017,08,09
35,"Very nice hotel, good location, very helpful nice reception team.","Very nice hotel, good location. we stayed 3 nights before and after a cruise, located very close to the embarkation deck. very nice large rooms high level equipped with nice large bathroom, lovely vieu to city and port.  very helpful nice and welcoming reception team. answered, guided and gave recommendations for any question. delicious high-quality varied breakfast, with large solutions for sugar and gluten free needs, dining room staff was very helpful and generous.",4,2017,08,05
35,Average hotel ,"We stayed at the Grand Marina from the end of July through to early August as part of our trip round Europe. We were disappointed by our stay. Our first room had a view of offices, which we didn't expect for the amount charged and the category of room. After raising this we were moved to a fresh room, which was much better. 

On the plus side, the location is very convenient and the gym is good too. Also staff were always good and friendly. However, a lot of things didn't work. Room service was very erratic and was poor value too. We struggled to get food in a reasonable time. When it came it wasn't great quality either. 

All in all we weren't too impressed and we just didn't feel that the hotel or the price lived up to 5 star expectations. ",3,2017,08,04
35,Very nice hogel,"Amazing hotel over looking the marina, great distance to everywhere and there is also a hop on hop off bus tour that stops outside would highly recommend! Rooms are fabulous with amazing little tiny details that make the room. Staff are very friendly also!",5,2017,08,03
35,Barcelona Trip,"Very nice hotel, good location. 
Upon arrival, we were greeted by the receptionist who received us very well and decided to upgrade us to a Seaview Suite.
Though the Hotel claims it is 5 Star, i think it deserves only 4 stars; for the following reasons: Furniture is run down and it needs renovation and the breakfast is really of average quality. The staff were pleasant. The Hotel is located on a Pier where many luxury cruise liners berth. There is a bus line very close by that serves all the touristic main sites. 
The nicest part of our trip was visiting Barcelona, its old town, beaches, restaurants, Camp Nou; Barcelona is really one of the nicest cities in Europe, both for business and pleasure.",4,2017,08,02
35,Excellent stay,"We visited Barcelona for a business trip and we stayed at Grand Marina Hotel for 3 nights. The location is perfect due that it is near the city center (Rambla, Colom, Barceloneta, etc.). The staff has been kind and welcoming; among them the Director has been also very willing and cordial.

35,Another great stay,Returned to this hotel again and it was even better than the last time. Brilliant location and facilities. The hotel staff are very friendly and yet not intrusive. Room was lovely and spacious with great views of the port.,5,2017,07,31
35,Great,"1. One night (after our cruise)

2. Three rooms (they gave us 2 of the rooms at 07:00 the morning when we arrived from the cruise ship) no extra charge! Great service!

3. Lovely lovely breakfast - expensive but worth every penny

4. Rooms - very modern but nice. Clean look. 

5. Hotel seems a bit dark inside. Maybe that is the look they wanted

6. Hop on hop off bus stops directly outside the hotel. By discounted tickets from reception. 

7. Friendly staff.

35,Excellent location.  Clean. Convenient. Personable.,"We had a great experience here.  The location is near Las Ramblas, but not right in the middle of the city chaos.  The city is very walkable and this was a great place to stay.  The first night we arrived there were food trucks that lined the promenade and we found the most delicious food there.  The hotel has a great bar and the breakfast had everything you could want.  The rooftop deck was nice, but the pool is kinda small.  The rooms were comfortable and clean.  Just what we wanted.",5,2017,07,19
35,Great for conferences,"We stayed here for a conference being held at adjoining convention center. Extremely convenient- convention center located behind the hotel.
I was very impressed with the hotel. Rooms differ in size and layout and views-I was fortunate to have a larger room with a fabulous view to the south west looking over a harbour and a cruise ship berth.
Breakfast was included in my room rate- what a fabulous spread- best I have seen. Lots of hot and cold food, cheeses, hams, salmon, eggs, cakes and pastries. 
It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the Ramblos, same to adjoining shopping center and harbor walk.
The rooms were fabulously appointed and well serviced- I loved the shower with vertical streams of water as well as conventional shower head.
And a bidet- great for soaking my hot aching feet ( yes,I do know how a bidet is meant to be used!)
I never used the pool but it was surprisingly small according to my co travelers.
This is a large hotel but service friendly and helpful. It's conveniently located for conferences and to the city center .",5,2017,07,18
35,Exceptional Staff and Facilities ,"Judit Parera  made our trip to Barcelona fantastic.  She was our concierge at the Eurostar Grand Hotel Marina.   Having never traveled to Europe as an adult she listened to what type of vacation we enjoyed and then made recommendations that matched our interests. We visited fantastic beach villages and beautiful old medieval villages with quaint shops and amazing bistros. Pals was our favorite.   Judit Parera truly made our visit to your hotel very memorable.  We stayed 4 nights and loved the facility.  It was very comfortable, clean and roomy.   The Buffett breakfast was also fantastic.  ",5,2017,07,18
35,Lovely stay,"Lovely hotel at the marina, which is an easy walk to Las Rambla. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable with great views over Barcelona. The hotel was quiet and has a nice rooftop bar. There is also a rooftop pool however no shade/umbrellas so quite hot in the sun. The hotel did lose our reservation however they handled it well and have an upgrade. The only downside is there is sometimes a wait for a taxi.  Great place to stay and would definitely return ",4,2017,07,14
35,Great Barcelona Hotel Option,"Fully enjoyed every aspect of our stay at the Euro GM hotel. The location is a real asset, with easy walking to La Rambla or the MareMagnum (shopping/Starbucks/Haagen Dazs) and a short cab ride anywhere else in town. Both of the hop on/hop off bus options have stops right outside hotel and we took a two day pass to explore the various parts of town.

Was greeted warmly at check-in by Manager and staff, and our request for early check-in had been noted. We arrived in the morning, and final preparations to our room were quickly done while we had a cup coffee. Room 615 was fabulous with beautiful views of the marina, mediterranean (on one side), and city (on other). Hotel was quiet and we enjoyed restful sleep. While not bearing super-luxury touches, the room was smartly laid out with a fabulous bathroom and was a nice size by European standards. Considering the price it was a fantastic value, and far superior to the chain hotel options in Barcelona which each have drawbacks.
Hotel property is nicely maintained, and we enjoyed the rooftop pool with additional nice views of the city and MontJuic. 
Very pleased with our choice and look forward to returning to the Grand Marina.",5,2017,07,11
35,Very happy,Excellent hotel .. sweet staff..clean rooms ..we had the best time there .perfect location next to the ramblas and a metro fast check inn no matter what time u arrive .....we would definitely come back,5,2017,07,11
35,Not suitable for young families ,"I booked four rooms for the family and I have to say that we were very disappointed with the hotel service and attitude considering the costs of the hotel. 

The hotel is so busy that tbh the staff really do not seem to care as the demand is so high. So many people are checking in and a number of staff are simply uninterested.

Checking in is very slow and painful. They also take the full amount at the very start, which I can only assume is so you can't leave the hotel if you are unhappy.

The room was good but the view is poor and you will pay an additional 650 euros just for a babies bed considering the room charges from a standard to a suite which doesn't have any difference in size.? I did complain to the hotel
About this but they did not do anything... 

The room service was poor. We arrived back in the afternoon the room, still to find that the room wasn't completed and for 3 people in room we only used to receive 2 towels ?? This happened every day! 

Breakfast was ok and a good selection.

The hotel isn't suitable for young families as lots of couples and lad parties seem to be there, and our room completely flooded due to someone using there bathroom above as a wet room.

Also a number of complaints from other family members on loud music and all night parties, room service etc 

The pool area is a complete joke, the pool is like a plunge pool and can't be used for any type of swimming.

Will I stop there again.... it's a tough question 

",2,2017,07,08
35,Couldn't be more impressed!,"Fabulous...
Hospitality, nice people....delete that...GREAT people...(can I say more)....well I could, but you may think I own shares....I don't. I just wanted to share with you a great experience...that's all. 
Sometimes less words tell a better story.",5,2017,07,06
35,Lots of good things but a few negatives to be aware of,"a good quality hotel based relatively centrally in Barcelona. its around a 5 minute walk from the hotel to the start of La Ramblas, situated on the port. Rooms were spacious and well equipped - fridge, TV, iron, kettle, ironing board, bathrobes, slippers etc so it was odd that the toiletries provided were the bare minimal and tiny bottles. They were replenished daily but one shower took the whole bottle so showering twice day meant you had to ask for more. There were no cotton make up pads, emery boards or body lotion. Similarly the tea and coffee provided was minimal - two sachets and two milks.  It seemed an odd thing to scrimp on for a 5*. The hotel has a pool and sun deck on the top floor, not huge so on busy days you might struggle to get a bed. The downside here was the location right next to the port. There was a cruise ship in one day alongside the hotel and for 4 hours it pumped out noxious diesel fumes right across the sun deck. There are also frequent sizeable ferries that leave from the port so similar fumes from those floated around the hotel. Breakfast was good -  a lot of options and cava provided too. We asked fora late check out but they were only able to extend it by one hour to 1pm. Some parking available if needed €25 per day charge. Taxi rank outside services the port largely but handy for hotel guests too.",4,2017,07,06
35,Very nice hotel that is convenient to the cruise terminal,"Looking for an nice hotel?
Well this is it!
They pull know how to make a guest feel welcome. When we arrived in the lobby to check in, they give us mimosas.  The lobby was modern and the customer service was superb.  

We had nice toiletries and slippers in our room.  

Within in the dining area, you will find infused water and candy.  A small band is stationed near the breakfast area for the guests enjoyment. 

The rooftop has a spectacular view.

You can't go wrong if you choose this hotel before getting on a cruise ship.  

My tip would be to take a cab to the terminal if more than 2 of you are in a group.  The shuttle costs more than a cab for 3+.",5,2017,07,03
35,Nice upgrades,"This is a unique property.  It reminds you of being on a ship. The lady at the reception desk upgraded us to a city view suite.  That meant our room had a pullout couch.  It was very clean and spacious.  One morning I went to the dining room to get a cup of coffee and the manager in the dining room sent me to an empty bar bc they were closing for breakfast, but several people were still there.  So I went to the empty bar and waited for about 10 minutes for someone to help me.  I went back to the restaurant to tell the manager no one was at the bar.  Instead of just getting me a cup of coffee, she sent me back to the bar and a lady appeared to make me a cup of coffee.  I was so annoyed by that time, I decided their service  in the dining room was below standards and decided to eat in las ramblas for the rest of my trip.  How hard would it had been for the manager to get me a cup of coffee??",3,2017,06,27
35,Weekend break,Arrived thursday around 1pm...room wasnt available until 3pm...worth the wait...room was lovely...spotless and bed was lovely and comfy. Pool very small but didnt need anything bigger as didnt spend much time there. Drinks expensive. Over all had great time..would defo stay again.,4,2017,06,27
35,Nice quiet hotel,It's a great hotel near the beach the view is good in the city view but it's just little bit far frome the city center.but the taxi and bus station is not so far.also the services are perfect 👌 nice massage....!,5,2017,06,25
35,Fantastic hotel in great location. Would certainly recommend ! ,"I have been to Barcelona before so instead of staying on Las Ramblas I was looking for somewhere close to the main area and somewhere two female travellers would feel little bit safer on an evening in the city when it is after dark . This was great ! 
We were so close to the beach but also to the shops ;). 
The hotel is modern , clean and staff very good. There is a gym and pool although we didn't get the chance to use. 
The hotel is in walking distance to la Ramblas and taxis are straight outside also.

35,60th Birthday Trip,"I adopt a fairly simple approach when purchasing something. I expect to get what I pay for. I didn't.

So when planning a short trip to Barcelona this hotel seemed a good option. So I went online and booked a room, breakfast, and added a ""view"" (explained as either of the city or of marina) which was extra, all confirmed by credit card. Total cost for two nights €528

On arrival we checked in and I presented with an invoice described as being for the first day and asked to sign. This seemed a bit odd but hey, local customs.

The room was on the second floor. The ""view"" was of the legs and safety netting of a funicular support tower. So I went to reception who reacted by telling me that I had in fact been upgraded to a mini suite. In fairness they offered two alternative rooms on higher floors (3 and 5) but these also faced the funicular tower so this was a bit of a non option. Now my experience of upgrades is that the hotel cannot wait to tell you the good news. So why did this hotel only tell me after I went to reception to complain about the non view. Somehow I didn't quite believe that I had the full story. I expressed my displeasure and left it at that as it was nearly 10pm.

Just to explain what a mini suite is in this hotel. It is an extra space with a moveable partition and it contains one two seater sofa, one coffee table, a second flat screen television and the room fridge. So you can sit alongside your partner instead of stretching out on your bed, or you can invite two friends in and they can sit on the sofa and you don't have to look at them, but it is otherwise a pretty useless addition. There is a balcony, unfurnished, about the square meterage of two coffins laid end to end and about as cheerful. 

The main room was pleasant enough to the standard of a €90-120 room in a four star hotel. 

The bathroom was vast. Fixtures were all to a high standard but there was an element of impracticality with a lack of places to hang towels ""close to the action"", very low slung toilet and bidet and a strange miserliness with things like toilet rolls. This bathroom design is fine for the able bodied but if infirm or disabled think again as there are no grab rails and the highly polished floor is exactly that, highly polished.

The following day we headed off for the planned sightseeing and shopping returning at 3pm. The room had not been cleaned but there were cleaners in the adjoining room so we went to the bar for an hour to give them a chance to do their stuff. 

When we returned the cleaners had disappeared and the room had not been cleaned. I phoned reception and this time the response was that it was my birthday. Trying to bring this increasingly surreal experience back to reality I asked that the room be cleaned after we had gone out for the evening at around 5.30. I explained that we would be back between 10.30 and 11.00pm so there was plenty of time. This,as best as I could understand it, was agreed.

The safe then jammed requiring an intervention by housekeeping to reset it.

When we returned we found the following. The room had not been cleaned. There was a small birthday cake and four bottles of water in the bedroom section, a trolley with a bottle of Cava, more bottled water, fruit and cheese and a note from a manager apologising for the problems and inviting us to relocate to a complimentary suite. So as far as I can understand it we were being asked to eat fruit, cheese, cake and drink cava on top of our evening meal, pack, move to another room just before midnight with a view to checking out early to catch our flight the following morning.

So I called reception again. During a difficult conversation it was obvious that the receptionist was not aware of the offer of another room but in fairness the person did understand that we wanted the room cleaned and made up and that the trolley and cake were to be removed. Once again we headed off to the bar to allow housekeeping to do the necessary.

When we checked out I was told by the receptionist that as I had provided my credit card details on checking in there was nothing else to pay. No paperwork was offered. So I asked for a copy of the bill. The receptionist printed it off and put it straight into an envelope. What was there to hide?

Obviously I then looked at the bill. The bar bill from our first night was not included, but ""room service"" which we had not had was, the two bar bills from the previous afternoon and evening also were not included. The room and breakfast was charged in full including the ""view"" extra cost. I took the view that I was ""up"" as the missing bar bills more than offset the extra cost of the non existent view and the non existent room service. 

The website is a bit disfunctional (try to follow through on the airport shuttle service) and a bit dishonest in terms of the pictures. We observed a very young and enthusiastic staff, speaking a good standard of English and we heard a couple of other languages spoken fluently. One to one service in the bars, breakfast area and concierge department was excellent. The reception staff were superficially helpful but they did seem to operate in a parallel universe and it doesn't help that they have the habit of taking calls while dealing with you face to face. Scuff marks on the walls are a no no. Dirty plate collection stations in the breakfast room are not acceptable (try going onto the terrace and look at them through the window). The hotel just needs competent management and more visually based control.

Management presence was non existent which is reprehensible and there seems to be no escalation procedure where the staff rather than the customer can move a problem up for resolution. The appropriate punishment I would recommend for this management is that they should have to stay in their own hotel and see how they like it.

A short visit from a professional consultant like Alex Polizzi would sort this place out in a heartbeat. The infrastructure is there, more or less, and there are good staff. Until that happens do yourself a favour, book into a cheaper hotel with better standards and spend what you save somewhere else. Otherwise you will feel like you would have been better drawing €500 from the cash point and setting fire to it.",2,2017,06,23
35,NOT worth the price we paid!,"We chose the romantic package to celebrate our 32nd anniversary.  When we arrived we were told that our room was not ready....we could go to the bar and have a drink while we waited.  We waited over two hours to check in.  Unacceptable!  Then after we were able to get into our reserved room....the cava and chocolate strawberries my husband expected to be there.....finally showed up....the next day!  So much for my surprise on our anniversary!  
The room was nice....but we were there for four nights....and our room was not cleaned until after 5:00pm each day......absolutely unacceptable.
The only nice thing was the breakfast buffet....excellent variety,  
The pool area was super small and not enough seating sun lounges to go around. 
Would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",3,2017,06,21
35,Swimming pool is very tiny + Lack of customer focus and empathy,"If you leave anything in the room, by accident, be prepared that you never see it again. 
When I left my laptop charger in the room I realized two things:
- the delivery of the object costs 55 EUR
- the hotel sent me the wrong charger
All together I spent more than a month chasing my charger. 
When I asked for some compensation, eg.: one complimentary night in the hotel, the answer was that we already apologized and this should be enough. Not very professional or friendly answer.",2,2017,06,21
35,Mas o menos... 5* and a self-disrupting service line with beautiful portview,"Dear Reader,
before you read my words until the very end, let me annotate some points before.
I have been to this Hotel also in the last years, used several services from the dining, to rooms service, laundry service, the concierge, hanging around on the roof top, using the service on the terrace etc... but... Many things I miss can be really found in other Hotels with less stars..
On my very first trip to this Hotel I was astonished, if not impressed, how well the location was, the personnel showed up very professional, a roof top terrace, nice breakfast, nice food, and overall something was not right. It feels like 5 stars, but it is not.
Bathroom: Looks ok, but the isolation of the bathtub is somehow 1 star. Edges of the elements are not in line, you can see gaps, the separating glass windows of the tub feels cheap, the overall tub feels cheap. Toilet is ok, but mine at home is better… The mirrors in the bath don’t have an underlining heater to keep the visible surface clean from the steam after taking a shower. The amenities seem to differ during my trips, while last year I got a nice golden package with shaver, foam, soap etc. this time I was happy to get a soap, although I had at least the same booking class and extras. This is remarkable, and usually I do not tend to remind them of missing things or why there are differences – because my duty is done by paying, their duty is to fulfil their 5*.
Living Room: Although having ordered my different pillows, there were only these horrible pillows that I know from my childhood. Hard, not comfortable, not convenient… There are some Hotels like H…. or Le….. where I sink into sleep immediately. Balcony as last time in same room class… not available, instead the windows were not properly isolated, so I heard the ships all times. The Hotel should know that, when ships are more or less 30 Meters away from you. You don’t need an alarm or wake-up service here – the ship’s horn does everything you need, wanted or not. But the battle ship in front of our windows was awesome… 😉
Now the best things:
One day someone from the personnel knocked at the door, bringing me a birthday cake for my “birthday”. I was really amused, because it was neither my birthday nor the correct recipient. This is just organizational fail.
The service guy on the roof top didn’t really notice you need some drink or something else for awful 20 minutes, when he noticed that there were some guests and so he jumped. In the bitter end I did not like to go to a bar and had to remind him of bringing me the menu! And that’s what is supposed to earn a tip. Not really…
Restaurant areas: Only the “new” people at the hotel jumped attentively to provide the service. Those I knew already were acting like begging for the day to end. The food is for sure ok, you can have sea food, fried sea food also  (bah), salmon, olives,… but please ask nothing special. Gambas, spicy with Habaneros, not feasible. Usually I prefer in the deep evenings a glass of rum, but after I only saw Brugal, Zacapa 23, not even 25, not even Matusalem (or the waitress had no clue) or Pyrat, I gave up asking any further. And please, dear hotel, this popcorn is horribly cheap! 5*, Ladies and Gentlemen!
The bad: And, as usual, getting used to during my last trips as well as this time – The invoice. Last time it was completely wrong with incorrect balances, positions, this time my booking was mixed up, leaving me with the same impression as usual: A horrible front desk. Seriously…
The personnel in total, as described above, lacks the competence of attentiveness, serving you the environment as expected. But they lack details like the room with misaligned furniture elements and edges not in shape – you remember what I wrote about the bathroom? The personnel is the same. It looks good, but never expect anything automatically. You can ask them and they will do, but to me this is waste of time, telling them what to do.
The good: The only point I really enjoyed: The concierge. Perfect alignment, reservations, no open wishes. But this is the only good point of this year’s impression.
Of course, the hotel is usually trying to do their best to fix it, get amenities, compensate it with a next upgrade etc. I would say, with a discount of 30-40% this Hotel might be an option, but considering the noise, sea gulls trying to eat your food in the inner garden, personnel not understanding that you are not looking for boring times in the restaurant or roof top, while missing a beer or food for 10-15 Minutes and talking with you in a kind of semi-educated way, simulating maturity and serious conversation with a business traveller makes me think intuitively that it is not well-established nor settled enough to compete with the real 5* establishments. I noticed that the personnel is in total very young, which is perfectly fine, but seeing their attitude, attentiveness, dedication towards the client, clearly shows a management fail. I have never seen anything comparable with mixed impressions, but due to the fact, that money is not my main concern at all, special offers, rates, upgrades are simply neglectable as incentive to come back. 
On the one hand, I principally like this Hotel, but this is not 5*, Ladies and Gentlemen.
Many thanks for your attention, dear reader, and good luck with choosing the right accommodation for your stay.

My rating of 3/5 is absolutely fair in this case.",3,2017,06,20
35,Violently rude front desk,"I was about to write a rave review on this hotel. But then came this: There was a mistake made in my reservation about the length of my stay. Suddenly, out of the blue, I get a violent call from Elena from the front desk saying in a threatening voice: ""you have 10 min to come down before I call security"". I had incidents like this before but was never approached by hotel staff in that language and tone. Ruined what could have been a wonderful stay. ",2,2017,06,17
35,Very disappointed,"We stayed in Barcelona for 3 nights in Juin 2017. we paid almost 1000€ for a ""deluxe room"".

But actually there was no ""deluxe"" in our room. Mini Bar not included (we paid almost 1000€!!!!!), small TV, dirty beds, no balcony etc...

The Pool (if you want to call it like that) is actually a little hole filled with water... totally bad and dirty... there is no space and such a pool in an hotel with more than 300 guests!!!? Very poor!

The staff is very friendly and the breakfast is very good. So at least one point for that. But to make a conclusion this hotel isn't deluxe or 5 star at all and too expensive! 

Look for another one in Barcelona",2,2017,06,17
35,Excellent Hotel and perfect location to see Barcelona,"Came to Barcelona for a long weekend and from the moment we stepped into the reception and was given a glass of Cava whilst we checked in we knew we were going to enjoy the stay. The rooms were excellent and spacious .... Pool bar was first class and it also had one of the best hotel gyms I have seen.
We will be returning,",5,2017,06,13
35,Mistakes not resolved and poor service,"We stayed at the hotel for two nights, the hotel itself is as per the photos and wouldn't rave about it nor critical either. My biggest problem is with the service when leaving, we received our bill with charges on which weren't ours which hotel staff corrected but even though our hotel stay had been paid in full before our arrival decided to charge my debit card again without my consent as the only time I entered my pin code was to pay a small bar bill which was under 40 euros. Someone manually charged my card and when I queried this with the hotel they gave a lacklustre apology but cannot grasp the concept that if they refund an amount a week after it is taken the exchange rate will vary massively meaning that with international charges I'm around 40 euros short with no replies to my emails from hotel staff. 

Whilst checking out there were also a number of customers complaining about charges so it seems this is not an uncommon experience. 

The only time the hotel staff have my sympathy is with guests that book a hotel with a port on three sides that complain their are ships in their view which I cannot understand at all. ",1,2017,06,12
35,Phenomenal hotel - fabulous location,"We came to Barcelona with our son and nephew. We had a really hard time finding any hotel situation that met our need to have two, adjacent rooms. Yes, theoretically available, but no hotel would guarantee it at check-in. On a lark, we found this hotel, with a ""Family Suite."" Essentially it is two separate rooms with a shared ante-room and shared key cards. Perfect. Great food, excellent service. Highlights: rooms can be made supremely cold and supremely dark. As in...we all slept until 12:30pm the first day (whoops). Pool is tiny but beautiful views. Great gym. Ability to shower and change upon arrival, even though rooms weren't ready. Highly recommended. ",5,2017,06,12
35,I would definitely go back!,I had one of the most pleasant stays I had ever had in Barcelona. The room was a nice surprise with a luxurious interior design and a spacious and comfortable bed. You could also find all the accessories one might need during a sleep over in a hotel including even packs of tissues to take away. The bathroom was all marble and had both a shower and a jacuzzi tab. The panoramic view of the see was a great bonus too. The staff were also incredibly nice and helpful. I fully recommend this hotel for both leisure and business.,5,2017,06,11
35,Bad service ,"Checked in today and used the safe box in the room, came back few hours later and the box didn't open, called reception and a gentleman shows up about 20 minutes later and couldn't open and left saying he'll send someone from maintenance, 30 minutes later I call reception again and the same happens, they send a gentleman that couldn't help and again informs me that he'll send maintenance. 30 minutes later I checked with reception who says he'll update me in a minute. 15 minutes later I called reception again, this time to be informed that it might take extra time, i asked reception not to send anyone as I had to put the kids in bed and requested to talk to the duty manager and I'm still waiting for the call. ",2,2017,06,10
35,Lovely Barcelona,"We spent 3 days in Barcelona and Eurostars was our choice due 3 reasons:
- was close to La Rambla and old city center with a lot to do and a metro station to connect you with all main points
- close to beach so I can do my morning run near the sea
- the only 5 stars hotel with acceptable price
Location was great indeed and good connection with the key touridtique spots of Barcelona.
Staff gave us mix feeling: some was very helpful but some treat us according to our passport which is not nice as we pay the same as everybody else. At the breakfast we were the only one in the queue whichbwere asked the name aside the room number - for all others just the room number was OK.
We booked a higher ranked room with sea view but we got at first a room at second floor where even we faced the sea, due to the construction of the hotal actually we cannot see the sea. Only after we complain they changed it the next day, on the same floor but with a berter view and balcony - the answer was: ""we have a group"". I am wonder which hotels get so big group who filled the whole 7 floors... Our guess was that there was not real intention to give us a better room st higher floor...
Breakfast was very good and worth the money.
The speed of internet was not too great.
The pool is actually on a size of a bit bigger jacuzzi so the word pool is funny. There is no way you can swim in that big tub. The picture on website is miss leading a lot so unless you do not plan to go on the beach, carrying a swimming suit is pointless.
The gym is acceptable although for 5 stars hotel you would expect better. The morning runs on the beach was just perfect - try it!
One word of attention for the ones who visit Barcelona - there are a lot of thieves. I am saying this after happening twice in 3 days for me and my wife: we found our bags opened- thank god nothing important was stolen, just a coin wallet with no more than few euros coins.
Next time I will definitely chose also a hotel on the beach - it is too good that morning run or evening walks.
Enjoy!",4,2017,06,08
35,"Good location, decent hotel ","We stayed for 4 nights for a city break in Barcelona. The hotel is well placed, near Port Vell at the end of La Rambla. Nearest metro station is Drassanes on L3, with the Barri Gotic very nearby. There's also a shopping centre, Mare Magnum, 10 minutes or so walk away. 

The location can't be beat, it's a maximum of 30 minutes away from any of the main tourist attractions. We made full use of that. We also spent a lot of time hanging around Mare Magnum, simply because it's a convenient place when you've got young children. 

There's a small pool on the roof, it tended to get crowded though, and the cable cars passing overhead have a full view. The pool bar and the restaurant were rather expensive, there's better value outside the hotel, especially for weekday breakfast (check out the cafes in the World Trade Centre, just behind the hotel). 

Service was decent, we had to get someone to unlock our room safe and they did that early in the morning (twice), promptly and with no fuss. The downside was that there were no connecting rooms available despite requesting in advance. 

We also had problems with the cab to the airport. Despite leaving our name and request to book a cab with reception, this wasn't done until we checked out and were waiting. Luckily we had allowed for some delay. 

All in all an ok hotel in a good location. ",3,2017,06,08
35,Mr.,Not happy with the room. Supposed to be a deluxe but very very ordinary. We were with another couple and we made reservations at the same time. They paid less than half our room rate. I don't know if this is a problem with TripAdvisor or the hotel. We will definitely not be returning to this hotel.,1,2017,06,04
35,Good and bad,Good location for the marina & Las Ramblas but not so good as it's literally next to the cruise liners which are noisy. Views from the rooms are of the city or port mostly. The World Trade Centre is attached to this hotel and the general vibe is that it's a corporate hotel not geared up for leisure tourists. There are better places to stay in the town. Depends what you are looking for. ,3,2017,06,03
35,Nothing special,"Location is pretty good.
Staff fairly helpful.
First room wasn't very good, with noise from outside and the loo broken. They sent someone to fix the loo instead of moving us and told us it had been fixed. It wasn't and so we were eventually moved.
Small pool but needed after a hot day sightseeing.
Probably wouldn't bother staying here again.",3,2017,06,03
35,Average Plus,"The hotel met my expectations in terms of location. The location in the central place in Barcelona gives an opportunity to visit the city, relax on the beach and go back to the room whenever needed.
Breakfast is excellent offers almost everyone what he prefers . The Staff at breakfast time is helpful, smile and pleasant Strong Point
The rooms standard are moderate ☹ , the TV wasn’t working and needed to be serviced. 
The reception services , and that is story. 
We couldn’t manage to get bath robes over two days and each time we called the reception we heard a different story . First we were asked to wait 5 min cause someone is gonna deliver them now, then we were answered that they are waiting for laundry and it may take an hour, then it may be the next day. Thank god we received them after two days……..but…
Still recommend the stay there despite all",4,2017,05,30
35,Half term in Barcelona with kids ,"Hotel well located at the bottom of the Ramblers next to the marina and the cruise ships
Staff very helpful and polite 
Red and blue bus routes stop 50 m outside hotel super convenient as traveling with small excited children 
We got interconnecting rooms and they were spacious and immaculate 
Only negative of this hotel
was that the pool on the roof was closed which was not mentioned on booking 
However the views from the hotel rooftop very impressive 

Breakfast buffet offered a vast selection and the pancake maker was a great hit with my 7 yr old son
Quite bar to return to after a days sight seeing 
Though I'm sure this would be busier during peak  season 
Will definitely return ",4,2017,05,29
35,Good But Not As Expected ,"Good location, with a nice view over the city, easily accessible.

Good size rooms, nice furniture, excellent beds, good food, professional chef(s) plus two highly skilled ""maitre d's"".

Poor service of some young untrained waiters in restaurant.

Poor reception service, due to insufficient and slow staff and obvious lack of training / skills of some of them. Perhaps some management attention could make a change. Waited in line a lot, both for check-in and check-out - totally unexpected for a five-star hotel.

",3,2017,05,28
35,Great location & wonderful service,"Very warm welcome. Lovely airy, well-appointed room. Fabulous view over this busy cruise port - ideal for Marine Traffic nerds. Lots of places to sit, eat, drink and relax both inside and out. A fifteen minute walk to La Rambla or to Maremagnum, the modern shopping centre across the water, on Rambla de Mar which has many eating places.
A short journey from the airport was the icing on the cake.",5,2017,05,25
35,"Great Hotel, Service Not so Great","I stayed here whilst visiting Barcelona during Formula 1 weekend. The hotel is lovely, very clean and modern. The location is a little out of the way if you're the kind of person who stays out a little late at night. The walk from la Rambla can be a bit dodgy in the early hours. The cruise ships dock straight outside the hotel and are noisy with their generators running 24/7. The service in the hotel wasn't great, particularly in the hotel bar. Even though it was F1 weekend the staff seemed oblivious to it and had mo helpful information about how to get to the rave track. There was a FIFA convention staying there at the same time and it was clear they had the preferential treatment.

Overall a good hotel in a great city, Howe we next time I visit Barcelona I will stay closer to the Marina or near the Place Realie. 4 stars for The Grand Marina.",4,2017,05,24
35,Vacation,I booked the hotel because it was so close to the cruise port. We arrived late the night before our cruise. Upon our arrival we were offered juice or champagne and they could not have been any more accommodating.Due  to our late arrival all rooms our price range were gone and we were given the presidential suite! It was AMAZING and BEAUTIFUL and was a great start to our cruise! Then in the morning I had paid for breakfast. The breakfast was unbelievable! Everything you could think of for a breakfast was served all on white linen tablecloths. As you can tell our experience with this hotel could not have been better and I do thank them and would recommend this hotel to anyone.,5,2017,05,22
35,"Great hotel, great service ","We booked in for 2 nights at the beginning of May.

The staff were friendly and informative.

We checked in easily and were directed to our room on the 6th floor.

The room was of a good standard with a view of the dock, good bathroom facilities including a bath, shower and double sink.  Great amenities including toothbrush kit, nail kit etc

The bedroom area was well catered for including a big comfy bed, good wardrobe space, flat screen tv, kettle, hair dryer and iron with ironing board.

The one very minor issue we had was plugging the kettle in.  We had to put it on the floor under the desk due to all plug sockets being on floor level.",5,2017,05,22
35,Weekend.,"We was visiting Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel for a long-weekend holiday in the end of April. The room was very good with a fantastic viuw over Barcelona. The staff was very helpful and when I was celebraiting my birthday, they surprised me and my wifw with a bottle of Cava in our room. 
So in total a very nice hotel in the harbour.

35,Not a 5 star,"Bad service from the moment I came into the hotel. Check in staff had a bad attitude. Rooms are very weird and tacky. I was planning on staying for two nights but checked out earlier. Couldn't get out fast enough. 
I was there for a site visit and the sales staff were totally unprepared. 
Do not recommend. ",1,2017,05,21
35,"Very nice hotel, great breakfast","Liked practically everything about this hotel. The rooms are very spacious (which is unusual for Barcelona). Everything is very clean and the staff is friendly and eager to help. Breakfast buffet was fantastic, eating it outside on the hotel terrace was even better! Its close enough to the Ramblas that you can walk (10-15 minutes).",5,2017,05,18
35,"Great hotel, great location","We booked a romantic room for a short break in Barcelona.
When we arrived at the hotel first impressions were really good all around. The location was great, the staff were very friendly and quick (we were even offered some champagne and juice at reception) and everything looked very clean.
Once we went to our room we found a bottle of champagne and some chocolate coated strawberries waiting for us which I thought was a lovely touch.
The room itself was very spacious and it had views of the marina which were amazing!
The breakfast was fantastic, on the Sunday they even had a duo of violin and Spanish guitar to make the atmosphere even better.

All in all a fantastic stay 5*",5,2017,05,17
35,Most Uncooperative Hotel,"Dear Team, I had booked a room Lead Guest Name: Mr Pankaj Chaturvedi through an online portal In on 21 May – 2 Nights 1 Room – 2 adults Due to a system error, as my computer had got corrupted and hung (no confirmation email also was received, on 14th April a double booking had been created for the same guest as below. Unfortunately, it it is a non-refundable hotel. I only need 1 room. Despite writing to you, and requesting you for the waiver of 1 room, even for genuine reasons, you are requested to co-operate and understand our problems. I have been requesting you for nearly 1 month now.",1,2017,05,10
35,Fabulous Stay,"Arrived at the hotel in the evening and was greeted by the long lit up avenue where the hotel is situated at the bottom. It looked beautiful. Our taxi pulled up and a member of staff at the hotel was there straight away to open the door for us and collect our luggage. Check in was quick and simple and our luggage was brought to our room for us. The room we booked was a delux and that's just what it was. Spacious, large bathroom with both jacuzzi and jet powered shower, comfortable, huge bed and blackout curtains or a good nights sleep. The room was nice and clean and was cleaned every day including fresh towels everyday even though we hung them up to re use. The staff were very polite and professional and helped us when needed. 

The breakfast offered catered for every appetite. Hot, cold, sweet, savoury, nice coffees, juice.... the choice was endless and the staff here too were on hand if needed and constantly on the go. 

The location was perfect for us as we had bought a two day bus tour ticket and the bus stop was just a short walk away and La Rambla was not too far either..... I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it. Thank you for a very pleasant stay in Barcelona ",5,2017,05,08
35,Good 5 star hotel,"What is the best about this hotel - the location, spacious standard rooms and very good breakfast. This hotel is situated in the heart of the Barcelona city, about 10 min walk from the famous Rambla street and in the beautiful area of the port. The room was clean, very spacious, with the comfortable bed and amazing view to the city. The breakfast was very good, with a great variety of cold and hot dishes, cakes, champagne and etc.",5,2017,05,08
35,This is 3 star non 5,"After first night I have requested to return my money to change hotel to five star as it was announced to my family before the trip. I have mentioned my reason (described below) but they refused due to my room rate was non refundable.
After 3 nights my opinion didn't change, unfortunately, because nothing was changed. I think it's fare to share my opinion with other people who're going to make booking.
Eurostars is: Rude staff including supervisors, construction works in the kitchen at night (despite our several requests to stop it because we can't sleep), dirty rooms, weak service. To get bathrobes it took me half a day and number of calls. Finally it was delivered but they said that they have only one size... Doors on balcony are not closing... its funny but they said it's hotel policy. My kids didn't sleep and scare to be in the room due to room has direct access (on the second floor) from the roof.
My opinion (sorry I'm not so experienced in 3star hotels and don't want to say something bad about them) this is not really 5 or 4 stars hotel. They need to do a lot of changes.
All the rest (I mean outside of the hotel): amazing Barcelona, museums and churches, nice restaurants in the city, football.... was perfect!",3,2017,05,07
35,Good stay,"Two things stood out about our 2 day stay at the Grand Marina.
First, we arrived at 10 AM after flying all night from Canada.  Check in time is 3PM.  We were tired and it was raining- we didn't want to kill 5 hours-  we needed sleep .  They took our phone number and said they would call when our rooms were ready.  I really didn't expect a call but they did, at 11:40 and the rooms were ready.  So were we!
Second.  We were going on a cruise.  It's a big port and I wasn't exactly sure where the ship would dock.  Well, the hotel is on a pier and has 2 docks called WTC North and South. (For World Trade Center).  Our ship docked at the WTC N dock, only 200 ft from the hotel's front door.  You can't get more convenient than that.

The rooms, staff and everything else were fine.",5,2017,05,07
35,Great base location for Barcelona,"The service was excellent and we were given a nice room upgrade which was very nice. The rom was very clean and spacious and had a lovely view of the city. Bed was very big and comfortable. My only complaint was the fact that after a long early morning and midday around Barcelona we decided to do as the Spanish do and have a late afternoon siesta but there was no way on this earth that the room cleaners in the room above us was ever going to let that happen. They have got to be the noisiest clearers in Barcelona, Grrrrrrrrrr",4,2017,05,04
35,Barcelona hotel at its best,"This hotel is a very nice and modern hotel directly by the sea and the port. Nice rooftop restaurant and pool. Nice fitness section and large rooms. 

Very modern and nice and good lobby bar. Highly recommended.",5,2017,05,03
35,Fantastic five-star hotel. ,"This is a fantastic five-star hotel with every possible amenity. Friendly staff and reasonable prices will greet you at this hotel right next to the port in Barcelona.  

There are a variety of rooms available. All very well furnished with a modern theme.  

The restaurant and bar areas are very nice, and the quality of food is very good.  

We have stayed at this hotel on three occasions now, and every time we return to Barcelona we always book here.

The location of the hotel may seem slightly out the way, but this is not true. Just a couple of hundred metres walk will find you at the start of las Ramblas. And from there you can explore the city.  

Tour buses operate from right outside the hotel with at least two selected tours.  

The subway  is extremely close to the hotel and there is also a large taxi rank right outside.  

It is also worth remembering that the hotel operate a limousine to and from the airport, and this is extremely reasonably priced compared to the taxi journey.  

",5,2017,05,03
35,"Great Location, nice stuff - ideal before a cruise","We have stayed here already more than ten times. We use this Hotel always before going on a cruise ship. The location is perfect, next to the cruise terminal and short walk to downtown. As a repeating guest you get no extras at all and no warm welcome. That's not so nice but we like the place.",5,2017,05,03
35,Very nice room and best location,"The hotel is very elegant and very well situated - in the heart of the center, but not at the noisy main boulevard. Actually at the marina, next to one shopping/dining center, which is very convenient if you decide not to breakfast at the hotel. The breakfast btw was a bit pricey. The room itself was very nice, very well decorated along with a quite big bathroom. The bed was also very comfortable, shich is extremely important to me for a good relaxation after a long and busy day in such beautiful city The staff was also nice and helpful. Overall I would recommend this hotel, which I find extremely convenient without being too luxury or pompous, but offers everything you might need during your stay in Barcelona. Another useful thing was that in front of the hotel there is a bus stop for all sightseeing bus trips. You won't be wrong if you decide to book it!",4,2017,04,27
35,Good but not great,"The big advantage of this hotel is the size of the bedroom. Very big bathroom and room. However when I moved in the tv was not working and my duvet was teared... Breakfast, regular buffet nothing impressive to be honest. As mentioned in title good but not great.",3,2017,04,27
35,Eurostars Grand Marina,"Location good. Drink ridiculously expensive as was the food which was less than average.
Room needed decorating and was very basic and not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel.
Poor quality towels, horrid tea and coffee tray.
Only used hotel as a base as didn't want to spend any more time there.
The best attribute of this hotel was the staff as they were very helpful and friendly ",4,2017,04,25
35,Excellent!,"Can't fault this hotel. Great location. Service from the staff was first class. Nice big rooms. Glass of bubbly whilst checking in was a nice touch! Had a meal in the restaurant one night and it was delicious! Food was excellent as was the service from the waitress. Nothing was a bother and she answered all our questions about the menu. If you like fine dining, then would recommend you give this a try!",5,2017,04,22
35,the Barcelona Cruise Ports,"Hotel Eurostars Grand Marina has a very nice location over looking the Barcelona Cruise Ports. It is very near to Rambala area which is very famous as a touristic attraction where you can find everything you intend to buy.
Also it is near to the Aquarium. In front of the hotel there is a bus station to take you to heart of the city. Also it is ideal to to walk along the sea promenade.",5,2017,04,14
35,Great service,"Beautiful hotel
Service provides pleasant and care. 
Very peaceful 
Very silent area. 
5 minutes walking from the Rambla and from the marina shoping center 
Tasted the room service
It was quick warm and tasty 
Recommended. ",5,2017,04,14
35,Nice but not 5 star,"Situated in the port area on the sea front, very convenient for the bus tours and Las Ramblas. Rooms were very nice (we had an outside room) Breakfast had a wide selection. Hotel presented well but not quite as ultra modern as it looks on the photos. 

My only criticisms : They way they handled the payment for the room. I booked for my boyfriends birthday so chose to book a room that was 'strictly prepay only' so the cost was a secret only to find that the hotel didn't take the payment (due to the hotel not being full & hoping we'd spend more) so when we checked in the cost was revealed - minor point but still unprofessional. We did get offered a free drink as an apology....but when we checked out we were charged for one of them as it wasn't on the free drink list!

All in all it's a nice hotel and there are some really good points. I perhaps would say 5 star is a stretch but it's certainly convenient & a good location.
",4,2017,04,14
35,Excellent stay at the habour,Excellent Hotel. Very friendly staff. Very quiet. Large rooms and bathrooms. Very good location. Directly at the habour and very near to the city. Bus in front of the hotel. Rooms with sea- or cityview. Good breakfast-buffet.,5,2017,04,11
35,Revisit,"When I went the first time it was a nice hotel, friendly helpful staff, clean suite. This time it was really tired. The staff were all clearly overworked and underpaid. The suite looked as though it hadn't been decorated in the five years since I last stayed. Very disappointing.",3,2017,04,08
35,Fantastic City Break,"I booked this city break as an Xmas gift for my good lady. As she had never been abroad and this was our first holiday together, without the kids, I wanted to spoil her. 
This Hotel was fantastic, a short 20 min drive from the Airport and within walking distance of the Heart of the city. The staff are fantastic and really helpful. The Hotel itself is more of a conference centre than a holiday hotel but this didn't bother us at all. ",5,2017,04,04
35,Excellent Hotel and very good value for money,"Eurostars Grand Marina is everything you would expect from a very good hotel. I would say it is excellent value for money considering it is impeccably clean and staff are very attentive.
Highly recommend.",5,2017,04,01
35,Luxurious hotel in great location,"Room was amazingly large and plush, first time in my travel I was tempted enough to take a bath..  staff is very friendly and helpful.  location wise, if you're up for walks, in great area to walk to sites or along port with open markets and streets lined with weekend vendors offering local goods..  It was nice walk from hotel down La Rambla by Palau Guell to lots of shopping..",5,2017,03,30
35,Very outdated and rundown!,"I was captivated by the photos that they have cleverly marketed to get you to the hotel!

The staff was amazing (so i cannot fault that).

But unfortunately the place was so run down and terribly outdated. The rooms looked old and 20 years out of date.

There was no atmosphere at all, the bar was always empty and the food hall did not seem to be used?

I paid nearly £400 for two nights. For this price you could get so much better elsewhere so do your homework. I thought i did and was let down as soon as i got there. 

I must stress though, that the staff was very good and very helpfull.",2,2017,03,28
35,Nice but not really for us,"Stayed here for 3 nights. The room was lovely with modern furniture and decor. The view from the room was a bit disappointing tho. It just looked out over a massive courtyard surrounded by the tall trade centre offices. We were right down on the water but couldn't even seen a tiny bit. 
We've stayed in Eurostars before and it was a lovely intimate experience but the high ceilings and big open spaces at this hotel like the breakfast room felt like you were staying at a conference centre or airport rather than a romantic retreat. The pool was closed and so was the roof top bar. Bit disappointing all round really as the weather was still hot. 
The breakfast was amazing and the staff were friendly although the one request we made to reception for some hair conditioner took about an hour and a half to fulfil. 
Was it terrible? No, it was clean and a nice experience but I would stay somewhere else next time.",3,2017,03,24
35,Top class...,"Hotel was fantastic in every department, location is great but you do need to be prepared to walk a bit which we love. Only thing that I was disappointed in was I made several requests when booking the room and none were met. The room was booked 4 months in advance so I would have thought at least 1 would have been met but it wasn't to be, the bell boy did come to the room the day after we arrived to move us to a room with a balcony but we had unpacked everything and it wasn't a sea or city facing one. 

Will definitely be back to this hotel, the views over the city from the roof area were tremendous...",5,2017,03,22
35,First class,"Stayed here for a long weekend away with my partner. The hotel is gorgeous and rooms are massive! The shower was spa quality! Finishing touches like complimentary drink on arrival and little packaged sweets in lobby added something special. Was also very impressed with the gym and not to mention the staff are lovely! Definitely 5 star!

35,"Old fashion, interesting location","Grand Marina is a good option for those who are spending vacations of those big ships and need to stay on dry land for a couple of nights to enjoy the attractions of Barcelona. You can feel old fashion in this hotel. Lots of dark wood, marvel, heavy curtains. Breakfast is ok, but at Sunday 10 am some products are missing and you can see empty plates. So for those who like to sleep... Overall impression is great. Worth of those 5 stars.",4,2017,03,19
35,One of the best ,"Great location , the service is great the breakfast- a dream come true - rooms clean and spacious, 
Worthwhile the cost and I'm sure the we haven't seen all I really have nothing to add but to say - go there 

",5,2017,03,18
35,"Great hotel, a little out of the way","This is a great hotel! Situated right in the port and with amazing views across Barcelona. As most of the attractions we planned to see were more central the location of this hotel was a little out of the way. Not a problem if you enjoy a walk (which we do), but if you like to be in the middle of everything then this is probably the wrong hotel. Having said that this is a great hotel. On arrival we were served welcome drinks and given a drinks voucher for the hotel lounge bar, which is spacious and contemporary. We were originally given a beautiful room on the 5th floor and once we had unpacked we noticed there was a split in one of the floor boards. We mentioned this to the receptionist and went to explore the city. When we returned the receptionist told us they were unable to fix the floor and were moving us to a different room! The new room was even better, almost panoramic views across the port and Barcelona. We could even see La Sagrada Familia! The staff are wonderful and really go out of their way to make you feel welcome and valued! We ordered room service on one occasion and as it was my partners birthday that week they even sent him a birthday note and free chocolate cake! A really nice touch to an amazing visit! X",4,2017,03,10
35,Great location and rooms adequate enough for a few days stay,"I stayed here a few years ago, so this is not the best review to read. However, I could not fault the hotel to be honest. It was my stag weekend, so I did not obviously spend too much either in the hotel, but what time I did spend there was perfectly fine and adequate. Drinks a little expensive, but to be expected. I would stay here again.",4,2017,03,07
35,Fantastic weekend at Barcelona,"We were warmly welcomed by the people of the hotel and our room was upgraded to a city Suite. The room was excellent as well as the location. Although we didn't spend much time at the hotel we really enjoyed the time we spend there. Bathroom was very clean and very nice and the bed was very comfortable.
Breakfast was really nice and there was live music with violin very pleasant. There were local delicacies especially cheeses and cured meat products. I would expect some more local delicacies regarding sweets but in total the breakfast was very nice and the space was nice as well. There is also open space which I guess it will work during summer.
Definitely a 5* hotel!!
I would recommend it without any hesitation!",5,2017,03,07
35,Top!,"Have been in this hotel few months ago.
Everything amazing! Nice,clean and comfotable rooms. U Can reach The Most famous Place in few minutes. Nice pepole working There...in the lobby bar rally Nice cocktail, The italian boy (Nico think it's name) iS AMAZING! It s always a Good thing To have a drink  made by his hand  'cos The woderfull atmosphere He creates. Hope I ll be Back Soon. .",5,2017,03,04
35,Far far far away from 5*,"Our visit began when Booking.com did not cancel the reservation. Well it did on the site- but not in the hotel. So it was no longer showing in our reservations list but on a certain day the hotel took the money. 
Ok, $500 is not that big deal for 2 nights stay we got. But unpleasant surprise.

Personnel mostly unfriendly. Especially women- that was so funny to watch their arrogance..

Our shower cabin was ruined. And it wasn't fixed during the stay. At all.
When I got after Barcelona half marathon to the hotel and asked whether I can have some time after checkout to have a shower, girl on reception made such an unhappy face and for 15 minutes has been telling me what a bad person I am and how full is the hotel (it was hardly 10-15 people on breakfast. Hello, February!). Anyway ""every minute counts, there are people who are already waiting for my (!) room. By the way it was noon (12:00). And check in is only possible at 15:00. But people are waiting. For my magical room with ruined shower. Huh. Anyway I got my half an hour for shower. HUGE THANK YOU FOR LECTURING NOW I UNDERSTAND WHAT A BAD PERSON I AM! I WILL NEVER DO THE SAME WITH YOU! 
Be sure I won't. I'd better Airbnb than grand marina 5*",2,2017,03,02
35,"Large rooms, friendly service, good breakfast, great bar","Stayed four nights during Mobile World Congress and paid the commensurate ridiculous pillage rate which is customary for 5 star hotels in Barcelona during that event. Rooms are very large and the young extremely friendly Catalans provide great service with a smile. The breakfast buffet was expansive and high quality, the bar had an amazing selection, 24/7 gym was adequate but clearly needs more aerobic equipment with personal TV to match 5 star expectations. Location at the bottom of the Ramblas is good for a nice long walk to capture the popular tourist sites.",4,2017,03,02
35,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed for one night as we were catching the ferry to Alcudia the next day, really nice Hotel, very good service, excellent breakfast and a very nice room, we had a room on the front of the hotel, it was huge, the bathroom was amazing and also huge, we would have stayed longer for sure had we the time, would thoroughly recommend for long or short stay.
Even better for us the ferry to Alcudia was literally a stones throw away, we checked out at midday, left our bags at the hotel foc, did our sightseeing and returned at 9pm to board the ferry.
Very nice and would definitely stay again.

35,"Nice hotel, great location.","Lovely room,nice and clean. City view from the balcony which was lovely. Rooftop pool and bathing area with great views across ocean / port / Cruise dock. Brilliant position just at the end of the Ramblas. *big minus was a (known) leak of water once the shower was on, meaning both myself and partner slipped whilst climbing out of shower. Staff were very abrupt and quite dismissive about my partners injury ( which actually was a fracture).  So lovely hotel but not so lovely staff. Will not be going back",3,2017,02,14
35,Five star if you so like.,"Rooms are spacious but a little overdated. Freandly staff and good breakfast. Close to Ramblas to walk. Maybe more like a convention hotel rather than what you look for
romantic time. Hotel bar is expensive.

Nice gym and good sauna.",3,2017,02,13

35,I strongly recommend this hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for three nights and found all the staff extremely helpful and very friendly. 

Rooms were a good size and the beds were comfortable. They had also pillow menu, from which you could choose from around 6 different types.

Upon arrival we were greeted with a glass of bubbly and smiles from all the lobby staff. 

The concierge and staff gave great recommendations on places to go. We also managed to get complimentary entry to all the clubs along with a vip queue jump from the concierge desk in the lobby.   ",5,2017,02,12
35,Highly recommend ,"Friendly staff, clean rooms, room service is good & fast, the rooms in 3rd floor is for smokers, location is great & the view is awesome.. 
I recommend who looking for quiet to stay in this hotel. in my next visit to Barcelona I will book again.. ",5,2017,02,09
35,Great Hotel ,"The hotel is located in the port. Its a little bit walk to la rambla but it was ok for us. Since we love to stay close to the sea. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. 

Loved the lounge bar with its relaxing atmosphere daily live music. 

The staff are very helpful. I have to give credit to the concierge for recommending the greatest restaurants for us. 

The only negative comment I have is for the room service. It was a bit slow. And on some days the housekeeping did not clean our room properly and forgot a toilet cleaner in the bathroom. ",4,2017,02,09
35,Modern but needs character,"This is a good hotel with excellent facilities and is served by tourist buses.

Don't expect exciting views if you 'face' the sea as there are other buildings in the way.

The staff here are wonderful, especially at check in, at the bar and at breakfast.

The hotel is situated away from the main historic area of the city, so if you're looking for a more authentic experience of the place I would suggest looking elsewhere.

The rooms are very spacious and feature excellent bathrooms and very comfortable beds.",4,2017,02,06
35,Location Location Location - but no charm.,"This is a wonderful location for easy walking and exploring. Professional, however, no special ambiance. Located in the Trade Centre complex - (end of the pier) means no noise and a business hotel feel. If you stay here - do yourself a favor and get out and about - even for breakfast. Has a very small roof pool that if wonderful at night (ie: when the kids have gone to bed).",3,2017,01,31
35,Excellent location.,"Stayed here for a night.

The welcome and check in was efficient and warm.

Our room was big and spacious. From the looks it is a truly five star hotel.  Our room was equipped with a walk in closet, Massage bath and great city views.

The beds where very comfortable, with the choice of pillows which was an added touch.

The hotel is less than a 10 minute walk from the metro station and port vello, where you can find ample shops and restaurants , not to mention La ramba being also a few minutes walk from here.

Taxis are parked outside, so hardly any wait if you need one.

They also sent us a slate of truffle chocolates and apple juice thanking us for staying with them, this was an amazing touch.

Overall a very nice clean hotel with great staff.

However I do have a fee nit pickings, for a 5* star hotel, the rooms had no robes, the amenities where just a basic soap, shampoo and shower gel, no toothbrush, no shaving kit,no soft tissues

The shower head was full of limescale, and the bath edge where the tiles meet where wearing off. 

The male sauna was very dated and off putting.( didn't use it)

The room prices are good value for money,  if you want a decent place with added luxury, in the midst of what Barcelona has to offer , then highly recommend you stay here",4,2017,01,30
35,Fabulous 5 star hotel and staff.,"Great location, big rooms and although I did not have room with view because there was no chance the room satisfied my expectations. 
I was welcomed by a handsome doorman that was extremely friendly ande helpful. He was always there with a smile to ask me how was my day , provide me with an umbrella, order a taxi... the girls at the front desk are lovely. I arrived at the same time with a group ande they took me to the another desk inmediately . Very professional welcome and departure. Private shuttle service to the airport  . Good breakfast , charming and cozy lobby.  Recomended 100%.",5,2017,01,26
35,Good Hotel in a Convenient Location,"Overall this was a very positive experience, nice bedrooms, very friendly and helpful staff and the rooms were clean and well maintained. The rooms were also inspected each day (stayed 4 nights) while we were there by the house keeping supervisor. The location is good for access to the city centre and las rambla. The hotel is situated in the World Trade Centre in the harbour area. We read some reviews that suggested you should be wary walking here at night as it is a quiet area. We walked (wife and I) from the city centre each night to the hotel and did not witness anything and saw no sign of undesirables. However, you should always be on alert no matter where you are. A couple of negatives, there is no atmosphere in the bar, it is not cosy as it is a large barn/warehouse like area (high ceilings, 2-3 floors up) and the tapas are expensive and do not compare to what you can get downtown. The breakfast is good but make sure you ask for hot coffee and avoid the waffles if they are not fresh (waffles can be sitting there for a while).",4,2017,01,26
35,Highly recommended,"I love the overlooking view of the marina, the bed is very comfortable, everything that's being expected from a five-star hotel, impeccably clean, it's seems that everybody was doing their job, from the receptionist, chambermaid, porter, doorman and etc. I definitely recommend it.",4,2017,01,24
35,Lovely yet had Mould in the bathroom,"Being tucked away from the main road, external noises are minimal, and internal noises depend on how quiet or loud your neighbours are as rooms are not sound proofed. We heard our neighbour talk and laugh with a group of friends at 1am followed by some heavy snoring for the duration of their stay. 

Block-out curtains do a good job blocking the morning light to enable sleep-ins. The staff are courteous and helpful. 

Was dismayed at the sight of mould growing on bathroom tiles especially given that the place had been recently renovated. The shower fixture was fancier than it needed to be and took a little while to work out how it works. 

If you have an opportunity, have breakfast there and enjoy watching the sun rise over the water waking up the city. A good variety of breakfast items to choose from. ",4,2017,01,16
35,The meaning of customer satisfaction,"We received Warm welcomes from everyone working in this hotel. 
The receptionist provided us with all needed information when she knew that this is the first visit to Barcelona. She also advised me to get and plan my activities via her colleagues in the Concierge. We received a call After 10 minutes from our checking in to ensure that we are fine and if we need any assistance. 

Transportation: Taxi cars are available in front of the hotel most of the time. Also, most of tourists' buses have station/stops just in front of the hotel. 

Location: it is on the World Trade Center where you can enjoy big ships and cruise park in the port. Its 15 minutes from one of the famous streets ""La Rambla"". There is a nice small mall and restaurants located in the port within 15 min walk where you can enjoy the sunset. 

The aquarium center is just 30 min walk from the hotel. 

",4,2017,01,11
35,"Beautiful hotel with breathtaking views, great location","My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel shortly after Christmas and were pleasantly delighted.  We arrived to a beautiful hotel right on the harbor.  The staff was VERY helpful and friendly.  Our standard room was large with  a window the length of our entire wall overlooking the marina/harbor! Gorgeous!!! The bed was very comfortable.  The room had a slightly odd scent but that would be my only complaint.  There is a rooftop bar at this hotel with views all over Barcelona! The hotel is in a great location, very close walk to the Metro and La Rambla.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to others!",5,2017,01,10
35,Good hotel for short breaks. Gets quite boring for longer stay!,"The room in which we were staying, was spacious and had a beautiful view. Breakfast offers a variety of choices, and quite good when you have certain food intolerances. Good option for children. Room service is also good. A bit limited options for dinner at the restaurant, however, if you opt dining at the hotel restaurant you would love it! Personnel are friendly, especially, the breakfast service shift. They are very helpful. 

A few improvements are warranted: we had triple room, both beds needed maintenance or change! Bathroom had layers of dust (on the phone wires, corners of the bath, and other corners of the bathroom), conciergerie, while helpful at times, requires additional staffing and knowledge to sharing with the clients. Finally, we strongly advise the hotel to invest in floor insulation material. For two nights in a row, it was difficult for us to sleep due to some noisy guests with children (although we have our own). It was quite unpleasant to be woken up by the screams and running of a child a 1a.m! 

The hotel is easily accessible by public transportation and in a walking distance of many museums, the Aquarium and other sightseeing places. 

We do recommend this hotel.",4,2017,01,08
35,Very good hotel by the sea,"Nice staff, good service, bar with terrace, comfortable rooms mune was with wonderful sea view. One of the most proper 5 star hotels in Spain. Not quite a 5 star when compared with some other countries but it is among the best I have seen in Spain when compared to the others. Complete and very satisfying breakfast, with wide range of choices and overall everything clean as expected. It is quite central, I am not able to understand the ""not central location"" critics. 10 minute walk to la rambla, staying at the centre of the city but still keeping the distance from all the fuss out there. All and all one of the best in Barcelona. ",5,2017,01,07
35,Perfect location for a mini break,"Clean and comfortable although for the price the bedrooms were a little on the small side. Beautiful bathrooms. Cant fault service of staff and great gym. 
Ideally located for Las Rambas and the centre of the city. Great veiws from our room.
Highly recommended.",5,2016,12,29
35,Birthday treat,"Did a three day weekend break at this hotel. Very central for all our needs.  Staff, service excellent, a very warm welcome, nothing too much trouble.
Standard of room excellent especially the bed really comfortable.
",5,2016,12,16
35,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed for two nights at the Grand Marina Hotel for our company conference in December. It was an ideal venue. The location is great, the rooms nice and the hotel staff very helpful and accommodating. We used the conference facilities on the top floor are of of a very high standard and I have to say that nothing was too much trouble for the management team at the hotel. We will return.",5,2016,12,15
35,Fully functional!,"I normally stay at The W but they were full and this place was nearby and a lot better value, so I decided to give it a try for my two night stay in the city. The location is great, a short 5 min walk to Ras Lambas, so really central with a taxi rank at the hotel. The hotel is on the Marina so some rooms have Marina views. The two things that were standout for me were the staff, 10 out of 10. From the Bellman to the Receptionist to the Barman, everyone seemed to be on point. The second thing that deserves a clear mention is the EXCELLENT array of food for the buffet breakfast. It's up there with some of the best I've seen. The one complaint I had was that my cappuccino wasn't very hot, the waiter (I wish I could remember his name) explained that for speed they use a machine but if I waited one minute he would go and make me one using a proper barista style machine. Not only that, the next morning he did the same without question. The rooms are nice, well furnished and quiet. The gym is a good size for a hotel and has good, functioning, modern equipment.
TOP MARKS to all involved with running the hotel.",5,2016,12,08
35,An unexpected trip to Barcelona,"The hotel is in a great location, within walking distance of Le Rambla and the guided tourist bus routes.

The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was lovely, but the tea provided in the room and at breakfast was awful.  

Other than the bar in the evenings we didn't use any of the other hotel facilities.  So I'm not able to comment on them.  I would definitely stay at the hotel again.",4,2016,12,07
35,Eurostar was the best,"Great hotel, lovely rooms and bathrooms - Hotel STAFF was the BEST! Everyone from the desk were so incredibly helpful and friendly.  All of our needs were taken care of from the point we arrived to when we left.",5,2016,12,05
35,Fine Hotel and Friendly Staff,"the hotel was fine, our room had a very nice sea view. the staff were very friendly and helpful specially Isaac who was very friendly, very helpful and he provided us with all the information we needed about the city.
the hotel was clean and the location is very good close to Ramblas and the close to the port.",4,2016,12,01
35,Grand Marina is Grand,"We stayed in this hotel for a few nights prior to a cruise and enjoyed it. The hotel is in an excellent location as it is close to the cruise ship docks and it is also an easy walk to La Rambla, Montjuic and Sant Sabastia Beach. The rooms are modern and clean. The staff are friendly and accommodating. The restaurant is very good but if you have jet lag and miss the breakfast seating, you can sit down in the lounge and order whatever you want as a late breakfast. In the evening it is nice to have dinner outside in the quiet courtyard away from the hustle and bustle of the city. At first, I thought our room overlooking the courtyard was second rate because we could not see the city. Later, I realized these courtyard rooms were quieter and probably more popular.",4,2016,11,27
35,Great Place to Stay Before Catching a Cruise Ship and great for Las Ramblas and the Beach,"Very modern hotel  Great restaurant and bar with outdoor space. Lovely roof top deck with 360o views with bar which sadly was closed as colder time of year. Rooms gorgeous, large. Windows open. Balconies.. Amazing bathrooms. I was ill andthe FABULOUS  Ponce (reception) kindly gave us a room early so I could rest in comfort. That was so wonderful and unique too! Thank you Ponce. Hop on-Hop Off buses virtually outside hotel too",5,2016,11,22
35,Great location ,"The hotel is situated on the port with a short walk to almost anywhere in Barcelona. Also the room was very nice. The only issue that I had was the fact that my room was supposed to have a balcony which it didn't, and it faced the World Trade Center so all I had to look at was office cubicles. The staff was great though. ",3,2016,11,20
35,Terrible service,"I had a 5 day stay. For the first 4 days, my room had nothing but boiling hot water and no cold water. For the last day, I only had cold water and no hot water. The hotel moved me twice during my stay. As if the problem was just with my room. In the 5 days, all 3 rooms I occupied had this problem. I had to 'shower' at the hand basin with the boiling hot water, together with bottled cold water. Omg!!! This is supposed to be a 5 star hotel! No thank you. DON'T STAY HERE. ",1,2016,11,15
35,Excellent hotel ...aw,"We checked in to this amazing hotel Eurostars Grand Marina hotel for 4 days during our honeymoon in Barcelona.it was an amazing experience.The hotel staff upgraded us to   a sea view room which was amazing.. we could view the Mediterranean sea and the marina right from our room....The reception staff was excellent..as soon as we arrived, she gave us a map of Barcelona and told us about all the important places to visit in Barcelona. 

The hotel is very well connected to all major points, 15 minutes by taxi from the airport, la rambla is a 5 minute walk, the hop on hop off bus has a stop right outside the hotel.. I would rate it a 5 on 5 experience...thank you Eurostars Grand Marina for an excellent experience.

Truly outstanding

35,Wonderful view Good service ,"actually I have been in Barcelona from 26 Nov to 30 Nov 2015.
It's one of my best trips to Europe, specially with this Hotel.
Amazing view
Good service 
Room size reasonable 
Great location,  near by La Ramba street 5 minutes walking only.

",5,2016,11,10
35,Big and comfortabel but far,Big hotel close to the sea with good views but locacion is not good for shopping. the hiotel has goos service and very fast too. its very far to walt to shops but Ramblas is ok. good service to take guests to the airport.,4,2016,11,06
35,Very well managed hotel,"Excellent location, well trained staff and a well managed hotel. It's modern and could be anywhere in Europe but I would certainly stay here again. The cruise ships and ferries that flank the peninsula (upon which the hotel is built) give the impression  that you could easily set sail. ",5,2016,11,05
35,Too many problems for the price,"CONS:
I spent about 4 nights at this hotel and ran into the following issues:

1) Toilet was broken
2) Unable to close curtains for privacy.  My room faced onto Barcelona World Trade Center immediately next door
3) For 2 days had either poor water pressure or cold water
4) Elevator broke down for nearly half the day

PROS:
The staff were very courteous and helpful.  Definitely professional.  
The breakfast buffet was great.
It's only a 10 minute walk to the main tourist strip (La Rambla), the subway or the train statation.  Cabs can easily reach you too.

OVERALL:
This hotel is charging a hefty price as it's meant to be 'luxury'.  However, I experienced too many problems in the hotel while staying in Barcelona for just less than a week.  It does not justify the price.",2,2016,10,31
35,great stay,Great vacation just a shame we were quiet far from beech. Staff at the hotrl were cery helpful and we're happy to talk and help ud in English. We stayed in the Marine Suite which was excellent and had fabulous views of the city if  we are in Barcelona again soon  we will be sure to return to the Grandstar Marina.,5,2016,10,30
35,4-star hotel at a 5-star price,"Rooms are reasonable. Somewhat thin sound isolation so you need to wish for a quite neighbour.
The food is fine but the service people are experts at avoiding your look. Many times we had to wait to order, to be served, to get the bill. Checking in and out also required patience as there were queues.
On the whole the place is ok but is priced as s 5 Star hotel which it is not. 4-stars is being generous.
No bus shuttle to the airport. The hotel will fix that at 95 Euro. A taxi cost us 28 Euro.",2,2016,10,26
35,Amazing ,"We have stayed at this hotel twice this year. Couldn't rate it enough. Lovely clean room , friendly professional staff . I would definitely come back . Breakfast is amazing to 👍
The pool is only small but it has a great view , overlooking the port 
The fitness Center is ok , gets the job done 
Love this hotel ",5,2016,10,26
35,Great hotel. Modern.,"Very modern hotel, with great space rooms. Very clean, nice . The bed just perfect for sleep. Bathroom space with great shower. The only minus that i was charged twice for room. I mean that one day before arrival the amount for room and one i checked in one more. It looks that You need to have more money on the card. I belive that this is just the blocked amount.",4,2016,10,26
35,right on the marina,"This hotel is in a great location - always easy to find your way back too.

Rooms are clean, modern and comfortable.

Rooftop bar is ok not as good as some other hotels we have stayed at in Barcelona…

All in all would highly recommend this hotel for a short city break.",4,2016,10,23
35,Great attention to detail,"This hotel has an international feel with multi-national guests staying, and some important conferences and events regularly held here. Buffet breakfast has everything you could possibly imagine. The food served in the bar and restaurant are of a very high standard and the staff are very attentive. Has all the extras you would expect from a 5 star hotel - pillow menu, chocolates on the bed, knowledgeable and friendly staff, etc. Located a short walk away from the bottom of Las Ramblas, and beside Maremagnum shopping centre, the marina and Barceloneta beach so we found it ideal as a base to have a quiet and restful night after exploring the city.",5,2016,10,22
35,Wonderful Location,"This hotel is perfectly located next to the marina and only 5 minutes walk from La Rambla. If your room is located on the east side of the building you can enjoy a panoramic view of the city. However friends who accompanied me were located on the south side of the hotel and were troubled by the noise from cruise ships that were moored immediately i n front of their window blocking out any view. The service is delivered by friendly, courteous and efficient staff. The buffet breakfast is extensive and varied. Unfortunately the rooftop bar was closed due to previous bad weather but it affords wonderful views over the city.",4,2016,10,22
35,Excellent hotel ,Me and my son stayed here for 4 nights and it was an excellent hotel. It is in a great location. The breakfast was really good with plenty of choices. The room was very spacious and very clean. The next time I visit Barcelona I will most definitely stay here. ,5,2016,10,18
35,Not 5 Star but good,"Excellent location and good service but falls far short of being a 5 Star hotel.   Room was good but lighting was poor especially in bathroom.  One sink drain never worked.   We latter joined a tour group tour and the 4 Star hotel was equal and one third the price.     Rate it a ""3"" based on $ value to quality.",3,2016,10,17
35,Great location!!,"A cheeky city break to Barcelona, before booking this hotel i read reviews on this hotel and it ticked all the boxes for me. I would recommend prestige.com for a good deal. 

On arrival at the airport, we decided to catch Aerobus from the airport to the city centre. €5.90 per adult and this is a great way to travel and it cost next to nothing. It took approx 30 minutes from and to the city centre, depending on traffic. We got off at Plaza Catalunya and this is around the corner from La Rambla, it took 25minutes to walk to the hotel. We fancied a walk and stop for a drink on route. 

This hotel is approx 10minutes walk away from La Rambla and it's a pleasant walk. The staff were friendly and the check in procedure was speedy. We were given free room upgrade on arrival because it was my wife's birthday, with great views of the city from the balcony. The lobby area is spacious and well maintained. 

The room was very spacious for a city break hotel, with all facilities available. The decor was good and the bathroom was clean. 

The views from the rooftop were great and I enjoyed a drink in the evening, with a slight breeze. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel it's near the sights but not in your face. You can get the tour bus from outside the hotel and after a long day out there's nothing better than getting dropped off outside the hotel. 

I felt comfortable approaching staff at the hotel and no request was too much to ask. Room service was spot on and I can't fault my stay. I would book this hotel again if I visit Barcelona. 

Tour bus cost €28 per adult
If you can book your tickets in advance for Park Guell, I would highly recommend this because when we arrived there was no entry to the park for couple of hours and we purchased tickets for the following day but it rained and we didn't go!!. €8.00 per adult. 

I read about pickpockets operating in the city centre, I didn't witness any crime but this doesn't mean you stop being vigilant. It's like any city in the world if your gonna have valuables on display then you will attract criminals. If you act like a tourist then you will be a prime target. 

Great city and loads to do. Thank you Eurostars grand marina for making our stay special. See ya soon.

35,Soulless but efficient ,"Hotel is in a great location, we were at the front of the hotel, you can hear the ferries and cruise ships come and go, but is not abig deal. The hotel is very clean. The room was large but very dark, hard to read at night. The staff were great. We ate in one night, which was very good. Breakfast lots of it and varied. It's just a bit cold and doesn't have a comfy feeling. ",4,2016,10,14
35,seems they dont honor what they say when you book on their website,"the hotel is well situated , but we supposed to have welcome drinks and late check out , after using their website when booking, but neither of both were honored.

 the telephones on the rooms didn't work for the 4 days, and we had issues with the hot water. Also the deluxe room was a little weird.  when you call for ice hey say they will charge you. staff was very nice altho they always expect the tips to be nicer...",3,2016,10,12
35,Wonderful hotel at the Marina in Barcelona ,"Very clean rooms. Very friendly and helpful staff. Convenient location. We had breakfast at the hotel every morning and enjoyed the quality and convenience. You can walk to a lot of places and it is close to transportation. I was concerned that because of its location, it might be a bit noisy. But it wasn't! We also looked at staying in the Gothic section, but we were glad choose the Eurostars. My wife felt that the mattress was a bit hard, but I didn't notice. We would definitely go back to this hotel.",4,2016,10,11
35,Great location and easy access to Cruise terminal.,Very well served by Ponce during check in. Large clean room with a great terrace and although hotel was very busy staff still managed to keep a smile on their face. Breakfast is varied and very good. Will definitely return. Thank you Eurostars Grand Marina,5,2016,10,09
35,Premier rooms and below no view,"Unless you are booked into a junior suite and above you will not get a view of the sea or harbour except for the offices of the WTC. So I suggest if you are going to stay here you might as well book a standard room. The premium room we got upgraded to looks like the deluxe we booked. I believe the difference is that it has a balcony. Unfortunately the balcony is overlooked by the offices opposite. So the upgrade really didn't amount to anything. The room was decently furnished with all the usual amenities. The feel of the hotel is a poor 3-star, the lobby is dated, the hotel exterior looks like an office block and the hotel corridors are dark with a funny smell of stale alcohol (4th floor). The room service menu was missing and amenities were not adequately provided in our room (no QC). To top it all there is a nightclub at the back of the hotel. So if you are after a good night sleep, you are not going to get any here (we were on the 4th floor). I certainly be avoiding this hotel next time I'm in town.",2,2016,10,08

35,Not up to expectation,We stayed here before our cruise. It was well located but would class it very much as a business hotel. There was no ambience. Roos and staff were nice but definitely not five star. It was a Saturday evening but maximum of six in the bar all evening and breakfast time just a four slice toaster which caused queues as our four slice toaster at home was much faster.,3,2016,10,02
35,We miss our club suite already!!,"This is one of the nicest hotel during our Europe trip thanks to my boyfriend’s big surprise and friendly staff. We stayed in a club suite in the 8th floor, and the suite was beyond our expectation. The interior design was cool, and the balcony was just so huge with awesome view. From there, we could see the lovely harbor spreading towards the horizon. It”s so romantic at night.
My boyfriend also got a surprise for me in which he and the staff prepared a romantic plan which included chocolate, fruit, champagne, and a letter with very neat handwriting. Everything minor detail was taken good care of. Staff were smiling all the time and handled things in a snap.
Though food at the hotel’s piano bar-restaurant at the 1st floor was not as what we expected, but breakfast was really nice.
We would love to come back here!",5,2016,10,02
35,"5 Star Location, but then it’s quickly down hill","I don’t know what organization rated this hotel as 5-Star, but it should be ashamed! This is, by far, the poorest performing 5 Star hotel that we’ve patronized.

Location 
Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel is located on a pier. It has a great location to develop a 5 Star facility, but it has a lot to improve.

Front Desk 
As an observer, I noticed that often 2 or 3 people were attending a single customer. 

We arrived at the hotel about 12:30pm.  We were told that our room was vacant, but not ready. It would be ready at 3 pm (customary check-in time).  At 3 pm, our room was not ready.  At 3:20 pm I was told that I would be put in another room that was ready.  At 3:30 pm, I was told that alternate room was also not ready. That’s when My Lady entered the discussion and demanded financial reimbursement for the time we did not have lodging. The original room, a Marina Suite, was available in 5 minutes. 

I was given a room number and keys and told that our luggage would be sent up. I refused the luggage delivery offer and said that I would do it myself. They had already shown that front desk operations were unreliable.  That’s when someone, who later referred to himself as the general manager, took the dolly that contained our luggage and went to our room with us.  

Marina Suite
When we entered the room, I noticed that the balcony was bare of chairs and a table.  The ‘general manager’ said that he would have them delivered.  When after 2 hours there had been no delivery. I called the front desk and someone delivered 2 chairs.  When I inquired about the table, I was told that NO table is allowed on ANY balcony in the hotel. (I chose the Marina Suite, in part, because of the table and chairs were, and still is at the time of this review, shown on the hotel’s website.) We never got a table.

Mini-bar Service
We were charged for liquor which was not consumed (not a single bottle of liquor was consumed). We were charged for bottles of water not consumed. The hotel provided 2 bottles of water each day without charge. You are charged for any additional bottles.  We never drank more than those 2 bottles but were charged for more anyway.

Restaurant 
When in the restaurant and bar area and look up at the ceiling in the far left corner, you immediately observe a large area of stain marks from leaking plumbing.  The blonde wood floors have black stain marks on it. 

We ate on the patio several times. On one occasion when the waiter disappeared, I walked inside to sign for my bill.  The waiter saw me and told me that he had forgotten that My Lady and I were out there on the patio.

I purchased the Romantic Diner package which we had on the patio as darkness was approaching.  The diner and service was excellent (a rare 5-Star event.)  The more than 7-course meal began with a single onion … and ended with assorted ice cream which was followed by a variety of chocolate balls.

The food was generally of very good quality (paella, street food, etc.), but service was lacking.

Black Marina Terrace 
Located on the roof of the hotel, the view from the Black Marina Terrace is spectacular. Then, its all down hill.  My drink was described as pineapple juice, mango juice and rum.  All I tasted was water.  We ate a dish with noodles and shellfish, which was good.  I asked for some Tabasco.  When the waiter didn’t bring it, I went to the bar for some.  The waiter saw me and told me that he had forgotten about it.

Rooftop Pool
The pool is small and about 4 feet deep. It’s clean and great for a wet cool down. There were insufficient lounge chairs for the guests.  Some were actually laying on the cement while waiting for a chair to become available,
And, there was no overcrowding.

Breakfast Buffet 
The breakfast buffet is about as close as the hotel gets to a 5-Star performer.  The staff is well trained and diligent. The food is standard fare and offered no variety during the 6 times we ate there.  I ate some smoked salmon with capers and red onion almost daily.  On the last day there, the red onion was nowhere to be found.

Overall cleanliness 
Our room was well cleaned, but the balcony was never cleaned and it looked like it hadn’t been for some time.  The hallway carpet was dirty with lots of spill marks on it. It had not been cleaned or spot cleaned in quite some time.

Housekeeping 
We were provided with 2 towel sets each day.  There were no extra towels of any kind.  On one occasion, we were provided only 1 face cloth.  We reported it at the front desk when we returned from diner.  We were told that one would be brought up to us immediately.  The cloth never arrived.

Concierge
When we approached the concierge for assistance, the was very slow to acknowledge us even though we were the only guests at the desk.  I don’t know what concierge was doing, but My Lady remarked about the lack of attentiveness.

Valet 
The team that signals for your taxi, helps with your luggage, helps you in and out of the taxi, and tells the taxi driver where you want to go … is on the ball!

>>>>>>>>>>>
Airport Transfers  - I suggest that if you arrive in Terminal 1, use a taxi. (The private transfer services that I contacted depart from Terminal 2. That means after you get your luggage, you must get on a shuttle to carry you to Terminal 2 to then get in your private vehicle.)  The cost to the hotel was 26 euros (including luggage fee), the return trip, including fees, was 30 euros.",2,2016,09,30
35,Luxurious Hotel with Amazing Views,"Stayed here with my fiance for a treat whilst on a city break here.
This is the second time I have stopped here and it was just as amazing as the first.
We had a junior suites with a view out the mountain on one side and to the side a view of the marina.
The room was luxury and a great size but the bathroom was just amazing. There was a huge walking shower with a separate bath.
I would say that this is one of the best hotels I have stayed at.
It is a bit of a way out from the city centre but onl approx 15min walk.",5,2016,09,30
35,Long weekend break,This was my second stay here. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Breakfast is good. Location is great - La Rambla is a five minute walk away. Taxis are available immediately from just outside the hotel. It's perfect for a short break,4,2016,09,29
35,What a hotel,"This hotel has the loveliest rooms and amazing beds!!! Me and my best friend had a great time here. The concierge was very helpful and friendly, he had glasses and a happy face!
It's located in a great place you can easily walk to La rambla and the main shopping areas to bcn.
Room service is great and if you enjoy the nightlife the hotel can arrange taxis for you very easily.
Great views from the rooms!! Me encanta :) ",5,2016,09,20
35,Location! Location! Location!,"Our cruise finished in Barcelona so we decided to stay for a few extra days before flying home. We initially went with Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel for its proximity to the port and beaches.

Positives: Amazing location. Every kind of transportation is right outside the hotel doors: taxis, tour bus, hop-on hop-off, city bus and even bicycles. Walking distance to Las Ramblas, Gothic Quarter and beaches. The concierge was also super helpful. Whatever questions we had they had answers. We booked a taxi for our early morning departure to the airport and purchased bus tickets right from the counter. They did atone for misplacing our luggage with a nice bottle of bubbly and chocolate covered strawberries. Nice big shower (for me) and Jacuzzi tub for the lady in your life.

Negatives: We had to wait beyond the normal check-in time even after calling ahead and arriving at 8:30am. They lost a piece of our luggage when it was delivered to our room. The temperature inside the hotel (outside of the rooms themselves) was abnormally hot. The music coming from the rooftop pool late Friday night made it tough to go to sleep. Paid for a nice room with a balcony and got zero view.

Overall I had a nice stay. There were a few hiccups, mostly on check-in day, but the location helped make up for it. Average value.",4,2016,09,20
35,"Excellent, well located hotel","Fabulous hotel in a very convenient location. The room was tastefully decorated and the shower/bathroom facilities excellent. Good staff. We ate in the restaurant one evening, the food was OK,  but just OK,  nothing special. The setting outside was better than the menu. To anyone visiting Barcelona, you MUST take the open air bus tour. We are not public transport people but this was the highlight of our short break. For as little as 29e pp, you can hop on and off the bus all day, full running commentary, with green or red route..east or west, both are included in the tour price. Absolutely fantastic. We definitely got our money's worth. We got on at 10am and off around 10pm!!! Great way to get a tan. Also, we hired a car from SIXT to drive down to Alicante...fabulous none quibble, all inclusive price. Excellent company ☆☆☆☆☆",5,2016,09,19
35,"Good location, reasonable room, no personality","Our room was acceptable.  On the website a room with a balcony was pictured.  We were shown to a room with a nice water view but no balcony - when we made a fuss we were moved.  So if you want a balcony you need to request one!  The hotel is right next to the world trade centre so there are a couple of small cafes there for breakfast - but be warned they are closed on the weekends.  So if your stay doesn't include breakfast you will have to walk down the promenade or catch a taxi. The fact that the hotel is on the promenade does mean that you have a 400m walk before you even get close to the beginning of la Rambla or any other buildings, so you can't just pop downstairs from your hotel and start browsing the shops/cafes like you can in other hotels. But the balcony/view compensated for this in our view.",3,2016,09,18
35,A few stars short of a 5-star,"I'm afraid this place is pretty much worse in every way than you would expect from its website.  It would be a just OK, 3-star hotel. 

I paid extra for a ""view"" room, but was given one that looked over a courtyard.  When I asked the front desk said that the ""view"" rooms were just a ""request"" and not a guarantee and they were out. Note, that this ""request"" was significant extra cost - which they didn't refund.  I noticed the person ahead of me in line was having a loud argument over a room problem as well.  Its not clear that the hotel has any good view rooms anyway - most of the complex is a conference center and offices are in the good view locations.

The room was OK.  Clean, but not in the best of shape with stained floors and a shower that soaked the bathroom no matter how careful I was being. Air conditioning was either full on, or off, the thermostat didn't work.  Think towels and cheap amenities

The location is good for the conference center, but a bit of a walk to anywhere else. 

Breakfast buffet was quite good, at the expected prices for a high end hotel.  Restaurant hours were limited, so not great for business travelers coming in from long-haul flights.

Really the problem is that their website gives an impression of a much higher end hotel than it really is. The prices are not all that high, so if you are going to the conference center and tell yourself its a 3-star, its OK. 

Still, I travel a lot and this is the most disappointing hotel I've stayed at in years .",2,2016,09,17
35,Nice but noisy,"Stayed there 4 nights, after a cruise. The hotel was in a great location, right by the cruise terminals. Very short walk to Las Ramblas. Hotel is modern, and very nicely decorated. The only problem I found, was that the walls are tissue paper thin. Could hear everything that was going on in the rooms on either side. Despite that it was nice,
and a good value.",4,2016,09,17
35,Nice location ,"This hotel was one of the best in Barcelona, we stayed there for two nights. The location is not far from most of the attractions in the city, however the only reason why I didn't give this hotel a 5/5 is because of the dated interior, other than that it's perfect. The staff were really nice and very helpful. ",4,2016,09,16
35,"Nice, but more for business","This hotel is in a good location, not far from any of the attractions. The rooms are huge and very modern. But there is no atmosphere. It is part of the trade centre and so is more suited to business people. We tried to have a drink in the bar one evening and it was just dead.  Very boring.  When we stayed the rooftop bar and pool were not open, which was very disappointing. Some of the staff are very friendly and some of the staff are extremely rude. There are better hotels in Barcelona! ",2,2016,09,15
35,Good hotel,Near by main Barcelona Spain good hotel and service is good hospilty is good me my  freinds stay here three nights and Indian food is near by but taxi is very expensive in Spain so in Barcelona hotel is worth wise,4,2016,09,15
35,Good hotel in Barcelona  ,"Myself and gf stayed for 6 nights. Good hotel in ok location. It's a 5 minute walk to nearest metro and same time to Las Ramblas

Rooms are big and modern and very clean 

Pool on roof is great but bar pool is very expensive ",4,2016,09,14
35,Can't really go wrong,"I came here in July for a 5 night stay. Hotel was very impressive and in a great location, the rooms are gorgeous and I felt very much at home. You only have to walk out of the hotel and over the road to be in the heart of the action so it is very conveniently placed. Before coming I was aware that I shouldn't expect impressive room views or a big pool so therefore I was not disappointed when this turned out to be correct.
There is only a small area for sunbathing but I never had any issues finding a bed and the rooftop bar is very pleasant for a night time drink.",4,2016,09,13
35,Loved it. Pick this over the W HOTEL! ,"We stayed here for 4 nights and loved it! Check in went well and were upgraded to suite with a bottle of champagne. Staff were all so friendly and helpful. We will be back

Don't make our mistake! Checked into the w hotel for our last few days. Man did we regret it. We were told the wonderful room didn't have any king beds as it didn't exist and that we would be staying in 2 queen beds ( actually single beds) for our wedding anniversary. Didn't get to enjoy last few days in Barcelona because they ruined it for us. Paid an arm and leg for the W HOTEL.  Don't stay there. They will lie because they have oversold or up sell you. Don't be fooled by the view. ",5,2016,09,10
35,SUPERB HOTEL,"The Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel is situated at the port of Barcelona and is part of the World Trade Centre complex. It is a beautiful hotel, but I think its staff are its greatest asset. During my visit, without exception, the hotel staff were helpful and friendly. Okay, hotel staff are paid to be helpful and friendly, but you can always tell when this is not genuine. At the Grand Marina, there was genuine warmth in their welcome and I felt they exceeded what was required of them in many instances.
Before our trip, which was a special surprise for my husband's **th birthday, I was a little worried because I read a couple of reviews that said there were ferries and cruise ships all over the place. These reviews also gave the impression that the area was noisy. I need not have worried. Firstly, the hotel is at the port so you will see ships, but the nearest was not all that close and it was in no way noisy. As a matter of fact, we found the ships an added interest. Secondly, far from being noisy, the area was very quiet at night, no traffic noise, no noisy streets. Another advantage to being at the port is you get sea views as well as city views, and a wonderful gentle breeze when you are outside.
The front of the hotel has great views of the city.
There is a cable car pylon on the large open area in front of the hotel. The pylon was close to our room, but it is not at all intrusive and looks like a mini Eifel Tower. It is attractive in its own way. You can ride the cable car from the Olympic park and get some unusual aerial pictures of your hotel.
The World Trade Centre is a working building with lots of offices, but for the most part, there is a wide piazza between the back of the hotel and the World Trade Centre building itself - meaning most are some distance away. There is nothing in front of the hotel (apart from the cable care pylon) and you get great views of Barcelona.
The World Trade Centre complex provides some handy facilities right next door to the hotel such as an ATM which is no more than 50 metres from the door of the hotel, a pharmacy, a bike hire place, small cafes etc. It is a pedestrian area and is quiet and shaded compared to the rest of vibrant, busy Barcelona. The red line of the hop on/hop off tourist bus stops less than 200 metres from the hotel entrance. A taxi ride from the hotel entrance to Las Ramblas was 3 euros and 50 cents plus tip at the time of writing.
One final thing about how great this hotel is. When they found out it was husband’s birthday they upgraded us to a junior suite free of charge and said it was his birthday present from the hotel. When we got to the room there was a bottle of Cava in a chiller waiting for us. It was a lovely gesture and we were so touched by their thoughtfulness. It made a special trip even more special. I am so glad I chose this hotel.",5,2016,09,09
35,Good visit,"The hotel has a great location and the views from the roof top are fantastic. It's a shame the pool is so small, but luckily it wasn't very busy. The hotel needs some attention in certain areas, especially the restaurant toilets. The door handles were very loose and they needed a good clean up. 
The staff on the front desk and the roof top bar staff were very helpful and friendly. The staff at breakfast probably need extra training to bring out that 5 star service, and so too the bar staff on the 1st floor. Overall good hotel but it needs some attention in areas to bring it back to a level it once was because its rating is nothing higher than 4 stars at the moment. ",4,2016,09,09
35,Clean - friendly staff,"I said at this herself 4 nights.

The parking is expensive at €27 per night.

Breakfast was good at €20 per time.

The staff are helpful and friendly.

The rooms are clean and well maintained.

The rooftop pool was a little small for the hotel size. The gym was well pointed. All in all a good hotel convenient for access to the ferries and cruise ships and also the rest of Barcelona.",4,2016,09,08
35,Good rooms - pool area could be better,In general a solid Hotel with nice big rooms. The location is not optimal. The distance to the beach is a bit far. The pool area is on the roof from the hotel and if there is a ferry docking at the port it can stink a lot (smog problem). It's not really the fold of the hotel but still I thing it's important to say it... So if you are not interested in using the pool area I can recommend the hotel. Breakfast was also very nice. ,4,2016,09,05
35,Superb and VERY welcome.,"Booked a 4 night break in Barcelona at a different hotel from this. The other hotel was awful so after a few hours I walked out and booked in here.

Great service immediately when I explained the situation and was given a room with a wonderful view over the harbour.

Gorgeous rooms, great food, impeccable service and lovely drinks.

A nice quiet rooftop pool with a bar serving snacks, a gym with sauna and a lovely location. 

What more could you want?",5,2016,09,05
35,"Wonderful stay, best shower ever and amazing service","We stayed in March so it wasn't the height of the season and was a little chilly! We arrived earlier than our booking said we could which was no problem and were taken straight up to our fabulous room. The bed was massive and comfy with a shower to die for which was amazing after having travelled! We were going on a cruise the next day and the location for that was fantastic, although it was just about walkable the staff recommended a taxi and we were glad that we did as it saved a lot of time and effort! The staff could not do enough for you and for the secret room price we got it for it was a bargain!",5,2016,09,02
35,View,"Located in the port... the view is amazing. It is very imposing from the outside.. the rooms are well appointed and has all the basics. The hallway carpet is a downer..stained and the color is tired. Being in the world trade center, usually big groups. Twice we have requested an early check in but we never got the room before 3 pm and we have to leave the room at 12 noon.",4,2016,09,01
35,Mother and daughter 21st and 50th weekend break,"A nice enough hotel but just without the wow factor.  Superior room on the 4th floor looked onto office block to the side which was big disappointment from which I'm not sure my daughter and I quite recovered.  Room itself had everything we needed but the small balcony over looking offices was something retrospectively we should maybe have asked if we could change.  The hotel has a ludicrously good position on the sea front but so much is obscured by the offices to one side which have the views.  Staff very nice, breakfast good.  Slippers provided but no dressing gowns which we were kind of expecting in a 5 star hotel.  Towels very thin but maybe I am now being picky.  All in all a nice enough hotel but left feeling just a little underwhelmed despite meeting Cliff Richard in the lift on the way out.  Yes, really !!",4,2016,08,29
35,Amazing,"I truly love staying in this hotel.everytime I visit Barcellina 
It has spacious room and a very clean hotel .The breakfast is excellent too .The only thing that truly annoys me is that you have to register for the room naturally behind others but then to collect your key you have to stay again behind a lot of people .That is an absolute waste of time 
",5,2016,08,28
35,Not 5 Star,"I'm not sure why this is a 5 star hotel? The rooms are lovely. The bed was big and the pillows soft. The bathroom was beautiful and that's where it ends. There are no lovely views from the bedrooms and the pool is not much larger than a hot tub.. The tiles around the upstairs, roof area are uneven and wobbly - an accident waiting to happen. The ladies, toilet door did not lock. Note I said toilet! There is no cover from the sun. We booked the room through Bookings.com - not such a good idea. Do NOT book a non refundable room, expecting a good rate. When we travelled, the rooms were reduced by £60 over a 3 night stay. The staff were lovely and we had complimentary toiletries. But not worth the money. The food and drinks are extortionate. The roof view was nice and the location is OK! The roof top bar has great comments, but during the day is unstaffed. There were no cushions on the chairs and very few sun beds.. The first day we arrived and visited the pool at 10 am, only to be shocked that the tiny pool was still shut off and there were no towels. The hotel does not warrant having five stars.",3,2016,08,26
35,A CITY break...,"

The hotel was pleasant enough, clean, busy well attended. The staff were competent and the rooms were spacious and clean. 
The roof top provided us with a pool area and bar. Very high, good views but a very small pool used by children.

A few things of note.

This is s very busy city and the average sightseer will benefit from the use of a open top tour bus at the cost of 35 - 40 euro per day. On foot you will find pedestrians, cars and bicycles fly everywhere and you will turn yourself into a standing hazard if you stop to browse unaware of your surroundings.

The city seems to thrive on the production of tapas. Great if you want to eat on the go but can wear thin if you are here for any length of time. 

Stick to drinks you know, which we found out to our cost bravely ordering random cocktails one night and ending up with a un ingestible mix of vomit and diesel. 

Can be pricey, with the euro exchange rate. Currently 1.2 an average lunch diner can cost 40 euros for just the main with a bottle of water. Our hotel had breakfast at 25 e each. A rather expensive start for the day. But shop wisely, taking advantage of local supermarkets and you may be able to control this. 

The city, like any other seems to harbour some shady characters. We witnessed the police in action here several times. Families and groups of young men are entertained by street sellers and small alleyways are the bolt holes of typical brexit fodder. 

The time we choose to stay in this city was not perhaps helped by the advent of school holidays. We do prefer a quiet getaway now but appreciate that this was billed as a city break after all. 

We do not think we will return, but it was a fairly pleasant week spent in this city, and the need to experience once is recommended.

'Farewell, pretty city.
Your illustrious history, your illuminated buildings. I remain seduced by your beauty.
You toss and turn, restless from the dock horns that pierce the night.
Yet do I ponder a return to your still shores. The bemused hospitable echo of a forgotten time.
Do I waste my precious hours in the cradle of your arms, yet ponder the time when my heart will be forever more safe in the knowledge of your existence. 
Farewell.'
",3,2016,08,26
35,Stopover Trip in BCN with very nice location site,"I was choosing the hotel because of previous notices of the Hotel as well as the excellent location. The Hotel is a 5 minutes walk away from the subway station Drassanes and Las Ramblas. The Hotel itself is structured in a very spacious way and rooms, especially in the upper floors are very comfortable - so make sure you choose one of the superior rooms. These are even equipped with a hydro-massage bad. Very nice. Unfortunately the iron in the room was broken, the balcony door did not close properly and the hydro-bath was leaking water apparently. ;-) But well...

The panaroma view over the city and the sea from the rooftop is simply outstanding if not exceptional. On the rooftop you will find the pool, directly next to the pool bar. From each side you can have a complete view over BCN at night and day. So if you want to be close to the sea, close to Ramblas and direct access to the yachting cruises, this Hotel is for you.
On the first floor, you will receive excellent food supplies at the bar all time of the day - not expensive - where also the breakfast area is located. Breakfast itself was very rich from scrambled eggs up to fruits of melons, types of bread, sausages, cheese everything is there. You will not starve in the morning times.. ;-)

The service at this level (first floor) is usually very kind, nice and quick, except in the morning times. Wifi is free and the area is calm and relaxing.
If you need the concierge service, you can easily aquire tickets for many sights in the city and get recommendations. Also this was very comfortable to me.

All this is very nice, but if there was not .... 
the overshadowing unattentiveness by the personnel.. at the breakfast times they missed quite often the coffee and the orange juice, not even asking, although you just arrived - and it was not crowded. Generally I noticed that the personnel is quite young and misses often the details to meet the hotel's quality rating. I noticed that during the checkin, during the stay at the bars, breakfast and further questions during the stay.
So also my final bill at the end was completely wrong, the reported amounts were times higher than what was consumed and one bill was even overwritten (manually) with a false amount, the minibar, although included, was accounted. In one case, a laundery service was incorrectly processed and billed to me and even after informing the staff and receiving confirmation that it was fixed, it still appeared on the final bill when checking out.

In the end, it was all corrected, but in professional terms this must not happen at all. Mistakes can happen, but not throughout the whole bill in this style. Nonetheless I keep my rating of 4 stars, which is very generous in this case, but this is far away from 5 stars related my visit.
Generally spoken, I can principally recommend this Hotel, except the experiences i made with it.
So please dear Hotel, work better on the attentiveness and reliability of your service. I really like this Hotel, but some things should be really enhanced.",4,2016,08,25
35,City Break,"We stayed at the Eurostars Grand Marina in October of last year and will be staying there again in a few weeks time. We loved this hotel, we found the staff very helpful and the hotel its self was was fantastic. The only thing that could be improved on is the meals in the restaurant in the evening, having said that there are so many nice restaurants in the area that it was not a problem. The breakfast's however were something else, so much choice and fresh delicious food. Our room was huge (bordering on a sweet really) with a large bathroom with both bath and shower. The position of the hotel( on the harbour ) was ideal for us , out of the centre but a ten minite walk you were right there. Really looking forward to our next visit.",5,2016,08,25
35,Very Much A Buisness Hotel,"Having just left our cruise ship (Harmony of the Seas) and had an excellent week on board, we decided to stay on in Barcelona for three nights - booking in advance the Grand Marina. Upon early arrival we were told that no rooms would be available until after lunch, so we decided to jump on the red bus tour - which stops close by. Reception staff very helpful and took care of our bags. When we arrived back our room was ready on the third floor, but to our dismay it was dark and dingy and you could smell stale tobacco - contrary to what the gentleman said on reception when I complained, as an former smoker of 30 years, I can tell if someone has been smoking as I now thankfully hate the smell. Anyway after a bit of mumbling we were given the key to another room on the top floor, which was spacious and bright and had great views looking back in to Barcelona. We had breakfast each day and it was very nice. The bar areas could do with a bit of waking up, as the service was slow almost I can't be bothered - especially when a barrel ran out and they wanted me to have another drink, instead of simply putting a new one on ! Anyway all in all after a stuttering start, we enjoyed our stay but unlikely to return as it really caters for 
business people, rather than holiday tourists - as can been from the cost of staying there.",3,2016,08,24
35,Not a 5*,"We arrived early morning as just come of a cruise, I knew check in was at 3pm but I did request at time of booking if we could maybe have one room earlier, I knew that this may not be feasible. My friend also had a booked a room. On arrival we were told we would have to return at 3pm but we could use facilities. We all had booked SUPERIOR ROOMS. We arrived back 2.45 to be told only one room out of 3 was ready, my friends was ready 5 mins later and my 2nd room for my sons was not available until 3.15. Room No: 416/417 DO NOT get these rooms as all you can see out of your window is an office block directly in your view. My friend got room 501 which is the room type I was expecting as shown on website, floor to ceiling Windows and balcony with fabulous views across the city and Port. I went down to reception to see if they had given me the correct rooms and they said yes, the reception staff said that they could not transfer me to another room as no availability. 
Did request one room to be queen bed and the other singles, both rooms singles pushed together with separate bedding on each. Bed uncomfortable as rolled into middle. Bathroom nice but dark, provided with some toiletries.
Cocktails expensive
Rooftop pool small,
Rooftop views fabulous
Most staff seemed gloomy and  unsociable
Good location
Would not class as 5* more 3.5* one member of staff agreed with me",3,2016,08,24
35,Barca :),Had a suite that was great.. The suite was big and had a cozy balcony and we got a room on the 7th floor out of 8... I was expecting more from the breakfast. This was a regular breakfast not a 5* breakfast so that for me is a minus but otherwise the staff and the room was great.,4,2016,08,23
35,Barcelona,A very modern and centrally located hotel next to the cruise terminal and at walking distance from the famous Las Ramblas. Staff very friendly and service was very good. There is no need to get any transport to explore the city centre as from Las Ramblas you can get into the old district of Barcelona and through to the main avenues of La Gran Via and Passeig de Gracia. The Bus City Tour also stops a few meters away from the hotel and you can explore the whole city with the hop on hop off service visiting places like Nou Camp Stadium and Poble Espanyol. ,4,2016,08,23
35,Disappointed,"We were there for two nights and we were disappointed. The location is good but we had to wait very long to check in. The food in the restaurant is outrageously overpriced. The carpets on our floor (6th) were dirty and our bathroom smelled very bad. I asked at reception to send someone to have a look at the bathroom but they only set the airconditioner lower. The warmer the room got the worse the smell was. Definitely not value for money. We had one night, one week previously, in an apartment in Barcelona - location  just as good, clean carpets and no disgusting smell in bathroom - at a third if the Eurostar's price! I won't recommend it.",3,2016,08,21

35,"its a great hotel, location, nice view,close to the market and facilitie. A+++++hotel.","I  liked the front disk management, very helpful, friendly and professional. 
There was a gentleman named  Mr. Gerard Moreno I was impressed with
his positive attitude and patience. I noticed he was helpful with me and others.
Thank you very much for the your  hospitality.",5,2016,08,13
35,"great hotel, location and facilities",its a great hotel in an amazing location with nice view and close to most one of most important landmarks to visit like maremagnum shopping mall and las ramblas street and so many places around. staff were very helpful and hotel facilities are best.,5,2016,08,10
35,Superb modern  hotel in perfect location,"Eurostars Grand Marina hotel offers something most hotels in Barcelona cannot. That is a view across the whole of the Barcelona skyline  to the mountains. The view encompasses everything that is an attraction, from the buildings, the sea, and the mountains. It is a very modern hotel, with artwork reflecting modernism on the walls, large lounge areas, inside and outside, pool, rooftop restaurant and bar. Something sadly lacking in the small boutique hotels that abound in Barcelona. Our large corner room faced both Barcelona and the port, which was great to watch all the boats arrive and leave daily from. The new shopping center and aquarium is close by, and the hop on hop off bus arrives at the door, taking you in both directions. East and West routes  both have great sights to see and visit. La Rambla is across the road and enables you to walk comfortably, without traffic, to all the tourist attractions in the old town and beyond.  The staff were very young and friendly. They were super friendly and gave the hotel a lovely positive energy. The restaurant breakfast smorgasbord was varied and plentiful with amazing cakes and pastries unique to Spain. Loved those custard filled donuts! Our 3 day  stay at Eurostars  with its quick access to everything Barcelona has to offer, was the highlight of our 4 week trip to Europe.",5,2016,08,09
35,Fabulous,"Stayed here very last minute as missed my flight home, booked same day and had no issues. Good location just south of La Rambla - about 5-10 min walk. Looks great from the outside, but also very impressive inside with a large reception area. Easy check in with friendly staff who also gave us a complimentary cocktail at the bar (which was very nice!). Room was lovely, large window overlooking the port (beautiful at night!) very clean. Bathroom was massive with a lovely bath & shower, with large mirrors also. The bed was to die for, and the pillows were that comfy I tried to find the brand to order some for my home! Great facilites with a nice quiet gym & pool on the roof (only con was the price of food & drinks at the pool bar, very expensive, and pool was freezing!). Lovely view from the rooftop, with the ability to walk around the top pretty much 360 degrees. Would stay again although it is expensive.",5,2016,08,09
35,Idyllic Isolation,"This is a terrific hotel for its central proximity to the harbour, beaches, waterfront and downtown attractions and yet it is also an island unto itself where one can withdraw from the touristic bustle, heat, and traffic and be refreshed.  It was suitably endearing to our needs during a whirlwind visit.  It does lack the character and feel that one might find in the myriad of colorful hotels situated in the nearby neighborhoods and I would equate it more to living as if on a ship docked in the old harbour.  Safe yet sterile.  The room itself was delightful although it seemed rather pointless to have a balcony overlooking a rather drab courtyard as the heat was almost oppressive and the lack of a breeze and noise from nearby air conditioning fans ensured that it would not get used except by smokers who just might brave those elements for their vice.  Request actual harbour view rooms as others have mentioned.  The rooftop lounge is an excellent escape for the refreshing breeze, music, views and drinks, but unfortunately the rooftop pool closes early.",4,2016,08,09
35,Expected better,"We really enjoyed our stay at Grand Marina but we did expect  better from a 5* hotel.  As we had treated ourselves to this holiday we were determined to utilize as many of the facilities as possible.  We requested turn down service both nights of our stay but returned to find this had not been done.  Our room was also not cleaned to a very high standard with dirty cups left for the next day.  We booked the stay through Last Minute but felt due to this we were treated with less respect than other people staying in the hotel.  We were given a much smaller room than advertised and it was also repeated by the reception staff several times during our stay that we had booked through a budget website rather than direct.

Overall we had a very enjoyable stay and the location was perfect for our short break, but we did expect more from this hotel given its rating and price.",3,2016,08,09
35,"No Beds, and Cigarette Smell","We stayed here for a night in the summer, and it really was not a great one. We usually prefer smaller, more intimate hotels, but we were meeting a group at the hotel, so it seemed easiest to stay there. When we walked into our room, we noticed two things. They overwhelming smell of cigarettes, and the fact that there was only one bed in a room that we booked for three people. We went down to ask for an extra bed, and they said it would be up right away. Four hours later, still no bed, so we had to ask again before it was brought up. The staff was nice, but the whole hotel (staff included) had a very impersonal feel, and the place was very crowded. Not my favorite.",2,2016,08,07
35,4 nights with kids,"Based on the price and good reviews of this place, my expectations were high. The rooms are spacious but not clean. Only few products are available; i.e. no body cream or tooth brush for example. On the second day, we came back to find the room not well cleaned at all with the dirty cups still there. We called room service for some water and reminded them a couple of times, but water was not delivered to the room. I called next day to complain, and the manager sent a letter with some juice and chocolate. I am not saying that this hotel is not good, but being used to 5 stars hotel, this one is no match. The hotel is very well located in the marina with a nice shopping mall nearby. However, La Ramblas is not that close, you need to walk a good 25 minutes to arrive to the shops. The rooftop restaurant is nice with beautiful view. The pool is small and nice.
The hotel is good and well located, however the room service needs proper upgrading.",3,2016,08,07
35,Great Hotel at a Great Price,"We enjoyed our stay at the Eurostar Gran Marina. The location is ideal for quick access to the Gothic Quarter and La Rambla, while being out of the hustle and bustle.  This hotel may not feel truly like a five star property, but for the bargain price we got on Booking.com we have no complaints.",4,2016,08,05
35,"No big issues, nice hotel","My husband and I booked in for four nights on a bed and breakfast basis. 
The rooms are of a good size with a small balcony (unfurnished). Beds are comfortable, towels are awful, limited toiletries.  Complimentary water would be nice along with the tea, coffee facility.
Breakfast is amazing and staff very attentive.
Pool very small, gym well equipped, drinks rather expensive.
Good location right next to the port.
Was rather surprised to see tourist tax of 4.50 euro per night on our check out bill! No mention of that from Jet2.
Cost of taxi to airport approx 30euro.",4,2016,08,02
35,Pre Cruise Hotel,"Hotel booked for easy access to Cruise Terminal, couldn't have chosen a better hotel, so well located to the cruise ship we were to board - which was literally right next to the hotel. 

Booked a Superior Room consequently bedroom and bathroom were well proportioned, modern and comfortable, didn't have to sit on the bed to watch the TV - great!  Room offered great views of the marina walkway and parts of the city. Hop on/Hop off bus services picked up about 2 minutes’ walk from hotel on the marina area, which we used, great way of getting a feel for a city, when only visiting for such a short time - 2 nights. 

Easy walking distance to Las Ramblas, shops, restaurants and bars - where there is plenty of choice to suit all pockets. The hotel location is great if you wish to walk large parts of the city, easy to access via taxi, tour bus - couldn't ask for more.

Staff are approachable and very helpful, hotel is modern, didn't have breakfast in hotel, so unable to comment, although it did seem to be quite noisy as it can be viewed from other floors, however lounge/bar area comfortable, airy and spacious.

Would return to this hotel as its location is great, it appears to be a very busy hotel, no problems booking in/out; enough staff on duty to deal with number of clients. Although hotel just away from the bustle of Las Ramblas, Marina Mall and other tourist attractions, we found walking in around the localised area quite easy and comfortable.",4,2016,08,01
35,Love it,"This was our second visit and must say that it is a vast improvement on the first one.
We booked a city view suite that was ample size and very well equipped--jacuzzi bath is a nice touch.
What makes this Hotel so good for us is the service--it has vastly improved from our last visit--it is stunning to say the least.
We had a slight issue with a suitcase and asked for a small tool to open it--instead a maintenance man was on hand in minutes and fixed the issue there and then.
Reception team are great as is the breakfast team--eat outside for breakfast it is stunning.
When considering either the W, Mandarin Oriental or this place I would highly recommend Eurostars.",5,2016,07,30
35,Conveniently Located and Comfortable,Eurostar Grand Marina is an excellent hotel with very comfortable rooms.  It is conveniently located near the ferry docks and tourist sites-many walkable.   Breakfasts were excellent.  The pool was small but helpful to cool off in the summer heat of about 90 degrees F.  Convenient drugstore and ATM next to hotel.,5,2016,07,29
35,"Comfortable, efficient, great location","Eurostars Grand Marina is a well-run, first-class major hotel.  Our room provided an outstanding view of the working harbor, with ferries, cruise ships, and other vessels continually coming and going.  We had intended to walk around the city, but instead ordered room service and watched the harbor until bedtime.  (The rooms are quite well soundproofed -- we could hear an occasional ship's horn, but not much other noise.)  We strolled through the central downtown area, including La Rambla, next day.  It's a few minutes' walk from the hotel.",4,2016,07,28
35,Good location,Room was nice even though I wanted a little better view of the ocean I was told there were no rooms that had view but was obvious that was NOT TRUE the location to the rumbles is great 10-15 minutes!!!,4,2016,07,26
35,Great accommodations at World Trade Centre and Near La Rambla,"I stayed here for 4 nights and thought the hotel and staff were all great. The restaurant food is also quite good. It is located close to many attractions. About - 30 minute walk to the beach, and only 10 minutes to La Rambla. I also took a boat cruise to Sitges which left from right in front of the hotel. 
I found the hotel room to be clean, but a bit on the dark side. The bathroom was also nice and spacious. ",4,2016,07,25
35,Top Hotel and Location,"This Hotel is in a superb location with magnificent views out to sea or in land . It is brilliant as it is so close to Port Vell, La Ramblas and Columbus's statue. There is a wonderful rooftop bar and the rooms with a balcony are stunning. The hotel amenities are excellent and staff are friendly and helpful",5,2016,07,25
35,Not as good as you could think,"Ok, clean and staff are nice, room was old and breakfast wasn't what we expect with that price. Walking distance from ramblas and taxi always outside waiting if you don't like to walk. Nice roof terrace but pool was like small bath",3,2016,07,25
35,prime position,"this hotel is one of the best ive stayed in barcelona, from checking in to all amenities in hotel, roof top pool and bar with cracking views over the marina and five minute walk to ramblas, one downside if you could complain you had to get on your knees to find a plug for the kettle or charging your phone.",5,2016,07,25
35,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"I had been made redundant after 14 yrs so wanted to splash out on a Luxury 3 day holiday with myself and my father. The 3 nights including flights was £1,900 so obviously I wanted this to be very special. I arrived at the hotel and I must admit the staff did not treat you with much respect, I would expect this type of service from a 3 star hotel not 5! I had paid for myself and my father to be next door to each other and when I arrived we were told this may not be possible, the lack of effort to event try and convince me they cared was poor. Check in was at 3 in the rooms so if you arrive like I did at 12 its a long time to wait to freshen up, I feel that this is more of a business hotel and not for holiday makers it is a very cold atmosphere at the hotel and I do regret now booking this and wish I had gone elsewhere. The pictures on the site look amazing but when you actually get there its not as it seems (or what it says on the tin!). I would say great for 1 night if your cruising the next day but as holidays go NO NO NO!!!!",2,2016,07,25
35,Great Hotel with great service,"Fine Hotel with excellent service, and good food. Good size room , short walk to LA Rambla, marina, and the large Marina shopping center.
Can't say enough about the room and the great bathroom.
Views from the roof top bar are ourstanding.",5,2016,07,23
35,Very Grand ,"Deserves 5 stars. Staff are super attentive, rooms are appointed to a high standard with spa baths and rainfall showers.  Superb breakfast with a vast range of items inc wine. Excellent location being 15 mins and €24 from airport. 5 minute stroll to Chris Columbus Monument and therefore Las Ramblas and Ramblas de Mar with MareMagum (shopping centre with food) within another 5 mins. In fact, go to the 8th floor roof terrace and you can see all of the above and the lovely Port Vell, drinks or comfortable seating. Hotel is just away from the hustle and bustle, Cabs on standby inc hire cycles and electric vehicles. Hop on Hop off tour bus stop within 2 min walk. Parking and the Trade Centre behind. You will see cruise ships dock next to hotel but that's of interest to see rather than a negative. 
Will stay again and Barcelona has lots to offer and the hotel is of a very good standard  
",5,2016,07,22
35,Well located Hotel,"We were spend a few days in Barcelona prior to catching a cruise.  To our surprise the Hotel was located right on the Terminal.
The Hotel was modern, very clean and very well located to visit the rest of Barcelona.
The breakfast was excellent with no waiting to be seated.  At the time we were there the Hotel seemed to be fully booked and were able to handle the numbers with ease.
The staff were excellent.",5,2016,07,20
35,Average ,"I dated one night. I am so satisfied with Bathroom, beds and breakfast. The bathtub was a jaccuzi 😁it felt great when I turned it on. Bathroom is clean but I suggest them to add bathrobes and extra big towels. Pillows were so soft I had a great sleeping :) breakfast is good. My only comment that made me so upset 1) no taxi 2) smoking smell although I am not in a smoking room but the smell of the decks just X ",3,2016,07,20
35,"Nice modern hotel, decent location","Nice modern hotel in good location, close to las ramblas, port and a 15 minutes walk to the beach front. rooms are slightly pricey, similar prices as the W.  Breakfast is good with plenty of choice, and the gym is modern, slightly small but good variety of equipment. Would recommend for business use.",4,2016,07,20
35,Not happy,"So i am staying three nights in this hotel, I feel it has a Great location  and has a beautiful view but i sm not having  a nice experience  with the breakfast, it's not good and there is a waiting line to be seated definitely nt worth he money  . Also the staff are not as I expected.The picture below is from the hotel 8th floor",3,2016,07,15
35,"A special experience, a few flaws but great place and customer service","My wife has long been a fan of Barcelona, and I've never been, so I thought I would take her there for a surprise.  I have no regrets whatsoever!

We had a great long weekend here when we stayed, and whilst the room wasn't particularly amazing (the window was suspiciously dangerous to open and the threshold to fall out was a bit suspect - and the view wasn't what we'd hoped) it's proximity to the local tapas bars and nightlife is impressive.

The breakfast session in the morning is not like anything I've ever seen before!  It was amazing!  There was even frexinet to quaff - if you were that way inclined ;-).  The morning quartet was genuinely a nice touch too.

Overall the stay was great and the staff were very helpful.  We didn't use the gym/spa etc.. but they looked decent enough.

I would recommend it but be careful if you have little ones re; window",4,2016,07,14
35,Solid 4 star hotel,"This hotel is situated out on a pier in the harbor of Barcelona. I think most guide books give this hotel 5 stars.... And it deserves it in some ways ..... The room was clean and well appointed... The roof top bar was top notch.... The concierge was so so helpful as was the outstandingly dressed doorman. And most definitely the breakfast.  The most sumptuous buffet with a huge selection.... Though the pancakes and waffles were cold every morning ....  And the staff was absolutely wonderful !!!  The things that kept this hotel from being a 5 star hotel in my opinion were the quality and quantity of the bath towels...... The small pool and lack of bar service in that area....though they do have a small cafe near the pool.....and no one at the front desk seems to pick up the phone when you dial and I tried on 5 or 6 different occasions ...... And one day they forgot to clean the room ... Yikes !!!  Overall though I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again if I ever visit Barcelona again !!
The best thing about the hotel is its location near the bottom of La Rambla... The pedestrian walkway with stores and restaurants .... It has a metro stop nearby as well... Which was super convenient !!! If you book a room... ask for an exterior room facing the Christopher Columbus statue ... That will give you a view of the harbor and the city !! An interior room faces a courtyard in the back of the hotel which faces the World Trade Center.",4,2016,07,13
35,"Comfortable & Great Location, but not quite 5 Star","This was our first visit to Barcelona and were glad to have chosen spacious premium rooms looking towards the city in this very comfortable hotel.  The metro is only a 10 minute walk away, as is the ever-lively marina area, the seaward end of La Rambla and the edge of the old ""Gothic"" town.  We found the staff to be universally friendly and efficient.  The breakfast buffets were excellent - although we did not order anything made to oder, which other reviewers suggest may have taken a while to deliver to table.  And the free wifi was excellent.

Our only slight disappointment was with the restaurant food and room service, both of which offered pretty basic and uninspiring menus - and the room service food was tepid rather than hot by the time it reached us. The answer, of course, was to go out to the many fantastic restaurants in the area and further afield - which was fair enough - it's a good reason to come to Barcelona! - but it did mean that the hotel felt more 4 than 5 star to us at least.",4,2016,07,07
35,Excellent place for a business meeting,"We organized a meeting for about 200 people at the hotel / World Trade Center of Barcelona. It was a great experience. 

The rooms are spacious, clean. The bed and pillows are good. The towels probably need to be changed, all in all the bathroom was comfortable.

The wifi was also really good. 

As of the location, it is not bad, but is not the best place in Barcelona. Anyway, everything is at a few minutes distance either walking or by taxi.",5,2016,07,07
35,Great location,"I like that is located very near the the port, somewhat near the beach and some of the most touristy places in Barcelona. There is plenty of restaurants near by. The staff was very professional and accommodated me earlier then the usual check in time since we had an early flight in to Barcelona. ",5,2016,07,07
35,Out of this world!!!!,"Myself and my husband arrived here in November after spending a few days cruising in the Med as a surprise for his birthday! This hotel was most definitely the icing on the cake and finished off our holiday beautifully!! Our suite was beyond belief!!! We were totally gob smacked at the size of it, the comfort of the bed, choice of pillows, the view, I could go on and on! Perfect location for all the shops and bars etc! The staff were professional, smart and friendly. The best hotel we have ever stayed in! I now compare every other hotel to this one..... And so far ..... None compare! We would love to come back to Barcelona and would not think about staying anywhere but the Eurostars!! I would give you 100 stars if I could!! Many thanks ",5,2016,07,06
35,"Great location, just a few little niggles ","The location was spot on. An easy walk to Las Ramblas, the beach, marina etc. The view from the rooftop terrace was superb.  Our room and bathroom was spacious and comfortable and the beds and pillows were perfect.  Breakfast was also very good.  Lots of choice and all fresh and tasty. 

Slight disappointments were the lack of balcony and view that we requested.  They offered to move us later in the week but that wasn't forthcoming. So we had to look at an office block instead of the sea! We requested bathrobes which duly arrived but were removed the following morning for some strange reason! Not sure why they were rationing bathrobe use!? The wifi in the room wasn't very good either. Bit hit and miss. 

Oh and the outside pool is tiny! And staff could have been a little friendlier. ",4,2016,07,06
35,Sea / marina view,Perfect location. Quite friendly staff. Nice and still modern interior design but it requirements a little maintenance. One thing: staff din't read customer's wishes which we wrote in booking.com. I understand that sometimes it is impossible to do everything that customer requested. But somebody from hotel has tell about it. ,5,2016,07,06
35,Very disappointing and no attention to detail,"Everything (arrival experience, service, facilities) a disappointment.

Arrival:
We booked a romantic package where we were promised Cava, strawberries and a room with jacuzzi. The reception desk was full of old stains - general decor is probably about 10-20yrs old which really didn't give a first good impression. We were swiftly checked in but were put in a basic room and they had forgotten about the Cava and strawberries.

Facilities:
They called the swimming pool the 'plunge pool' but it is really really small. I would say probably about 10m long  and enough to have 1-2 adults and a couple of kids. 

Service and breakfast:
We checked out the roof top bar which they claimed closed at 2am. We went up just before midnight and it was full of rubbish and no one was serving drinks. We then went down to the 1st floor bar and waited for 20mins for our drinks and found out the waitress had forgotten about them.

Also breakfast service is slow - we ordered poached eggs and had to wait for 20mins. The manager made an excuse to say poached eggs normally take 15mins to make when we complained.

Breakfast staff run around like headless chicken - get the feeling it's understaffed or they haven't had any training.

View:
Depending on which side of the hotel you are, you either get a giant iron tower eye sore in front of your room or if you get a sea view like us, you may find waking up in the morning with guests from the in and outgoing cruises staring into your room. 

Value for money:
Overall if you are just looking for a room and don't plan to spend time in the hotel, this maybe  an option. Otherwise don't stay here.

It is certainly not 5 star and really not worth the money.",1,2016,07,03
35,Beautiful Hotel and Great Service,"Just arrived home after a 3 night stay with my boyfriend at this hotel, we booked the basic room but when we checked in were offered a free upgrade to a suite which was a wonderful surprise and wow the room we were upgraded to was stunning, gorgeous views, so clean and the bed was probably the most comfortable bed i've ever slept in. I think there were 2 occasions where we called reception for something and within minutes they were at our door to help!! All the staff were super friendly, warm and welcoming. Would totally recommend staying here and when we next return to Barcelona we will definitely be staying here again!",5,2016,06,30
35,An excellent stay in a beatiful hotel,"Pros : We arrived in Barcelona with an early flight and went straight to the hotel (were there at 07:00' am). The warm smile from the receptionist made feel real welcome and the early check-in was the perfect surprise! The room & the bathroom (shower & bathtub available) were big & clean. The big wide windows offered unblocked view to the sea. We were competely satisfied with the variety and the choices of the breakfast. Near to metro and La Rambla street.

Cons : A bit pricy bar, restaurant and parking. A small issue with wi-fi speed and connectivity but only the first day.",5,2016,06,30
35,Best break away ever! ,Everyone we came into contact with were so friendly and accommodating. The hotel is spotlessly clean and have the most beautiful views from the city facing rooms. It's only 20 minute walk to Barceloneta beach. We can't wait to come back again soon. ,5,2016,06,29
35,Perfect all the time,"I've visited this hotel again and everything was again perfect if you like luxury style of living. Recommend if you don't care about the budget. The location is in the marina, walking distance to Las Ramblas and other sights.",5,2016,06,28
35,Amazingggggggggg,"Wow what an amazing hotel! I love Barcelona and this was my second visit. 

We was traveling from France to Spain and stopped in Barcelona for a night as a treat and decided to book a decent hotel and I'm so glad I choose the Eurostar.

The staff where very friendly and welcoming. Check in went smoothly and our bags where waiting in our room when we arrived later that evening after dumping them there that morning.

It's a very modern hotel and well up there in the 5 star range. We was lucky to be upgraded to a suite which was fab amazing huge bed, separate sitting area, balcony and amazing bathroom with Luxury toiletries.

The room was beautiful I didn't want to leave but could resist exploring Barcelona!

The roof top was stunning lovely small roof top pool and a seating / bar area with the most beautiful views across Barcelona.

We also had a free complimentary hotel cocktail.  

Parking was expense 25 euro a day but that's the going rate in the area.

I CAN NOT WAIT to book here again AMAZING hotel one of my favourites 

Thank you xxx   ",5,2016,06,27
35,Relaxing pre/post cruise hotel with roof top pool and great views of Barcelona & the port,"I booked into this hotel with my husband post cruise for a 1 night stay as we wanted to be in walking distance of Las Ramblas but wanted an outdoor pool. Hotel is modern and minimal but very clean and our standard room was huge with a balcony & whirlpool bath. The hotel has huge public areas and lovely bar downstairs. 5/10 minute walk to the marina shopping centre and to the start of Las Ramblas. We shopped in morning and headed to the pool for the afternoon, our room was ready for 1pm. The rooftop pool area does need some tlc as there are a few uneven paving stones but it was clean with wooden cushioned loungers, towels, & rooftop bar selling snacks...........pool too cold to use though & very small. Fab view of port from the roof to see cruise ships leave in the evening. On the 2nd day we checked out of room at 1.30pm (hotel extended from 12 on request for free), left cases in left luggage and spent afternoon at pool and showered in the gym changing rooms later in the evening to travel back to the airport. We found prices of food to be typical of a 4/5 star hotel, but value for money (excellent club sandwich & tapas).......at the back of the hotel (on a lower level that you get into a lift to get to) there are a handful of tapas / pizza small restaurants located around a courtyard that serve nearby offices so worth having a look as we didn't notice this until we were leaving. A peaceful sanctuary withe bustle of Barcelona a short walk away.",4,2016,06,26
35,"Clean and tidy, ","Booked months ago after staying last year....rooms very clean....great location, expensive drinks and food.... It is a business hotel more than an all out holiday hotel... Would ask for a high room front or side facing, not a rear facing room as the view overlooks the courtyard and office area....on both occasions our and the rest of our parties rooms were very clean, rooms cleaned and replenished every day...pool is a plunge pool on the top floor

Area gets busy at night as you are right in the middle of the harbour so see the ferries, cruise liners and yachts coming and going..but nothing compared to Ka Rambla

Would I go back? Yes because it is far enough away from all the noise and bars but only a 6 minute stroll to the bottom of La Rambla.

Took advantage of a discount offered after subscribing to their email list which made the stay very competitive compared to their advertised price but we had to fit in with the dates on offer.

Taxis easy enough to get outside hotel (8/12€ to Plaça de Catalunya) or public buses and tour busses 2 minute walk away",5,2016,06,26
35,Lovely stay in Barcelona,"Great hotel!
Fantastic welcome from the doorman and reception staff.
Lovely (and huge) room which was kept spotlessly clean.
The hotel is in a great location on the marina, but only 5 minutes walk to Las Ramblas.
Breakfast had lots of variety and the restaurant staff were efficient and friendly.
If we return to Barcelona, we would definitely book this hotel again!",5,2016,06,24
35,"Very good, no surprises","A very standard chain hotel. I was crashing there for a couple of days and spent very little time inside, so no complaints. It is part of a very large complex (which includes an office building). Everything is of a corporate style, and no boutique feel. Breakfast and room service are standard, as expected. I do like the sauna, swimming pool with jacuzzi, and the steam room. This is not a resort. What more could you expect or ask for?",4,2016,06,23
35,"No real complaints, you won't be disappointed","Great location for the marina and La Rambla, with bus stop pretty much outside the door.

Lovely room with walk in wardrobe and the most comfy bed and pillows ever! Fairly business like but nothing to complain about. Superb service from the concierge who was very friendly and helpful.

Pool on the small side and we found it difficult to get a sun lounger, but great views of the city and coast from the rooftop.

Breakfast expensive, save your money and buy a croissant and drink from the ground floor in the world trade centre.",4,2016,06,21
35,"Great Location, but.....","Very disappointed with the first room that we were given. There were two pairs of slippers on the side of the bath, no robes, used shampoo and shower gel in the shower and a view into an office block window. The pool on the roof is described as a swimming pool, but is really a plunge pool. We also had to query our bar bill on three separate occasions, as prices charged were not as stated on the bar menu. Our bar bills were rectified immediately but this should not have happened in a 5* hotel. The roof terrace we couldn't go to on the first night as there was a private function and it was pretty desolate on the other nights we were there. We had to go to the bar and get our own drinks to take up there.
However.... Staff were happy to move us to another room as long as I went back the next day, before noon. Luckily we were moved and to a room that had a nice view and it was considerably lighter.  The breakfast choice is good, if a little expensive (we were room only), the beds are extremely comfortable and the location is perfect for exploring Barcelona. Las Ramblas is only a short walk away and the city tour bus is more or less outside. If you require any information/advice or tickets to local attractions, the concierge desk are excellent. 
We booked our room through the hotel website several weeks before we arrived, and paid the price offered on their website. In hindsight, if you are willing to take the risk, book through a price comparison website. We could have saved ourselves over a third of the price, and probably wouldn't have minded some of the disappointments.",4,2016,06,20
35,Corporate hotel,This hotel is professional and clean but lacks warmth and charm. The pool was a disappointment. The view is blocked by the office building. There was no hotel store for personal amenities. The staff was very nice and helpful. I would return for business but not leisure. ,3,2016,06,18
35,Dissapointed,"Really looking forward to this 4 day break and the Grand Marina was pretty central with amazing views or so we thought..
My partner and I paid for the delux room and our room was far from delux we were situated on 5th floor and all this level had a balcony but not ours we were stuck on the corner with no balcony only one opening window and facing an office block . The curtains were coming off the pole and didn't close the nets were dirty and office staff could see through and the room was very small not at all like the images displayed by the hotel. We were assured we had the correct room and if we wanted an alternative we would have to pay extra. (What a joke) we had paid just short of  £1.500 for delux. We had not bathrobes and only one set of towels, we had to remove the bulb from lamp on night time as it wouldn't switch off.
At breakfast you are told where to sit and we were refused an outside table. (Was not happy).
However the room was very clean and once out of our room the harbour itself was amazing. The choice of breakfast was good but sometimes ram short on food and you had to wait. 
Overall Barcelona is fabulous and we will go again just would not stay in this hotel again. I have stayed in a lot of 3.4.5 star hotels and our experience of service room and attitude was dissapointing and I have stayed in better 3 star hotels.
Hope this helps.",3,2016,06,17
35,Three nights in Barcelona,"Warm welcome, with valet parking and smooth polite check in. 

I had a 'superior' room, which is I think 5 star hotel speak for their standard room.  Nice room, modern, clean and a comfortable bed. Reasonable rather than large size.  In bath' shower, and I've seen a lot better showers in lower category hotels. 

A couple of small niggles. I guess about a 100 tv channels but no guide function on the very basic remote nor list in the hotel guide.  

The temperature control in my room kept resetting itself to 23 deg after several hours even when leaving the card in the room master switch. And as mentioned by others no bath robes. 

The pool area is ok, but hardly stunning.  Nice well equipped gym. 

I was there during the Euro 2016 football tournament and football matches were advertised in the hotel as being shown in the swimming pool bar - but for a match starting a 6 when I went to watch the second half at 7 I was told the bar was closed! Why advertise the match - it only leads to disappointment. 

Room service was quick and polite. As was the service in the lobby bar. Staff in general were polite. 

Rooms can be serviced quite late in the day although they did do mine when I then asked at 3 in the afternoon. 

It's about a 10 minute walk to the sea end of the Ramblas. There's nothing immediately adjacent to the hotel, just the liner terminals. 

Personally I thought it lacked a little atmosphere. 

I was quite happy there but had a discounted rate. If I'd paid more would have been less satisfied. For me this is four star standard - not 5. ",4,2016,06,17
35,Barcelona Break,"Just returned from my first visit to Barcelona, great city!! Probably the easiest city to get about in I've visited. The city tour buses are a joy to use with plenty of stops and frequent buses, never really waited more than 5 or 10 mins at stops.
Stayed at the Grand Marina Hotel next to the marina and all the comings and goings of the boats and ferries on the jettys to each side of the hotel just added to the stay, made you feel you were right in heart and essence of this busy port. Las Ramblas is only 10 mins walk as are all the bars and shops on the marina next door. 
The hotel itself is busy and bustling having links to World Trade Centre at the back, you really do feel part of the city. The hotels interior has the feeling of an ocean liner with all the corridoors clad in wood and the rooms are huge. Didn't eat in the restaurant as so many Tapas bars to sample and enjoy but the breakfast was very good with a great selection of everything you could possibly want with the option of indoors or on the large outdoor terrace in the warm morning sunshine, bliss!!",5,2016,06,17
35,Not a 5 stars,"Hotel is well located, next to the cruise pier. Check in experience was poor and registration staff was not pleasant.
Room (standard) is not well designed. Good luck finding a plug to charge the electronics! There is a wall that separates the bed room with a ""sitting area"" that leaves the room in the dark. The amenities were tacky and the shower was difficult to understand. had too many knobs.
This is not a 5 stars hotel. Would not recommend.",2,2016,06,17
35,Repeat visit - very comfortable,"I have visited here twice now and had fantastic service and a very comfortable stay both times. The rooms are spacious (more like a mini-apartment!) and the breakfasts are excellent! Can be better to order breakfast as room service to get the poached eggs or a lighter meal - the buffet is so good it's hard to choose! 
I also tried their massage sportiv and can highly recommend this!

The only downside... The cocktails could do with a little work... 😉",5,2016,06,16
35,Great rooms but foyer and reception feel sterile and cold,"The hotel was in a great location - within walking distance to main shopping and short taxi ride to beach. Upon arrival we found the reception staff not very friendly and a bit cold, like the surroundings. But a few days in we found the concierge staff very different, they were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was very good with a large variety of food.
Rooms were very modern and comfortable.",3,2016,06,16
35,Very nice junior suite,"We stayed here the night before embarking on a cruise. We had what I believe was a junior suite with sitting room, TV area, walk through wardrobe, large bathroom with jacuzzi and walkin shower plus two toilets. Had a very nice meal in the small restaurant forgot before hand in the bar that the Spanish do not know when to stop pouring the gin !!  If going on a cruise make sure you know where the ship is, ours was at the back on the WTC with the terminal entrance 30 ft from the hotel so our two mile round trip in the taxi was not necessary. We all saw the funny side of it! Would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,06,15
35,Perfect for our family city break!,"This was the perfect hotel for a family city break, if you book a family room, you get two adjoining suites which a beautiful and the price is similar to most hotels where the kids are on a sofa bed in your room. The staff were so friendly and kind, pool and pool bar are perfect for spending half the day while you go out around the city for the other half. I really couldn't be more positive about this place and especially the set up of their family accommodation, we will definitely go back.",5,2016,06,12
35,Not bad,Stayed here a week ago. Found the breakfast extremely expensive for what it was. The room was pleasant and felt comfortable. We hired bikes through the hotel too and again expensive and they wanted them back by 10:00 pm which was a little early but very good fun.,3,2016,06,11
35,"Best location, value for the money spent ","+ location, staff, (small) pool on the rooftop, sauna, free wifi
- breakfast for 27.5 extra, we ate in downtown; water in the shower is warm after you stay and wait
We are absolutely happy we stayed in the hotel instead of la ramblas options. Going along the port is a nice evening fun",4,2016,06,11
35,Fawlty Towers!,This must be the worst hotel I have ever stayed at with my husband and friends.  This was part of my husbands celebrations for his 65th birthday.  There were so many things wrong with this hotel I could write a book on it.  The check in staff were ok but we had to wait for our room but we had arrived early so we went out for lunch with our friends.  Came back about 1730 and couldn't get into our room.  When staff came to help they asked if we really wanted to get into our room!!    Two days later the same happened and our room hadn't even been cleaned.  The shower was hanging on the wall just! Powdered milk and wooden stirrers.  5 stars I don't think so.  Breakfast at €25 was a tepid affaire.  They charged my credit card as soon as we arrived.  Bar staff tried charging for a glass of ice!  Loose paving stones near the tiny pool.    This hotel might have been 5 stars when Barcelona had the olympics but would be struggling to make 2 stars now.  Accommodation is very tired and is in need of revamping.  The general manager seemed to find it very funny that we were locked out of our room.  As recompense we asked for 3 g & t's and a white wine.  It took half an hour to arrive and no white wine.  This hotel is not worth the money.,1,2016,06,10
35,Great Location!,"Stayed here for 7 days early May 2016. Very nice big hotel, staff extremely pleasant & great buffet breakfast, in a great location, a 20min very pleasant dander along a pedestrianised zone to beach, 10min very pleasant dander to the main strip. Great promenade along beach with loads of bike hire, scooter hire options - a great place to people watch. Small rooftop pool with sun loungers but unfortunately no shady places so not recommended for my pale irish skin! But there is so much to do & see all within walking distance. Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,06,08
35,Beautiful Barcelona ,"We booked this hotel on the recommendation of friends. Glad we did,  the location is perfect. Situated on the harbour and only 5 minutes away from Las Ramblas. The rooms are splendid and the service from staff is perfect. We chose room only but could not resist the breakfast, it is worth booking it. Very good choice and glad you could add it onto the bill. I would definitely stay here again next visit to Barcelona. ",5,2016,06,08
35,Magnifique ,"Perfect place and perfect hotel, we have had an upgraded suite! Just amazing. Sea view and well located. The hotel rent electric bikes. Rooms are clean and totally equipment you need are available. Breakfast perfect, room service perfect ",5,2016,06,08
35,Nice hotel ,Nice 5 stars hotel clean room  the air conditioning was very cold . Takes about 15 minutes to the Rambla st. And 25 minutes to the beach. Near to magnum mall . Nice staff very friendly people . Nice and good,5,2016,06,07
35,"Fantastic Hotel, Fantastic Location, Fantastic Staff","The hotel itself is fantastic, located on by the sea, in my opinion in the best place in Barcelona, walking distance of 10 minutes to the center! Rooms are clean and big with fantastic view and the hotel is fully surrounded by the sea! I work in a hotel myself and the experience in this hotel was amazing! Made us feel like home! Bell team always welcoming us with a good mood and maids always helpful!  
Also the breakfast was extraordinary and the staff in it as well! 
Big variety of everything and a very nice restaurant! Staff at the breakfast helpful all the time by our side! 

We enjoyed our stay in the hotel and we highly recommend this hotel for the location, the surroundings, the staff and everything! One of the best in Barcelona! 
We will return for sure!",5,2016,06,06
35,great hotel,"great location,in Port Vell, it takes for about 20min.to walk down to Barceloneta Beach. The Staff is extremely polite and engaged, always checking that everything is fine. We took a superior double room and it was excellent. 8th floor pool is extremely little, no chance to swim in it. maybe just the kids :)",5,2016,06,06
35,Good Location,"This property is located on a pier adjacent to the cruise terminal.  The hotel is part of a larger complex of offices.  Some of the smaller cruise ships dock immediately next to the hotel - 30 second walk from ship to front door.  It is not within walking distance of the main cruise terminal.  I think the cruise terminal shuttle bus stops about 100 meters from the hotel.  The Barcelona HoHo bus stops close to the hotel front door.

The lower end of Las Ramblas is a 5-10 minute walk and the metro stop is only slightly farther.  There is nothing immediately around the hotel.  If not dining in the hotel then plan on a trip somewhere.

The hotel is very pleasant.  Some of the rooms have great views.  The rooftop is a nice place for a drink.  Rooms themselves were fine.  Immediately outside our window was a very bright decorative light which required closed drapes.  Fortunately, it was turned off some time in the night.

Food and drinks were pricey.  As mentioned, ice for your room is indeed 5 euros.  I ate in the bar where the food was fine.  I did not try any of the restaurants.

Staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful.",4,2016,05,30
35,"Nice Hotel, But some issues.","At first nice. Friendly employees. But second day afther a full day of site seeing you attend your room who has not been cleaned, and you need to ask for cleaning is a no go. Later we asked some ice cubes at the bar to use in the room and they told us to order it from the room via room service. Thats what we did.... awswer. Ok sir, you will have a charge off  5 Euro. Disappointed.",4,2016,05,28
35,Good location and good sized room,"The best thing about this hotel is the location, on the sea, which was the perfect place for exploring the Barcelona beach and marina.  Room was a good size and the shower was amazing! (Different jets, lots of different taps and phenomenal pressure.)  View from the room was really uninspiring though - first of a ventilation fan, then (after moving room) staring straight at another building.  Breakfast had a very good selection of food - hot, cold, fruit and pastries and room service food was good quality.  Beware though as hotel offers smoking rooms as well as non-smoking so make sure you specify your preference.  Expensive for what it was - especially when compared to other prices in Barcelona, but no issues and a pleasant stay.",4,2016,05,26
35,"Pleasant stay, cool place","I've been there just for a while but the feeling was great. First of all I received an upgrade to junior suite (you must see folks!) and we enjoyed the room so much. Very good the food, drinks, the service is really a Five Star Service (not always the same in other hotels). Thank you very much, we will book again!",5,2016,05,25
35,Nice room but not as good as I expected,"The hotel is really well located for exploring Barcelona and this is surely the best thing about the hotel, as its quiet in the evening but only a few minutes walk to Las Ramblas or the beach.

Our room was nice, but wasn't perfect. We had to have a few things fixed, which were done promptly, but still not a great start. I was also disappointed that there were No bath robes, which I found unusual for a 5* hotel. 

The staff were very nice, but I found drink and food to be over-priced. It was cheaper to drink a bottle of Cava at a Michelin star restaurant than in the hotel bar! 

The pool on the roof was disappointing, it was very cold and much smaller than the photographs suggest.

Overall it was an ok hotel, but for the money I'm sure there is better in Barcelona. ",3,2016,05,22
35,Perfect stay for business,"We stayed here during the GSM World Forum. This is a luxury hotel, spacious and comfort room with wifi. The service also good, as well as the breakfast. We held a half day meeting here also and the meeting room and the refreshment were good.
The distance from La Rambla around 10 minutes by walk.",5,2016,05,21
35,Fantastic hotel! Fantastic staff!,Stayed here beginning of May... What a fab hotel and the staff couldn't do any more for you with being welcoming and helpful. Reasonably priced and views are fantastic. Great location and is also on the tour bus route. Great restaurant and bar to top this great place off! Fantastic!! ,5,2016,05,18
35,4***Hotel,"Beautiful Hotel, good service and nice staff. Simple decoration, very clean room, big bathroom. Breakfast included. I stayed at the 7th floor so i had a great view to the city, its near transports so you can visit every place. This was the best hotel i ever been, I realy enjoy it. Next time i will look for the same hotel in other countries.",4,2016,05,17
35,Classy and friendly,"Our stay at Gran Marina were inspired by good discount(half price) at hotels.com.Nothing special there.
Our expectations were little to none when we arrived from airport but our worries were instantly eradicated by level of service. That exellence in service proved out to be constant highlight in our stay! Reception were very friendly and resourceful towards our various problems including late dining in the city,quick taxi at rush hour,football game just to mention a few.
Room was clean, up to date and spacious.
Bathroom included a jacuzzi but water pressure and temperature control in shower was poor.
Breakfast had great variety of goods and wines were included.
There is rooftop pool and bar with plenty of sunchairs that we were lucky to enjoy for a day.Rooftop also offers good view over the city.
All in all a good stay but it all comes with pretty decent prize tag.",4,2016,05,17
35,Everything was good,"Big, clean rooms. Very helpful staff.  Breakfast at good level. Interesting location but there aren't rooms with sea view. Wi-fi in room was ok. It takes about ten minutes to get to Rambla and metro on foot.
There is  small pool on the roof - beautiful view.",4,2016,05,15
35,Rudest staff ive ever known,"For the quality of the hotel the staff need to be thought about customer service they were the most rude abrupt unhelpful staff i have ever met, they had a disgusting attitude. We didnt even end up staying in the hotel, the staff didnt really seem to care or even want us to have had our reservation, would never go back.",1,2016,05,14
35,Decent,"It is a very decent hotel. The rooms in the corner have bay view. The breakfast buffet spread is lavish and sumptuous. The hotel is located about 3kms from La Ramblas. The concierge was very helpful and there are bike rentals right outside the hotel.The hop on hop off buses pass right outside the Hotel. So, i took the tickets for 3 days and got off at whichever place i wanted to go.Ample warnings about pickpockets are given everywhere. So take care of ur belongings. I loved the city.",4,2016,05,13
35,practically faultless,"An amazing hotel, very well situated, expensive but you do get what you pay for, the views are superb, a little strange to have offices and shops behind you. Good location to see the cruise ships, there is a tower in front of the building for the sky lifts but for us it added to the views.  Easy walking distance to the ramblas, the marina, the beach and montjuic. Fantastic choices for breakfast, you can eat inside or out. The only grumbles are that the drinks are expensive even for a hotel of this type (a rum and coke and a mojito came in at 26 euros), and we had some works ongoing with the water and on one day the shower had no cold water so scalding hot. Good service, friendly staff, the breakfast staff in particular couldn't do enough for us.",5,2016,05,09
35,"Hotel was ok, very business like and many issues during stay","We stayed here for five nights after booking a mystery hotel in Barcelona with one of the online booking sites.

The hotel is very much a corporate hotel aimed at business users and is located in the middle of the port and is not a beach front hotel as advertised by the booking site (30mins walk to the beach). Location wise it is 10 mins walk to the metro and 20 mins from a variety of places to eat. (Excluding places on las ramblas)

The good

- This is a five star hotel and the service from all staff is efficient and everyone we spoke to spoke good English.
- The room was clean and could be cleaned everyday if you wanted it to be.

Unfortunately we had a number of issues whilst staying including:

- We were informed water would be off for 6 hours one evening for ordinary maintenance, but in the morning it was broken meaning it was past lunch time by the time we managed to have a wash and get out and missed half our day along with having to pay extra to visit the places we had planned on going. (We did get a bottle of cava delivered to our room as an apology)
- Arrived back the last evening to find a smoke smell coming through the air con, not sure why, guessing it was from a smoking room or a bar, but as this was our last night, we simply chose to turn the air con off and not have their maintance team look at things at 11pm at night. Room still smelt as we were leaving the next morning.
- Sliding door didn't close properly to the frame meaning all outside sounds / music from the bar could easily be heard at night. This was especially loud Friday evening up to 2am.
- Had to call someone to reset the safe twice as it locked us out.
- TV or remote didn't work for the entire stay.

We chose to report some issues like water, safe, smoke, but left others as we were not here to constantly be on the phone reporting issues and didn't want people in our room all the time. I have honestly never had so many things go wrong whilst staying in a hotel.

We had requested a quiet harbour view room on the higher floors before arriving by phoning them (they don't reply to emails or their online chat), but we ended up with an internal facing room on the higher floors that wasn't particly quiet. Staff were also very strict about check-in time being at 3pm and we had to wait an hour as we arrived at 2pm to get our keys.

The rooms all have the facilities that you would expect, I wouldn't say they are that modern, but it's comfortable. However if you like a quiet room at night, then this may be a hotel that you avoid.

We had food delivered to our room twice whilst staying, first time the meals were good, the second time the same meal was not as nice. Breakfast was priced at 50 euros per day for two of us, so we chose not to have this.

Overall, this hotel should be ok for a business stay, but we just had too many problems and it was maybe just a bit too business like for our leisure break.",2,2016,05,07
35,A real 5 star. ,"Stayed here for two wonderful nights. Room great, jacuzzi bath a bonus. Staff great, ambience great location great. Couldn't ask for more for a short break. Reception staff couldn't be more helpful. Opted for a smoking room which was perfect. Lovely large bed. 
Picture of the pool a little deceptive. It's smaller than the pictures show. 
",5,2016,05,05
35,Great hotel,"We stayed at the hotel before leaving for a cruise .
Great location , near the ramblas and the port , great hotel , very good staff . 
Delicious breakfast not a must if not included, as it is quite expensive.",5,2016,05,04
35,"Rude staff, rooms not as advertised","Arrived there with my partner as an engagement surprise break, we booked what we thought was a top hotel. On arrival the staff where very rude and unhelpful. We got to our room which was cramped and smelled like raw sewage. I went down to reception and complained about the room looking nothing like advertised and they just shrugged and said well unless you want a suite at an extra €300 per night then that was it, the staff then turned their back on me and walked away.
The hotel was full of rude people, mostly occupied by business people using the adjoining world trade centre, yet again nothing like advertised.
I complained for the first time in my life and it fell on deaf ears from both jet2 holidays and the hotel direct.
If you're on a business trip and don't mind a cramped room with in personal staff and the stench of raw sewage then this is the hotel for you!!
Shocking",1,2016,05,04
35,Love this place,"Large, comfortable rooms with large, comfortable bed and excellent view. Couldn't really fault it. Not cheap, but very good at the price.  Hotel is walking distance from La Rambla, Montjuic and Barcelonetta. Great location.",5,2016,05,02
35,"Gorgeous rooms, fantastic view!","We chose the Grand Marina because we had an early-morning ferry to the islands the next day. The location could not have been more convenient. The drive to the ferry line took exactly 3 minutes! Fortunately we arrived early, so we had time to enjoy the amazing roof-top terrace and swimming pool (ok, the pool is… not large, but the views out over the Mediterranean are crazy beautiful!). It was also fun to watch the cruise ships and ferries arrive and depart. We had a spacious (for Europe), very quiet fifth-floor room with parquet flooring and a fairly large balcony, with gorgeous views of the entire city. Lovely bathroom, and a fabulous walk-in closet that I want to replicate in my own home! Nice toiletries, fluffy bathrobes. Floor to ceiling windows. The hotel is located essentially on the water in Port Veil, so it is walking distance to the Ramblas, Ravel, Barri Gotic and Barceloneta. We are very much looking forward to going back!",5,2016,05,02
35,Good location for las rambles. ,"By the dock where the ferries and cruise boats dock. About 5 mins from south end of last ramblas and drassanes metro station.
Staff generally were polite and friendly. I had a room with a balcony but it seems these either look out at the courtyard by world trade centre or at the front towards Barcelona which is ok as a view but not great.
Room was very clean.  Bed was comfortable and air-conditioning worked well. 
My only real issue was that breakfast service was hit and miss.   Day 1 i had to ask 3 times for a hot drink. Day 2 was fine.  Day 3 they cleared my table including my drink as I got some toast.  

There is quite a lot within walking distance but I recommend multi day metro tickets front here as most of the big attractions  such as la familia and nou camp would be a 1hour walk. 

It's not in a quiet location as most days the cruise ships made noise such as engines , horns and loud speakers. One night there was a very loud event in the courtyard held by a delegation at the trade centre.
Overall it was a pleasant stay  but at these prices I'd probably have expected a bit more. ",5,2016,04,28
35,Great location with calm environment to relax after a day of sight seeing,"The essentials are great. Spacious room, comfortable bed and pillows, nice furniture. The location is great, it's a cozy place where you go through the small park right from the city center. El Raval, Gothic Quarter and El Born are right there with the great infrastructure for tourists. Moreover, the metal construction in front of the hotel is a cableway station, the next one is at the Montjuic Mountain which is a really nice place.

I never felt this place as a 5 stars hotel. Maybe for Spain... I would like to think about it as of a great 3 stars or mediocre 4 stars. It doesn't have any gloss of a 5 stars hotel. Reception is helpful but can't fulfill some basic requests. You should call to get a bathrobe, waitress misses to clean some stuff, etc.

Generally, I'm advising this hotel as it fulfills all basic stuff completely. Just don't expect too much.",4,2016,04,28
35,5 star ,"Definitely worth the 5 stars. A really efficient concierge service upon arrival. They gave us free cava as it was our anniversary.

The room was really big with two compartments and a great view over Barcelona. 

The location is walking distance to las rambles and the Christopher Columbus statue.

The staff were extremely helpful and gave us lots of good restaurant options. They were also great when helping us get Barcelona season tickets from my friend who didn't have the time to meet us and made the transaction easy.

We went in winter so the price was worth it but it's hard to say about the summer prices.",5,2016,04,26
35,Great Hotel,"Lovely clean and quality hotel. The bedrooms are Hugh with very comfortable beds and pillows.

Food was great and service second to non.

Position was good being very handy for the cruise terminals and only 10mins walk to Las Ramblas.

Highly recommended",5,2016,04,25
35,Ok hotel.,"We stayed at this hotel for our family holiday with our young children. We booked a city suite room.  The hotel was ok. In fact, this word probably sums up my overall view of the hotel and our experience. 
Rooms were clean and tidy but the hotel and the rooms lacked a ""wow"" factor. Everything was just...ok...
The breakfast buffet was however very good with a vast range of options. The breakfast staff were especially professional and always happy to help and very friendly. 
The hotel restaurant for dinner was extremely quiet, small and with a very limited menu (perhaps why there were hardly any guests, although the food that we ordered was very nice). 
The hotel lobby / bar area was very boring, not much to look at or do. There wasn't much of a buzzy atmosphere. There was also very limited staff within the bar area so ordering a drink or a bar snack took some time. 
There is also not a lot around the hotel in terms of facilities, restaurants, bars, shops and you need to walk for 15-20mins to buy / see things. 
Overall, our experience was ok. Nothing to overly complain about but nothing to really praise about either.",3,2016,04,25
35,Great location,"I have been here last year with my husband for a quick short vacation. We stayed for 9 nights at this great hotel. The location is the most special thing about it, you can teach every thing by walking. We never used the car or taxi except when it rains cats and dogs. The breakfast is delicious with many selection. It is a quite and calm hotel. ",5,2016,04,24
35,"From the doorman's hello to goodbye, this hotel was excellent.","We stayed here in March and found the hotel to be well appointed, in an excellent location and with staff who could not have been more co-operative or pleasant.
Our room had a balcony, allowing us to enjoy a view over Barcelona right up to Montjuic and around to Port Vell.  
From the hotel it was only a short walk to Drassanes Metro station or to La Rambla to access touristic sites, or to wander about and make our own discoveries.  We found that a 1.5 hour ferry tour with nearby Golondrinas gave a different view again of the busy port and Barceloneta.
Throughout our stay, we found the breakfast staff to be welcoming and accommodating, as were all others we encountered in our movement around the hotel.  We loved it!",5,2016,04,24
35,Excellent choice ,"The location is the main important issue for me .
To be near from anywhere is a good thing because you are a tourist. 
The hotel is very good. All the staff helpful and kindly. If I will visit this city again then this hotel will be my choice again. ",4,2016,04,23
35,Great Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Grand Marina Hotel for one week. The location of the hotel is very convenient. It is a 5-10 min walk from the city centre, the mall or just a walk along the seaside. The view from our room was breathtaking. It overlooked the port and the city. They served a breakfast buffet which included a great variety of choices. Breakfast is served till 10:30am which I think should be extended till 11am. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and spacious. I would definitely stay again at this hotel.",5,2016,04,20
35,Ticks all the boxes,"I stayed here for three nights in April, on a work event - the hotel exuded quality in all areas, the only thing that annoyed me is they didn't replenish the free water bottles after the first night. The room was perfect, the fitness room excellent, the bar facilities superb, impossible to fault. ",5,2016,04,20
35,A night in Gran Marina Hotel,"This was a really good surprise! The hotel is near everything. We stayed only a night but we regretted not staying more. Rooms were really of quality, breakfast was too. Staffs are welcoming. And what a amazing view on the top!!! And in addition there is a sympathetic lounge bar at the top next to the swimming pool with two Spanish guys who make you fabulous cocktails! (If someone can remain me their names) 
If you want to relax after visiting all the city it is the perfect hotel!!! ",5,2016,04,19
35,Clean & Convenient,"We chose this property due to it's location.  Although not right in the middle of town, we found it to be very convenient to the sites and shopping areas.  It was a great location for exploring the city by foot.  The property is modern and clean with all of the expected amenities.",5,2016,04,18
35,1 night business stay in grand marina,"
I stayed one night for business in a suite room.
This is an odd choice for Barcelona - a city full with boutique hotels - as the hotel is big- typical congress hotel, kind of new but ugly building , at the seaside but not facing the sea, kind of central but in really quite a walk ...
Room designs are rather outdated - modern but wooden interiors - suite was everything but a suite - with a little extension of a couch and a TV. Amenities were great if we were in a 70's movie set , branded plastic bags with lots to open - nothing to enjoy.
Service at checkin was not particularly welcoming somewhat harsh feel.
Only thing I can complement is the breakfast - nice rich selection for EU standards .
Avoid it if you want to have an authentic experience - unless you are tied or get a particularly good deal.
",3,2016,04,15
35,Good Hotel,"Rooms are big and comfy. 

Location is good. with nice views (if you like ships big cruise ships you will enjoy you views here.) 

pool is not that big but nice and not crowded. 

Service is good. 
Room service is good too.",4,2016,04,13
35,WoW. Perfect for a Pre-cruise stay. ,"We picked the hotel owing to its proximity to the cruise terminal. It's perfect. A 3 minute taxi ride in the morning dropped us at the ship (it's not walkable due to the geography). 

We had booked two rooms and when we arrived we had been upgraded to two x city suites, each 55m2, with an outer door that could close to essentially make one 110m2 2 bed suite. This only cost us €260. With the suite we received free cocktails and luxury toiletries. The bar was lovely and the staff excellent. Only a few minutes walk to the bottom of La Ramblas. 

When cruising from Barcelona I wouldn't look anywhere else. ",5,2016,04,08
35,Great hotel in city centre Barcelona,This hotel is in a great location close to the end of the Ramblas and adjacent to the cruise terminal. Good quality rooms with excellent breakfasts. We also had a tasty supper as well. Modern with all the usual amenities for a big hotel. Great place to use as a vase for visiting the city centre.,4,2016,04,04
35,Wonderful surprise,"We stayed for one night pre cruise on Silver Spirit in November.  When we arrived, the doorman was quite accommodating and allowed us to leave our car in front of the building while we checked in.  There was a line at check in (early afternoon) and while it took longer than I had hoped, we were upgraded to a city-view suite.  After taking our bags to the room, we retrieved our car and took it back to the airport.  The doorman gave us excellent directions to both a local gas station and the airport.  The room consisted of a bedroom with a living room with small balcony overlooking the city.  The bathroom was very nice with the toilet and shower in a room separated from the bath tub and sink by a glass door.  The bedroom was quiet and had everything we needed for a perfect night's sleep.  The balcony, albeit small, was enjoyable, and we had a picnic lunch on it.

We had drinks and tapas in the bar which was nice and reasonably priced.  Although the server did not speak much English, we had no difficulty communicating.

All in all, I would return any time we are in Barcelona.  The hotel is walking distance to Las Ramblas, Solsona (the shop to buy leather clothing) and Old town.",5,2016,04,02
35,The hotel to be,"If you are visiting Barcelona this hotel must be your staying place without thinking !!

It offers everything you need to have a great trip: location, room quality, great staff, food quality, service speed & quality, helpful concierge desk...... Can't list it all the list gonna be too long :D

Believe me you'll never regret this choice ;)
",5,2016,04,01
35,Luxury with a view,"We spent three nights at this hotel in March. We requested a room with a view on the cruise terminal, as we would be sailing on a cruise after our stay. We were assigned to room 738, which is a room without a balcony. There was no smell or sound in the room coming from the cruise ships or the ferries in the harbour. The windows had perfect isolation. The room was very large, with all the comfort you can expect of a 5 star hotel. The bathroom was also very spacey, with seperate shower and jaccuzzi. The breakfast buffet was the most wonderful feature during our stay, with a huge variety of very good quality food.",4,2016,03,28
35,46th wedding anniversary stay in a beautiful Hotel...,"Very caring personel - Pleasant Premier room of 45m2 - unfortunately no sea or harbour view despite stating wish with 3 weeks anticipation - very clean - had to claim a clogged wash basin, a loose face mirror and a cold shower due to bad regulation... But all was mended immy after claim - appealing and vast breakfast buffet, yet management could organise riper Fruits - very kind and efficient personel. With a little more care this attractive Hotel can call itsself a very good 5* House - very quiet and  convenient for tourism, as tourist bus and metro very nearbye.",4,2016,03,25
35,Good but missing a few things from a 5*,"After reading the poorer reviews I wondered if I was in a different hotel, all the furnishings are 5* but it is missing things that you would expect in a 5*. Toiletries in the bathroom were poor, you had to ask reception for certain things.
Most of the staff that I meet were helpful and curtious, although they did want to charge me €5 for a bucket of ice?!",4,2016,03,24
35,Fabulous one ,"I have stayed in this hotel for 6 days. I really liked it. I care a lot about the staff services and they were very helpful, friendly, optimistic workers and supportive. Hotel location is very appropriate for the tourists as there are many things close to do around. It's recommended.",4,2016,03,23
35,Strange,"I start with good reviews, hotel is surrounded by the sea like a small island and its. Located perfectly in the downtown but close to the beach! Staff are super friendly and nice!!!
But how ever you have the sea from 3 sides but it's not possible to see the sea! There is no view !!! Rooms are very small and closets are super small! I asked for some ice and they charged me for 5 euros!!! ",3,2016,03,22
35,Decent quality,"As the name suggests,  located on the Marina, it's a premium location.

We ran a business meeting here and their operation was slick no we had a great event.

Rooms pretty standard, clean and comfortable.

If you get a chance go up to the rooftop, they have some great views up there.",3,2016,03,18
35,Nice Joint,"Place is ideally located, walking distance from La Ramblas and accessible to most mode of transport like taxis and the like. Food is great at the buffet breakfast, and the people covert helpful and accommodating. Trendy location as well. Ideal for business and family.",4,2016,03,17
35,Graet Hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights and the location is a 3 minutes walk to La Ramble's but enough to be out of the way as your in a port ! ,                                                              The main room and bath  room are very nice and we even had a bottle of bubble sent up as it was my birthday which was nice, I would reckon mend the 8th floor with a city view and the breakfast was also lovely !",5,2016,03,17
35,Best  hotel to enjoy Barcelona  ,Love  love  love  this hotel. Perfect  views perfect  staff and perfect  location . Great  for  exploring the  beauty  of  Barcelona .  Hope  to  book this  summer. Your  busy  exploring  days are rounded off  relaxing in your lovely  rooms  and  the  roof  top  pool  is great .  I have never  eaten  there as you  tend to  be out  all  day and there are  so  many fab  eateries  along  the rambles .  All  in all  fab !,5,2016,03,16
35,Rational choice ,"We stayed here for 3 days. All in all the stay was enjoyable. Would recommend the hotel.
+the main advantage is its location near the city center
+wonderful view from our room: the port with yachts
+comfortable bed and pillows, it was somewhat chilly during the night, but there is additional warm bedspread
+open terrace on the roof
+decent breakfast with enough variety, croissants with custard were delicious
+swimming pool on the roof
-the swimming pool is tiny and not always open because of the weather
-they charge for the parking :(",4,2016,03,15
35,"Perfect location, lovely and helpful staff and awesome experience","We just returned back to staying in the Gran Marina for 2 nights.  It is at the world trade centre but five minutes walk from Las Ramblas. Very friendly staff, incredibly helpful.  The hop on hop off bus was right in front of the hotel, the train station was a 2 min walk and being bang by the port meant taxis and bus services were plentiful.  Breakfast was awesome.  Will recommend this hotel to anyone who is going to Barcelona.  Will surely go back and stay there.",5,2016,03,14
35,Luxury ,"This hotel is pure luxury, the rooms are beautiful. Bright, clean and spacious with a balcony looking over a courtyard, big bath and separate shower and a very comfortable bed! Staff were more than accommodating and very friendly! Breakfast was included in the the room which was buffet breakfast and spoilt for choice. My only complaint was Drinks at the bar were way too overpriced a glass of wine was €7 but hotels tend to do that! ",5,2016,03,12
35,BLISS,"our suite was perfect, views amazing,service couldn't fault. breakfast  and room service excellent! loved our time here dreaming of coming back.. stay here if its you and your hubby totally recommended",5,2016,03,11
35,"Perfect location, great staff, huge room and awesome breakfast buffet","We stayed a whole week for our babymoon - could not have been a better vacation! The staff foremost is outstanding - they were incredibly friendly and the service was great! The location could not be better: you can walk everywhere: las Ramblas, Barceloneta...and you are connected to the tram/subway system immediately. The breakfast buffet was huge with fresh local and American style dishes and was topped off by the dynamic, young staff serving. Of course it is a big hotel and does not provide the charme of small little hotels more downtown, but you know that, when you book it! While it is true that some parts need maintenance, especially the roof top terrace, the rooms themselves were great and had abundant space. The gym on rhe topfloor was also well equipped and tidy! In short, we enjoyed our stay and will definitely return to this hotel and recommend it.",5,2016,03,11
35,"Great hotel, great location and great city","We have just returned from a 3 Night break at this amazing hotel.  We were upgraded to suites with beautiful views over the harbour.  The beds, in particular the pillows,  were very comfortable and there was no 'hotel noise' so slept perfectly.  The staff were so friendly, nothing was too much trouble.  The position is perfect for sightseeing, the cable car is a short walk away, in fact the cable cars go over the hotel and the hop on/hop off buses stop outside.  La Ramblas are about 7 minutes away.  There is a large roof top terrace, gym, small plunge pool and very nice bar area.   The breakfasts were superb, everything you could wish for was on offer and there was even live music (piano or guitars) in the background. There are facilities for storing your suitcase on the day of departure.  One of the best hotels we have stayed in.",5,2016,03,10
35,Three night break,"What can I say! Every aspect of this hotel exceeded my expectation. We arrived early from Heathrow and did not expect a room to be ready but they did offer us a room but we declined it as we waited for our room. They stored our luggage as we walked the short stroll to La Ramblas to have a look around and a coffee. Well after a great 8 mile walk around the town we came back to a fantastic room. It was the ""romantic package"" double aspect room and one of the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Staff here were fantastic polite and courteous. The breakfast buffet  was very good and a vast selection. Toast took time to make but seems to be an issue everywhere I have stayed ( no big deal) we had a bottle of Carva and chocolate covered strawberries delivered to the room when we wanted them and was part of the package. Loved our time there and would not hesitate to recommend or return there. Only criticism would be there is no pool as such, only the one on the roof but this was empty when we stayed.  ",5,2016,03,08
35,Great central location & amazing staff,"We got a great deal on this, booking only 6 weeks in advance, and had NO complaints during our 3 night break. Hotel staff were so helpful, and friendly. Check in was efficient.  The room was amazing, and really large, we had a small dressing room area and a large bathroom with double sinks, and a great power shower. Toiletries provided were good and plentiful (if you run out there are lots of extras at the gym.  
The beds were very comfortable and there is a pillow menu.
The gym is actually a good size with great equipment, we didn't take our workout gear :( there are also male and female saunas within the changing rooms.
We were a very short walk from Las Rambla and some of the main attractions.. Our longest walk was about 5-6 km upto Parc Guell, we didn't use public transport at all during our stay. 
We booked room only and walked to find breakfast, lots of places within 5 min walk. Great place for breakfast we found was the very colourful market.
The corner Bar on the 1st floor of the hotel sells great cocktails!! We spent our first evening here due to horrendous rain and sampled several cocktails and had a burger.., all were very good. You can obviously get food and drink a lot cheaper outside, but atmosphere was great with live music on the Saturday.
Would definitely return to this hotel!!",5,2016,03,05
35,Nice hotel,"Really nice hotel, good views of waterfront. Rooms to a good standard.  Beds are comfortable with little noise from other rooms. 

Pool is nice, given its. City hotel, also have large gym and hot tub. Drinks however quite expensive. But it is a good quality 5* hotel. ",4,2016,03,02
35,Balance between comfort and location,"The hotel provides a great balance between comfort and facilities on the one hand, and location on the other. It is in walking distance of La Rambla and the Gothic Quarter, while being a good starting point for visits further afield. The open-top bus tour has a stop there, and taxis are always waiting.",5,2016,03,02
35,Excellent hotel,"We booked here for a short city break. Excellent location on the Marina with spectacular sea view from room. 
The comfiest bed and fluffiest pillows ever!
The staff were extremely helpful, friendly & polite. 
Lovely bar area with a pianist.
Complimentary cocktails on arrival. 
I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone. 
",5,2016,03,01
35,For the business traveler mainly....,"Fairly large ""concrete block"" hotel down at the Marina of Barcelona. It is part of the World Trade Center and gathered around the needs of the business traveler who is there for meetings or conventions. Does not come across as typical or traditional Spanish, hence if you look for that type of experience need to elsewhere. The staff is very nice, the rooms also, average in size, good facilities and amenities. The hotel restaurant (e.g. for dinner) is surprisingly small, 7 tables, could likely not sit more than 15 people. Menu is very concise as well, some typical dishes, but taste is average and price is about 30-50% over the top. Clearly in Barcelona you dine in of the hundreds excellent restaurants in town. Keep this only as emergency or cannot go out. Being part of the WTC, from most rooms you see into the office of the adjacent buildings and vice versa. Not the best view, while feeling exposed, but is quiet, good sleep!",3,2016,03,01
35,The best hotel in Barcelona,This hotel is very luxury. I am Italian and  I went in many hotels in Barcelona for the Mobile World Congress in the last 10 years. This year I spent a long weekend here with my wife and everything was impressive. The Deluxe Room with sea view is something special.,5,2016,02,27
35,Fantastic stay!,"Location: The hotel is right next to the harbor. It is walking distance to a big shopping center, La rambla and placa de catalunya. It is very easy to get a taxi from the hotel, the staffs will always get the cab for us. 

Bedroom: We requested for a high floor, ocean view room and our wish was granted. We got to stay in a fabulous ocean view room but at the 5th floor which was OK for us. The room was very spacious, lots of closet and walking space. Bed was comfortable. We were able to choose our pillows from the pillow menu but the available pillows were pretty fantastic and so fluffy to begin with (the rita hayworth) so we didn't select other pillows. 

Bathroom: It was amazing. The shower is a little complicated to maneuver though but once u get the hang of it, it is fine. Our amenities came in little bags with ribbons, my husband thinks it's really cute :)

Breakfast: We had breakfasts every morning during our stay in the hotel and we loved it. Every single morning when we arrive at the restaurant lobby, we were pleasantly greeted by the musicians in the lobby who would delight the guests with lovely classics during breakfast :) The buffet spread includes the usual scramble eggs, sausages etc as well as fruits, yogurt, granola...they also had a whole section of pastries and bread. Juice and fruits were aplenty. You can also choose to order an omelette from the server. 

Staffs: They were all exceptionally friendly and accommodating. They greeted us with bright smiles all the time. We had written some postcards to be sent home and the concierge told us that they can send it for us for no charge! 

Room service: Amazingly quick and still hot. Our food came with all the appropriate side seasonings so we didn't have to call in for mustard/ ketchup/ vinegar etc they gave it all !

We told them that it was our honeymoon and they gave us a complimentary welcome drink at the bar. It was a very wonderful start to our stay :)",5,2016,02,21
35,♥ Valentine ,"A great 5 star hotell at The world Trade Center, Barcelona. 
A very nice room, clean and shining.
We wish the stairs was better situated.
A view from the balcony uptown and the Cable car above. 
We think the prices for food and drinks are too high, so we went to La Rambla for an out door breakfast and lunch in the sun.
The hotel has a pool and fitness center at 8th floor, but it was empty mid. February.
The view was brilliant.
The staff are very serviceminded and helpful. There was a Door man and a Bell Boy, in Black and White very polite and helpful. 
",5,2016,02,21
35,Excellent ,"We booked this hotel only 2 days prior to our visit to Barcelona. It was £211 for a two night stay for two people in a standard room only. We arrived in a taxi from the airport and welcomed by a top hatted concierge who carried our cases to reception. I had no change but he didn't hang about for a tip so I didn't feel bad. 
The check in was quick and efficient. We were given a welcome drink card to use in the hotel bar. We got to our room and immediately noted we'd been upgraded to a suite. The bed was massive, the bathroom had a twin sink, jacuzzi bath and separate shower/wet room with side jets. The balcony looked over the city. The room was quiet even though it was adjacent two docks where ferries docked.
I wasn't too keen on claiming the free drink but my partner insisted we should. The barman (who I think was the manager) was a little too pushy and over friendly. We had a cocktail which was nice but he came over about 3 times, giving us food menus, more drinks menus, telling us his name and how he's there to serve us blah blah blah. It made me just want to drink the cocktail and go elsewhere. He was also Barking orders at a young girl which I wasn't impressed with. But if that's the only complaint I can find then it's pretty good. 
I'd 100% want to visit again. The location was fantastic (approx 5 mins walk from las ramblas and 1 minute walk from the hop on hop off tourist bus stop) 
Check out was also quick and efficient. The concierge called us a taxi, told the taxi driver which terminal to take us just by telling him which airline we were flying with. 
Excellent stay. ",5,2016,02,21
35,Short break ,"Great hotel ,rooms clean spacious ,bathroom fantastic .Had a great rooftop swimming pool .Walking distance the centre .Bus stop for the tour  stops just outside .Did not try the resturant as there are so many close buy . Would stay here again",5,2016,02,14
35,Two night stopover after a cruise,"We were made very welcome at the hotel and they were very amenable to upgrading the room that our agent had booked at no additional cost.
The hotel is on the harbour adjacent to the World Trade Centre Barcelona and within easy walking distance of shops and tourist attractions such as the street markets, and 2-3 minutes from the Christopher Columbus monument.",4,2016,02,01
35,Second stay in this lovely hotel,"We have just spent four wonderful nights here, our second visit in two years. From the minute you arrive you are made to feel so welcome by all the staff. Check in was very quick and we had a lovely room with balcony on the 7th floor overlooking Barcelona which was just what I asked for! The room was very spacious with comfortable bed and great bathroom with jacuzzi bath and shower. The hotel is perfectly located for sightseeing, the hop on hop off bus stops just outside. It is right next to the marina and ten minutes walk to La Ramblas. The bar on the first floor is lovely with a pianist and great food from the snack menu. We didn't have breakfast during our stay. Great views from the roof top which will be lovely in summer with sunbeds and a small pool and bar.
Check out was very quick and they will keep your luggage if you have a late flight home.
All in all a fantastic break in a great hotel. Highly recommended. We would certainly return.",5,2016,01,31
35,5 day family trip,"Stayed here for 5 nights and found the hotel to be clean and the rooms fairly good, some with nicer views than others. The staff were helpful and the location is very good for exploring the city or people watching along Las Ramblas. The bar on the 1st floor was our last port of call most nights and was a pleasant place to end the night but , be warned, this is a 5* hotel and its reflected in the prices. All in all an enjoyable stay and would definitely stay here again",4,2016,01,29
35,Amazing,"Stayed in this hotel with my partner for 5 nights. Initially we were put round the side of the hotel looking onto the sea but after 1 night we asked if we could change rooms for a view of the city looking over Barcelona. The staff happily moved us and were so helpful. They even sent a gentleman (even though the room was only down the corridor) to move our luggage to the other room. They were clean, spacious and we had an amazing view of Barcelona. The roof top pool was absolutely freezing but we didn't mind too much as we preferred sunbathing anyway! The bar area was beautiful. Of an evening we sat with a cocktail listening to the gentleman play the piano. Very relaxing. In regards to the staff they couldn't of been any more helpful. Spoke perfect English and helped us find our way to various tourist attractions around Barcelona. And not to mention, the room service (breakfast) was absolutely stunning! From pancakes to fresh fruit, full English, pastries, juices and hot drinks. I really would stay here again. Lovely hotel. ",5,2016,01,28
35,Fabulous weekend,Quick check in. Helpful concierge. Room upgraded after husband told them it was birthday while we were there. Room was beautiful. Hairdryer in the bathroom. Bed very comfortable. Hotel only 5 mins walk from the popular Rambla. We were room only so can't comment on the food. Would highly recommend. ,5,2016,01,24
35,Fabulous hotel.,"You know you have chosen well when the transfer driver is impressed with your choice. Amazing room, clean and spacious. Friendly and very professional staff. Great location, good food, spectacular views. Could not find fault.",5,2016,01,19
35,Short City Break,"Arrived on the Thurs for a two night stay.
Very pleased with the Hotel, great location, great staff and good price.
Lovely room facing the city with great view of all the sights, well appointed room with everything you would expect.
Used the bar on the first floor, nice cocktails and food was ok but would suggest going in to town with so much choice on your doorstep.
Great help from the staff about local attractions and sight seeing advice.
Would definitely recommend and will re book next month when we return.",5,2016,01,18
35,The room was spectacular,"The room was spectacular, the people at the reception desk very nice and friendly. What I disliked was the sound of the boat that was parked right beside the hotel..
I'd recommend it for couples. The hotel is located in the center of the city.",4,2016,01,18
35,Polite staff but incompetent service,"We booked to stay at this hotel for 6 nights over New Year, we paid for a 'luxury' hotel therefore we had high expectations. Overall our expectations were not met and we left feeling disappointed with the service and room. 

The room: We paid for a Deluxe. Beware the photos on their website are wrong - the Deluxe room we were given is exactly the same as the pictures of less expensive Superior Room on their website. 

Our first room smelt strongly of cigarette smoke, we complained immediately. A member of staff visited our room and said that they could not smell it. They said they were fully booked but could bring a machine into our room to clean the air while we vacated for at least 3 hrs. Eventually after two more nights in the smelly room (smoke smell was coming in through the ventilation system from the smoking floor) we were able to move rooms. 

Our new room was much smaller than our first, but we were reassured that it was a Deluxe Room. We emailed the Hotel company to complain abut our experience but its now been two weeks and we have not received a reply.

Breakfast: The buffet has a large range of food. However the breakfast service was understaffed - the staff were there to serve drinks. The poor staff were so overworked during New Year that they hardly had time to offer every table tea and coffee. I would rather just serve myself than waiting 35mins to be offered a drink. They also had eggs a la carte, we ordered poached eggs and it took over 30mins to arrive. 

The room service is mediocre at best - we ordered it for dinner twice. 

Overall we were disappointed because of the amount of money we paid for our room. We are still awaiting an acknowledgement of our email complaint to the company.",2,2016,01,18
35,Exceptional customer service,"We were only there for 2 nights in November but we will return.The staff were absolutely brilliant and most impressive was the research done by the young concierge – Snr Moreno – who gave great advice for a day trip, and then researched  a specific restaurant employing disabled people when I said I’d heard about it.",5,2016,01,16
35,Top quality for a reasonable rate,"Stayed for three nights in July and it was a brilliant stay. We got a great deal as well, so very good value for money. I would say this is a better destination for families than our group (three long time drinking friends), simply because of the quiet area and the relative distance to party spots. But the roof bar is a pretty good alternative.

Pros: Quiet location, very nice rooms, excellent service and food. The staff are really top notch. 

Cons: Bit of a walk to the beach (if, like me, you avoid taxis) and to the nightspots of the city. Apparently not a taxi driver in Barcelona knows where this hotel is (bit of an anecdotal pain--we did manage to survive).",4,2016,01,14
35,Cannot Praise it enough. Best Hotel in Europe.,"I can't praise this hotel enough, the standards of this hotel are amazing. The staff are extremely Helpful anything you ask for regardless if it is Information about the City or a request for your own room from room service. This stay was for my Girlfriends birthday and she adored everything about this hotel. The city views from our room and the 8th Floor are breathe taking.The food in the hotel is of top Quality and the drinks are perfectly balanced in the lounge bar. As a Five star hotel a lot of people would think its unreasonable on pricing, But i assure anyone who reads this review you are mistaken this hotel is the closest you will ever get to perfection. Be it from the Soft Beds and feathered pillows to the warming welcome of the Doormen and the staff at the front counter. Barcelona itself is such a beautiful city there was simply not enough time in a week. Places i would recommend to go to in the City is Maremagnum shopping center and its various restaurants especially Gino's and Kurz & Guts the food is absolutely amazing. I would recommend you avoid is La Surena. the food is horrific and the service is dreadful I would not touch this restaurant again with a ten foot pole.",5,2016,01,13
35,"Very nice, good hotel, ideally situated for Barcelona, quiet but not far from the action!","Really nice five stars hotel with a very good bar and very good customer service.

The hotel is situated a 5 minutes walk to the Rambla and 15 minutes to a shopping center and the Barcelona aquarium.
The hop on - hop off bus stop is 2 minutes walking from this splendid hotel.

Rooms are very nicely decorated with a nice view over the city or the sea. Rooms are clean beds are extremely good and very nice big bathrooms with shower and bath. Wifi is free and works perfect.

One of the better breakfast buffets I have seen in Spain, also catering for gluten intolerant people.

The bar of the hotel has some very interesting and nice cocktails with very friendly personnel.

One downside, they don't have an ""early leavers breakfast"". We had early flights and left at 6 o'clock and could not get any breakfast although we requested from the reception at check-in.
Five stars properties should find a solution for this kind of thing and not saying, ""No sir it's not available, breakfast starts at... AM"".

One tip, go have a look at the swimming pool to have the nicest views over Barcelona and the port. ALso when the swimming pool is closed you can still admire the sights!

+++ good equiped gym",5,2016,01,13
35,"Nice hotel, superb staff and lovely rooms","Stayed here for 4 nights in September. Nice hotel, easy and professional check in, well equipped 5 star rooms, very comfortable beds and high quality bedding, a very nice pillow menu with witty names for the 6 pillow types on offer. In room furnishings high quality, amazing jacuzzi bath!
Room service / housekeeping teams very quick and attentive, particularly when we accidentally blocked the in room safe and needed it reset.

Didn't eat in the hotel since our room rate was exclusive of breakfast and there's so many great restaurants to explore in BCN so cannot rate their restaurants but the room was lovely.

Great location, short walk and you're at the foot of la ramblas.  ",5,2016,01,11
35,Erostars  proper 5 star Hotel,"Even this hotel location is not as center as my previous Eurostars hotels stays, it is still easy walk from city center. 
This hotel is a proper 5 star hotel. Room 741 with  separate living room space and balcony over looking city and mountains.
Reception a big, international style.
Room was obviously nice and  spacious 
Bed/pillows fabulous again. Bathroom  fabulous/ separate shower/bath
Bathrobes/slippers in wardrobe as was also iron and ironing board 
The only  minus: WIFI and some lighting problems. Also, it would have been great to have TV in Bedroom/now it was in Living room only (cost saving: why hotel doesn't add tv aerial connection to Bedroom so customer can choose where they want to watch the TV/if hotel does n t want to invest to another tv)
Over all, Great room
Room service; reasonable fast, however my Lasagna was  not hot. But as I was tired and hungry,I ate it.Tuna Sandwich was reasonably  good. I really hop Food and beverage Management in Eurostars hotels start to think about health options. Sandwich was served with Chips/ why not give customer  to choose  either chips or  salad, for example""
Tried the gym upstairs as well, and sauna (separate  dry saunas in Men's and women's  dressing rooms). GYM is great, spacious and a lot of equipment. Sauna small (sits max 3 people) but nice and hot! 
Brfst: wOW, THIS WAS REAL FIVE STAR BRFST. HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ADD BRFST TO  STAY.An excellent service, excellent selection. Congratulations  Eurostars, here you had a perfect brfst (and serials)
Over all, great  Hotel, and if you looking for 5 star hotel to international standards, this is it. I just hope they upgrade their WIFI. In proper 5 star you expect to have speedy connection",5,2016,01,06
35,Great Christmas stay,"Great check in even though it was the middle of the night. We enjoyed the free welcome drink in the bar with the piano playing. Room was excellent, very luxurious. We enjoyed the spa bath and the view of the cruise ships in the harbour. A bit of a walk to some parts of Barcelona but fine if you're catching the metro around. The concierge gave us a great restaurant recommendation for Christmas day also. One improvement would have been better tea and coffee facilities in the room. There was only powdered milk and no spoons which was annoying when we bought some yoghurt for breakfast and room service were going to charge 5 euro for cutlery according to reception. 
All in all, really enjoyed our stay here. Thank you!!",4,2016,01,03
35,Super hotel!,"We are staying during Christmas and new year. The location is very nice. You are very close to the La Rambla. Unfortunately,  we had a room with view to the inside. From the roof, 8 floor, you have a great view of 360 degrees of the gabor and Barcelona. The room was comfortable and enough room for 3 peoples. ",4,2015,12,30
35,Marina Best Hotel Location,"I stayed at this hotel during Dec 2015.
Check In / Check Out: was outstanding and fast.
Staff: they are friendly and willing to help.
Lobby: quite with a lovely great design.
Room: the room was great with enough space to move around, however, the bed was not comfortable.
Wi-Fi: free
Breakfast buffet: it was excellent with a great variety for the guests.
Concierge Service: they were helpful with enough information to tour the city. 
Location: at the marina and a short walking distance to the downtown.

Overall, I highly recommend this hotel, and surely I would stay at this hotel again if I visited Barcelona.

Thanks to the Hotel team for their fabulous service and taking care of my stay.",5,2015,12,29
35,"Perfect location, very Grand, Friendly staff",Stayed here for 4 nights. The staff is very responsive and try their best to help. It's very close to the metro and bus station. We had our breakfast included in the stay and they had a lavish varierty in the buffet. They upgraded our room for free to a Suite in the top most floor with beautiful views of the city and the port. The hotel is private and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this one.,5,2015,12,28
35,GREAT HOTEL FOR THE PRICE - PERFECT LOCATION,"Perfect location, good service, good price. Highly recommend, located in WTC in Marina.
We got an very big and amazing room with a nice view. The Hotel is made like a ship which gives a very good feeling !",5,2015,12,27
35,"Good location, friendly staff overall good enough hotel",I stayed for 4 days on a business trip and this hotel was fairly decent. It's was very good a few minutes walking from the Rambla. Nearest tube station was 6-7 minutes walk.  It is a simple hotel but had all the essentials; pool and gym. Breakfast was good quality and had a good selection. I would come back again.,4,2015,12,18
35,A really good hotel,I stayed at this wonderful hotel for 6 nights for my wife's birthday. I did a lot of research of were to stay before travelling to Barcelona. Thank God I stayed here the hotel staff was wonderful we stayed in a Jr suit which was amazing. The location is just perfect and would not hesitate to stay here again. The suit was spacious a living room with a sliding door a little sitting area in front of the bed room a walk in closet and a large bathroom for European standards. I only missed on thing which was a nespresso machine which I really take seriously. I would highly recommend this hotel for families or couples you will not be sorry.,5,2015,12,16
35,City/Port Spectacular,"What separates this hotel from a 3 star or a 5 star rating?? Room location. You can be looking at the world trade center or Barcelona's city lights, landscape and amazing port. You must book a room with a view to get the best the Gran Marina has to offer.
Super staff and amenities, within walking distant of La Rambles & Gothic quarter.
If your not a walker,easy and inexpensive transportation is everywhere.",5,2015,12,16
35,Weekend away,"Recently stayed here following a business trip. 
The location is good for the Ramblas if you don't mind walking. 

The rooms are ok but dark. 
Unfortunately ours had a constant dripping toilet of which we informed reception daily but nothing happened. Our telephone didn't work in our room and we found housekeeping very noisy outside our room daily. 

On a plus the lunch tapas served in the bar was great
The roof trerrace was nice for a city hotel, adjacent to offices though and in summer I wouldn't think there would be much room if the hotel was full capacity. 

The location on the docks does mean you can hear shopping. If you want quiet don't stay here. 

I probably wouldn't stay here again",3,2015,12,11
35,"Location, room size","The location is right near Las Ramblas which conveniently takes you to the main square and public transport hub or the hop on hop off interchange. There is also a hop on hop off that stops right at the hotel. It is also near the harbour and waterside which is always a nice thing. Rooms are large as are the bathrooms. Beds were so comfortable, WiFi perfect, they also have a business centre where you can print things off, which was handy for buying tickets. The doorman/ car valet was fantastic, he assisted us with our luggage, parked our car then retrieved it upon leaving. His affable manner put me ease as I'm always nervous about handing over my keys.  Reception was friendly check in smooth as was check out. The only thing that stops me giving it five stars was the fridge was not cold, everything inside was lukewarm, even when I complained nothing was done about it. It also started raining in the bathroom, water from upstairs began pouring into our bathroom. Since we were on our way to check out when it happened it didn't affect our stay but it affected my impression for sure.",4,2015,12,03
35,I advise everyone to stay in this hotel ,"for the the tourists who would like to stay in good hotel and best location ever,  stay in eurostars grand marina Barcelona. 

the rooms is perfect and special thanks to the receptionist for the Marina view room. 

The staff is helpful and the concierge helped us to book the bus city tour. 

at the end,,  Thanks to management of the hotel. ",5,2015,12,03
35,Great hotel near the cruise terminal,"We stayed here for just one-night, as it was the closest hotel to the cruise terminal.

Upon arrival, our luggage was picked up and brought to the front desk.  The lobby was quite stale and the initial impression was of a typical corporate hotel.  Check in was quick, we were on our way to our room, and our luggage followed shortly.

Our room was very well appointed, upon entrance, there was a long hallway; there was a dressing room/closet area immediately to the right, and further down the hall, the bathroom was to the right and had a large dual vanity, with the toilet, bidet, and tub in its own room.  At the end of the hall was the bedroom, which was a nice size, high ceilings and a balcony.  There was a sliding door if you wanted to close off the bedroom from the hallway.  The bed was very comfortable and had very nice sheets.  There was a pillow menu but, I felt that the pillows were all the same.  TV lineup was adequate, mostly in Catalan, but had one FOX and CNN channel in English.

I booked the room to include breakfast, which was an extensive European breakfast. It featured a variety of charcuterie, cheese, pastries, hot items, cereals, juice, and fruit.  They also had a guitar player out in the adjacent lobby area, which was a nice touch.  I ""think"" the retail price was 30E, not sure.  So, you'll save money if you book the room with breakfast on their website.  I don't think I would've shelled out 30E per person but then again, there are no other food options near the hotel unless you walk out to the town.

Basically, we just slept here before boarding our ship, so we didn't go sightseeing or anything.  But, do check out the top floor of the hotel where the gym is.  There is a wrap around terrace with amazing views of the water and city.  Wifi was also free; up to three-devices per room, and the signal was strong.

Overall, service was excellent, accommodations were excellent, and the breakfast was enjoyable.  Yes, this hotel cost significantly more than smaller/independent hotels along Las Ramblas or in town (but significantly less than the big W across the way) but, I felt that we truly got what we paid for.  I would certainly recommend staying here, especially if you're pre/post cruise.",5,2015,12,03
35,Stay in Barcelona,"We stayed in Eurostar GrandMarina hotel for our honeymoon in Barcelona. Hotel is located close to end of La Rambla (~10 min walking). Rooms are very clean and comfortable and we had an amazing view of the city from our room. Breakfast buffet was really good. Staff were super friendly, they would go out of their way to do simple things for us. ",5,2015,12,01
35,"Great hotel, fab location for the Les Rambles and walking the city!","Just on the sea front/harbour. Really easy to walk into the bottom end of Les rambles and take in the city. Shops, eateries etc all within walking distance. Nice hotel, good greeting and rooms very nice. We had a city view facing the cruise ships. If choosing  the higher the better. roof top bar and views are great. the outdoor pool on the top is fine but deceiving from the hotels photos. it's adequate though if you want a dip!",4,2015,12,01
35,Nice Hotel - Great Staff,"The hotel is good enough. But the staff , all of them we met had a big smile and very welcoming, very attentive. Especially the concierge , it a shame i don't remember her name but she was so helpful and genuine in recommending us. If i would ever go back it will be for the staff only !",4,2015,12,01
35,"They Fraudulently Charged my Credit Card $1,174 Before I Even Landed and $350 Next Day!","Eurostar wants this removed because I admitted I never ""slept"" there - WELL, I swear they CHARGED ME as if I DID and they are NOT refunding a penny.  This review is STAYING and according to them it does not matter if you sleep there or not-you ARE going to pay anyways...as I explain below...

Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel fraudulently charged my credit card $1,174 before I even landed and I am a single traveler. I was on a plane and could do NOTHING. Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel excuse when I arrived face to face was I seemed double booked and for nights I was not there inclduing the night I was still in the states. The rates I signed up for was the $165 or so Euros per night for one night.  Because they had credit card data under that reservation they added more reservations for $550 a night rooms- for TWO nights. They admit their staff may have not understood the reservation (their English is terrible) and they admitted I received no services-but said there was ""nothing they could do"" it was all NON-refundable!  It gets BETTER!  I ended up on the street with NO hotel in a foreign country as to not ever hand them my physical card.  AND they are trying to keep my money BUT tell TripAdvisor to pull this report because ""I never slept"" at their hotel.  So-I can pay over a thousand dollars in the hotels opinion but not qualify to leave a review! 

The Manager Manuel refused do correct anything except refund the CHEAPER ONE and that was not good enough. I am not paying $550 Euros a night for any room. As soon as my bank credited me--right in front of the manager (gotta love Chase) they turned around and charged my card again for like $814. NO SERVICES WERE EVER USED. And ultimately I never slept there. I never handed them my card nor signed for anything. 

I simply went to Hotel W and do not trust this company with your card. Because of them I had to cancel my card WHILE on the FIRST  DAY of my trip! Not counting pretty much ruining the start of my trip. That did not bother them AT ALL!  You cannot imagine the stress of that situation-it was surreal. And they know you have like five days to dispute BUT they also factor you cannot dispute while on a cruise!  [I found a way trust me] and this entire nightmare affected my entire trip to Europe, even having to cancel my credit card!

After EuroStar Grand Hotel in Barcelona shoved the first two charges totaling $1.174 and after I told my bank to cancel my card - the next day they charged me ANOTHER $350 or so!  Chase forgot to cancel it.  Another issue- if you enter Barcelona with NO hotel reservation it is really going to cost you double and this is what ended up happening.  They figured I would be too scared to be on the ""street"" in a foreign city and that I would cave in-is what Eurostar thought.  Well-I did not cave and almost spent all night looking for a place to sleep.  HOW can you bill someone before they even land the plane ? Unless you planned on screwing them in the first instance.  This is a week later and nothing has changed...that hotel is fighting with my bank to keep the funds.",1,2015,11,28
35,Weekend at Barcelona,"Great hotel allowed us the room early 10 am  . It was an upgraded room with two large single comfy beds and menu for several pillow types . Balcony overlooked city with some sea view overlooking marina area. Dining table and chairs tea making and luxury bath with jets, hairdryer, swore area lop bidet and jet shower . Free welcome drink  (14 euros) in bar where duo violin and cello played Spanish music that lunchtime . Evening in the bar was a jazz singer accompanied by piano. Light meal of chicken Ceaser salad  in bar very promptly served , did not use hotel restaurant but looked good. Location on the flat,  about two stops on metro from centre and great to go to beach , marina or Gothic quarter . Good friendly staff stored cases no charge on last afternoon",5,2015,11,27
35,Barcelona week away,"Staff excellent from front desk on arrival to the cleaners. Room service menu good, rooms and views excellent.( we stayed in the deluxe room with sea view)  Good location. Never did find the jacuzzi, gym adequate. Could do with a few more things to do in and around the hotel for that extra star, but would recommend.",4,2015,11,25
35,Not 5 stars by european standards...,"Stayed here for business, 4 nights, in November 2015.

+ The rooms are spatious and clean
+ Great location
+ Room service good
+ Friendlyness at reception

- very slow service at the lobby bar
- even slower service at breakfast (20mins to receive cold poached eggs, how do you do that?)
- water bottles not replaced in rooms when used",3,2015,11,25
35,Location Location Location,"Was quite excited when we booked this hotel originally it was for just three nights then we added an extra night so stayed four days in total. The hotel is within the world trade complex which itself is pretty amazing. The reason why i have only given it a three mark is based on two things. The size of the rooms are tiny and badly laid out for example if one of you is on your PC the other has to vault the bed to get to the other side of the room. Have seen bigger rooms in 3 star pod hotels. The second reason is restaurant facilities on one of the evenings we wanted to stay in to eat and they advertise a formal restaurant and a casual one were you can have tapas. Well the latter dident seem to exist and the formal was tucked away at the side of the bar and looked as appetising as a McDonald's
The good points to the hotel are the breakfast probably close to the best i have sampled Choices galore want for nothing
Gym everything brand new and the views spectacular
Negative on the pool it really is just a plunge pool
Location is everything chair lift over your head Las Ramblas 5 minute walk and amazing restaurants all located within 10 minutes don't eat at Las Ramblas to touristi 
and poor food
Would go again but would want more space for 200Euros a night",3,2015,11,23
35,Excellent customer service ,The staff in the hotel deserve medals for their excellent customer service. I will definitely be returning to this hotel. The food is delicious. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. The hotel is close to all the main attractions. The whole experience was very comfortable. ,5,2015,11,21
35,One night pre cruise stay,"Firstly I have to say the hotel is in a great situation and an easy walk to Las Rablas the shopping mall etc, also the cable car is right outside the hotel.

On arrival the staff were busy but it didn't take that long to check in.  Our deluxe room was great plenty of room and a superb bathroom (bit small bath) small balcony no seats but a view over the city.  

We went upto the roof top pool area for a drink and all the seats were soaking wet as there had been heavy rain the night before.   The pool is not up to much and was cold and if you have a disablity it would be difficult to access.  The views as you walk around the pool deck are  lovely but all the slabs are very loose and dangerous my husband stood on one which collapsed, reported it to the reception and it was promptly repaired I do think this will be a constant problem for the hotel.  

When booking this hotel I thought that the hotel sat on his own but is is attached to office blocks and the staff come out onto their outside space which overlooks the pool area, really did not like this.  We did sit in the sun for a while and had another drink, the next day when we went up to see what our cruise ship looked like our glasses with the left over drink were still sitting there.  

Got a taxi at the front of the hotel to the cruise port which is quite near but don't walk the bridge seems never ending.

Would I stay here again not sure",4,2015,11,18
35,"Very nice hotel, with very knowledgable and helpful staff.","I enjoyed my stay at this beautiful hotel.  It was very clean and had beautiful views.  Luckily for me when I checked in early there were no long lines and they did  their best to get me into a room early after being up all night flying from the states.  

The views upstairs were very nice and it was relaxing to sit on the roof in the fresh air watching the port. 

The breakfast was a very nice spread with lots of choices, but nothing made to order. the service in the bar area for coffee was amazingly efficient and the server very pleasant. 

I picked this hotel because of its proximity to the cruise port, which in my case was not too close.  That did not spoil my time there however, just added to the taxi costs.  Being at the port, just the wrong pier, at least did not cause any traffic woes in the morning for embarkation.  I was disappointed to find  that there was no easy way to get to the pier, or at least no one knew of any, nor knew if there would be a shuttle available that next day, so it was a taxi for me. At least there was no traffic except to get over the other bridge.",4,2015,11,17
35,Great location and good facilities for a family with teenagers,"With such a great location, they should have at least one restaurant / bar with a view.  The rooftop bar was not open even though it was 24°c.  
Drinking water in the rooms would be nice.

Great location.  We had nice views. 
Our teenage boys made use of the gym.
We also used the hotel's electric bicycles to gad around Barcelona.  Great fun!
My teenage son celebrated his birthday & the restaurant staff made it special without making him cringe. Thank-you!",5,2015,11,16
35,Nice Holiday...,All in all a nice stay..Dnt know if it was the city alone or the hotel helped make my stay memorable..Trip with my family. Nice hotel stayed in a Jnr suite..Quite expensive..minus breakfast..Staff were very professional almost excellent..... .Great location..Probably best thing about the hotel. Lovely views of the marina...nice gym. Breakfast was very good. Would go back definitely.  Not for anyone on a budget...,4,2015,11,16
35,Nice but not brilliant,"This hotel was sold as a 5 star, it was easy check in and lovely and clean, when we got to the room it had no view unless u count the inside of the world trade centre offices as a view from our room. It had 2 bottles of complementary water. The pillows bed and bedding were amazing. One of the best sleeps I've ever had. We were woken up by a small explosion about 8 in the morning which turned out to be the start of a protest. Shouting banging drums whistles and fire crackers went on til we gacpve up and went out at 11. We asked the reception about parking our hire car in the hotel car park thinking it might be free or cheaper than normal because we were staying at the hotel but nope, it was 25 euros a day.. Had a brilliant time sight seeing and when we got back our room had been cleaned  with new towels bed made it was lovely. But no water.  We went up to the roof top terrace to have a cocktail and sit and watch the beautiful view. Over the city one side and cruise ships and ferris the other but the cocktail bar was closed as was the roof top pool. Very disappointed as this was one of the reasons we chose this hotel.  We decided not to drink here after we saw the price for 1 whiskey was 30 eruos!! Other than that the hotel was very nice and located well.",3,2015,11,15
35,nice hotel,"we arrived at the hotel check in was easy room was nice and clean with complementary water.but the following morning we were woken up by a protest going on, whistles and fire crackers going off quite scary when ur not sure what's going on. had to pay 25euros per day to park in the hotels carpark. the bath plug leaked all the water out so had to have quick baths. we only got the complemtory water on the first day as well. the hotel was sold to us with a roof top pool and cocktail bar, which were both closed sadly. I wouldn't give it 5 stars.",3,2015,11,14
35,A FIrst Class Hotel,"Our first trip to Barcelona was made all the better for staying at the Grand Marina Hotel. The staff are 100% professional and friendly. Just a few minutes walk from the city, the hotel is ideally situated and, being surrounded by cruise liners and ferries, made it all the more interesting. Excellent restaurant too.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who's looking for that extra special place to stay.",5,2015,11,12
35,Upscale fine Hotel,"We stayed here for a night before leaving on a cruise the next day. Great location for catching the hop on hop off bus for a quick tour of the city. Too far to walk to the cruise terminal. The hotel is very nice - big room, comfortable bed and great breakfast.",5,2015,11,11
35,Great Location!,"Close to Rambla, sights, Tour bus's stop; you can open windows and feel the sea  breeze - unforgettable! Barcelona is your view. Ask for city view rooms. Very clean and comfortable. Multilingual staff. Breakfasts are super expensive - prefer at some local place on Rambla - much more authentic.",5,2015,11,09
35,Good location,"Bin here for second time and always had a good stay.Location is great , just a few steps from center and Rambla. Rooms are big and clean with all you need.
This is not a cheap hotel but goid value for what you get.
See you next time.",4,2015,11,08
35,After a long time to check-in...A very nice stay!,"Check-in is at the time posted. You will not have your room ready before. We were there at 11:00 and were told to come back to see if the room would be ready in a hour, we ended up communing back 4 more times... We checked-in at 3:15. So arrive at check-in time if you don't want to loose your time like us... They should have told us to come back after 3:00 instead of giving the impression that the room could be ready before.",4,2015,11,07
35,A nice location for the port and beach,"I have stopped at this hotel for the past three years, the hotel and staff remain very good, but the room I had was showing signs that it needs some maintenance, walls were marked from suitcases which although only minor does need to be addressed before it becomes more significant. The roof terrace bar is an excellent place to chill out and watch the sea and ships",4,2015,11,06
35,My stay at Grand Marina Hotel,"I enjoyed my staying at the hotel the location is fantastic  and the staff at reception are very nice and helpful. I loved staying at higher floor with sea view.

35,"Fab position, friendly and helpful staff. ","We stayed at the Grand Marina Hotel with other family members for 3 nights. We booked two rooms, one for myself and my partner and the other for family members travelling with us. The hotel was easy to find, even during the chaotic rush hour traffic of the city. It is well signposted as you make your way to the port area. 

My partner and I had a fabulous room overlooking the city and marina. The other family members had a room looking in the opposite direction. Our rooms had a sweet balcony area which was a fab place to watch the bustling of the city and port and listen to the sounds of vibrant city life. Once the sliding doors were closed the outside noise was minimal. We did hear the Barcelona football fans parading through the city after a triumphant win on the Sunday evening but we actually loved the fact that the city was bustling with life and the sound in the room was never at a point where it stopped us relaxing. 

The room was very clean and felt more luxurious than the price would suggest. Walk in wardrobe area and large bathroom with spa bath and rainwater shower. 

The staff on reception were very helpful and gave us ideas to help us plan out visit. 

Breakfast was spectacular - continental, English, American-style and local foods were all present. The staff serving in the breakfast room were cheerful and extremely good at their jobs! 

We all thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would happily choose this hotel should we visit Barcelona again in the future. ",5,2015,11,03
35,Boutique 5 Star - What can you ask for ?,"This is the 2nd time we have stayed at the Eurostars Grand Marina, due to the fact that its a 5 Star Boutique Hotel offering the usual level of well appointed large Couture bedrooms, we stayed on 1st/2nd November, on arriving from the Norwegian Cruise Line, it was early in the morning, around 8am, so we dropped our bags with the concierge, and spent most of the day in Barcelona, for those who love Barcelona as a travel destination, the Grand Marina is well located on the World Trade Centre stop for the Red Official City Tour, just outside about a 5 minute walk, its stop 5 on the Orange tour, plus Las Ramblas is about a 10 minute walk, its close to the Cruise Ship terminals, and the local Leisure complex of Miramar, a 10 minute walk across the marina, the hotel offers superb well appointed large Rooms, with large comfortable beds, a large bath and shower room, with the usual boutique amenities, parquet floors, with a suite rooms available, as this is our 2nd visit, we expected the class of hotel to be the same as before and it was, nothing more to add, its at the high end of Barcelona 5 Star Hotels, and we would recommend it to other trip advisor travellers, you wont be disappointed. the Concierge and reception is superb..best of luck. ",5,2015,11,03
35,Amazing hotel,This is fantastic hotel in a fantastic location with walking distance to Las Ramblas when I return to Barcelona I would definitely stay here again and the food is also second to none and rooms are pure luxury.,5,2015,11,02
35,Fantastic,"We stayed here recently for 4 nights and had a fantastic time. Its a great location for Las Ramblas with only a 2 minute walk to all of the action. 
We had a lovely comfortable room on the top floor, it had plenty of space and a lovely big bathroom, all topped off by a great view of the harbour and city beyond. The staff in the hotel were all really helpful and pleasant and the rooftop terrace bar was a great place to relax after a day of sightseeing. There is a small pool on the roof and sun terrace but we didn't have time to use it. 
The tourist sightseeing buses all stop at the front of the hotel which was a brilliant bonus. Overall we thought it was well worth the little bit extra we paid to stop here and would definitely book to stay here again if visiting Barcelona.",5,2015,11,01
35,Fabulous!,"Stayed here last week for 2 nights as a 50th Birthday treat. And what a treat it was! The Staff were very friendly & professional. We had a deluxe room up on the 8th Floor. The room was fab,lovely polished wood floor, large bathroom with jacuzzi bath, a massive shower, a huuuge bed & lovely white fluffy robes & slippers. We had breakfast both mornings and it was superb! The Location is perfect, right in the harbour, just a short stroll from La Ramblas & the shopping centre. The tour bus stops there as well on the West Route. The cocktails were delicious, but expensive! We would definately go back, Barcelona is stunning! Still loads we havnt seen. Cant wait to return.",5,2015,10,30
35,rather pretentious,"probably one of the most pretentious hotels I have ever visited. A experience that would never be repeated. The hotel is so unwelcoming and barren in decor and friendliness : so ""empty and minimilist"" and cavernous. Customer service is rather  of a poor quality. the Room is of a decent size but the noise from outside strips the room of all the good qualities. Expect a poor night sleep.",3,2015,10,28
35,Excellent room in a seafront location,"The Eurostars hotel is right on the harbour and is where the cruise ships dock to load and unload passengers. A great hotel if you're picking up your ship here. We weren't doing that but it was still very nice, right under the cable car with the cable tower immediately in front of the hotel. The room was large and very nice, almost a suite with every facility you can think of. The roof terrace is a great viewpoint or just somewhere nice to sit with a drink. The restaurant and bar prices were on the expensive side (17 Euros for a burger and 8 Euros for a beer) but we ate there anyway one of the nights and it was very good with friendly attentive staff. The hotel was also quite pricey at 300 Euros per night for the room with no breakfast so I'd rate it's value, but not its quality, down for that.",4,2015,10,28
35,Great Hotel thats ideally located for cruise terminal and Las Ramblas,"Stayed for one night in October before catching a cruise ship. We regularly use the hotel and it never disappoints!.
Easy walking distance to Las Ramblas and the Old Port. Nice spacious rooms with a roof top pool and bar/ restaurant.
Also has a bar and restaurant on 1st floor. Service in the bar was a little slow but food (tapas selection) was excellent.
We were upgraded to a higher standard of room for 2nd consequetive stay.",4,2015,10,25
35,A nice hotel with good location and views,"We went with my wife last August, A good place to rest , cosy ,with a nice terrace with port and city views of barcelona.  Good location as well walking distance from a lot of Barcelonas landmarks. Fast wifi and friendly and helpfull stuff.",4,2015,10,25
35,Nice ,"Great location lovely rooms but the pool is tiny its nothing like the pictures and was closed during our stay
Bars nice staff are excellent
Lots of little bars and snack bars very close offering fantastic value and very handy for boat trips 
Definitely a great place to stay out of the bustle of la ramblas but close enough for a leisurely stroll",3,2015,10,23
35,"Lovely place, great location","Stayed here for 3 nights on a work trip and was very impressed.

From arrival I was greeted by warm and friendly front desk staff who made the check-in process nice and easy. 

My room was on the 5th floor and was light and airy despite having an inwards facing view, I could just spot the marina and a ship.

Breakfast was lovely, lots of choice and lots of space, buffet was also lovely.

Measures for gin and tonic in the evening was enormous.

Also great location 2 mins walk from everything you'd need to see

Fully recommended ",5,2015,10,19
35,Worst customer service ever,"I booked directly thru the hotel website which was confusing, but hope that hotels are helpful if any issues. There was a issue in that my reservation was for day after I arrived ( not sure whose fault but?) The language barrier was problematic ( I'm from USA) but we worked thru it and ft desk agent agreed to credit my reservation for next nite and give me rooms ( we had 2 ) for that nite. While spending hour doing that one of my friends checked on rates and avail with diff clerk and found not only was plenty vacancy but rates were considerably cheaper than what we had been charged. They are now refusing to credit for nite We didn't stay. 
In addition wifi didn't work very well, bar was boring and over priced, and it was to far from everything in city where everything else is walking distance.",1,2015,10,19
35,Excelent,"We stayed 3 nights in this hotel.Close to everything.clean.Polite staff specially Aida who offered me a large room on 8th floor with amazing view of the creek and city after I was not satisfied with the room first offered.
But...entrance lobby very simple and empty and in immediate need of redecorating.  And be aware of your hanging ""do not disturb ""on your door as this might be discarded.So I proposed the reception l to change ""do not disturb"" sign to red so that nobody enters the rooms without the guests' permittion and cleaning stuff never ask about the cleang despite no entry sign.",5,2015,10,19
35,Noisy but well located,"Being next to the port I expected a little noise but the lack of sound proofing in the room led to the worst couple of nights sleep in the last 9 hotels I've been to in the last three weeks.  The windows don't have anywhere near enough sound proofing meaning you can hear the boats engines as a constant drone, people talking down on the ground, the walls are thin so you can hear next door talking and laughing at 1am, and the door to the hall is no better so you hear everything outside.
Staff have been good during my stay though, contrary to other reviews, might be luck.  Nice modern feel to the place and a good priced upgrade option available but needs major sound proofing.",3,2015,10,18
35,Very Good location with stunning views,"Stayed here for 2 nights early October 2015 when I went to see U2 in concert with my wife.
Very good Superior Room with Very good bathroom.
Stunning views Westwards from room.
Stunning 360 degree views from rooftop terrace and bar / cafe area.
Excellent breakfast with plenty of choice.
Reception very helpful at check in and on departure.
Only problem - the grotesque tower at the hotel entrance for the Barcelona cable car.",4,2015,10,14
35,Clean but,"I stayed this hotel for business in Barcelona to participate the event in Oct.   Hotel location is pretty good in front of peer and central city.    The room is clean, but some maintenance might be required.   ",4,2015,10,14
35,Barcelona Spain Visit,"A wonderful start to cruse staying in Hotel Overlooking Port Vell Harbor.  This was an excellent Hotel with spacious rooms and first class service.  Easy walk to shopping 
and sightseeing.  Tour buses stopped out side hotel in square.",5,2015,10,14
35,Grand it was,"My partner and i have just returned from 4 days in the Eurostar Grand Marina Hotel. The Location is very good for everything you want to do in Barcelona, the shopping in Las Rambles is just a few minutes walk, the tour buses go from outside the hotel and also the cable cars are not to far, by taxi it was only 5 /6 euros from the hotel.Magical fountains are worth a visit although very busy. We found the City to be safe and did not encounter any problems with pick pockets or any other hassle from beggars or traders.We did the Bus tour of the city and did all three routes where you can hop on and off the bus when and where you want.We got off at the La Sagrada Familia but could not get tickets to go inside as they were  sold out, I would advice to book on line before getting there.The hotel and the staff are all fantastic and the breakfast was very good. There is a swimming pool on the 8th floor and the views from the bar are great.Expensive but worth it.",5,2015,10,14
35,"Nice location, spacious rooms but let down by service","We stayed in this hotel on a 4 day break. The location was nice close to the Marina but did require a 15-20 min walk to bars and cafes. We enjoyed the walk, it was a less busy area and had a room with a balcony and a good view out over Barcelona.  We were given a glass of cava complimentary on arrival and rhe receptionist noticed it was my birthday that week so nice start.  The room was spacious, bathroom nice and large comfy bed. The hotel had more of a corporate feel and was impersonal, following the nice welcome so I don't think we would choose it again. The lounge bar was nice but again felt rather corporatw. The roof tetrace had fantastic views and in the summer I imagine the bar would be really nice. We ate one night in the restaurant due to heavy rain. Food was bland and service average. One of our sides came after we finished the main course and the food was cold. We nicely highlighted this but the waiter didn't seem very interested. The last day was my birthday and we had ordered room service for breakfast. They had forgotten to collect the order. They did give us some pastries and coffee an hour later after we complained foc. The receptionist apologised and offered us a discount on another stay with Eurostars. It wasn't a great response as anyone who responds to their CSAT survey is offered 10%.  I completed this but haven't had a response yet!",3,2015,10,14
35,Near the port for the cruise liners,"We stayed here the day before the cruise sailed as it is located adjacent to the terminal. The hotel lovely room lovely. Hotel staff couldn't be more helpful. But the food in the restaurant had a limited choice, was very expensive and some of it was inedible, and tasteless. That was very disappointing   
Would go back but wouldn't eat in the hotel. ",4,2015,10,13
35,Just Fabulous!,"Second time at the beautiful Eurostars and once again we were not disappointed. Friendly, welcoming reception staff who could not have been more helpful, a beautiful, clean and spacious room overlooking the marina and a gorgeous huge comfortable bed for an excellent night's sleep. An early morning coffee was served by a lovely young man who also brought us fresh warm croissants and was most helpful with the setting up of my exceptionally good wifi.
My teeny tiny gripe was room service- due to a dreadful downpour it was impossible to go out, so we ordered in and we had barely warm fries and a greasy thin pizza for €44.00! Also the man taking the order had a poor command of English and was a little abrupt at times- 
However, nothing detracts us from this fabulous hotel- our first choice for Barcelona and for cruisers an absolute must! ",4,2015,10,10
35,Nice Hotel,"I visited Grand Marina in August for my birthday. For a 5 star hotel I would say it was pretty ok. Our room had marks on the walls and our safe didn't work on several occasions - although staff did assist immediately. 
The beds were incredible guaranteeing a great nights sleep and the location of the hotel was good.The rooftop bar has some incredible views of Barcelona",3,2015,10,10
35,High standard of everything!,"A high level of service, quality, and location. Good standard of rooms, restaurants and bars with friendly, helpful staff. Recommend this hotel for business or pleasure. Great views from rooms on higher floors, so try and get a room on floor 5 or higher",4,2015,10,09
35,Excellent top class hotel,"Stayed here for business and was amazed by the quality of the hotel. My room was large and had a lovely big bathroom with a jacuzzi bath. The breakfast buffet was amazing, the only problem was there was too much choice! We had dinner there one night and the food was delicious, typical slow Spanish table service was the only downer. Nice pool on the top floor!",5,2015,10,08
35,Good Hotel,"Stayed here for a few days while attending a conference in the city.
Room was very comfortable, good bed and pillows, bathroom excellent with jacuzzi bath and separate shower, very clean.
Breakfast was excellent, fantastic choice and good quality. Staff were very helpful.
Would be a great choice of hotel before a cruise as next to port.",5,2015,10,07
35,Nice room,"The room was nice, clean, comfortable and spacious. The shower was great!! Nice touch that the windows open...  Unfortunately it gets loud and smells like exhaust if it's left open too long! Location is good.... The hop on, Hop off bus is in front of the hotel. Minutes walk to a great part of town. Quiet location which can be a nice break from the hustle and bustle of Barcelona! ",4,2015,10,06
35,"Great Location, amazing Hotel, staff (mmm)","At first when I arrived, i thought ouch it is in the middle of nowhere by the sea port, and then after check in and after my first walk in the area i found out that it is in the best location ever in Barcelona.

A huge premises with a great location at few minutes from every where, you may enjoy a day or a night walk to each of the market, la rambas, the bay by the sea, restaurant area, a near by shopping mall, and as calm as yo wish all at the same time.

The lobby is amazing and the staff at the front desk were very helpful and very supportive.

The concierge too was of great knowledge to the city and where to go.

 we were on a business trip and we had the opportunity to spend three great nights at this hotel.

The breakfast was of so many choices and the variety was of more than you could need.

We had one dinner and another lunch at the hotel and the food was just average OK, but the shocking part was the rude staff at the restaurant during lunch and dinner, totally unprofessional...

Rooms were great and had all the needed amenities, TV channel variety was also very interesting, free wifi internet good and fast.

If i am to go back to Barcelona again, this Hotel would be my choice.",5,2015,10,06
35,Good hotel!,"This hotel is beautifully placed by the marina in Barcelona. It is modern and well appointed with good sized rooms. The fixtures and fittings are of good quality, and rooms with excellent views are available. Our room was excellent, but as with many hotels the bathroom looked better than it was, and taking a shower without causing a flood was almost impossible!
The staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful, especially in the restaurant and bars. We were not as impressed with the food....it was ok but no more than that....but there are plenty of restaurants within easy walking distance.
Unfortunately our stay was marred when the day before we were due to check out, we were called down to the lobby to pay our bil,l because it had exceeded 1000 euros. This policy is ridiculous and leaves a bad taste because the hotel is not cheap so passing 1000 euros for a few nights is not unusual I would have thought, and it is as though the guests are not trusted. My wife and I travel extensively, and have frequently stayed in hotels that are both more luxurious and more expensive than this one, but we have never been treated in such a desultory manner.",4,2015,10,05
35,Great Stay in Barcelona,"We stayed at the Eurostars Hotel for 6 nights and were absolutely thrilled with this hotel. 

Cleanliness, Room Size and Quality are definitely worthy of a 5 star. 

The amenities of the hotel are quite expensive, however the hotel's location allows for a quick walk to either La Rambla, Barceloneta or the Gothic Area to find some really authentic and fair priced options.

In terms of getting to the hotel we took the Aeroport Bus to Placa Catalunya and walking down La Rambla to the hotel. Cost us 11.80 euros for both of us and was  fun walk to the hotel. 

We got a great deal in terms of price for the hotel but were very satisfied with our stay.",4,2015,10,04
35,"Great hotel, but no so good service","The hotel itself was lovely and a great location, but considering it was 5 Star the service was quite poor, no entertainment in the evening and their bar prices were extortion, would not stay here again",3,2015,09,30
35,Great hotel!,"Entrance, reception's design for somebody can seems not as a 5 star hotel, as it looks very simple, but as soon as you get service and attention from first step, all hesitations are disappearing. 
We had a lovely spacious room, where everything is organised, big clean bathroom with bath and separate shower, which was comfortable to use. We loved bed and linen!!! Extremely nice and comfortable! 
Breakfast was nice, good variety of everything. For those who doesn't want to have breakfast in the hotel, always a choice to go nearby. 
We had a great stay in this hotel! Thank you! ",5,2015,09,29
35,"Excellent Service, SPOTLESS","Absolutely loved this Hotel! The front desk, doormen, everyone was exceptional. The entire Hotel is spotless and so are the rooms. Beds and linens are great !! You even get a balcony, nice these days for a bit of fresh air! Can't say enough great things about it. Would stay here again and highly recommend it.
Breakfast is expensive but there are several independent places to eat just at the side of the Hotel.
The City bus has a stop here, as does the red bus to tour the city €27. The ferry also stops here. Concierge can not do enough for you and they always seem to be working.
The great front desk makes a huge difference. Loved it!!",5,2015,09,28
35,Five Star??,"a Five Star hotel with very expensive rates you would expect something special. Excellent was the location, view and the staff who were friendly and very helpful. If you book their Romantic Deal then you do not expect to have a double bed consisting of two single beds made up and close to each other. You do not expect in a 5 Star hotel to wait 20 minutes to run a bath and then because the lights were not fitted properly to be in the gloom. No milk to add to a coffee or tea and the small balcony was standing only. Food was good in the restaurant but again expensive.
Overall disappointing, won't stay again.",3,2015,09,24
35,Great Hotel ~ Deceptive Charging,"This hotel is excellent, superb location, with extremely good staff, but you need to be very, very careful of the varying costs for food and drink. Whereas you would expect the charge in the mini-bar to be the most expensive, as with any hotel in the UK, please be aware that the charge for the various bars are different. The price for a Bacardi 8 rum in the mini-bar is 7euros, it is 12euros in the main restaurant area and an amazing 18euros (more than it costs for a bottle in Las Ramblas). When I queried this with the reception staff, I was told ""this is what we charge. It is normal"".",4,2015,09,20
35,Great views,"Lovely room, staff were helpful and great location for sightseeing .  Rooftop pool area great place to relax after lots of walking.  We did the Citybus tour which was excellent would recommend that anything in particular that you want to see to pre book tickets as lots of queues for all the major attraction",4,2015,09,20
35,Great!!!,"We stayed at Eurostars Grand Marina hotel during our honeymoon at Barcelona. Everything was great. We had a great room at 7th floor with an excellent view of barcelona. The staff was genuinely polite and smiling. The breakfast was also perfect. 
And it has a bar at the terrace with a great view for your after dinner drink!!!",5,2015,09,18
35,"Great location, however quiet expensive","Took my girlfriend to Barcelona for her birthday for 3 days, and fully enjoyed the trip! 

Hotel was in an excellent position to where a lot could be reached, such as the harbour, metro and taxis etc. 

Staff were very helpful, and room was very nice for a few nights stay. 

Do not waste your money on the breakfast in the hotel. Extremely expensive, I think around €25 pp!! 

Would recommend using the metro ( if you are able to understand the ticket machine!) as will save your legs a huge amount! Only downside is you will miss a lot of the scenery! ",4,2015,09,15
35,Lacks Soul,A large modern Hotel that looks very smart on appearance but is actually rather ordinary once you focus on detail. I stayed in a suite which was adjoining with another suite and i could hear my neighbours conversation clearly which is far from ideal. Hotel management did not think this was an issue! If you have drinks at the bar on the outside top terrace they stop serving food at midnight which by Spanish standards is ridiculously early and they are not open to making a plan of any sort. Other than that room was spacious and comfortable. The terrace was not worth the extra expense as it is just about big enough to stand on but not big enough to have any chairs to sit on should you so wish. The beakfast was fairly generic and did not change day to day but the buffet is large enough to find something different you enjoy on a day to day basis. Staff were generally very helpful and attentive. Personally I will stick to smaller boutique hotels with a more intimate atmosphere in future.,3,2015,09,15
35,Not worth the price,"This is a very average hotel and you should look elsewhere in Barcelona as there are better hotels for rather expensive room price.  The hotel is big, and has clean modern rooms with views of the port.  Ask for a non smoking room as several floors are smoking.  The location is good right at the base of las ramblas.  The service is what really got to me - we had poor service at the front desk, where we were skipped in line multiple times, clear to the desk staff, waiting to get checked in.  The worst was the second floor bar where we actually left after 30 minutes of servers ignoring us and our requests for drinks.  It was pretty amazing.  The highlight is the upstairs terrace bar which has beautiful views of the city.  Service up there was somewhat better.  We paid over 400 E/night t stay here and it definitely is not a 4 or 5 star hotel in price or amenities.",3,2015,09,13
35,Barcelona,"Brilliant hotel with amazing views.
Close to everything especially the metro which makes sight seeing so easy.
Hotel has everything you need, swimming pool on the roof offers amazing views of Barcelona as well.
Definitely recommend it and will hopefully go back!",5,2015,09,13
35,Worth a visit if you can get it at a discount," Got this for a decent price last minute. Lovely hotel. In a fantastic position. Just at the bottom of Ramblas. Rooms are superb with great views of the port. Room service very efficient. Only thing to be improved is better selection of teas and coffee is on in room tray and maybe real milk. Otherwise would thoroughly recommend but only if price is right",4,2015,09,11
35,Nice Hotel,"Very friendly and helpful staff. Great location, especially if you are taking a cruise. Got some great eating and tour tips from staff. Enjoyed a great breakfast buffet. Rooms are spacious and have all needed amenities.",4,2015,09,08
35,Rip off city,"this city is the worst I have ever been to for thieving and being ripped off. Do not even think of coming to Barcelona. We were ripped off by a taxi driver taking us on a tour of Barcelona when the fare should have been 5 Euros. The management at the hotel stood firm with the local. We could have walked in less then five minutes but then the police were called.  Went to the bar to consolidate and charged 20 euros for two small glasses of very average local Cava. The bottle at dinner cost only twelve Euros. 
We have been ripped off by taxis. Twice local,thieves tried to steal my phone. STAY AWAY. Go to anywhere with more integrity.",1,2015,09,07
35,Just okay,"We chose the Grand Marina because our bike tour group departed from there. Not the ideal accommodations I was hoping for. Being completely out of the city center is nice to escape the pollution and noise, but walking through a port area is unattractive and a lengthy trip for everything. The buffet breakfast was generic but well stocked. Our room was very clean but the ""balcony"" had no chairs or room to sit. Overall, it was s step above a Marriott or Hilton. Location is inconvenient but service was enthusiastic and always helpful.

Pros: exceptional service and staff, room was clean, a lot of variety at buffet breakfast, good sound proofing for sleep, out of the main crush of tourism.

Cons: A long, unattractive walk to everything; view of cruise ships and port, yuck; functions like a generic, convention hotel, huge and impersonal; decor and design of a cruise ship, tiny pool and gym.",3,2015,09,02
35,Nice location with close walk to city center,"Not the newest of hotels in Barcelona. But all in all an good experience and a quiet but Yet close location to city centre. Friendly and very helpful staff. Rooms was very nice. There are more high end hotels in Barcelona, but this one is good value for an good hotel.",4,2015,09,01
35,very nice hotel but very small pool,"I did spend 2 days in this hotel in august this year,
this is a very nice hotel, very well located in the center of barcelona. the room was perfect, very clean, nice view, bed of good quality, sufficient room, ... in a few words a very high standard.
also a very nice roof top bar with a nice view to the harbour, you will have the chance to see the cruiseboats arriving and living (quite impressive)...
the only disappointing thing is the pool (that you can't call a swimming pool as you can't swim ...) which is extremelly small ... this should need to be changed, it is not in relation with the standing of this hotel",4,2015,09,01
35,"Lovely hotel, superb location.","The location is superb, a short walk to Las Ramlas. Our room was well appointed and the bed was very comfortable. We had a corner room without balcony.  The shower was amazing!! 
We loved the roof top pool and the roof top bar especially after a long day out. The staff were very friendly and assisted us when ever we asked.",4,2015,08,31
35,Modern luxury,"One of the most amazing hotels I have ever been to, nothing bad to mention. Excellent location, modern environment, luxurious service. The Gym is well equipped with a beautiful view. 
Breakfast and the rooftop bar are especially good. The staff is very helpful and friendly.
",5,2015,08,31
35,Best location and view,"It's a great hotel that I have stayed in three times , the location is great and the place has a nice view of the port and sea . It's walking distance to the la rambla and the shopping centers . Nice rooms and service and has good breakfast . Take the rooms on side facing the port shopping , it sometimes comes annoying on the other side because of the ferries ",4,2015,08,29
35,An interesting location,"Our room was on a corner , nice but no balcony. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom facilities were excellent.
Found the passage ways very dark and being curved and cornered was easy to lose ones way back to the room.
The pool area was ok but the pool needed a good clean , water was very murky.
We enjoyed a pleasant session in the upstairs bar area. Requesting more teabags from housekeeping equalled nil.",4,2015,08,27
35,Excellent location. Excellent room. ,"This hotel came recommended to me and it didn't disappoint. The location is a few hundred meters walk from the ramblas which suited us as it was away from the hustles and bustle. 

On an evening after a lot of working around Barcelona we would relax by the pool with a cocktail and look across the marina at the cruise ships. I think this hotel means you can have the best of both worlds, a busy vibrant city and a chilled relaxing environment to Soak up a few Rays. 

Our room was very modern with a large bathroom. The room was very clean and definitely up to five star standard. 

There is a roof top bar which is ideal for watching the sunset over Barcelona.

We will definitely be staying here next time we're in Barcelona. 
",5,2015,08,27
35,VERY GOOD ALTHOUGH....,"This hotel has many positive features.Booked direct,  a good rate inclusive of a fine breakfast was secured . The location , surrounded on 3 sides by water , meant it was so quiet despite being a short walk from the throbbing Ramblas.
Staff were good. Mr Strange in the breakfast room was a genius , producing superior Italian coffee. The 2 young female concierges were brilliant ,pointing us towards the best Tapas restaurant in town . 
Minor niggles were the inability to produce a double with balcony despite it having been repeatedly requested and water was only supplied for the first night ( of a 5 night stay). 
I would gladly return here .",4,2015,08,26
35,Great hotel and staff,"I stayed here with my boyfriend for a long weekend on the romantic package, the hotel is amazing with beautiful views. Staff are lovely and helpful. The location was great, walking distance from beach and the centre of town. Had a fantastic time in Barcelona and would recommend this hotel to everyone ",5,2015,08,25
35,Good location,"I have stayed in the Eurostars Grand Marina on many occasions. The location is fantastic, being close to the centre, but far enough away from the hustle and bustle to allow you to relax. The views from the roof are perfect for taking in stunning sunsets and most of the staff are very friendly and helpful.  Nice size rooms although starting to look a little tired around the edges. Food, drink and breakfast are very expensive, so I normally make other arrangements.  Good wifi connection.",4,2015,08,24
35,4 Stars at Best,"This beautiful hotel located at the World Trade Center in Barcelona is next to the marina. The suite I had was lovely, with a strong signal free wifi & very comfortable. Parking is an extra 25€ a Night, the valet parking is poor! Took 30 minutes to get the car out at 8am. The breakfast is good, but room service needs improving, the food was delicious but the service is poor. When you deliver soup to the room, you bring a spoon for the customer to eat with. Other then that I would return to this hotel again. ",3,2015,08,23
35,Fantastic Hotel,"A brief stay in this beautifully situated hotel. The staff are very welcoming & can't do enough for you. 
We got upgraded to a junior suite & had an amazing view of Barcelona from our balcony & a gorgeous view of the marina.
The breakfast was amazing
There is a lovely rooftop plunge pool.
All in all I would recommend this hotel to everyone!!!!",5,2015,08,20
35,"Fantastic Hotel, top-service","To start; We had stayed in the hotel before, and that experience was definitely better than this one! We were given a room on the 6th floor, and there was quite a lot wrong in the room. (Phone not working, a lamp that would only switch off by taking out the lightbulb, TV not working, bath-tub was leaking). We asked the reception to send maintenance, we had to ask up to 3 times before it was finally fixed. For a 5-star hotel at 200 a nigh, this is unacceptable. 
That being said, the amenities of the in Hotel are fantastic. The pool and the gym on the rooftop offer a great view over the harbor with Cruiseships. The rooftop bar is very nice, offers great view over Las Ramblas and the city at night. (Drinks are costly though! €8 for a beer - Aug 2015). The cleaning crew is thorough and anything you wish, can be arranged by the concierge! The turndown service is not necessary, but it's an added value to enhance the luxurious experience.
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that wished to experience luxury in Barcelona, it's the 2nd best location in Barcelona! It's expensive, but worth every penny (if they give you a proper room!)",5,2015,08,13
35,Trading on past reputation - used to be much better than now.,"It's not often that you find a Spanish hotel worth its salt that offers genuinely poor service but this one really does. It used to be so much better years ago but now the staff seem sullen and distracted. Of course the hotel location is still second to none with the city and mooring cruise-liners on the doorstep but newer hotels have popped up around and the Grand Marina has failed to keep pace (except with the ""W"", which is even worse). Actually walked out of the bar early evening after being conspicuously and repeatedly ignored by a bored waitress. The rooms are impersonal but plentiful though pricey for the standard offered. Keep looking.",2,2015,08,12
35,Great hotel for quiet holiday,"A really great Hotel. The atmosphere is lovely, quiet and  often live music. The staff always do their best to satisfy their guests and they delivery every time! 

Don't order to much to drinks on the rooftop at bar, it was the worst drinks we had after 13 days in Barcelona, and more then twice as expensive as the others. The view was outstanding though:) ",5,2015,08,10
35,Past its prime,"I stayed here in August 2015 and ten years ago. The hotel is past its prime and needs a refurbishment. The rooms are dated and the gym is simply from another (past) era. Get ready for loads of guests with kids taking advantage of summer deals and treating the corridors as extensions of their rooms…noisy! That said, I still like the ""close to the city but not in the city"" location on the water.",3,2015,08,08
35,Location and Breakfast!,"Beautiful hotel inside with a short walk to Las Ramblas making the location prime. Valet service although paying for parking was pricey. Good value for the rooms and service. plenty of space in the rooms and when they made a mistake to us they gave us free lunch and a driver to the airport for two of our guests within our party.
Lovely breakfast and very attentive staff. Finally for me the best thing about a hotel is lighting so that you have bright views and the lobby oozed this with an inviting reception area. 
Highly recommended if you dont fancy paying the prices of the W hotel and the arts hotel.",5,2015,08,05
35,great location!,"i would recommend this hotel to anyone as it is in a great location . Few minutes walk to la rambler and all the service of tour bus , local bus , and taxi are all in in front of this hotel!
the hotel has the 5 star staff as they are friendly, courtious , helpful  with your every need . what a excellent service!
The rooms are comfortable , clean and has great views of harbour and barcelona!
breakfast is plentiful and delicious!
swimming pool is on the roof top but it is very small for a this hotel but you could just sit there and relax and watch all the ships coming and going!
Roof bar is must in the evening ! you can see the view of whole of Barcelona and the harbour .Watch  the sun go down. although i did find the drinks very expensive.
The only negative thing of this hotel is the reception . it does not have have that  warm welcoming feeling . it is small with no great features and is like booking into a small 2,3,star hotel. Apart from that it is a great place to stay and would come back here again!",4,2015,08,02
35,Location! Location! Location!,If you are looking for a great located hotel in Barcelona... Look no further.... The grand Marina is located just off the port.... 5 minutes walking from the centre of the city...les Ramblas and a mere ten or fifteen minute drive by taxi everywhere else in the city.... The hotel itself has large spacious rooms.... Very unlike European standards. Furnishings and fixtures are opulent and well maintained .... The restaurants are also above average..... Definitely would recommend as a place to stay....,4,2015,07,30
35,Spain 2015,"This Hotel is probably the best located hotel in Barcelona and the easiest for cabs to find. We stayed here for 5 nights and they were great. The rooms were extremely comfortable and the beds hugged you like a cloud. The shower was a bit odd for me since I am 6'4 265 so it was a little tight for me but nothing I'm not used to. The people at the front desk were very helpful and will also help you book  anything you may need to while your in Barcelona. Breakfast is really good here and has a huge selection from their buffet. We did not do dinner here the food looked good when we walked by. 
The pool is on the roof and extremely small for such a big hotel but Barcelona does have a beach so I am assuming that is why. Overall I would defiantly recommend it to anyone who is going to Barcelona",4,2015,07,30
35,COMFORTABLE,Stayed for 5 nights at the Grand Marina Hotel - found it very comfortable - bedroom had a lovely view over the Port - was a little disappointed as requested a Balcony due to long stay.  Bathroom very spacious.  Pool area very nice.  Always had to wait a while for lifts though as we were on the 6th floor.,4,2015,07,29
35,Hard to find!,"We stayed for my husbands birthday for three nights.  The hotel was very arty and luxurious but rather hard to find, as when I booked it, I did not realise it was actually part of the World Trade Centre!  It was so posh it even had a pillow menu.  Best hotel breakfast I've ever had.",5,2015,07,28
35,Nice hotel,I stayed in this hotel for 3 days the room is nice and the staff is helpful too but the location is little far from la rambla street the attractive street in Barcelona it is around 20 min by walking but the good thing is the hop on stop is next to the hotel ,4,2015,07,27
35,Great views and location,"Stayed here a few years ago and the hotel continues to deliver. Great views of the port and city from very comfortable bedrooms, superb location, excellent breakfast and gym. A few relatively minor gripes include inadequate lift capacity at peak time (breakfast), the inability to book children aged more than 14 into the (very large) standard rooms with parents & the strong smell of stale cigarettes with dirty carpet on the third floor. In contrast the rooms were spotlessly clean with excellent maid service.",4,2015,07,26
35,This hotel has style and quality in abundance,"From the moment of checking in the staff were exceptional , the rooms a pleasure to stay in and the rooftop bar is a must with amazing views all around. Coming off a cruise this was the perfect place to stay within easy reach of all there is to see in Barcelona.we would highly recommend this hotel it lacks for nothing.",5,2015,07,26
35,Good but not excellent,"While not having the most modern or new of furnishings and decor, this hotel is still a comfortable stay.
We found the staff friendly and helpful, the pool area is nice (although drinks at the adjacent rooftop bar are a little expensive).
The buffet breakfast is large, and the restaurant meals were reasonably priced although not the nicest I've had. They did offer seeded breads, complimentary gazpacho, and a complimentary dessert platter though which was a nice touch.
Overall we had a pleasant stay, however this hotel probably wouldn't be my first pick next time.",3,2015,07,26
35,Beautiful view of the Harbour!,Very clean and quite large!  On a peninsula out into the harbour.  Very close for walking and transportation from city transit right to the door.  A little pricey but very close for short taxi ride to the Cruise terminal.,5,2015,07,25
35,Everything that you would expect of a modern contemporary hotel....,"Excellent rooms, facilities and staff made this a really great stay. Just one night as I was visiting a few hotels to decide on a conference location later this year.
Room was spacious and great view of the port with massive bed and huge bathroom....

Breakfast was extensive buffet and fabulous outdoor courtyard to eat in subject to weather.  Only complaint is that at busy times the 3 lifts to get to the restaurant are packed and not fast enough on the return journey back to the room.

All in all would definitely stay again.",4,2015,07,25
35,Ruth Nswana,"The grand marina hotel,  is beautiful I loved and and everything about it. The reception is awesome the employees are friendly and helpful.  I could stay there Forever! It's amazing. I loved the pool and the gym is specious. 
      ",5,2015,07,25
35,Making Life Easier If Departing From The Cruise Terminal in Barcelona,"Eurostars hotels staff is extremely friendly and helpful.
The hotel is directly next to the terminal building.Makes life easy
Now for the hotel itself.Location great if you are transferring to a cruise.The rooms are quite large and very comfortable.The bathroom has a rain-forest shower witch was great after a long airline flight.Breakfast is a must.Buffet that was extremely delicious and plentiful.Cant ask for much more. Oh Yes the rooftop pool is the showstopper.Quiet relaxing and just great.I guess I liked the Eurostars accommodations for  easiness and comfort. great way to start or end a trip.",4,2015,07,24
35,perfectly located,"We had a superior room which was absolutely massive. It was well worth the extra money. As we were picking up a cruise ship we thought we would stay close to port. Now we know most of Barcelona is close to the port, but this hotel was so worth it. Close walking distance to Gothic Quarter, and beach front area just a little further on. A must is the roof top terrace bar. Sit back at the end of the day and enjoy a quiet drink while you watch the comings and goings of the harbour",5,2015,07,23
35,Cosy place,"This hotel is in a good location and the service provided was excellent. The family rooms are amazing, very large and good sized beds. The kids were very happy.
There pool is terrible, very small and not a pleasant area around the pool. A shame..",5,2015,07,23
35,Great hotel,"We just spent 6 nights there with our 13 and 5 year old sons. The staff and service were excellent, the family suite brilliant with separate rooms. The only downside was the limited menu choice. For a 5 star massive hotel we would have expected much more choice. Except breakfast where there was just about anything you could want. Would stay there again and recommend it to others.",4,2015,07,22
35,Close to the pier if you are cruising,This is a modern organised and professional hotel. The room was good enough as was the bathroom which had a separate bath area.  Although it is too modern to be 'warm' there are lovely touches like the violinists playing at breakfast outside the Cube.  The food was good enough and I found the staff very helpful in explaining where to go and which restaurants to eat at.  We were able to catch a City hop on hop off bus a few hundred metres from the hotel which was most useful.  A taxi fetched us to go to the cruise ship and it was about 8 euros and less than ten minutes.  Definitely difficult to walk with your case however.  We enjoyed our stay overnight.,4,2015,07,21
35,good quality and service,"We choose Eurostar for 3 nights with 7 yo daughter. Hotel is located in Marina between port and Magnum trading center. Walk to Magnum takes over 10 min. Also distance to the first outside bars and restaurants needs about 10 - 15 minutes walk. The hotel is modern, clean and with good service. Very nice and helpfull concierge. Well equipped fitness and nice, small pool for short relax on the ruff of the hotel.",4,2015,07,19
35,Superb hotel and fabulous service.,"Room was excellent, very cool in the hot summer. WiFi coverage and speed was excellent and it was included in the room rate. Service was really fabulous, smooth checkin/checkout and staff was very friendly. Gym facility and top view was also superb.",5,2015,07,17
35,"Superb, excellent, fantastic!!!","Wow!!! 
Great hotel, wonderful location near the old port, easy access to The Rambles.
Our two rooms were right next to each other as we requested, plenty of light, and room for our four kids and ten suitcases, AC, and big bathrooms.
Complimentary tea and coffee, was a plus. Led TV with a good selection of international TV, perfect lighting, comfortable beds.
Sparkling bathrooms with complimentary toiletries, soft towels. 
Pool and restaurant are superb, room service 24/7 and FREE WIFI!!
Amazing staff, from the girls in the front desk to the cleaning ladies and the valet. We absolutely will come back next time we visit Barcelona!!!",5,2015,07,14
35,Excellent pre-cruise location,"The high level of support for NPN conference participants was impressive.  Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel personnel are congratulated for respectful, courteous, multilingual, professional service at all levels. The range of ethnicities, colors, and cultures among the staff and adminIstration was a highlight of our entire 10-day Mediterranean experience.  ",5,2015,07,12
35,Short stay,"Excellent hotel with a friendly welcome. The rooms on both occasions that we stayed were of the highest quality. The terrace bar offers fine views over Barcelona and a good place to relax after a day touring the city. The breakfast was excellent with a wide range of choice. We would definitely stay again when next in Barcelona.
      ",5,2015,07,12
35,Roof top pool puts this a cut above the rest,"Really enjoyed my stay at Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel.

Really helpful and welcoming staff made me feel right at home. I had a deluxe room which had a separate dressing room and bathroom off the main bedroom. The balcony was a nice extra touch although not needed due the amazing rooftop Resturant, bar and swimming pool! 

Great 369 views right across the city, beach and port area. A late night drink with the DJs playing chilled out tunes was a great way to end a night out.

Will be back 100%!",5,2015,07,09
35,Vacation,"We stayed at euro stars grand marina hotel about a month ago. I loved the hotel, modern clean, great service. I wasn't impressed with their restaurant, I didn't love it as much and the service wasn't on point. The hotel itself everything exceeded my expectations!",5,2015,07,03
35,Really impressed,Recently stayed at the Eurostar and was generally really pleased. The majority of the hotel staff are really friendly and polite. The concierge can't do enough for you. The views from the terrace are stunning although the terrace itself has potential to be a lot nicer. Its fine though. The drinks & food are dear but that's standard in hotels really. Location is fantastic and there is a bus stop for the Barcelona bus tour right outside the hotel. I would stay again and recommend.,5,2015,07,02
35,Lovely but expensive,"We stayed here for 1 night pre-cruise before departing from the cruise port just outside. I don't normally go for such an expensive hotel but with two large cruise ships departing the next day and a sporting event happening in the city, there wasn't much choice available and we decided to splash out.

Check in was smooth, although there was a slight confusion because I booked via booking.com and I thought they had already charged me. Turns they hadn't, meaning I had to pay on arrival. However, not the hotels fault. Suitcases were taken up to the room from the taxi by the porter, and arrived just after we did. The room we had was beautiful, with great views out to the city. Room had usual amenities; tv with channels in various languages, safe, ironing board/iron etc. WiFi was free and very fast. There was a ship outside making a buzzing noise all night which was affected sleep slightly so light sleepers be wary.

There was a pool, bar, sunbeds, gym, salon, sauna, jacuzzi and conference rooms on the top floor. Jacuzzi was emptied and cordoned off during our stay which was slightly disappointing. Didn't use the gym but looked very well equipped. Pool area is small but very nice. 

We paid for breakfast the next morning, it was gorgeous. Highly recommend paying for the breakfast (25 euros i think). It is a buffet with a huge choice and all of high quality. All the staff we encountered at the breakfast and throughout our stay were very friendly and helpful. 

Overall, very luxurious hotel of a high quality and great location but a bit too expensive for us.",5,2015,06,30
35,First visit to Barcelona,"Great hotel very clean nice rooms but the concierge is really not very helpful they can decide with is the best paella restaurant. 
Many good ones. And it is true we already try 3 and I don't know each one is the best
Best place in the world to eat paella :-)",5,2015,06,29
35,Amazing Location,"From the time you check-in to the time you check-out, this hotel has an amazing service, front desk staff very professional and helpful. Very clean, spacious rooms,very comfortable beds, big bathroom with all the utilities, top of the line service. I would stay there again.Great Location!!",5,2015,06,29
35,A dream hotel that saved us from a nightmare experience at another hotel,"We had a bad experience at Hotel Cram so we checked out and found the Grand Marina Hotel.  From the moment we stepped out of the taxi, the valet was super friendly and very cordial.  We arrived early to get out of our previous hotel as early as possible and the staff was so accommodating given our story.  Marta and the rest of the staff were sympathetic to our experience and put us in a fantastic room that they hoped would distance us from the previous night.  We were overwhelmed with glee as we opened our door to a beautiful view with the most comfortable bed and modern furnishings.  The room was meticulously clean and the privacy level was immaculate.  It was really what we needed considering our security concerns at Cram!!

The property is on the water, near the beach and a bit of a walk from the city center but only steps away from the metro train and definitely still walkable.  We made it to the Sagrada Familia for our tour in less than 10 minutes by cab and it was only two stops by train!! I would definitely stay at the Grand Marina again, in a word ""fantastic"".",5,2015,06,27
35,"Excellent hotel, perfect location","Hotel is a part of the WTC Barcelona and is in a perfect location. For a hotel if this size and considering it’s in a middle of a marina, it is rather quiet and very peaceful. Staff is very professional and they fulfilled every single request we made. Our room was about 45 square meters in size and had a king size bed which was very comfortable. Big bathroom with a separate shower and bathtub came in handy! TV comes with 107 channels and a very good selection of channels in English, German, Italian, and French language.  Restaurant and the lounge are on the first floor as well as the breakfast area. In the evening there is live music (piano and I believe guitar).  The restaurant does not have a huge selection of dishes but it does have something for everyone including kids.  Breakfast is very good with plenty of choices; in fact, I will say that this hotel offers one of the best breakfasts. The only thing I would encourage them to improve is the coffee.
8th floor is where the gym is, bar and a pool. We did have lots of fun in the pool area. We were lucky enough to be over there on the 23rd of June (Saint John festival) and the hotel organized a pretty nice dinner on the roof of the hotel with a fantastic view of the city and the marina. We enjoyed food, wine, the view and fireworks!
Bottom line, if you are in Barcelona on business this hotel will deliver all that you may need, if you are visiting as a tourist, you will hardly find a better location!",5,2015,06,27
35,Great hotel - location is better than it first seems...,"Once you get over the fact that the hotel is located at the port and in a commercial building complex, you realize what a great location that it is.  A few minutes from the base of Las Ramblas.  Walking distance to lots.  Top notch 5 stars all the way for service, rooms and very friendly staff.  I would stay there again.",5,2015,06,26
35,"Fantastic hotel, excellent facilities, brilliant staff","I stayed here for a night away during June with my other half and as it was the first time we'd been to Barcelona, we weren't quite sure of what to expect. In summary:

Hotel Location
- A short taxi ride from the airport (approx. 20 mins/30 euros)
- Brilliant for access to La Ramblas (5 minute walk)
- A short walk around the harbour (20-25 minutes) to the beach
- Quite a distance (40-50 mins from the Sagrada Familia)

Hotel Room
- We opted for a room with complimentary strawberries which were amazing
- Loads of toiletries and towels etc... supplied and a separate walk in wardrobe
- We were on the 4th floor and had a great balcony view
- Complimentary WiFi coverage in the room was really good 

Hotel highlights
- The rooftop pool, bar and sun terrace (all were a little small but never very busy)
- The very well-equipped air conditioned gym (we didn’t use the spa but it looked nice too)
- Best selection of breakfast I've ever seen in a hotel
- Although we were definitely not the richest guests in the hotel we were treated really well by all of the staff
- On arrival we were provided vouchers for an additional complimentary glass of bubbly

Hotel Lowlights
- None!!!! We will stay here again and would definitely recommend

Other info that might be useful
- Sunbeds can be hired on the beach for 7 euros each
- Boat trips from the harbour are under 20 euros(for both of us) and lasted about half an hour which was really nice but there wasn’t much to see
- La Ramblas is a MUST for a visit but don't stay there too late as the atmosphere changes to be quite menacing later on with pick pockets and prostitutes surfacing",5,2015,06,24
35,June 2015,The staff was great and friendly. The room was big and very nice with a balcony. I also stayed at the Arts Hotel Barcelona and the Pullman Hotel. This hotel does not compare to the Arts Hotel but I definitely preferred it to the Pullman Hotel. The only difference was that the location for the Pullman was better. But the pool for the Pullman was definitely much nicer.,4,2015,06,24
35,"Great hotel, great location","We had a twin room booked for four nights, room only, and upon check in we requested a nice view.  We weren't disappointed.  Our room overlooked the marina, so looking to our left was the town and to our right, the sea.  Absolutely perfect.  Our room wasn't ready as we arrived at noon but our cases were in our room when we returned.  We then got a phone call from Reception asking if everything was to our liking, which was a nice gesture.  The room was very clean, tea and coffee facilities good and there was very little noise to be heard. A free in-room safe is always a bonus.  The air-con was so quiet in the room we could leave it on all night, undisturbed.  Concierge went over and above expectations and were extremely helpful.  The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the Columbus Column at the bottom of La Rambla.  If we ever return to Barcelona, this is the only hotel we would stay in.",5,2015,06,23
35,A great hotel,I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The staff is very friendly. The service is great. The room are big (for Europe). The location is perfect. We were in town for a conference (which was business) but took a couple of days off to see Barcelona. The Gran Marina was a great place to have as a base.,5,2015,06,19
35,"Perfect location, very attentive staff","The hotel is very well situated only a few minutes' walk from Las Ramblas. We were able to have a stroll along there every evening without needing to use public transport to get back again. Also, there is a stop for the Hop-on-hop-off buses right outside the hotel so that was also very convenient on the day that we used that service for sightseeing.

The breakfasts were exceedingly good. The buffet included everything imaginable and the staff serving at breakfast were very attentive, polite and friendly.

Also, all of the staff working on reception were very efficient and helpful.

The room was very pleasant and clean, and we had a superb view of the city and the marina. Admittedly there is a cable car tower right in front of the hotel but it only blocks part of the view. It didn't spoil it for us at all.

We loved Barcelona and would certainly recommend this hotel very highly.",5,2015,06,17
35,Great Stay and Location,"The room was huge, amazing bathroom and a very comfortable bed  The balcony was a added bonus.  Location was great, within walking distance to all the sites, sounds and smell's of Barcelona. The staff were great.  I would stay at this hotel again",4,2015,06,17
35,Grand Marina Hotel,"A large hotel in a nice scenic location, fairly close to it all though better once we hired bikes to get around the city. We had a decent room & view from the room but the lighting was terrible - very dim throughout the room & bathroom.
Rooftop bar very overpriced (perhaps why we were only ones checking it out!)",4,2015,06,16
35,Pleasant Stay,"Stayed here for a long weekend last July. Have only just got around to writing a review. Our room was very classy and the bed was so comfortable. The reception staff were lovely, the night porter Xavier showed us to our room, and also talked us through all of the best restaurants/places to go. He was very helpful. We had dinner in the hotel one night, it was okay, nothing special though and over priced. The highlight of our stay was one night when we were going across town, we needed a taxi but the road was blocked off and it was raining - without being asked one of the porters hopped on a bicycle, top hat and all - waved down a t",4,2015,06,15
35,"Good location. Quiet place next to the pool,  there was nice .","Breakfast is really nice, big choice and friendly stuf. Friendly smile at the reception greeted us . Everyone throughout our stay was nice and I liked that it wasn't crouded felt like only few people were in hotel only breakfast area was busy in the mornings . 
      ",5,2015,06,14
35,Perfect way to launch your cruise vacation,"Our travel agent recommended this hotel and he was right.  Perfect location near La Rambla as well as to the cruise ships. Breakfast buffet was included, and it was a lavish, varied selection suited for all the nationalities that will come to this gorgeous city.  We had drinks & dinner the first night in the hotel, which was perfect.  The next night, we had a glass of wine and the server remembered us and the kind of wine we had.  Love that higher level of service.
The room was nicely appointed.  Clean, comfortable.  Robe, which is always a plus for me.
I definitely recommend this hotel. Great service, location, quality!",5,2015,06,14
35,Nice hotel,"I spent 2 nights at the hotel((Friday and Saturday). Overall, it was a nice experience. All the smokers are assigned to just one floor of the hotel. The staff was helpful and friendly. Although some only spoke a little English they were still very helpful. The food at the restaurant and room service was pretty good.  The amenities were nice(refrigerator, coffee pot,  hair dryer, pool, fitness center, etc. The location of the hotel is central to many tourist sites.

The room was clean and the maintenance staff was quite helpful. I would definitely return to the hotel if I come back to Barcelona.

My only complaint is that the shower window was so narrow that water pooled on the floor.",4,2015,06,14
35,Ups and downs,"I liked a lot of things about this hotel. Rooms were very spacious and quite. Nice bathroom. Helpful staff. I ordered roomservice: perfect!
But, the pillows where so terrible that I didn't got much sleep. The restaurant was full when I attempted to have breakfast; there was already a large queue. So I went out instead.
",3,2015,06,13
35,"Nice ""first"" hotel in Barcelona","I stayed at this hotel at the beginning of a tour. When I returned back to Barcelona, a week later, I stayed more in the city center not because of a negative experience, but the cost. The hotel is big and clean with spacious rooms and a big bathroom with both a shower and a jetted tub. The morning continental breakfast was bountiful and I definitely recommend choosing the bed and breakfast option as anything else would be a ways to walk to. The rooftop pool is really not a pool but more like a large hot tub. WiFi was spotty. I made use of the airport pick up service, but take a cab and save some money. Barcelona cabs are metered. You can get to the hotel for about half the cost of the car service.",4,2015,06,12
35,Benchmark hotel,"Absolutely stunning hotel! Deluxe suite was spacious, with 2 big rooms, bathroom that had everything you might need, even small jacuzzi style bath. Value for money! 

Very good location, few minutes walk to La Rambla and not far away from the beach.",5,2015,06,11
35,Birthday trip,I booked this hotel after reading some good reviews we did the trip for my husbands birthday on arrival a member of staff came out and took our case and the girl who checked us in was brilliant all through our stay they were extremely helpful and polite will defiantly stay again,5,2015,06,10
35,1st time Barcelona,"First time both my wife and I had visited Barcelona, the hotel was very clean and the staff were very helpful. Location wise it was perfect for what we wanted. My only compliant was the cost and standard of the breakfast, when checking in the lady on the desk advised that instead of paying EUR25 per visit she could offer EUR18 per person if we agreed in advance so we took the offer. We visited the breakfast restaurant and were shocked to find that not only was the buffet style food cold but also the coffee was cold. We left the breakfast food and decided to have some fruit instead. It was such shame that a 5 star hotel would forget to serve warm food. We did not go to breakfast the next day so lost EUR36 but it was worth it!",3,2015,06,08
35,Fantastic location,"Just got back from a long weekend in Barcelona and was very pleased we choose this hotel, when we arrived from the airport by taxi a member of staff was there to open the car door and take our luggage straight to reception, having arrived mid morning our room was not ready, but they said they will look after our luggage and bring it up to our room later, so we went off to explore the city. On our return we collected our room keys and went to the room, we had booked a deluxe room and was not disappointed, large bathroom with walk in shower and separate jacuzzi bath, large wardrobes with oversized safe, flat screen TV and large bed and also seating area   Fully stocked mini bar. Small outdoor swimming pool and bar area on roof terrace with indoor gym facilities. We did not have breakfast while we stayed there but did have an evening meal which was at a very good standard, only a couple of things that were not to our satisfaction was our room did not have a balcony and the drinks were a little expensive, but saying that the staff were fantastic and nothing was to much trouble for them, The location of the hotel is fantastic to explore the city by foot or the tour bus which stops 50 metres from the front of the hotel. Next time I visit Barcelona we will stay here",5,2015,06,08
35,Classy & Sophisticated,"Only stayed here for 1 night prior to catching a boat but would definitely recommend it.  It's location was spot on: not just for catching my cruise but also for a wander into the city itself (Las Ramblas was literally a 5-10 min walk).  The staff were friendly and helpful and breakfast (I ate out for dinner), was exceptional. Bedrooms were big, fully equipped and the bed itself was lovely (ensure you read all about the different types of pillows they have on offer named after American actresses of the silver screen 😃). This was a business trip for me but I would definitely go back for pleasure.",4,2015,06,07
35,Got to be the best in Barcelona,"Great hotel in a Great location, this hotel has the wow factor views from ore room was over the harbour and city, it was easy to get to all the sights the beach was only 25 mins walk away. the staff in the hotel could have not been more friendly and  helpful,, we arrived a little early to book in our room was not ready we were going to drop our bags and go sight seeing, but were told that we could have an upgrade to a suite (no extra cost happy days) it was stunning, the pool on the 8th floor was a plunge pool but adequate  also plenty of  sunbeds.
There is so much to say about this wonderful city, for us it was I city that we will be returning to, as we will to The Grand Marina Hotel",5,2015,06,06
35,Could be great but let down by a few things,"Unfortunately we arrived in Barcelona on the day of the Spanish football final and accommodation was limited....and expensive!
We had 2 rooms for 2 couples and each was quite comfortable and one reasonably large.
Unfortunately, whilst the room was generally quite clean, the bathroom floor had a stone-type tiled floor which had absorbed a number of stains, particularly around the toilet, which were quite off putting. The bathroom area was also quite poorly lit, especially the shower area.
The beds are very comfortable and staff very helpful and friendly.
The buffet breakfast has a large assortment of food but is strangely not particularly inviting.",3,2015,06,05
35,Great location,"Rooms are good sized. Bathrooms are very nice.  Some rooms have nice views. Staff is great. They are pleasant and go the extra mike. It's very convenient. Concierge suggested some very good restaurants. They all speak excellent English which is not true of all resorts. If you are going to Barcelona, this is a great place to stay. You will not be disappointed. We will definitely stay there again.

35,"Communication,communication,communicatio","We had our clients accomodated in hotel Grand Marina and unfortunatelly cant be satisfied with the Service. Bar,food, breakfast is ok. Rooms standarized for 5star hotel. But the service of the front desk is bellow any comparable hotel i have seen so far exept few places in carribean...nobody knows anything about what is going on, changes in reservations,late check ins not communicated, might be good for conferrences but cant recommend to anybody else..couples,young travellers, families there are better hotels for better price in Barcelona...",2,2015,06,01
35,"Loved the hotel, the location, the breakfast, the staff!","We were getting off our Wind Star Cruise ship and saw that our hotel was just a few steps away.  I had no idea that we would be so close to the cruise dock when I made the reservation to stay here.  We stored our luggage in the lobby, had the concierge book tickets for the Barcelona Hop On Hop Off Bus Tour and headed out for the morning. the tour buses were just a few meters away from the hotel so it was very convenient.  When we returned at siesta time our luggage was safely stowed in our lovely room.  

The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, the turn down service was great, the pillow menu kept my husband and I both happy, the room was clean and well appointed.  We had prepaid for breakfast and wondered if it would be any good.  It was fabulous and well worth the money.  there were beautiful pastries, a wide variety of fresh fruits, a nice cereal bar, gorgeous cheeses and meats, one of the best cappuccinos ever.  The hot dishes didn't have a great deal of appeal - the scrambled eggs looked overcooked, the bacon looked undercooked and the special Tortilla de Espana had no flavour, but considering all the other food available I was very pleased with the overall breakfast.

All of the above plus free wifi.  How could ask for anything more.",5,2015,06,01
35,You must stay here!!,"An absolutely beautiful hotel!! The staff are so so helpful and friendly, they're a real credit to the hotel.  The rooms are very spacious and clean, with all necessary facilities.  Food and service fabulous!! Location brilliant, 5 minutes walk to Las Ramblas. We will definitely come and stay here again and very soon - an utter joy!!!

35,Great Hotel Great Location,"We would have no hesitation in recommending the Eurostar Grand Marina Hotel for your stay in Barcelona.
The location is great. The Hotel is first class. The Staff are great, courteous and extremely helpful.

35,"Great facilities, lovely staff, secure parking!","Spent 4 days here in May and we selected this hotel as it has underground secure parking which we needed. Breakfast was good, rooms were good: mine was large with not much of a view, my friends had the sea views in slightly smaller rooms and those views beat a bigger room. Staff were really hospitable and friendly (apart from matron at breakfast), parking was good, concierge could maybe have been more experienced. The gym was in great condition with good equipment all fully working, outdoor pool small but adequate, sauna good but 3 people max really, bar in the 1st floor was nice but prices powerful... Location means fab sea views but walking to the beach you do get a little tired of the walk as it's around the harbour of course so around 30 mins. We needed good parking so we'd come back if driving to Barcelona again. If facilities make this a 5 star, I'd say overall quality would make this 4 star. Overall good hotel and Barcelona and the weather was fantastic. ",4,2015,05,29
35,A nice place to stay,"We stayed four days in late April and chose the hotel for its convenience. It is within easy walking to the main shopping precinct. Food and service excellent, rooms clean and ours had a view down the forecourt. Taxis and busses available from in front of the hotel.",4,2015,05,29
35,And the truth is........,"This hotel is lovely, for a final day of a Spanish business trip which also took me to madrid I was really impressed with this hotel.... Great service focused staff,  lovely clean and bright hotel .... Probably not 4 star by uk standard but never the less still high quality, certainly by Spanish standards ......wouldn't hesitate to recommend .....well done all...",5,2015,05,27
35,Marina Base Keeps you Cool,"Stayed here 4 nights with another couple to explore Barcelona. Only five minutes stroll to Las Ramblas. You can catch the tour buses outside the hotel.
The marina location keeps you cool and the view over the city and harbour is fantastic. 
Hotel is stunningly modern and spacious with lots of different areas to chill out in. We loved our very large room with balcony.
Don't expect too much about the pool - it's quite small.
Excellent breakfast choices, 
The restaurant in the evening was underused which is a shame because the food, service and extra touches were excellent and we would really recommend it over what were often either 'overpriced' or overcrowded places around.
Staff were extremely relaxed, friendly and helpful.
Drinks and wine quite expensive.",5,2015,05,26
35,What can I say.. Excellent!,"It was my second stay in this particular hotel and it definietely won't be last! Fantastic location at waterfront, 5 minutes walk from La Ramblas, Aquarium, 10 minutes walk from Barceloneta and it's fantastic sea food restaurants. Service was spotless exactly what you would expect from 5 star hotel. Rooms were spacious and well designed. Worth every penny ..or cent! So what are you waiting for? You won't be dissapointed!",5,2015,05,26
35,Lovely hotel....great location,"Just returned from 3 night stay at the Grand Marina and it was a lovely hotel with (broadly) very good service and a fabulous location.

On check in we were greeted with a voucher for 2 free drinks and later that afternoon enjoyed a couple of glasses of cava in the sun!  

Location was super, only 10-15 mins from La Rambla and Placa Reial, 15 mins from Barceloneta and 5 mins from the start for the climb to Montjuic.

We had a deluxe twin room which had every modern convenience including a futuristic shower which looked amazing but sadly did not allow temperature control!  After the first evening enduring a boiling shower we complained but no action was taken.  The second day after prompting it was confirmed that it could not be fixed immediately.  After a conversation which went along the lines of ""you can still have a bath and we have no other rooms"", ""er, no we would like a working shower"" we were given another equivalent room.  The bathroom was not as impressive but it worked! 

So, in the end the issue was satisfactorily resolved by the staff, some of whom were more helpful than others.  

I would stay here again and would recommend it.  Just be prepared to persevere if there is an issue!

",4,2015,05,25
35,Great location with fab views- a nice hotel,"I stayed here with my boyfriend for three nights. At first I was a bit apprehensive, wondering if it would be too 'corporate' but we thought it was great.
Perfect location for us as easy to walk to Las Ramblas and along the port, as well as good distances for taxi prices. 
We didn't actually eat at the hotel once but would sit for coffees and service was always good, (as were the coffees).

We had to ask for our room to be serviced on the first night but from then they did it automatically. Fresh towels and clean sheets daily. 
Bathroom and bedroom were both really good sizes and clean.

Our one negative was the size of the pool. Very, very small and as on 8th floor very windy but better than nothing.
We used the gym which had a good selection of machines and weights.

Concierge were really great. They recommended restaurants and helped us hire the motorised bikes- emobile- definitely recommend those, great fun!! 
The hotel itself doesn't have a spa but recommends somewhere directly outside the entrance. My boyfriend had a sports massage which he didn't rate. 

Overall, we would stay here again and recommend it to family and friends. It's not a quaint, romantic place, but at the same time it's not too corporate for couples. 

Room tip: our room was on the 7th floor- amazing views!! ",4,2015,05,25
35,Excellent Barcelona hotel,"We stayed here for one night prior to a cruise.
The hotel is ideally located for walking into Barcelona as it is only a few minutes from Las Ramblas. 
The hop-on, hop-off bus service stops at the hotel too.
The rooms are spacious and well appointed and the bathroom is large (with baths not just showers).
The is a nice roof-top pool and sun bed area with a bar and lunch menu.
We received a complimentary upgrade to a suite which was really nice with a separate living room and balcony.
We have used the hotel several times and will continue to use it as our preferred choice for Barcelona.",5,2015,05,24
35,Howdens Jolly,"Contemporary rooms were excellent and clean, facilities were excellent and quality, the views were spectacular and all other aspects of the hotel were wonderful. I would definitely visit Barca again and stay in this hotel

      Luggage had to carry yourself in your room.",5,2015,05,23
35,Relaxing,Very relaxing and accommodating. The rooms were phenomenal and the staff worked hard to ensure we had a pleasant stay. I also loved the live strings playing in the lounge area when we arrived. It was a short distance from the port and right near a bus tour/sight seeing stop. We loved the hotel!,4,2015,05,22
35,Good stay,"The hotel is greatly located and walking distance from Barcelona city center.
Nice facility, clean and well maintained. Staff very friendly.
Provide Free internet connection
Maybe a bit expensive but overall good experience - I would come back.",4,2015,05,21
35,Amazing time - Great Stay!,This was a perfect stay. Had a great room with a view of the water. The bed was so incredibly comfortable. Bathroom was fantastic. Room clean everyday very well. WiFi was high speed and perfect. Breakfast amazing. Just a perfect stay!,5,2015,05,21
35,Excellent!,"From the moment you arrive you are greeted with smiling faces.  When we arrived (2 hours before check in ) the room was not ready but we were treated to a complimentary drink and were given a room in under twenty minutes. The front desk staff whisked our bags up to the room and were very professional, friendly and courteous. The white gloved doorman was quick to help with directions, calling a cab and recommending  local restaurants. 

The hotel is a ten minute walk form te main street in Barcelona which is home to great restaurants, bars and lounges. The hotel is literally on a marina which overlooks the water.

The rooms were HUGE! We stayed in a suite which was very comfortable, clean and technologically efficient.  

Room service has great service and really good food. There is large outdoor rooftop patio connected to the   restaurant and bar. It was nice to sit out at night and have a drink under the stars. The hotel is a fantastic option for people traveling to Barcelona for business or pleasure.",5,2015,05,21
35,Way too expensive,"I understand the position which is very good (even if, despite being in front of the sea, you cannot enjoy seaview from anywhere because the building is surrounded by the building of the WTC...who designed this non sense???) but the cost of everything is just crazy...4 euros a bottle of 250ml water from the frigo bar? No way...thousands of euros the rental of normal meeting room? You could get same service much cheaper in better locations, even in Barcelona. Will never consider to come back here for business or leisure",2,2015,05,21

35,Excellent location by the port.,"Excellent location just a little out from the very busy city center, so perfect for us. It's close to a shopping center with lots of excellent restaurants which look out on to the water. Service and breakfast facilities were exceptional, and we were especially pleased that they put the MotoGP on the TV in the bar on Sunday. Highly recommended :-)",5,2015,05,18
35,Good location,"If you are looking for a nice hotel in a good location, but don't want to be right in the city center then this is a good pick.
I arrived at 11 am and was assigned a room immediately - no need to wait until 3 pm. The room was spacious and clean. Wireless internet is complimentary and works well.
I stayed at the hotel for one night only and didn't use any of the F&B outlets (why would you in Barcelona), so I can't comment on that.",4,2015,05,14
35,"Great service, perfect room, nice views, ideal location","Picked this one for Formula 1 event stay. Got room with city view. No complaints. Very good large room. Great service at reception. Thank you! We didn't arrive with a fancy car (regular taxi), but still got VIP treatment!!! What can i say? I will come back for sure!",5,2015,05,11
35,"Great location, quality hotel","Nicely located overlooking where the cruise ships dock, this hotel is hard to fault. Spacious modern rooms with the facilities you’d expect at this standard, a small balcony (which means you can get fresh air if you want),a good buffet breakfast selection, very good bars – often with live music – and a small pool and sunbathing area on the roof. The roof bar is a great place to sit and look out over the harbour and the City, and even watch the Barceloneta cable car seemingly feet away as it passes. There’s a good gym too. Service is good. The nearest metro is perhaps 400m and the hotel is nicely placed not far from the Columbus statue so near to La Rambla but far enough away to give you a break from the busy-ness. Our room prices were quite reasonable too – though drinks and meal extras were costly (though the minibar less so!). A nice touch was showing live Barca football in the funky Cube bar when there’s a match.",4,2015,05,11
35,Perfect ,"Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel in my opinion, is the best hotel location ever in Barcelona. Every place there is waking distance. I stayed there for six wonderful nights.   

The room and bed are very cozy. The bathroom need more lights. The room service overall are excellent. 

Hotel employees are very helpful they provided me with very good recommendations about restaurants and places. 
",5,2015,05,10
35,Don't waste your money,"This is not a tourist hotel. It's attached to the World Trade Center so if your on business, like boredom and have money to throw away, this is the place to go.  Don't expect a clean room before 3:45 and don't plan to see the sea from your room or from anywhere in the hotel unless you go to the roof.  We stayed at two other hotels in Barcelona for half the price and twice the amenities.  Use the extra $100 per night for something fun or entertaining. You're not going to get it here.

35,"Harbour views, business meetings type hotel","This is the sort of hotel you would come to if your intention is to stay only one night in Barcelona...why?...let me explain further. It has fantastic panoramic views of whole Barcelona City from the roof top terrace, therefore you will get full clear perspective of the entire city immediately.  It is short walking distance location from Ramblas and marina yet away from all the hustle and bustle of city centre. The food is great, fresh and varied. The rooms are fine ( in line with cost). The main drawback for me was that seemed more a hotel that is used for business meetings. There is no swimming pool as such that you can relax around ( there is a tiny one on the roof top terrace but is more jacuzzi size) and can get quite crowded at peak seasons. This was the reason for my average score overall",3,2015,05,02
35,Review on stay in April,"The attention & service we received from first arriving until leaving was first class, the room was very good and the standard of attention to cleaning the room good, breakfast selection very good and service of the highest degree

35,Fabulous city hotel,"What a treat for our last night of a 10 day trip.  From our arrival to our departure, the hotel was amazing.  Very gracious staff, amazing room - we were treated to an upgrade as well.  Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,04,28
35,Great hotel and facilities.,"I recently stayed in this hotel on a visit to Barcelona. The facilities were fantastic and it is set in a great location, close enough to walk to las ramblas and the beach, but far enough away that the business of the area had no ill effect. 
The rooms were very clean, and I have no complaints about any of the facilities really (although the rooftop pool is pretty small, not ideal for much more than having a quick dip!)
The breakfast was to a high standard, and the bar area was nice (either sat in the main bar within the hotel, on the outdoor terrace or in 'the Qube' out back).

The hotel is quite expensive to stay in, but if you want the added luxury, great service and good location, it is definitely worth the outlay.
Exploring the city for restaurants is advised, as it gives you a better sense of the culture, and the hotel food is as you would expect fairly pricey (but of a very high standard).",4,2015,04,26
35,"Great Hotel, Great Location",Stayed for a weekend in April.  15 minutes from airport.. Great quick check-in.  Friendly helpful staff.  Room had a great view of the city. Close to Las Ramblas and a short walk to the beach. Ideal central location! Will be back..,5,2015,04,25
35,"Great hotel , great location","Went to Barcelona for my daughters 21st. Absolutely great hotel along with the location.
The room was fabulous with a dressing room , spa bath. The breakfast was awesome loads of variety and the drinks although a little pricey were lovely . Would definitely stay again.",5,2015,04,24
35,Great place to stay!!,"Stayed here two nights. Had a lovely room. Very comfortable bed. Lovely bathroom too. Clean. 

Really good location. A few minutes walk from Ramblas and Maremagnum. Very easy to walk around in general. Felt safe. 

Rooftop bar wasn't open. Went and had a look, nice view, can imagine when running properly and with customers its a great place for a drink. I can only imagine of course. 

Didn't eat at the restaurants so can't comment on those. 

One negative and at the time incredibly annoying - when we checked in we paid for breakfast to be included, signed the agreement etc. 
When I went down for breakfast, our room was marked for 'not included' and I was handed an invoice to sign before I was able to eat. Having already paid for it, there was no way I was paying twice then going through the hassle of getting the money back at a later date. I refused to sign it and insisted she check with reception. She did and they said it wasn't included. She said if I wanted to eat I would have to sign the invoice or go an discuss it with reception. Such a lovely event for first thing in the morning. Went to reception very annoyed and they confirmed it was included and had already been paid for. More annoyed! Went back up and finally ate breakfast. Is it bad admin or bad communication - who knows but it was very annoying.",4,2015,04,21
35,Best Hotel I've Stayed In Yet,"This was a great experience for my husband and I. We visited Barcelona following his return from a military deployment. The room was awesome. We actually ended up booking a room we thought would accommodate us but it wasn't large enough so they went ahead and placed us in something more comfortable and discounted the price down to the room we originally booked. The staff was very friendly and spoke perfect English (even though I speak decent Spanish).  The brunch was awesome and the concierge was very accommodating. Only complaint is that the pool is very small so if you are all about the pool, do not book here. It's also not immediately accessible to the beach but close enough to drive to one if needed. Beautiful view, comfortable room, lots of amenities, wonderful staff. Highly recommend.",4,2015,04,21
35,Fine if you aren't staying in the hotel much,"This hotel is nice enough. Has a nice, albeit very small, pool and deck area. I can't comment on the food because we ate out even for breakfast. The rooms were okay, fairly small and actually a bit dark for my tastes. The bathroom was the best bit, really nice showers with multiple shower heads and the bath had a jacuzzi function which was perfect after a long day of walking around. It is perfect for las ramblas and loads of restaurants that are cheaper and have amazing food nearby. The corridors were a bit maze-like and were also very dark with no natural light. I would stay again but I think next time I would upgrade the room for more space.",3,2015,04,19
35,A WELL APPOINTED HOTEL,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 3 night stay at the Eurostars, which was situated in an ideal location close to the Ramblers & the hustle & bustle yet in a reasonably quiet locationset back from the main drag.The staff were extremely attentive,& breakfast was excellent I would certainly stay here again & recommend to friends & family.",5,2015,04,19
35,Very enjoyable,"On check in I got a free upgrade to a suite which was probably the best one I have ever stayed in; huge room, lounge, bathroom e.t.c. The breakfast had a good choice, the bar was good and had great bar food, the roof top bar was great.  It's walking distance to most central places but in a quiet area.  Not too expensive either!",4,2015,04,17
35,Best hotel view,"Absolutely beautiful hotel. Can see why this may be missed due to being by the water and not directly in the centre of the town however the location was perfect. Just a short 5 minute walk to las rambles. The tourist bus stopped just outside the hotel so we were able to hop straight on and then go onto all the tourist destinations. We were upgraded on arrival to 2 adjoining superior rooms which were just beautiful. Really spaces, the biggest rooms I have ever stayed in, each with their own balcony. Our room overlooked the city side, waking up every morning looking out on Barcelona was just amazing. The hotel has a large terrace area on the roof, you can walk round one side and see the ocean and the cruise ships, then the otherside has the stunning city view. Sitting up there in the evenings with a bottle of wine was bliss. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2015,04,15
35,Dangerous and disappointing!,"I truly would not consider Grand Marina to be a five star hotel. Granted, they try their utmost to please and give service with a smile - but when you go past the surface they are in fact really incompetent. 

I say this because of an incident that occurred once we arrived in our room. After a long journey we wanted to make ourselves a cup of tea, and decided to make use of the tea making facilities in the room. My partner tried to plug the kettle in - and the plug exploded!!! Sparks flying, smoke everywhere, his arm was electrocuted and the power went out in the whole room. We rang reception immediately, explained the situation and was met with the reply ""Oh the kettle? Has the fuse gone? We'll send maintenance up."" Zero apologies, zero recognition of the fact that this was an extremely dangerous situation! All they did was replace the kettle with an identical once which thankfully, did not explode.... We thought that perhaps they hadn't understood what had happened, tried to re-explain after checking out, but still - zero acknowledgement or promise to check that this wouldn't happen in the future. We couldn't believe it. What if it had been a kid trying to innocently plug a kettle in??? 

Aside from this - the bed is comfortable, the bathroom clean but the quality of the toiletries is poor. The welcome drink is a nice gesture - and we had a cheese board which was excellent. The atmosphere at the bar was lovely with a live pianist although service was very slow.

Location is not that great - it is quite a walk from anything and for this price you can stay a bit closer in a 4 star hotel but is probably equally as good. I feel that if a hotel is lacking in location, for this price you need to make it up for it in other places - which it hadn't in this case. Good free wifi in the room. 

I will not return to stay in this hotel - and I hope that someone from management will read this review and check that there is not a fault in the kettles as judging by the nonchalance of the receptionist, it seems like it has happened before.",3,2015,04,15
35,Affordable luxury and convenience with a smile!,"I cannot say enough great things about the staff at this hotel. There was a minor hiccup with our one of the rooms in our double-suite the first day we arrived, and it was attended to immediately. We were also treated to a free upgrade without asking, which was very generous. The staff are very kind, helpful, and resourceful. The grounds are impeccable, and the rooms are very comfortable. The space in the suites were the largest I have ever encountered, and they were well appointed, including the mini-bar, toiletries, robes, etc. We were treated to champagne on the house on arrival. The view from our 7th floor suite - wow!  We have to go back just to take it in again. We could see the lighthouse, part of the city, and the beautiful port of Barcelona.  As far as proximity to tourist attractions, the hotel is a brisk 10-15 minute walk to Les Ramblas, the Columbus Monument, the Maremagnum mall with breathtaking harbor views, and a 20 minute walk to the Barcelona aquarium and Barcenoleta Beach. Definitely money well spent, and how vacation should be. Thank you, Eurostars Grand Marina!",5,2015,04,12
35,Good hotel if you like to be on the sea front,"I stayed in this hotel while visiting my brother in Spain. It's a bit far from the las ramblas but still a walking distance. The room I had was a junior suit, very spacious and neat. I woke up one morning to see a tourist boat parked just outside my window but they left that evening. The buffet breakfast is one of the best I've had.",4,2015,04,07
35,Long Easter Weekend in Barcelona,"This is a nice modern business hotel (which did nothing to deter the many families we noticed staying there :) ) which is located on the marina (outside the noise and pedestrian traffic of the gothic quarter but only a 5 minute walk to a hop-on-hop-off tour bus stop, or a 10 minute walk from Las Ramblas, nice restaurants, the beach, a modern shopping center, and the metro line). We made the booking using the hotel website since they offered a special discounted rate and requested a double premier room; when we arrived we were given a large beautiful room on the 6th floor with a balcony & a beautiful view towards the city. The room had all the modern amenities, with a comfortable king-size bed, sitting area and a separate walk in closet; the bathroom had dual sinks and separate toilet and walk in shower with a multi spray shower head & fantastic water pressure. The spa, gym and rooftop pool are located on the 8th floor; the view from the rooftop was amazing. We did not get a chance to try the spa or the pool (it was sunny but rather cold during our stay) but the gym is better than most hotel gyms. The bar on the 1st floor is nice but leans more towards a business clientele, e.g. not overly romantic. The breakfast buffet was some of the best I've ever had, and they will also make eggs to order. The staff are some of the friendliest and best that i have ever met, eager to please and not shy about offering assistance or enquiring towards your comfort. We rented the hotel bicycles and enjoyed a brisk but fun ride around the city and along the beach. The concierge were very friendly and helpful and their restaurant recommendations were never disappointing! We were very sad to leave but hope to come back again.",5,2015,04,07
35,Could have been so much better but good enough...,"Good location, not too noisy as not located on Las Ramblas - about a 10-15 minute walk from there. Nice and peaceful at night.  

We were really disappointed to find the rooftop pool was drained as April is classed as 'out of season' but nonetheless the view from the roof of the city was breathtaking. I suggest checking with the hotel before booking if you're looking to enjoy a swim as if we had known we wouldn't have booked this hotel. 

We ate out for all our meals so can't rate the food but the bar we tried was ok - quiet and corporate looking, no complaints..bit soulless but we kind of expected this from some of the reviews we read first. Overall I'd say this is a good place to stay on business rather than for a romantic getaway. 

The room was on the small side but the bathroom was large and one of the nicer we've come across with a separate bath and shower, and double sinks. Overall, it was an average hotel and an average stay, but then if you're in Barcelona you're going to be out and about exploring so all you want is a convenient location, which this was for us.",3,2015,03,30
35,Birthday trip,"loved the Hotel, brilliant room - we upgraded to Floor 7 with a balcony & Living Room so excellent for space/views over the city & harbour.
The welcome on arrival was second to none, all the staff provide 5 star service.
 A good choice of breakfast food, the Lobby Bar us welcoming (on the 1st Floor) with attentive service.
Cons: we were asked to pay half of our bill after two days of a four day stay. We still can't understand this, we were told it was Hotel Policy as our bill exceeded €1000 after 2 days - well it would the room cost €450 per night! This was so unusual it's worth mentioning here!
Would we stay again? Yes, hopefully without paying halfway through our stay!",5,2015,03,29
35,Could have been better,"Well, overall the experience was fine, however if you are an international traveller beware, they will do the preautorization in your local currency and mostly won't be able to release it or use it due to currency fluctuation. I have €500 stuck in my credit card due to that. Also, don't believe the promises of the front desk when telling you that they will take care of it. Once you check out they will charge you again.

Now the good side is, once I arrived, they upgraded me to their 2 bedroom suite for free, which was nice. Overall, staff are helpful and friendly. I especially like the bell boys as they are jolly and very cooperative and supportive.",4,2015,03,28
35,What a disapointment,"Here we go, a 5 star hotel, expectations are high... and what we got was such a deception! I could not imagine that the isolation between the room of my neighbour and my own room could ever be so bad. Every step he made, felt like he was walking in my room. The view of the room is again very deceiving. From its position you should expect a nice sea view but nothing like that, I just got a view on the city without any interest... My room happened to be a suite... but no couch if you want to relax, go to bed! just like an ordinary 3***. The good points go to the bath room which is very complet with massage shower and baththumb and bidet! as well as a spacious dressing for your clothes. Regarding the breakfast nothing special to mention",2,2015,03,26
35,"Great place, great position!","This is a true 5* hotel, everything all right!
Good breakfast, welcoming personal, reception very supporting and helpful!

The hotel is at 5 minutes walk far from Barceloneta, famous Rambal not so far and sightseen buses just 50mt

Place to go to have a nice stop!

35,Fantastic location,"I stayed here last September during La Merce fiesta.  It is in a lovely location.  The
views of the city from the roof terrace are to die for.  The breakfast is excellent, I had
one meal in the evening, that was also very good.  There was a band playing Brazilian
jazz, it was lovely.  The young staff are very friendly and welcoming.
On the minus side, Its a long walk from the city center and La Barceloneta beach, but
there is a bus stop very close and taxis.  I did not find it dangerous walking back to
the hotel in the late evening.  
There seems to be a shortage of shower robes as I only had one on four nights of my
seven night stay despite leaving a note for the room maid.  But on the whole it was
a pleasant stay.  So I would recommend this hotel.",4,2015,03,21
35,Amazing service and a fantastic stay,"I stayed here with two friends who were celebrating their anniversary and a Birthday... I rang before we went and asked for some champagne to be put in their room for when they arrived. They put this in place and on top of that they added at no cost an amazing chocolate selection and some strawberries covered in chocolate (Which I was told were amazing). 
The rooms were very comfortable and well appointed with massage baths and very powerful showers and a nice selection of bathroom freebies. The mini bar was well stocked. There is a pillow menu which one of my friends used. 
We didn't eat there primarily because the place is so close to the Barrie Gotica and also the marina restaurants. 
I had a specific request for a steak restaurant so I spoke to the concierge (All the staff speak passable to excellent English) and she booked us a table at a great steak restaurant for a great night out. 
I would recommend this to anyone staying in Barcelona as its proximity to everything is brilliant and also for the staff who couldn't do enough for us.",5,2015,03,18
35,Nice but not 5 stars. Good business hotel,"We spend 4 days in the grand marina hotel. Check in was fast and professional. The room was well designed and clean. But you can defiantly see that it's not the newest hotel in town. Bathroom was quite used and there was a lot of dust in the lights very vissible. Water temperature and pressure was weak. Once we even had brown water coming out of the shower, so we used the water from tr mini bar to clean the tooth. Bed was very comfortable, we stepped perfect. Turndown service was available upon request. We called for a toothbrush which was delivered after 5 minutes (very fast)The service overall was ok but not as warm and needed in a 5 stars hotel. We missed the personal care. 
Service staff at the lobby cafe / bar was talking to each other about 10 minutes without serving us. 
Prices in here were also quite expensive (5 euros for a coffee ect.) 
 
It's the perfect business hotel clean, anonym and big. But if you're looking for a romantic and unique time in Barcelona I would recommend to stay at the arts hotel. They give you the special details and warm hospitality.",3,2015,03,18
35,Nice hotel in great location,I stayed in this hotel for 4 night between August-September 2014. The best part of my stay was the great location of the hotel being at the marina. Within few minutes you can reach the famous La Rambla street. In addition being very close to Rambla de Mar and the shopping mall of Maremagnum. If we come to the hotel itself. The check in was smooth but the lobby was small and essentially not much space to sit in. Something has to be done to address this issue. The lobby lacks any features of luxury.  My room was clean and nice. The breakfast was very good. The staff in the hotel were very helpful. In general I had a very pleasant stay in this hotel. Being a frequent traveler staying in various chains of hotels I would not consider this hotel as a luxury hotel based on international standards but probably luxury when it comes to Barcelona. I recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to visit Barcelona.,4,2015,03,18
35,Excellent Service,"The staff were wonderful! Travelling alone and not speaking Spanish, I had worried a bit about my arrival but once there, I felt very well taken care of.  No request was too big or too small.  They gave me a room with a wonderful view of the city and the harbour, I enjoyed it very much during my stay.  The soaker tub had jets, albeit a rather unpredictable shower head.  The decor was chic and streamlined and the bed was comfortable.  They presently have only instant coffee in the rooms, they should consider adding expresso machines.  As others have said, the toiletries are aa bit basic but there is the offer to call down for others.  Room service was quick and of good quality.",5,2015,03,18
35,brilliant hotel,"unfortunately my husband was taken ill in Barcelona and needed hospital , the hotel staff were so supportive warm and kind to me at what was a traumatic time and could not have done more . The hotel is a wonderful place to stay the rooms are big and stylish with very comfortable beds, the bathroom had a wonderful shower and jacuzzi bath. Food  was very good and beautifully presented, although the main city of Barcelona with its restaurants and entertainment is just on the doorstep. There is easy access to all the major tourist sites. It is a great hotel and i would not hesitate to book again. Thankyou Eurostars Grand Marina you more than deserve your five stars",5,2015,03,17
35,Lacked attention to detail for the price,"I booked a 3 night break as a treat for my son who was doing well in school. It was booked months in advance via the hotels own website.
Great location for getting into Barcelona without any fuss.
The bar/restaurant was good, the breakfast facilities were good and the concierge was very helpful....but when I book a twin room I expect a twin room not a double and when reception say they'll get someone to rearrange the beds (which were two singles pushed together) It's very disappointing when it doesn't happen. Likewise the view wasn't quite what I was expecting given the options I chose when booking via the hotels own website.
I have stayed in a lot of similar quality hotels in the states when on business, and would dearly have loved the same sort of service here.
Would I stay again....maybe as it's so convenient but I'd probably try not to be so English about asking for what I'd booked.",3,2015,03,17
35,"Fabulous hotel, great location and very friendly staff","We had booked this hotel through Last Minute.com and we couldnt have been more pleased.

Staff were very friendly and helpful the whole time we were there.  Couldnt fault them!

Rooms were very well appointed, we had everything we needed.  We asked to be near our friends that we were travelling with and this had been organised as per our request.

Doormen were always happy to help and very friendly each time we arrived or left each day.

Hotel is situated about 5 minutes from La Rambla which is the main area of Barcelona and from there only a few minutes to the Old Town with everything it has to offer.

Hotel is also right next door to the Marina with shopping, dining and boat tours.

I would definitely stay in this hotel again!! We loved it!",5,2015,03,16
35,"Great hotel, great price","I wouldn't call it just great value; this is a great hotel. The rooms are spacious, the bathtubs have jacuzzi jets, the beds are ones you won't want to leave. The food is on the expensive side, but since you're in Barcelona, why wouldn't you want to eat outside? It's walkable to many of the lively neighborhoods the city has to offer, and there's even a Metro station nearby, for those days when you don't really want to keep walking. Highly recommended!",5,2015,03,10
35,Great lication,Relaxing hotel and great for those who like to walk around the city. Location was good and we would recommend to anyone looking for a short stay in Barca. Situated right next to the Marina offers stunning views with easy access by foot to all the major landmarks. ,4,2015,03,10
35,big room,"we arrived way too late and found very accommodating staff helping us with locating our lost luggage and they delivered to our room promptly
the room was big and well equipped
we stayed in better hotels but the service here was very warm and pleasant",4,2015,03,10
35,AWESOME VALUE FOR MONEY!!!,"We missed our ferry due to a delayed train and turned up at almost midnight. The staff went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable and provided with all our necessities. They printed off our boarding passes and delivered them to our room. The room was a city view, lovely bed, luxurious bathroom. Room service was prompt and delicious. The wifi is fast and the black out curtains gave me an almost 10am sleep in! All in all, this hotel was an oasis in a long journey from France. We'll be back!",5,2015,03,06
35,Luxury rooms,"Very good big rooms, big bathroom. Not in my style as everything was from marble, I prefer design hotels, however this is subjective. Perfect service, perfect breakfast, close to city center. Ideal for business trip or if you are using the marina.",4,2015,03,03
35,Very disappointing ,"I was there for 3 days during a biz trip. It's a 5 stars luxury but it rather could be a 4 star, nothing more. The room is very spacious but very essential. Even the toilet kit is basic one, only soap and shampoo. Nothing else. At 5 o'clock pm of my second day my room wasn't set yet and I had to wait the lady finishing for 20 min. I paid a rate which included breakfast and one morning I asked room breakfast, with my great surprise I've been charged €20 for this extra service despite room breakfast for the ones not having paid b&b rate costs only €23. I complained with the receptionist at checkout but he said ""this is the price, you have to pay it"", from an hotel that is supposed to be more luxury of a hostel I would have expected some more consideration. Only positive aspect is the location which is strategic for business (15 mins from airport) and tourism (just at the down end of the ramble). Don't go there! ",2,2015,02,28
35,Trapped in the lift - an interim review,"The hotel serves well in terms of location.  
I think my rating could be higher if it were not for having been trapped in the main lift for 30 minutes with my panicked 9 month old baby (with no-one answering the emergency button for the longest 10 minutes ever).  

I suppose the apologetic bowel of fruits from this '5 star' hotel to make up for such a traumatic event was 'sufficient'. Let's see how the rest of the stay transpires. My  final review pending.",3,2015,02,25
35,Really nice place and what a view!,"We spent a couple of night in Barcelona and enjoy our stay at this hotel. First of all our room had an amazing view!waking up in the morning and see the entire city skyline from the waterfront is priceless!!
Location is also good if you don't mind walking, as the hotel is very accessible with the car, just outside city's ring, but also 10 minutes by walk from the Ramblas and the old town.
Room are very spacious and qiuet and the personnell very professional and always willing to help. 
The only drawback: what not included in the room rate is unfortunately quite pricy...",4,2015,02,25
35,INCREDIBLE HOTEL,"This hotel is beautiful!! I loved it that much I can't wait to get back!! 
It's set on the marina with stunning views and atmosphere! It's right in the heart of las ramblas and shopping 
Could not recommended this hotel enough 
Room service, staff and facilities are 5star quality!! Friendly and welcoming, the reception staff were more than helpful and pleasant 
I could not fault this hotel at all!!",5,2015,02,23
35,"Book now, no regrets, enjoy this luxury hotel","I stayed for 5 nights with my wife and daughter...

Attentive, corteous and friendly staff. English is spoken quite well by most front-line staff.
Rooms are spacious and comfortable .  I had a family room for my wife and 4 year-old daughter. They made up a separate bed for her.
Pillow menu allows you to choose the pillows that suit your sleeping style best.
Great shower and bathroom - one of the best I´ve been in and I´ve stayed in lots of hotels...
Note that toiletry provision is currently only shower gel and shampoo-conditioner in standard rooms but I´m told the hotel is working on improving this...
Breakfast buffet is, for my tastes, great.  Good coffee served on request (machiatto is yummy).  Lots of smoked salmon, Spanish meats and cheeses plus all the usual breakfast foods.  Be sure to watch out for the egg menu which is placed on the table if you like your eggs poached, etc.
Concierge is friendly and helpful and can advise on where the locals go to eat, not your tourists.
Business centre is free and easy to use including printing tourist vouchers and boarding passes etc.  No passwords and other inconveniences, etc. Great!

Tips:
Taxis are frequent and cheap, no need to use the hotel car
Get a room with a view of the city, it is more interesting than the sea!
If you have any issues with service, the hotel manager is friendly and easy to approach.  I did have some minor issues and they were addressed quickly and with great results.
If you want to use the restaurant at peak times, book in advance.  That said, there are great dining options nearby in town.

Would I stay here again? Yes, definitely.",5,2015,02,19
35,Excellent overall,"I had booked this hotel for 1 night before our Med. cruise.  It was within a short & safe walking distance to the start/south end of Las Ramblas, as well as within short drive to the cruise terminal. The hotel staff speak fluent English and very helpful.  The bedroom, closet, and the en-suite washroom are impressive and in the closet there were robes, slippers, and umbrellas for our stay.  The room is very quiet and the bed is very comfortable. The front desk help us with directions and volunteered to arrange a quick shuttle to the cruise terminal on the day.  I don't usually stay at 5-star hotels because of cost, it feels like a 5-star and is a good bet when far from home.....however, it was at 5-star $price$$ but worth the peace-of-mind, I think.",4,2015,02,17
35,Top hotel in Bacelona port,"I spend 1 night in this nice hotel 
Place is absolute quiet at night and a nice view.
All the staff is very very friendly, rooms are clean, comfortable, in high standard.

Sauna, Jacuzzi, nice restaurant inside but a lot of possibilities to eat around.

Good place to start your visit in Barcelona

Will come again and recommend this hotel.",5,2015,02,16
35,Great hotel within walking distance to many attractions,"Stayed here for business.  Room was small but nicely decorated, showing signs of wear.  Great views.
Walls are thin - had a family with young children in the adjacent room - could hear them very clearly.
Located on the water near the Mirador de Colomb, and within walking distance to La Rambla.
Staff very friendly and helpful.

Liked best: Location, decor
Liked least: Shower - typical European shower (no shower doors), soundproofing",4,2015,02,11
35,An unforgettable visit!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a few days for my 21st birthday. We chose this hotel based on the 5 star rating and how close it is to the centre (5 minutes from Las Ramblas).

On arrival, we were given an upgrade which was awesome. The staff were lovely and attentive throughout, and our room was great - nice view, spacious and a jacuzzi! The pillow menu wad unique and interesting - we didn't like the standard pillows so we ordered some harder ones which were sent up quickly! 

We were even helped getting tickets to see Barcelona at Camp Nou! 

So if you want a bit of luxury, but near the centre, I recommend this hotel. Breakfast and drinks etc are expensive ( of course!) but there are restaurants all over and a Lidl round the corner!  ",5,2015,02,08
35,Great hotel in the center of Barcelona,"Very nice hotel, located on the waterfront, very close to the port.
the rooms are very spacious, the amenities a bit poor, the beds are comfortable.
the breakfast is very good.
the reception is big, but with a small sitting area, however the 1st floor, has an lounge with a sitting area.
friendly service.",4,2015,02,08
35,Superb second time round,Our second stay here and again we were not disappointed. The staff were super helpful as always. This is why returned here again. They even put a piece of cake in out room for my birthday and we hadn't informed them of the date either. The bartender on the poolside bar was great. He was even helping by providing Spanish lessons for us. Highly recommended!,4,2015,02,06
35,"Luxury rooms, perfect location","On first arrival greeted well at reception they took our bags into storage whilst we explored the city as we were super early and they were waiting for us in our room :) little hiccup of broken heating in our room but the staff were lovely and we were upgraded. Rooms so clean , bed comfortable and huge , tea and coffee in the room ...the jacuzzi bath in the room was the cherry on the cake and a little gift wrapped toiletries bag. You got cosy dressing gowns and slippers. The gym was free to use and the sauna too but the jacuzzi and swimming pool closed in winter. ...and to top that all the location ..we could walk everywhere , right on the marina ,5 minutes walk to the bottom of the rambles , easy to get everywhere very near the drassenes metro station and 10 minutes walk to plaza Catalyuna  to catch the airport bus (€6) however taxis readily availAble at the door of the hotel or concierge also available ...5 star luxury in perfect location with very attentive staff xx highly recommend !!",4,2015,02,06
35,Honeymoon was amazing.,"We stayed here as part of our honeymoon and loved it. 
Service was 1st class. 
Food was delicious.
Rooms were lush.

Would definitely stay again.

Only thing i would warn travellers is, the drinks prices are 5 star hotel prices...
But as it has that 5 star what would be expected. And we enjoyed many drinks in the hotel bar. Modern and spacious with romantic gardens.",5,2015,02,05
35,great hotel! brilliant,"Every thing here is perfect, beach,  hotel, room, i love this hotel! 
Reception is vey welcoming , it is close to city center and la ramblas street, i liked the front beach alot.
 I really recommend this hotel, 
wifi is  free !",5,2015,01,30
35,Great Trip,Great location and a good rate compared to what's nearby. Las Ramblas is right there and the beach is down the road as well. Even the red busses that go to all of the sites is just outside the door. If you want a taxi they  are there as well,5,2015,01,27
35,Ideal for a Long Weekend,"Booked as a hotel and flight package, we had a mini suite overlooking the marina and Barcelona.  The view fromt the balcony was lovely (although we did have a tower for the cable car in front).  The rooms were spacious, twin beds, bath and shower, sitting area with fridge.  There was an abundance of choice at breakfast either from the buffet, or cooked fresh in the kitchen and we tried something new every day, finally joining in with a glass of cava on the morning that we came home.  The staff were very attentive, the only niggle was that the coffee came lukewarm, but once we had asked for it hot, this was not forgotten.  We ate in the hotel bar on the first evening and it was OK, but a little disappointing.  It is a short walk to La Rambla and into town, but that was fine for us.  Would stay here again.",4,2015,01,26
35,Clean and Awesome Service!,"Hotel is conveniently located 10mins away from La Rambla where shopping and eateries are. Near the port and beach, walkable to many places of interest. Service rendered by the hotel is impeccable. Will stay there again!",4,2015,01,24
35,Good choice for a family vacation,"Entering the hotel we got a little disappointed  since the atmosphere of the enterence is pretty cold with white lights and the worst christmas tree decoration ever... (Sorry! ;) ) but then we went up to our room and it was warm and nice and well decorated with a nice view of the marina. We were travelling with our kids so we needed all the space that we could have and the rooms are very spacious. Staff is very professional and positive and mostly helpful. Considering very few people speak English in Barcelona, you can communicate with most of the hotel staff and that is a plus. Breakfast is good, open buffet...it might get a bit boring if you are staying more than 2 days like we did since they serve absolutely the same things each and every day. Also the line for a table at the breakfast area surprised us... this is the first time i waited in a line at a hotel for breakfast. 
Rooms are clean and the bed is comfortable and they did everything they can to make our stay comfortable with our kids. 
The location of Grand Marina is another great plus. The hop on hop off busses have stops right by the entrance and also famous La Rambla street is right around the corner. Going down to the shopping mall by the marina or eating tapas looking over marina at the restaurants is a pleasant experience. 
Overall this was a pleasant stay for us. Great choice for a family vacation.",4,2015,01,20
35,High Class,"The hotel was very clean and staff were polite and very helpful. We ate breakfast there each day which was fantastic with plenty of choice. Drinks at the bar were a bit expensive compared to the town. 
Atmosphere was a bit lacklustre but I think that was more due to the time of year we attended and that the hotel is probably aimed at business folk.
Fantastic base for exploring the City.",4,2015,01,12
35,Business and a real pleasure,"Arguably one of the finest hotels I have had the pleasure to stay in. Rooms were superb, if a little cold in their décor. Superb views along with a terrace to enjoy them by. Staff were excellent, but then I suppose you'd expect that from a six star hotel.",5,2015,01,08
35,Classy hotel and they gave us a discount for...,"I always like a nice welcome drink and the glass of bubbly after a long first day went down a treat.
The staff can not do enough for you - all friendly and helpful. It's all very clean and very business-like. More businessy than coupley I'd say, but still nice and classy none-the-less and it's in a great location.
The open-top tour bus has a stop at the hotel too, which was very handy for nipping into the hotel to put our shopping away and hop straight back on a short while later. The hotel also gave us a €1 euro discount on the bus tours (every little helps).
We did skimp on breakfast as it was €27pppn! (That's going by memory, correct me if it's wrong) So went into town to find something a bit more within our price range.
We were lucky with the weather, for December it was about 10-14C with no rain. Lovely and mild which complimented all of the Christmas lights.
Airport is a taxi ride away - but it is possible to walk to the top end of La Rambla (with intent) to get the airport shuttle bus.",4,2015,01,04
35,Last nights desapoint,"I have a very good time in barcelona I stay on gran marine hotel the staff working durant the day is very nice but my last day on the hotel . 28 of December 14 at 03:30 on morning , your doormen working in night called a taxi  on front your hotel , I first I saw something suspect between your doormen the taxi driver . On  way to the airport the taxi driver is looking very suspicious  and taken all a money with aggressive attitude his looking carried a gun . Because his keeping the hand  holding same thing.  I want you to investigate the doormen, and taxi drive . You regards Mr finn.",1,2014,12,29
35,Excellent choice for our one night pre cruise stay!,We needed a night in an hotel before our cruise in Barcelona.  We had previously visited Barcelona so being close to the cruise terminal was important to us.  We literally walked our luggage about 25 metres to the check in desk.  We were also able to walk to La Ramblas as this was an easy walk of about 10 minutes.  On arrival we were told we had been upgraded and the suite we had was amazing  The views were of the city but also the water.  The amenities in the bathroom are extensive and there is also tea and coffee making facilities which I always appreciate.  I would highly recommend this hotel for a pre-cruise stay.  Check the hotel wed site as they have pre cruise or post cruise offers.,5,2014,12,28
35,GOOD BUSINESS HOTEL,"i had the pleasure of staying at this hotel on a recent business trip and would highly recommend it.
It is very well located, within walking distance of the Ramblas and the large Mall in the harbour area, making numerous restaurants and shops easily accessible.
My room was huge, comfortable and spotlessly clean and my bathroom was not much smaller that the room.  
I would give this hotel 100% for comfort and convenience.

The staff were warm, welcoming and willing to bend over backwards to help.  Nothing was too much trouble for them.

Because of the nature of my business, I was not able to sample the food on offer at the hotel but should imagine that it was in good keeping with the rest of the hotel's standards.

Would I recommend this hotel to the business traveller?  Undoubtedly, yes.",4,2014,12,21
35,Fabulous hotel beautiful location,"Great hotel staff excellent perfect location near the Cruise port.  Hidden local cafes and restaurants behind the hotel with local prices and excellent choices. Handy for the airport, port, las ram las and the tour bus stops right outside the hotel.",5,2014,12,19
35,A lovely spot of luxury on the water,"Though I only spent one night at the Grand Marina, it left a rich experience. Situated at the Moll de Barcelona and a 5 minute walk from the eastern end of the storied La Rambla, the Eurostars property has just about everything you could ask for in a hotel, with a great degree of professionalism apparent throughout. 

The room itself, a fairly spacious corner suite on the second floor, was extremely comfortable and well appointed. Although the view from the room left a bit to be desired (it was the second floor, after all), it wasn't difficult to make a stop on the roof to really breathe in the city and the port at night. 

The front desk and concierge were of great help, providing recommendation for a few restaurants and bars along La Rambla that were in walking distance. Even more helpful was that they accommodated me by speaking English and by tolerating my passable Spanish in return.  

If you have a bit of free time to spend at the hotel, I'd highly recommend taking in their periodic art displays on the second floor. They will typically rotate out art pieces and photography centered on the city of Barcelona on this floor and they will give a different perspective on the city. After that, take a few minutes to relax in their lounge with a glass of cava, taking in some live piano music.

The Grand Marina has a lot to offer and will give you a great experience in Barcelona. Highly recommend.",5,2014,12,13
35,Lovely View of the Water,"I was in Barcelona for a business trip and the meeting was held here. It was clean, the staff was incredibly friendly and I was able to walk to many of the points in Barcelona.  There is a mall with many restaurants within walking distance and there is a beautiful view of both the city and water. I would recommend it to someone wanting a nice, but moderate hotel. PS-The club sandwich in the restaurant was quite good!",4,2014,12,09
35,A nice place to stay ,"Was there a few days ago and was really happy with the location.  It is not too far from airport nor too far from city.
Walkable distance to la Rambla street and plenty of shopping around.  Views from the room can be better (especially since it is located at the marina)..  Very helpful staff as well... The room is quite comfortable buy needs a bit more amenities for the best experience...  ",4,2014,12,06
35,A Wonderful Choice,We couldn't have been more satisfied with this hotel. We were specially pleased that the criticisms aired in Trip Advisor reviews were not our experience. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and pleasant. The location was perfect for a pre cruise stay and touring in Barcelona.,4,2014,12,03
35,"Great hotel, not to pricy",We stayed for eight days and we were received with Champagne. Every night they offered us Cava (Wine). It was a great experience I would recommend to anyone and I would go back. Very fancy and family orientated.,5,2014,11,29
35,Superior Double Room Only (i.e. Standard room),"Booked with Lastminute.com which seemed to have the best room rate (€80 - €100/night). Stayed for 4 nights. 10 - 15 mins walk from La Rambla and the nearest Metro station was Drassanes with entrance/exit at La Rambla.

Room was clean and reasonably spacious. View was satisfactory. Corridor and room décor was indeed 5 star. Linen, toiletries, towels, pillows, bed/mattress met 5 star standard. It was quiet except for one night where I heard couple of slamming doors.

I asked for a bucket of ice but was told it would cost €5 to be delivered to room. Instead I went to get 2 glasses of ice from the restaurant bar on the first floor for free which they were happy to provide. There was no conveniently positioned socket for the kettle that had a short chord. Therefore we had to use the socket next to the bedside table and had to boil water with the kettle on the floor. Low quality and limited supply of coffee and tea. No complimentary bottled still/sparkling water provided. Nevertheless safe to drink from tap. Used glasses and cups were not \washed by housekeeping.

Tried their breakfast for one morning (€20 - €25/person) - I would not recommend it. It felt like something that I would only pay €10/person for. 

Staff are generally friendly and helpful. 

Did not visit the pool or gym therefore cannot comment.

Overall, an average 5 star hotel.",3,2014,11,29
35,lovely Hotel,"close to Marina and to the Rambles street 

nice rooms and huge too. 

nice staff. 

also quit hotel an near to many places. 

i spend me and my wife good time there.

there is a bus that you can do the tour to all Barcelona areas, just next to the main gate of the hotel",5,2014,11,22
35,Staff not interested in correcting big mistake,"Had booked online directly with Eurostars Grand Marina website at 160Euros non-refundable for 1 night prior to a cruise.  Upon checkin I presented my reservation info with Confo No. and price.  The agent then proceeded to charge my CC for 615 Euros and handed it to me for a signature, I refused to sign, as my rate was 160Euros, finally a supervisor was called in and she said it must a system error and when she had time she would take care of it.  She put the paperwork aside and proceeded to check others in, 3 hours later I came back down and insisted that my CC be credited, as while in my room we checked the computer, and yes we had been charge USD $800.00 for our 1 night stay in a basic/no breakfast room.  Needless to say, it had not been credited when we boarded the cruise, but when we returned 2 weeks later, it was taken care of.  However, no apology by the agent.",2,2014,11,18
35,Central and quiet Grand Hotel,"The hotel has a very central position (400mi from the Ramblas). Ask for external suites, since for the internal one there is no view. The staff could be more nice with guests even if a guy of the reception gave us the advice to get arroud in the city with the Vesping service they provide. This was the best we could do. Many thanks Jose! See you next time",5,2014,11,15
35,"Super hotel, pleasantly surprised!","Despite some trepidation was really smitten by the hotel, food, drink, prices and the great staff who tended to our large party with attentiveness and panache second to none. 
Spacious room overlooking the marina and all the necessities one could need furnished with the accommodation. 
7 min stroll to bottom of La Rambla...what else do you need?",4,2014,11,14
35,Perfect night stop ,"We only came for one night but had a lovely stay at this hotel. We stayed in a Premier room which was comfortable and spacious and had the most amazing views over the city. The room was clean, tidy and well equipped. The staff were friendly and very helpful providing us with information on the city and booking a restaurant for us. 
We opted to have breakfast and while there was plenty of choice the hot option was unfortunately decidedly cold! Everything else on offer was very nice though.
I would definitely come and stay again, we loved the location, it is very close to La Rambla and had a bus stop for the tour bus just outside which was perfect! ",5,2014,11,13
35,Not Very Convincing For 5 Stars,"Barcelona is spoilt for quality 5 Star Hotels but unfortunately the Grand Marina is not one of them. It aspires to be something great but just fails to deliver on many levels.

The rooms are comfortable but the little touches you come to expect of a quality hotel are more in line with a premier in. The soap is of poor quality, tea bags nothing special and the towels are hard and appear as though they have had the life laundered out of them.

Not sure what telephones are used for in hotels nowadays - to contact reception, room service or the concierge maybe ? In which case these ones didn't work as I seemed to be kept on line for an age with a tone which sounded as though I was on to a disconnected line.

Buffet breakfast - invented  to allow gauging of food at breakfast time and reduce the need for human interaction - just don't work well in Europe.  The cold food appears warm and the hot food appears cold and there is far too much choice for a meal so early in the day.

But my biggest complaint was in fact the wifi - which I have to say doesn't work well in any Barcelona Hotel I have stayed. In The Grand Marina  it barely has enough strength to receive emails which in this day and age might be deemed unacceptable.",4,2014,11,09
35,Amazing views,"We stayed in a deluxe room, very spacious, xcellent bathroom and separate dressing room, comfortable bed.  Views all over the city and harbour as we were on the 6th floor. The staff were very friendly and helpful.  While they did serve a very good breakfast, the hot food wasn't always hot and their coffee not great. Their location was perfect for us as it was a ten minute walk to La Ramblas and close to everything else,  I would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,11,08
35,Great breakfast and very comfortable rooms,"I really enjoyed the night I spent with my family. Beautiful location on the Marina. Outside the hotel you can rent bicycles and the fantastic electric bike. We spent 8 hours around Barcelona .... Ask the concierge
My room had a nice balcony and breakfast was rich and healthy too.... ",5,2014,11,04
35,Wonderful staff,"We stayed four nights at this great hotel in the end of October.  Good location, close to every thing but quiet. Concierge desk had good recommendations and breakfast buffet is one of the best. 

We opted for a city view room and it was worth the extra cost. 

",5,2014,11,04
35,Well situated for all the sites,"The view of this hotel is amazing with its prominence in the marina, reception is quick and the rooms airy and light as you would expect from this calibre of hotel. The concierge is a wealth of knowledge so take time to visit, if nothing else he made my stay worth a return visit.
The staff are all polite and helpful and are worth a mention as is the Hot chocolate served in the bar lounge, definitly a place to relax from the hussle of La Rambla.",4,2014,11,04
35,Perfect location and accomodation,"We stayed at this hotel for a surprise city break for my boyfriend's 21st.  I chose this hotel because it looked appealing, had great location and had views of the port and the views did not disappoint!!  The hotel is a 15 minutes drive (max) from the airport which cost €25 in a taxi.  The hotel is a bit far from the nightlife and restaurants but is only stone throw away from the hop on hop off bus tour.  Each morning we were able to go up to the 8th floor and see the ships that had docked and look out onto the port to see boats, rowers and yachts.  The rooms were spacious and provided everything that we needed - a hairdryer is included in the bathroom drawer - even though it doesn't say that on the website!  Breakfast was €55 for 2 which we thought was ridiculous so we went to Starbucks instead which was only a 5 minutes walk away. The bed was comfortable and we had a view of the world trade centre.  You could hear the boats at times but it didn't bother us - once the air con was on it distorted the noise.  Staff were very friendly and helpful, they checked up in at 10am instead of 3pm because we had an early flight and they were also happy to book restaurant reservations and provide us with maps and other useful information.  The lobby area was beautiful and live music was available all weekend.  Room service was reasonably priced and very efficient.  Mini bar available but VERY PRICEY so avoid!  fresh towels and new spa treats (shampoo and conditioners etc) every morning; also a choice of pillow shapes and firmness if necessary.  Swimming pool, lots of sunbeds, towels available and huge gym.  Hairdressers and beautician need 24 hours notice if you want to book.  Taxis available from outside where the front of house would help translate where you are going.  Would definitely stay here again, family members have already booked for when they go on their cruise - dock up and stay in the grand marina.  just perfect! thank you.",5,2014,10,30
35,Perfect Hotel,"Me and my wife spend weekend at this hotel. Nice, clean, in front of sea and staffs were very friendly. Good security in place. Highly recommend. Hotel has easy access to all amenities.You can walk to all tourists attractions. You can reach with 10 minutes walk most of the places to visit. Barcelona has lot to offer. Tourist bus hop on and off run from front of hotel. If you got time buy two days tickets so you can get most of it from your visit. Only disappointed was even though I booked with last-minute com and confirmed as well with Bed and Breakfast, it wasn't included. Its very difficult to chase later to find out. Its better you make sure before you pay with all your requirements.",5,2014,10,30
35,disappointing,"booked a suite
problems: sound insulation lacking -- could hear all neighbours' activities; despite the large room and adequate space, only had two uncomfortable chairs to sit on besides bed-- should have had at least one sofa; poor lighting; no ice machine; quality of breakfast not what i would expect from 5 star hotel.
staff were very friendly, in fact, wonderful. location fine. view fine.  clean. service fine.",3,2014,10,29
35,"Good hotel ,not ideal location",The hotel is beautiful but location is  not ideal .It is a bit far from nightlife and restaurants.The room is spacious and clean .The staff is helpful and friendly.The tapas at the lobby restaurant  was very varied and tasty.,4,2014,10,28
35,A long way from the action,"The rooms are OK, nothing special, it is the location of the hotel that is poor. You will need a taxi to get to where all the busy night life is, but if you are going on a cruise ship then it is perfectly placed next to the habour.",4,2014,10,27
35,NOT GREAT.,"Arrived at around 1pm and delighted that our room was ready   635 courtyard view.   The room was perfect great shower, bed and nice decor.  Reception staff were very efficient and our bags were delivered in15 mins.
 However, we were  so let down by the service and food!   No ice machine, asked for ice at the bar, NO phone room service.  Sat and had a drink....later went down for food around 4.30.... Shambles  food cold.   Waited ages, service poor...... We went up to bed as it had been a long day.  Not 5 Star.    I like to pay for good service and a smile.   Not here.   

Just average apart from very nice room, sorry I want the full package.

Will not return.

",3,2014,10,26
35,modern and friendly,"stayed there while attending the Barcelona Intl Boat Show in October. Close to everything and
more. Views are limited, if you have an Inside room, to an inner square with offices etc,etc,
But otherwise a very modern, classy and quiet hotel to rest and conquer the city.",4,2014,10,26
35,Great Hotel excellent staff,"Beautiful Hotel, well located and the highlight is that the staff are very capable and very helpful... you can see that this is a well run hotel from the minute you walk in to the minute you check out - highly recommended",5,2014,10,22
35,Not impressed,Nice big rooms but can be noisy if you are facing the harbor.I would say the hotel is a 5 star place.Average 4 star maybe................................................................................................,3,2014,10,20
35,5 stars!,"Lovely hotel set in the most amazing location. We watched the cruise liners dock from our balcony, very impressive! We also had a fabulous meal in the restaurant. The rooms were very spacious & furnished to a very high standard, the bed (pillows especially) was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Huge bonus that the hotel is also only a few minutes walk to Las Ramblas. ",5,2014,10,18
35,Excellent!,"I stayed here at the beginning of October just for one night before boarding the Liberty of the Seas.  The hotel was perfect, right on the marina, we watched the ships docking in the morning and the Aida Blu docked right outside our window.  The service was excellent, the staff are very attentive and could not have done enough for you.

The breakfast is probably the best you will have in Barcelona, the selection is absolutely amazing with everything you could wish for.  The rooms were very big and the beds were so comfortable.  I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to everybody who would like a relaxing stay i Barcelona.  

It took approximately 15 minutes walk to Las Ramblas, this was a pleasant stroll, if you walk fast paced it would take alot less.",5,2014,10,18
35,Excellent service,all staff provided excellent service. We were lucky in that our room was on the 7th floor overlooking the City. Cruise liners and ferries moored alongside will spoil the view and peace if your room is in the wrong place.,4,2014,10,15
35,"Friendly staff, pleasant stay","Stayed here for two days at a conference, and enjoyed my stay.

The bedroom  was set well back from the corridor (with bathroom and dressing room in between) and the room was silent at night as a result. I had no problem with the wifi (as some people reported). It worked well throughout. I slept well, and the room was comfortable. My only frustration was that I couldn't work out how to turn out the lights with lots of switches, some of which appeared to turn off the plug sockets. I thought it was me, but  my colleague reported following same solution as me - pulling the plugs out after some failed attempts to turn the light out.

The best bit of the hotel was the helpful staff. The worst bit - probably the location which is in the docks (which they try to feature) but I felt cut off from Barcelona proper. The taxis were cheap however, and we always used them, we didn't have time to explore the cable car.",4,2014,10,14
35,Great welcome to Barcelona,"We stayed here for one night before we went on our cruise. The room was a fantastic size and had a beautiful bathroom with whirlpool bath and fantastic walk in shower. 

The staff were friendly and very accommodating. The hotel was clean and very well presented. 

I would definitely stay again thank you to all for making our stay a pleasant one.
",4,2014,10,14
35,Simply Fabulous!,"We visited Barcelona on business a couple of years ago and found this hotel on our travels, having wanted to stay here for some time it lived up to expectations, the staff were amazing, nothing was a problem for them.  Our car had been experiencing some problems but the exceptional valet team seamed to fix the problem. The room was fantastic with great views. Location was perfect near to the bottom of Las Ramblas.
",5,2014,10,11
35,Nice hotel in a beautiful country in the best possible location !!!!,"Nice hotel in a great location surrounded by a sea port in the center of the city, great food, fine and attentive waiters, the room was with a gorgeous panoramic view of the city! Modern design and the hotel and the lobby and rooms, I like the discerning traveler a very pleasant surprise! Well now he was minus one, but significant, we had booked a VIP package which included champagne, snacks, bath accessories in a beautiful package, bathrobe and slippers, but this package was delivered but after the request, only a bathrobe and slippers, and at the end when the final calculation for a room with us wanted to take the second time this VIP package, it would not be a shame if it was brought in full at the beginning, but alas !!! that something like this)",4,2014,10,10
35,Superb hotel and location....,"Just returned from our honeymoon after 4 nights here and it was pretty much faultless in all aspects. We had a fantastic room , with the most glorious of views overlooking the city. I did request this, but they knew about this on arrival so there were no issues whatsoever. We decided not to eat in the hotel, as there really is no need due to the location of the place and in particular to Las Ramblas which is just brilliant if a little pricey. 

The hotel staff were all really attentive, polite and made us feel welcome at all stages of our stay. A small gripe about the Jacuzzi not working all week , but the outdoor pool on the roof of the 8th floor more than made up for this. Absolutely spectacular views from here there are, and the bar next to it compliments it perfectly. 

The Marina next to the hotel is also beautiful, and its fascianting when ships pull in as it is literally right next to the hotel. One morning a cruise ship was docking a few meters from the hotel, a great sight given the size of the ship and not something you see every day at all.

We can not wait to return , hopefully for our first year anniversary next year!.",5,2014,10,06
35,Not a great room,"This looks to be a great hotel, however we were sight seeing for 2 days therefore did not get chance to use the hotel facilities. The reason why I have given only one star is that our room was not a great room. We were upgraded upon arriving, which is always very nice to hear but this was the worst room I've ever stayed in for noise ! The room (345) was part of an adjoining room/suite with just a locked door . There was no sound proofing . We therefore had 2 nights of broken sleeo with cupboards and drawers banging, TV turned on throughout both nights, three way mobile phone conference calls on loud speaker, constant flushing of toilet chain, smoking and loud conversation. Despite a sound proofed panel between our bed and the hallway to the adjoining room there was no difference in this loud noise, it was like the people were in the room with us ! We complained expecting to be moved but upon arriving back the next evening we were informed that nobody had dealt with the matter and nothing could be done. We hoped for a quieter night but the second night was even worse. Upon checking out the next morning we informed reception of how unhappy and tired we were, it seemed that they were used to complaints about this room and reception staff were not bothered, nor did they offer apologies or any sort of discount, this in my opinion is extremely bad customer service. If you stay in this hotel, when booking please make sure your room is not part of an adjoining room as you will have the same problems ! Wifi was hit and miss, kept cutting out in the room and one evening it was lost altogether. Third floor is not great for views, aim higher to benefit from great views. One good thing, the concierge was great, helpful and very polite with regard to booking us restaurants etc.",1,2014,10,05
35,Two nights when we could finally have a good nights' sleep,"My husband and I booked this hotel for a romantic weekend break.  The room was very spacious with incredible sea views.  The standard was very high and we actually contemplated staying in the room although it was both of our first time in Barcelona! The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower and bath were lovely.  The bath had jets- so relaxing.
There was one situation that we could easily overlook, yet gave us an initial scare.  We are guessing (again, this is an assumption) that housekeeping was being tested in our room because there was a very large fake spider on our curtain.  After having lived in Southwest America, seeing a tarantula did not give as big of a scare as it might to someone who is afraid of these creatures and who had not been exposed to them previously!   It was fake nonetheless and either it was used as a testing device, or previous guests had a Halloween party?  Who knows.",5,2014,09,30
35,very comfortable hotel,"twowheeltours stayed at the Grand Marina in August of 2013 - it was a great hotel before we departed on the Haute Route Dolomites cyclosportif. The rooms are very comfortable, clean, the staff is great and are happy to speak English. One of the biggest compliments we can give them is the food, top shelf, pastas, salads all at a very good price. We look forward to staying there again when we are in Barcelona.",4,2014,09,29
35,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed here for 4 nights found hotel lovely and quiet.
Staff were brilliant!!! Ignore other reviews about rude staff! They were attentive and so helpful from reception to bar to maids.
Walk to las rambles is quite a walk in my opinion especially after a few drinks and a meal!
Having a room facing the port can be noisy but with the brilliant air conditioning windows don't need to be open at night. Beds very comfy but change the pillows from the pillow menu as these were much better.
Drinks and food at hotel very expensive, €55 for breakfast for 2 people.
Drinks at bar very expensive! Pool area nice and quiet but pool freezing lol.
Just want to mention Taxis, arriving at airport took taxi to hotel €38 BUT going back only cost€14 be aware they will charge what they like!! 
Overall hotel brilliant but quiet on terrace in evening no atmosphere and bit clinical.",5,2014,09,27
35,American Style Hotel,"Having traveled extensively in Europe, I am accustomed to small rooms and less than luxurious bathrooms. That is not the case with this hotel. 
We had a spacious room with modern conveniences.  We had one minor hiccup because we first booked and then cancelled a car with the concierge for airport transfer. Unfortunately, it was on our bill when we checked out. Our four days there were otherwise uneventful.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a luxury style hotel.",5,2014,09,27
35,"Great hotel, excellent location","Attentive staff on reception more than happy to help, lovely room with enormous bed and great views from the balcony! Lots to see with the ships coming and going but no noise as others have stated, just a short stroll to the central attractions too.
The bar area was lovely and again the staff very good!
The roof top pool looked very inviting and the views from the roof were brilliant-a great city and a excellent hotel for exploring from and to get back to to relax! Thanks for a great weekend",4,2014,09,23
35,Surprising....in a good way,"I was not sure that I had chosen wisely from my colleagues and I when I booked rooms for several nights at the Grand Marina. I was pleasantly surprised. The reception and concierge staff were outstanding (so helpful, excellent English, willing and able to deal with questions and issues), most of the bar staff and waiters good or better. The rooms were of a better than expected size and quality - genuinely very good. My room - a junior suite on Level 7 was outstanding with wonderful views over Barcelona city and over the harbour and sea. Beautiful room, well kept and with plenty of space. Excellent shower and bathroom. My colleagues were also well pleased with their rooms. The roof top terrace was extremely nice (though frustratingly closed for three nights, twice for the weather and once for a private party). The hotel is adjoined to the World Trade Centre. How to improve? Prices were a little exciteable for relatively modest items at the bar and in the restaurant; service in the main lounge was remarkably slow and for the most part with little interest in the guests - going through the motions, and slowly at that. Room service was good in quality but with a very limited variety. 
The location was fantastic - a 15 minute stroll to St Antoni or a 5 minute taxi in Los Ramblas....and the views! However, the hotel really is in amongst the harbour/port and cruise liners do moor right up next to the hotel - someone may mind this, others may be very relaxed about this. I found it really relaxing to be in the quiet and calm whilst watching from my balcony the busy comings and goings of the boats, ships, canoes and people below.",4,2014,09,22
35,Shocking poor customer service,"We are currently on our last night at this hotel And we are shocked by the level of poor customer service. Before I go on to tell you about our experience, I must warn you that if you are looking for a quiet hotel than this hotel is not for you. You have noise coming from the huge boats docking in, Thursday 18th sept night there was a boat party that was so loud that went on until midnight. The worst part though of the hotel is the lack of customer service, all the staff looks so miserable and they seem to be well under staff, one person working on the pool bar during late afternoon busy time. We felt that asking for a drink was like asking for the world. Friday early evening my husband when to fetch a cocktail for us from the 1st floor bar so we could enjoy in our room, he was told no, your not allowed to do this. Then we rang reception who said that we had to order from room service for a fee of 6 euros and it would take at least 15 minutes. What a joke! At 15 euros for one cocktail it seemed like the hotel did not want out custom. The hotel staff seriously need some people skills training and customer service skills training. It doesn't take much to smile. Very disappointed, clearly not a 5 star hotel. ",2,2014,09,20
35,Sea View - Not!!!,"I booked this place at the last minute after arriving in Barcelona to find my booked hotel had cancelled my reservation. Therefore I ended up paying quite a lot of money for the hotel, for 3 nights. I appreciated the fact that I was allocated a harbour view room on the third floor which, for the first night, gave excellent views and comfortable surroundings.

However, on the second day the cruise ship appeared. This moored just a few metres in front of our bedroom window, completely obscuring any sort of view apart from the ship's balconies opposite. If it had quickly moved on, as cruise ships do, this would have been OK. But it didn't. It sat there for the remaining 2 nights of our stay, with engines running noisily.

It was as if someone had instantly erected a block of flats right in front of the window. There was literally no view at all. In addition, the constant noise from the ship's engines made any sort of relaxation, or sleep, impossible.

This aspect of the hotel completely ruined my holiday. Several hundred euros per night for a room with no view at all and no sleep for 2 nights. This is unacceptable. It is certainly not worth five stars. Complaining to reception had no effect apart from a shrug of the shoulders and a 'nothing we can do' attitude.

In short, you are taking a gamble. If you are lucky enough to have an unrestricted view it is OK, if very expensive. However, be aware that you may have a cruise ship appear to shut out the light and keep you awake. No view and no sleep is not a five star experience.

I definitely do not recommend this hotel for this reason.",1,2014,09,19
35,Pleasant stay in Barcelona,"I stayed at the Grand Marina for one night on my way out of a 10 day Barcelona / Catalonia visit.  The hotel is more for conventions and meetings, but I enjoyed it and felt very welcome as a single traveler.  I was upgraded to a Jr. Suite upon reception and offered a free drink coupon.  My room was very comfortable, neat and well appointed.  I ate a late lunch and dinner in the lounge - very tasty and not overly expensive although higher than you would pay eating in central Barcelona.  But my plan was for a quiet evening within the hotel and for that it was very enjoyable.  The Breakfast was huge!  I'd been traveling for a week stopping in small boutique hotels so this large offering was almost overwhelming, but again, the atmosphere was welcoming and the food and service top notch. The staff were very friendly and accommodating.",4,2014,09,16
35,Beautiful Position,"My husband and i have just returned from a four night break in this beautiful city. We found the Hotel, clean, comfortable and quiet. The Hotel had a lovely view overlooking the harbour and at the bottom of the Ramblas.
The Flamenco show at the Palau de la Musica Catalana is a must starring Joaquim Cortez. The theatre was beautiful indeed and Cortez was stunning.
We went to Montserrat which we found rather disappointing, being too commercial. We did not manage to see the Black Madonna as the queue was too long. The cable car up was beautiful.
We also visited the Gaudi house which was so unusual and quirky.
We bought a two day pass on the open top bus, hop on, hop off, anywhere, which was ideal.
It took us all round the city to the Barcelona stadium, the Olympic stadium and many more sites.
The river boat trip is also a must on a balmy evening.
We were there on the festival for the independence of Catalania, which did not affect us, apart from most of the shops being shut. These things happen and we went knowing so couldn't complain.
We only had one room service in the Hotel, rest of the time we ate out. What we did have was extremely edible.
Will we return? you bet, both to the Hotel and the City.",5,2014,09,15
35,Excellent location!,"This Hotel is in a very good location if you intend to visit Las Ramblas or the marina (its very close to the sea), or even if you are going to get a cruise. The staff is very friendly and the rooms spacious enough. Unfortunately, despite the fact that is very close to the sea, no bedrooms with sea view are available. It as an excellent terrace on the last floor, from where you can see all Barcelona.  The swimming pool is very small for an hotel of this size, but with an excellent view. The only step back is the price that you need to pay to stay here. The breakfast are very expensive (27 euros per person) considering the food available is equal to a 4* hotel which is more cheaper",4,2014,09,15
35,Good experience,"We were in Barcelona for a conference and stayed here for 7 nights. Good location in te World Trade Centre with amazing views out side the windows of the ferries to Ibiza and Majorca. Truly majestic. The room was well appointed and the evening turndown service is a nice touch. The toiletries are a bit basic for a 5* hotel. Shampoo and conditioner are combined and dished up in a satchet with a screw cap!

We had a nice balcony and enjoyed the robes, slippers, and all amenities! The hotel is a bit removed from mainstream public transport. But a 12 minute walk to Drassanes train station got one going. What is nice is that it is in walking distance to the Port Vell, the harbour cruises and Mare Magnum shopping center, and the famous Las Ramblas, which is as much a pain after dark as it is a pleasure during the day. The number 20 bus to Passiage de Gracia starts / finishes near the hotel entrance. Taxis are plentiful.  The Teleferic (cable car) from Barceloneta to Montjuic passes above the hotel. Would skip breakfast at the hotel especially if on a longer stay and eat at the cafe's on Paral.lel and other places given the amazing quality and value.

The internet connection is very hit and miss and in about a day it was clear that the free wifi wasnt going to work in my upper floor room with a sea view. This meant long time spent in the business centre trying to catch up with work but the staff, especially the managers Alvert and Sergio, facilitated this process. The staff were all are very warm and friendly and are substantially helpful.",4,2014,09,13
35,Excellent for Business Traveller,"Had a one night stop over in Barcelona with meetings at the World Trade Centre. brilliant hotel with exceptional views over the sea and harbour. Amazingly located for tourists also. My room was outstanding with a working area and guess what, the wi if worked everywhere. The bar in the terrace is a lovely place top sit and relax over a beer. Not cheap but well worth it. Staff and service tremendous.",5,2014,09,13
35,Great location and comfortable hotel for a walking visit in Barcelona,"A really good hotel that is very clean, spacious and surprisingly quiet given it's proximity to the port.
Really enjoyed the stay apart from the poor availability of room extension on departure and the service support that came with that(truly negative)
Otherwise I would recommend it.",4,2014,09,10
35,As always the best!!!! Especially for our cruise!,"Second time around, and as always not to disappoint! We were in Barcelona again a week prior to boarding our 24 day cruise from Barcelona to Venice on the Nieuw Amsterdam Holland America! We know the area well from last time, so again we booked at this hotel. Not disappointed at all. Huge suite with a changing room, a separate area ( room) for our luggage, clothing, and bar with coffee, etc. we had a nice balcony and enjoyed the robes, slippers, and all amenities! What is nice is that it is in walking distance to the harbor , and shopping center, as well as the beginning of the famous Las Ramblas! We took the Blue Bus at the end of the hotel entrance last time (shuttle to the cruise terminal), but this time we took a taxi which really cost nothing! Not a very long trip. Was extremely humid and hot that day. The staff are so warm and friendly, from the moment you arrive you are in a little piece of paradise! They have a wonderful outside balcony that is breath taking and is a complete 360 degree view of all of Barcelona from the cruise docks, to Las Ramblas, to La Famila Sangrada. The gym is wonderful, and they give you fresh towels, water and an amazing view. Breakfast is too die for! Come experience Barcelona and this fine HOTEL!",5,2014,09,09
35,Nice location but disappointing views,"Booked this hotel after much research of Barcelona hotels. Based on location, I thought views would be great - but - there is a building between hotel and sea - something unseen in photos and hotel descriptions. Rooms are clean , breakfasts are good. Gym is sub-par , with aged and sparse equipment. Views from top deck is great. Staff are accommodating",4,2014,09,07
35,Perfect Location For The Start or End of a Cruise,"We collected our cases at the end of our cruise on the Oceania around the Canary Islands and walked the 50 yards to check in at the hotel. Room not ready at 9.30a.m. not surprisingly, the porter took our cases so we could go off sightseeing. The first floor breakfast area with courtyard was delightful, and we could see the cruise ships and ferries moored alongside from yhe stunning rooftop swimming pool and beautiful cafe. The 360degrees view and cooling breeze was delightful too. The room we had on the 6th floor had a balcony as we think had all the other rooms. The hop on hop off bus stops at the end of the treelined drive to the hotel/port. And the ever cheerful hotel concierge was always available calling taxis queuing nearby. The Trade Centre ensures a lively atmosphere.",5,2014,09,03
35,Amazing Hotel,The hotel was Amazing and very nice service. The location was very good. Next time definitely will stay at this hotel. The breakfast and the room was again awesome.  You can walk to Marina and there is a nice shopping mall. U can also reach La Rambla easy by walking.  Or take a boat and have trip. Alot of restaurants and coffee shops you can find in the same area.,5,2014,09,03
35,Great location for cruise passengers,"This hotel is located on a pier right beside the cruise terminal. It is a 5 star hotel according to Priceline. You can expect to pay $250+ a night. 
  The pool is small by North American standards and located on the roof. A bar and the fitness center are also on the roof (8th floor). 
  We asked for a room facing the city but the hotel was full during our stay so we ended up with a room facing the world trade center. Not the best view. 
   The hotel is located one block from the bottom of La Rambla where many restaurants and stores are located. The On -Off tourist bus stop is located on the driveway up to the hotel. 
 All in all it is a nice hotel with rooms that are large by European standards. I would stay here again.",4,2014,09,02
35,Not worth the price,This is a nice hotel but my experience was mixed.     Checking was late afternoon.     Long line and it took forever.    I had requested room on top floor but was told hotel full and the second floor was best I was going to get.    No breakfast included and the breakfast served is amazing but EXPENSIVE.     It's very handy for cruise departures but I have found great hotels just as handy for a much better rate with more included.,4,2014,09,01
35,love this hotel 5x,"we have been staying at this hotel for the last ten years and it feels just as new now after all these years no wear an tear, this is a great couple hotel and we have took our older boys here and they loved it, food is gorgeous, right in the harbor, walking distance to all the shops and restaurants,this hotel is away from all the hustle and bustle,which is what you pay for, waiting staff are very professional and polite, breakfast is top notch, cant wait to go back again.",5,2014,09,01
35,Beautiful Views of Barcelona,"We stayed here at the beginning of August and had a great stay. Found the hotel staff friendly and helpful, rooms were clean, comfortable and the views of the city were gorgeous. Location of the hotel is a pretty easy walk to many shops, restaurants and attractions. Would not hesitate to stay there again.",5,2014,09,01
35,Quality,Beautiful hotel. Excellent check in. Rooms are beautiful and beds are excellent. Pool area lovely and food is excellent. Ate in the restaurant and the staff were wonderful as well as the food. I have nothing but praise for this hotel and their staff and they are definitely going in my notes to stay here again.,5,2014,08,29
35,"Okay, But not the best :)","The lobby was very large BUT empty, it gives you the feeling that they are closing or something. There wasn't any kind of decoration, only two or three wall paintings behind the receptionists, who were polite. The room was large compared to the size of rooms in Europe. Room service was bad ( I asked for cleaning but they didn't ). Breakfast was okay.The worst thing in this hotel was the air conditioning system, they turned it off when the weather became cold outside ( It was february when i was there ), I talked to them, they asked me to open windows to get cold air!!! It was annoying because this hotel was very close to the port. There are other hotels closer to La Rambla than this.",3,2014,08,25
35,Not recommended for the price,"The staff was pretty friendly and helpful, but the main problem was that the entire hotel smelled like smoke. We brought this up immediately upon entering the room, where the staff told us they would call us back to let us know the plan of action. We waited for almost a full hour in the smoke filled room, then were told to leave our room for another hour while they fumigated it. I explained that this likely wouldn't help, because it seemed as though someone was actively smoking, but that was the only solution they gave to us.

We went out to dinner and to check out the city, and when we came back the smell was stronger than ever. We called again, and someone finally came up to check on the room and agreed that yes, it smelled very strongly like smoke. She said she would call all the adjacent rooms and let them know to stop smoking. Meanwhile, we still were in a room full of smoke.

We also did not have any hand soap in the room, and there are no outlets that are easily accessible to charge our phones or computers. I don't know, I guess I just figured for the price these things would be included. I wouldn't really recommend this hotel for anyone actually.",3,2014,08,22
35,Excellant Hotel,"I spent 6 days in this hotel , it was amazing place , very good welcoming , wide quiet room with Balacony , wonderful location with sea view , very good resturant for breakfast with live slow musics it could be little expensive for others , 5 minute walking to Rambla ST or to Maremagnum shoping mall , if i decide to go Barcelona againe sure i will stay again in the same hotel 🌹",5,2014,08,21
35,2 nights in barcelona,"the hotel is nice and with excellent location for beach,shopping,entertainment and crouise line 
small lobby, not many resturants in the hotel but with 5-10 min walk many resturants in the area...very disapponting pool,too small. hotel conceirge was very friendly and helpful.
the size of the room and thr bathrooms was very good",4,2014,08,20
35,Wonderful location but not a 5 stars grand luxe hotel,"I believe that the problem of this hotel is its category 5 stars GL ( grand luxe ) : 5 stars for the location this is sure, simply unbeatable , 5 stars ( absolutely not GL ) for the rooms , 5 stars for the breakfast although VERY expensive at 27 euros , 4 stars for the service I received . GL ? No.
 GL should be reserved to the exceptional world class hotels offering a truly superior and outstanding service in all departments and appointments  and where style is found everywhere.
Before leaving the hotel were I was staying in Costa Brava thqat morning I checked the availability of the Grand Marina and there was availability in different categories and there was availability in different room categories.
 We arrived at 10.30 a.m. not expecting, of course, to have an immediate room availability. I worked my whole life in tourism so I know what to expect. 
I asked for a room with view if possible  (  with 2 beds or king size to make things easier ) and when the room was available and the “Senora” told me to come back at around 12 noon. I come back at 12.30. “We have a room  available now but without a view. If you want a room with a view you have to wait” . I was tired so I accepted. “Sorry Sir, we had a computer problem, no rooms available at this time.”  Ok.  When do you expect to have my room ready ? “No idea,Sir.” At this point I was a little upset but I respectfully asked :  “ Maybe …1 our , or maybe 2 ?  “No idea Sir ”. She never smiled during this…”sad story”.   ( at this point I can say that this  could have been a youth hostel check-in ) .  “Ok, but if I have to wait so long I’d like at least a room with view please (I booked directly on their website and they give a one category upgrade for free). “Ok, Sir” was her reply. 
After around  one and a half  hour  waiting  she finally  called me back . “Your room is ready” (no info from her on what kind of room…)  . When I entered the room, this was  without a view and with other’s luggage inside : this room had already been assigned to someone else... At this point I came back to the “Senora” and complained.  She sent me  a supervisor ( of the same “school” of her colleague…) who, in the grand style of the “Grand luxe ” hotels told me : ”If you have not yet occupied the room please  come down  and I will assign you a room with a view  but  you have to wait a couple of hours ”. Instead, of course, of telling me that we could wait in the assigned room and when the new room was available they would have helped us in changing the room . No apologies at all for other’s luggage found in the room.
IS THIS A GRAND LUXE HOTEL CHECK-IN PROCESS ?   You  judge. 
In the room the kettle was broken and there was only 1 piece of (very small) soap in the bathroom, the soap type provided in 3 stars hotels I believe.
 The toiletries were absolutely standard : in the four star superior hotel we just left in Costa Brava the toiletries were of L’Occitane. I EVEN HAD TO ASK FOR A BATHROBE ! No bathrobes in bathroom when we arrived.
Can a 5 GL category hotel  provide a bathrobe on request only  ?  Ah…the second bathrobe was XS size, good for an extra small lady  and this was certainly not the case : small details, of course, could survive  but are these details that makes an  hotel  building  a 5 stars GL.
They do the turndown service on request only : I called them asking  for the service between 7.30 to 9 pm.:
 “Con mucho gusto (with pleasure) , Senor” . Still waiting for turndown .The day after I called the room service and  explained , in spanish, that I didn’t receive the service. No apologies at all and, of course, no turndown service this second evening too. GL hotel service ? No !  
To be fair I have to say that people serving at breakfast were all VERY  kind and smiling and the same at the swimming  pool’s  bar.  Also the coachmen (super people ! ) and the concierges were very hard working and always smiling !",4,2014,08,20
35,Should not be titled as a 5 star  hotels,"From the moment you enter to this Hotel you know you made the wrong choice! Staff is young, with no experience and no will to help you. We hade to wait 45 min for our room and not even a glass of water was offered even to our children. We had booked a family suite. We were charged a family suite, but stayed in 2 rooms with no connecting door but a connecting entrance. The rooms were dark, small and with a tiny closet for our clothes.When we asked why their is no space for our clothes we received the answer ""this is a city hotel""!!!! Funniest part was we were being charged 100 euro/per day for extra bed and were never informed about it!!!! Room service was slow, 2 hours for a salad, French fries and water. Breakfast is also very expensive, if not included, and service is horrible. Staff only speaks Spanish and you will never get a glass of water unless you ask it ""the Spanish way"" ! By the way better not ask for water, they charge 6 euros for a small bottle. Hotel states they have a swimming pool; don't get excited and bring your pool toys..... It's more of a bath tub than a pool. Food is horrible and staff seems to be ""annoyed"" that people actually choose this hotel and also dare to ask for help touring the city. It is really strange who decided to grade this as a five star hotel. The only good thing about it is the location and nothing else. I would never recommend d this for families, even for business. Waste of our money, wish we had spend it in drinks to forget about this hotel....",1,2014,08,16
35,One of the best,"One of the best hotel in Barcelona , taking into consideration that the hotels there are not very luxury. 

The location is very convenient.  Close to every attractions area .

The breakfast is very good including wide selection of fresh and delicious food.

Swimming pool is small and located at the roof.",4,2014,08,14
35,A wonderful Hotel for a special treat,"We stayed here for 4 nights as a family celebration. Our rooms looked out into Barcelona Harbour, it was a wonderful experience. The bars, terraces and roof top pool was good. This hotel is well placed to access open top buses, which you can get on/off around the city to visit all the places of interest. It is also well placed to explore Las Ramblas and the markets. The breakfasts are excellent and we tended to eat out in local cafes at lunch time and then explored tapas bars and restuarants in the evening. Altogether a very memorable experience. We intend to return.",5,2014,08,14
35,City break,"We booked a two night stay at the Grand Marina; from start to finish it was fantastic. We checked in late Friday night and took a quick look at our fabulous rooms before going to the bar for a drink and a club sandwich each. The sandwich has to be the best I've ever had in my life, and everybody else who has tried the club agrees. We had two rooms booked; one superior and one premier. The superior faced the city and had the better view from the balcony. The premier had a view of the world trade centre, but was a much larger room. The bathroom was huge with a jacuzzi bath and seperate massage shower. The only thing it lacked was fluffy bathrobes, anything else you required could be sent to your room.
Breakfast was simply amazing; fruits, yogurts, jams, cereals, bacon, sausage, all types of eggs, cheese, meats, fish, croissants, etc, etc the selection was huge! All the food was gorgeous, and the service was impeccable. We loved the breakfast even though it cost an extra 87 euros per day.
The hotel is spotless and a beautiful building, the only tiny issue is the roof top pool; it's very small for such an impressive hotel. The staff are friendly and very accommodating wherever you are; the roof top bar, the reception, the 1st floor bar and restaurant, just no matter where you are in the hotel you cannot fault the staff. 
The location of the hotel is good for the city and the beach; all within walking distance. I would love to stay at this hotel again.",5,2014,08,12
35,"Lovely hotel, friendly staff","We stayed here for 3 nights from 6th August 2014. The hotel was clean and the staff were helpful and friendly. We booked one of the smaller rooms, but it was still a good size with a queen size bed. The bathroom had a jacuzzi bath and it was a decent size. We booked the hotel because it has a pool, and although the pool is small it was big enough for what we wanted. There is a roof top pool side bar during the day and in the evenings there is another roof top bar with great views over the harbour and city. Although the bar is expensive it is lovely to visit at least once during your stay. 
The area around the hotel can become busy, it is between two ferry terminals, but to be honest you don't really notice it when you're in side the hotel. We found it quite interesting! If you're looking for a cheap meal it is worth walking over to the shopping centre across the harbour. There are plenty of restaurants, but we found an all you can eat (and drink) buffet that charges €13.50. We thought it was good for the money. 
The hotel is well situated for most of the tourist areas, the Ramblas is a short walk, the beach isn't too far and the tour bus stops outside the hotel. 
We'd go back if we were to visit Barcelona again.",5,2014,08,12
35,Grand indeed and perfectly located,"Have visited Barca a number of times and have always gazed over at the building where the ferries dock which is actually the World Trade Center but also the Grand Marina Hotel. We hadnt planned to be in Barcelona but our Summer plans unexpectantly changed and hence we booked some last minute flights and this hotel. We weren't disappointed. The Grand Marina is 5 star and lives up to it's official rating. We had a family room from three that was spacious, great bathroom with whirlpool bath and a water jet shower, balcony, free wifi, multi channel tv, safe and great air con. Hotel is of modern decor with a lobby and terrace bar (we were offered welcome drinks in both), a large breakfast area with a fantastic range of food and drinks plus a glass of cava with your brekkie - nice! Roof top area has a small but ok pool - the same with many Barca hotels and a number of sun loungers which we used plus a very well equipped gym. We spent 4 nights relaxing and whilst we visited a few locations it was really an opportunity to unwind. Would stay here again.",5,2014,08,11
35,Nice Hotel Near the Waterfront,"We stayed at the Grand Marina a few weeks ago.  It is a modern hotel with many amenities.  There are two restaurants, a gym, a small rooftop pool, and a number of rooms that overlook the sea.  We stayed in a one bedroom suite, and it was large and well appointed.  It had a full bath, half bath, living room, bedroom, and additional sitting area.  The rainforest head shower was wonderful, and there was a large soaking tub too.  The room was quiet and overlooked a large courtyard area.

We had tapas and drinks in the first floor restaurant, and the food was very good.  The next morning we ate the buffet breakfast.  It had a nice assortment of baked goods, egg dishes, yogurt, cheese, meat, and cereal.  I thought breakfast was a bit overpriced, but everything tasted great.

I didn't love the hotel's location because it was a long walk to get anywhere.  We stayed downtown during another visit to Barcelona, and that was more convenient overall.",4,2014,08,10
35,OUTSTANDING,"Arrived for one night on return from Mallorca with a total of 10 family members. Reception was brilliant with upgrades to 5 suites, just amazing, rooms beautifully appointed. Location was great with views over the harbour and only a short walk to La Rambla. Small rooftop pool and bar area. Dinner in hotel was average and expensive however wait staff were excellent. Jean the doorman from Cameroon was fantastic from arrival to departure. Would definitely stay again.",5,2014,08,08
35,A fine place to stay,"This hotel is approximately 20 minutes by cab ( 25 euros) from the airport and occupies a commanding view over the harbour.Walking distance to the Highlights or lowlights of Barcelona, whichever way you view the City. we had a 4 night break. The Hotel was very clean and the staff were attentive and professional however it seemed to lack any emotion, feeling as if it were more suited to the business traveller rather than a tourist. Room was of an average size with a view over the conference centre at the rear which was a little disappointing considering the cost.Ask for a sea view.The fascilities in the room were good, having an easy to use safe, quality TV, nicely appointed with nice bed linen and towels and very good Aircon .Bathroom was a decent size but a little tired.A good Hotel to stay away from the marauding Tourists on Las Ramblas but close enough to be convenient.Don't stay here if you are less mobile and intend to walk into the city, it's a lovely walk but a bit of a trek, take comfy walking shoes.Loads to see just watch your valuables,  we saw a large Police presence every day in every street however we were still aware of people being mugged and or ripped off in broad daylight with the police in Hot pursuit,Starsky and Hutch style.This hotel is Probably the best Hotel I saw in Barcelona, with others being in the heart of the City and VERY busy.If you stay here take the opportunity to go to the roof top terrace at night for some spectacular views over the city and if you are walking take in the old castle near to the Hotel.Bar very expensive,24 Euros for two Gin and Tonics. In conclusion , a very nice expensive Hotel, in a nice spot, not far from the excellent airport but in my view more suited to business clients with an expense account.We didn't try the restaurant.Woud I stay here again.....Yes, but I don't think I'll be going back to Barcelona in a Hurry.",4,2014,08,07
35,A nudge in the right direction and this could be a great hotel,"Brilliant location with walking distance to the Port Vell marina and Las Ramblas.  My room was very spacious with a separate dressing room and bathroom.  Lots of Japanese style sliding doors or screens to break up the accommodation.  A really great breakfast buffet, fabulous waiting staff who make  a mean gin and tonic.   Lunch and dinner were ok but not inspiring and their wine selection was woeful.  This is the area they could really sort out but they have their hands full with so many excellent restaurants nearby...come on!!  Definitely not 5 star but close.",4,2014,08,05
35,"Great location, great hotel","My wife and I stayed for 8 nights the last week of July 2014.  I had booked my flight and this hotel with booking.com from Dubai, as we decided to travel 2 days before...flights were tight and there was no time to ponder choices.  Have to say we were pleasantly surprised.  First 3 nights, we did have a room facing thre convention centre courtyard, in other words no view, but we were persistent in asking for a room with a view.  $th day we received a room facing the Columbus statue, great city and water view.  I added breakfast and superior room upgrade on my package...was I think about $55 per night...well worth it in my opinion.  The room was a good size with narrow balcony, breakfast is simply great...superb selection of anything you could want.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again, as it ot a close walk to Rambalas, has plenty of taxis, hop on hop off stops 50m away from the front door....beds comfortable, AC  cold...could have used a few more English language tv channels.  4.5 star in my opinion, would definitely stay there again if visiting Barcelona.  I don't know why people complained about the ferry boat noise...yes they came and went daily...could throw a ball onto the decks, but the noise was really not bad at all...in fact when the engines would rev up, you knew they were leaving port and it was fun to watch the huge ships slip away.",5,2014,08,05
35,Grand Marina Barcelona,"We had a delightful stay at the Grand Marina. Barcelona is such a charming city. The Grand Marina is located close to many of the major attractions, restaurants etc. The staff was very professional and attentive. The room was fantastic and the beds comfy. There is a small commercial center attached to the hotel with pharmacy, cafeteria, gifts etc that is not part of the hotel. I recommend it.",4,2014,08,05
35,Great location!,"We were taking a cruise from Barcelona so this is one of the closest hotel to the port.  It was also in a great location for tourists wanting to see Barcelona. Las Rambles, the harbour with shopping and restaurants and the hop on hop off busses all very nearby within walking distances. The hotel accommodations are definitely 5 star however service is very slow.   We arrived quite exhausted from our transatlantic flight and had to wait 3-4 hours for our room. It also took forever to check in; still not sure why! We went to get a bite to eat at their outdoor terrace restaurant and also very slow service!  And be careful when booking this hotel online; the descriptions are not exactly accurate.",4,2014,08,05
35,Great luxury hotel 5 mins walk to La Rambla ,Spending 4 days in Barcelona at this hotel . Location is 5 -7 min walk to La Rambla or closest Metro. Hotel is located on the Port with liners docking at its door . Thought initially about staying closer to La Rambla or the city centre which is a far busier and nosier location than this peaceful little enclave ,4,2014,08,01
35,Rubbish ... this doesnt deserve to be a STARred hotel,"I had aweful 2 nights stay at this hotel in May. 

- Service was rubbish
- Staff wasnt welcoming. 
- tiny swimming pool.
- The bar near swimming pool is hardly tended and the service was poor and slow.
- Food wasnt great

Just to note one incidence: 
The bath literally burst from bottom (somwhere down there)  in the middle of the night - 1 am it was ( yes, I have a knack of having a good bath at night) when it was half filled. We had water all over the place. Th staff offered a replacement room. The staff was very rude and maybe was not happy that we asked for them at 1 am. We had to call the reception and had to ask for the manager in charge.

Dont go here.",1,2014,08,01
35,Great location,"I have stayed in this hotel many times, and have found the staff very helpful, the location great.
The hop on hop off bus is almost at the front door. The rooms are very nice clean . Great if you are going on a cruise the cruise port is right next door. Las Ramblas is close by , walking distance 
lots of great places to eat up and down La Rambles Find a local spot and have the seafood piaya and a glass of wine. Would Stay here again, well I'm staying there again this October 2014.",5,2014,07,31
35,We love Barcelona and loved this hotel!,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights prior to our Cruise took off and 1 more night after we came back from the cruise.  We loved it there and here are the reasons why we loved it:
1) Hotel staff is friendly and helpful.  Some speak English better than others but everyone speaks good enough English.  
2) The room was clean, stylish decor, great master bathroom with full of amenities.  We had the Barcelona city view and it was beautiful. 
3) The rooftop pool, jacuzzi, gym and cafe was fabulous!  The view from the roof was amazing!
4) Location of this hotel is great.  Walking distance from the popular shopping/restaurant area (Las Ramblas), shopping mall, Columbus Circle, tour bus stop but not noisy or busy at all.  You'll have restful nights there.  
5) Restaurant on the 2nd floor was decent but I enjoyed dining out, of course. 
6) You can watch ferries and cruise ships come and go from your room.",4,2014,07,31
35,Great visit,"Had a gorgeous 5 days here
Lovely upgraded room
Clean and comfortable 
Great air conditioning
Pool clean and compact - only downside was repetitive same cd every day and very expensive bar
Concierge were the best I've ever know and booked every resturant catered for my gluten free needs 

Staff amazing 
Location lovely far away from Los ramblas as night and easy walk to marina",5,2014,07,30
35,"Excellent staff, wonderful atmosphere","We had originally booked into another hotel which was way below standard.  We arrived in reception to ask if they would have a room for one night.  Traveling with two children and not having a place to stay could have been very stressful but the staff were so pleasant and so accommodating. They put us in a wonderful room, with a great view. Thank you - definitely going back!",5,2014,07,30
35,Room With A View!,"I recently stayed at the Eurostars Grand Marina hotel for five nights in July 2014, and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The staff were pleasant and helpful, after arriving considerably earlier than the designated check-in time, we were found rooms immediately. We were given a room on the seventh floor with stunning views of the harbour. Although earlier posts note the noise, we did not have any problems with the noise from the harbour, and even still, it's not very often you get to view a Naval Ship right outside your window! We spent many a night gazing out of the window watching the goings-on on board the ship. Watching the ship leave, with all the crew lining the ship, saluting away was a truly goosebump experience. Asides from the stunning views, the hotel and the rooms were lovely, and were kept especially clean. I would definitely recommend staying here. The only downside however is the breakfast, it was far too expensive, and considering the price of the hotel, it should have been included, or at least cheaper!",5,2014,07,30
35,The Team,"Having a fantastic time here, great hotel. Excellent service rooms are very good all with a/c the views across the city are awesome, food is splendid. Reception are very helpful as well a great hotel with a pool on top floor, take a dip and chill out",5,2014,07,29
35,Very big rooms but overpriced,"The location is very good. The rooms are huge. Unfortunately we got a room facing the inner courtyard, so no nice views; on the contrary, the rooms with views must be pretty noisy because the hotel is in the middle of the harbour. The swimming pool offers nice views but is very disappointing (tiny). Breakfast is very good. Staff is young and enthusiastic but needs professional training.",4,2014,07,29
35,DANGER!!!  UNWANTED VISITOR AT 3AM - ROOM SERVICE WAITER HAD A KEY TO MY ROOM,"I believe i was identified by staff as a target for sexual assault, and the predator given my room information,  as i came into the hotel at 11PM  after a tapa tour a little tipsy and alone. DO NOT STAY HERE if you are a woman traveling Alone!!!  At 3 am while sleep in my room a man knocked repeatedly at my door,  when he did not stop,  i shouted through the door go away in english and spanish, he then used his employee key card and tried to enter my room!   He was a room service employee so he has a key card to every room in the hotel!!!  The bolt was locked so he could not get in luckily.   The explanation the ""5star"" hotel told was that he made a mistake in the room number so i asked about controls and if i could order room service to any room, the general manager said it has never happened before, because they have controls they use to ensure room service is delivered to the correct hotel room, one control is the computer prints out room number when ordering, when i said well why did this happen last night, response by the general manager oh employee didnt look at the print out, so even if that was the case and it was a mistaken room, it does not explain, what happened next , when i heard the knocking at my door repeatedly, I shouted through the door at 3am to go away you have the wrong room, the employee clearly knew a woman was alone in the room.   At which point he used an employee key card to try and open my door!!!  Clearly I did not order the food because there is a printed bill on the tray, clearly i wasn't going to open the door, clearly i was alone in the room, and clearly he forcibly tried to enter my room without consent. Wrong # room service does not happen in 5 star hotels but sexual predators with access cards to every room does.   WARNING to WOMEN ...YOU ARE IN DANGER if you are a woman traveling alone at this hotel.  A simple human mistake of the room service person, is not at all logical, when clearly i did not order room service based on the printed ticket,  the stories of how he misunderstood the room number and controls also changed with each manager, however,  the most disturbing part, after being told to go away, employee tried to use a key card to access a woman's  room who told him to go away, when I asked why did he try to enter my room with the card, the general managers response... we do not have a security problem here, we already apologized and the 6'4 300lb general manager became aggressive to a woman who have just been the victim of an attempted forced entry for which you can only assume would result in sexual assault. .   NEVER STAY HERE and if this has happened to you please report it to the US Embassy, they may be selling information or room keys of women traveling by themselves to staff or others, this happens in Asia, just didn't know my personal safety was in jeopardy in Barcelona at this hotel!!   NEVER STAY HERE!!!!!",1,2014,07,28
35,Overpriced and Isolated,"Eurostars Grand Marina is rated as a 5 star hotel and you'll pay the cost associated with that rating, but consider this:  I'm writing this largely negative review from the business center computer in the 1st floor lobby because only half of my room gets a wi-fi connection and the signal quality is poor.

Pros:  
1. Beautiful views of the marina and city from the balcony.
2. The City Suite is comfortable and the bathroom has a jacuzzi tub.

Cons:  
1. Overpriced
2. Room service was expensive...and awful.  I'm going to detail this one because it really put the exclamation point on my experience at the Eurostar Grand Marina.

We ordered a caesar salad and the lettuce was old and weird.  We got penne with bolognaise sauce and it tasted like the pasta I made in my freshman college dorm topped with just a dash of bottled Prego.  The pizza lacked sauce and cheese...which is basically the only way you can screw up pizza.  I knew what I was getting in to when I opted to pay an exorbitant price for room service, but from a ""5 star hotel"" I had assumed that I'd least get some good food.  This was some microwave-ready, college dorm prepared, tasteless garbage.  It was the most expensive meal of our entire stay in Barcelona.

3. The outdoor pool is small and dissapointing
4. Guest Service is slow.  For whatever reason, it took about 20 minutes to check in.  One night we needed a bottle opener to crack open some Estrellas.  It took 45 minutes and two phone calls for someone to bring one up.  
5. Wi-Fi only worked on half of our city suite and the signal we did get was poor.  Like, AOL you've got mail 56k dial-up poor.
6. Bad Location.  I'm going to detail this one as well because this may cause controversy as others are very satisfied with the location.

If your intention in Barcelona is to lay out in the sun on a crowded balcony with a great view of the city in the distance, then by all means, this is your spot.  But if you actually want to visit the sights and journey the streets of Barcelona, you're in for a massive walk.  The hotel is situated across from a major tourist square where Las Ramblas hits the ports.  While this is a nice area to see and pass through, you wouldn't want this spot to be your base of operation for an entire vacation.  You'll get ripped off by tourist traps left and right.  If you're staying at Eurostars in the summer, like we are, you'll hike across a massive expanse of nothingness in the blistering heat for ~10 minutes just to get to Las Ramblas and from there the real journey through the Barri Gotic begins.  Do you want to hop out and get a bottle of water without being ripped off by minibar prices?  It's a 10 minute walk to the nearest supermercat and you'll still get ripped off in tourist trap hell.  Avoid the swarms and stay in beautiful L'Eixample.  That's where you'd want to go to get the best food anyway.

The cons outweigh the pros at the Eurostars Grand Marina and unless you're wealthy enough to throw good money at a subpar hotel experience, I highly suggest looking elsewhere.",2,2014,07,28
35,Details,"Great location but For a 5 start hotel, it lacks. Not even a small bottle of water in the room as complimentary. The hotel needs to be more customer oriented. 
I will use it again however due to the location.
      
      ",4,2014,07,28
35,Beautiful but expensive,"Have been to Barcelona before but this was the first time we stayed in an hotel by the marina. Beautiful location. Loved watching the ships and cruise liners sail past. La Rambla is only 10/15 minute walk, although it seemed a little drab compared to our last visit 10 years ago. We opted out of breakfast - 27 euros too expensive! A cup of coffee in the outside terrace cost 5 euros. The swimming pool, although lovely up on the roof terrace, was quite small and if you didn't get up early and put your towel, book etc on a sunbed you had no chance later on. Our room was gorgeous and big. En suite great. Lots of beautiful free toiletries and slippers. Great view. This hotel is in a good location for the town, beach and of course walking around the marina.",4,2014,07,27
35,Superb view of the harbor,"Eurostars Grand marina could be categorized as a business hotel , although it is very elegant and chic in some ways . The reception and greetings were very polite and helpful and they upgraded us to a room with a superb view without even mentioning it . Our room was huge , clean with the best view of Barcelona , facing the harbor , with views of the city and the mountains . The location is really close to the Ramblas , a 10 min walk at most and its also close to a cable car that takes you to mountjunic . I would certainly like to go back and recommend this hotel to everyone.
P.S. the concierge were very helpful and kind .",5,2014,07,25
35,"Good location, big room","I was on a business trip with two colleagues. We had all similar rooms but mine was bigger than the two others. There was a corridor leading from the door to bed room and along it was the bathroom and a walk-in closet type space. The bed room was average size. There were small scrathes in the walls and some bathroom tiles were broken. Otherwise the room was in good shape and clean. I had a view to the inner court yard of the hotel, so I guess you need to pay extra for the sea view. The breakfast was expensive but worth of the money, in my opinion.",4,2014,07,24
35,Absoutelly amazing!,"We had such a wonderful time, the location is excellent, the staff are brilliant and the facilities are excellent!

Walking distance to lots of great attractions (Picasso Museum in particular is excellent) and fairly easy to get to the beach.

Would definitely reccommend!",5,2014,07,22
35,Great location - lovely rooms,"We had a fabulous evening at the Eurostars Grand Marina the evening before a cruise. The hotel is really lovely and in a great location just steps away from the marina, Ramblas and the Cruise port.

The only issue we had was some very loud music coming from one of the nearby boats at around 0530 - but that's not really the hotel's fault.",5,2014,07,21
35,Great Location for Cruise Ships!,"We recently took a cruise from Barcelona to Rome and stayed one night in this very nice hotel -- five-star service from check-in to check-out. The rooms were large and modern. Every single staff member that we came in contact with was just wonderfully helpful. On the morning of check-out, we enjoyed a full buffet breakfast that had everything from fresh fruit to eggs and all the trimmings! Sadly there was a taxi strike that day but within five minutes the concierge arranged a private car that was just a bit expensive. You can take a bus by walking to the end of the hotel's long driveway and I believe that the cost is only EUR 3 per person. Love this hotel and would highly recommend!",5,2014,07,18
35,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel is simply a must if you wish to experience excellent service. The exquisite cuisine was only complimented by the wonderful attentiveness of the hotel staff, something other hotels could learn from. I would certainly recommend this hotel for excellent service ad attention to detail.",5,2014,07,16
35,Great Times,"Visited a while ago and booked on a late rooms website, great deal was had and this hotel was fantastic. Concierge were very friendly and knowledgeable. Had a great long weekend. Will definitely return. Fantastic marina. Great food, drinks and service. Barcelona is a lovely city, just sad that I couldn't have stayed longer.",5,2014,07,11
35,Highly recommended,Very good 5 star hotel with helpful staff that speak good English.  Located a few minutes from La Rambla so closest enough to the action but far enough away not to disturb.  Everything in easy reach.  Would happily stay again.,4,2014,07,08
35,Let down,"Stayed in this Hotel 2008, fantastic service,wich Lexus to return 2nd July 2014, this time service is terrible, the hotel is only now interested in corporate functions, to give you a flavour of poor service
.no bath robes, not aproblem you would think when you ask the housekeeper for robes and iron.
It turns out a problem when 24 hours later you have to ask again.
Room service, although I didn't order food or drinks,just a bag of ice for a swollen foot waited 1 hour for this, then tried to contact reception,THE PHONE DOESNT WORK,my husband walked down to reception 50 minutes ago to chase the ordered ice.It has not arrived.
Hoping the breakfast tables are laid out correctly tomorrow, so I dot have to search for salt and pepper,The list is endless, the bar staff and concierge are too good for the manager of this hotel.",2,2014,07,04
35,Luxury,the hotel has everything to offer if you are looking for luxury.  The breakfast buffet was good with a variety of choices.  I had couple drinks at the lobby bar wich was good as well. The rooms has no good view.,4,2014,07,03
35,"Good location, great views","This hotel is right in the marina/harbour area of the city, so if you prefer to get away from the city centre, it's a great location. You can walk straight up to Las Ramblas in just 5 minutes. The hotel was under construction when we stayed there, but disruption was minimal. 

You can walk to the beach area and there are plenty of restaurants to choose from. 

The room was very stylish and we had a pretty view of the marina. Room service is expensive but delicious....",4,2014,07,01
35,"Perfect location, awesome breakfast, rooftop pool","The hotel was fab. I have to start with the fact that architecturally it is really interesting, because it is at the marina where a lot of cruise ships and large boats come around and the hotel actually looks like a cruise ship, which is really cool. Breakfast was one of the best I've ever had, the rooftop pool, albeit small is really amazing because of the view. Staff was very kind and helpful. Location is perfect, just by the bottom of the Ramblas. Overall a very positive experience.",5,2014,06,18
35,Perfect,"Perfect location, perfect rooms and amazing breakfast. Will come back for sure. It's of course not the cheapest one you can get around Barcelona but it was really worth it.............................",5,2014,06,16
35,Private Terrace Took All The Credits!,"I spent couples of days here with my Family this May.
Staff, valét, bartender, definitely on the level of a 5* Hotel.

We had the suite on the top of the Hotel with a private terrace more than 100 sq meters, with amazing view of the city...it's the choice to make in the Hotel, u wouldnt want to leave the place.

Only downsize I could say is that the huge terrace doesnt have a jacuzzi.",5,2014,06,15
35,Proffessional and friendly,"Service is definitely on the level of five stars and location is excellent. Just if you have visiting friends with Catalonian identity or communicate in Catalonian, you may get unpolite reaction of staff and that is nonprofessional.",5,2014,06,11
35,city break,"arrived at approx 11am-your room will not be ready until 2pm i think it was...ok we will toodle ooff and look around....came back at 3pm - still not ready....have a complimentary drink on us. come back in 20 mins....came back at 4pm...still not ready....you have a wonderful room....yeah i know i bloody paid for it....we got 2 complimentary drinks whilst we was waiting, at last 5pm our room is ready. What a fab room it was....no complaints. hotel staff friendly and helpful.....very expensive drinks and food....walk 5-10 mins up the road to la ramblas.....go off to the right for glorious restaurants and squares...we got wrecked one day going in and out of bars.....loved it. get a two day ticket for bus tour....great....we went on the fenicula...and also got a cable car on the montijuc.....we loved our time in Barcelona....what a city...Doorman taught me basic spanish. so friendly....only complaint about the hotel was noise from above and next door, luckily enough we were leaving after they checked in....you could here the girl above clomping around in her heels at 2am....and next door very noisy into the early hours....my only complaint....e-mail any ?'s..",4,2014,06,10
35,Fantastic view,"I spent 3 days in Barcelona. It was a business trip, but my wife went with me. We decided staying at Eurostars Gran Marina because its location. The service was very good. Excelent breakfast. It's a good value for either a business traveller or leisure traveller.",4,2014,06,10
35,Enjoyable stay,"On arrival our first thought was business hotel and not very attractive. Once inside we found the staff were really nice and helpful. It was a pleasant surprise to be upgraded to a very large room with views over the harbour and city. For us it had everything we needed, but others may need to be closer to all the action. Las Ramblas is only a 10 minute walk away. The rooms were very clean and well stocked. If you enjoy a huge breakfast this is the place, it had everything, even included wine! Check if breakfast is included in your room rate. Over all we had a very pleasant week and would return, especially if we were taking a cruise or ferryboat as this is a great location.",4,2014,06,10
35,"Very nice hotel, but check your bill!","This hotel is a five star, and the rooms and extra's are five star. I booked through the hotels website and got a free upgrade, the first time to a city suite, and the second to a premier room. The rooms are spacious, with a number of little extras, such as a whirlpool bath, and a good selection of toiletries. The hotel is away from the foray of Las Ramblas, but close enough to be in the mix within five minutes. Dome would feel being stuck between the cruise liner terminals a bit industrial, but I found it quite interesting. A note that should you be looking out to the world trade centre make sure you are properly attired when opening your curtains in the morning, as the office workers may get more of a vista than they bargained for.

I found the breakfast excellent, a good selection, and it past the scrambled egg test, as in it was fresh and not grey. 

Finally, the only negative is if you are booking through the web site, book all rooms individually, as it does not recognise the promotion for subsequent rooms. To this end you could be presented with a larger bill than expected. However once the hotel saw the original confirmation, they did reduce it to what it should have been.

Enjoy Barcelona",4,2014,06,09
35,Only for business,"I have been in this hotel for business purposes.  So I am glad that we haven't chosen this hotel for holiday. It doesn't fit in the history of Barcelona. 
Apart from that food was OK. Nothing very special about. Rooms are good. People are helpful as in any hotel with this price.
But no matter where we stay.. Barcelona is a wonderful city.",3,2014,06,05
35,Ugly boring business hotel surrounded by equally ugly marina,"I have stayed in hundreds of hotels around the world, most of them 4 or 5 stars, i booked this one for my 40th birth day on Hotwire thinking i would get the W hotel nearby at a discount, to my huge disappointment i got this boring huge business hotel instead. Nothing about this place is 5 stars. 

The hotel is basically a big conference center surrounded by the main port and marina of Barcelona, so there is no good view from any room, the beach is not visible either, the pool is very small, the jacuzzi did not work, and it takes about 15 min to get to  Las Ramblas by foot, 30 mins to Barceloneta. They do have lots of bikes outside that only locals can use, what a joke...

On the bright side the rooms are nice, some even have small balconies, the internet is free, and the gym is basic but complete enough for a good work out. The service is good to, they upgraded me but a bigger room does not make up for the lack of beauty of the place. 

This place feels empty and cold even when it is full, and the scenery around is not at all a memory one should keep of this great city, one i consider to be the best in the world to vacation in. 

Stay away and book elsewhere cheaper instead, I stayed in much nicer and much cheaper places in Barcelona before, and i sincerly regret booking this hotel...

Great for one night IF and only IF your going on a cruise he next day, for convenience.",2,2014,06,04
35,Superb hotel with excellent service,"We have stayed in this hotel before in the past (approx. 6 years ago), and had a great time so we booked this hotel again for a four day stay, but this time with an 11 month old daughter.

The hotel staff were extremely friendly as soon as we turned up and really helped us settle in.  We were upgraded to a city suite room free of charge without even requesting this which was a massive bonus.  The room was huge and provided plenty of space for our daughter to crawl around and have fun.  The views from our room were great and they are even more spectacular from the roof terrace.

Staff were also great at helping us identify baby friendly activities around Barcelona which really helped with our planning.  Everytime a staff member would see my daughter, they would always make her smile and giggle - she absolutely loved her time in the hotel.

The breakfast is quite expensive so try to get this included in your package when booking.  Apart from that, a truly outstanding hotel and one that we will book again on our next visit to Barcelona!",5,2014,06,03
35,A pre-cruise stay ,"The hotel is centrally located and closest to the cruise terminals.

The accommodation is probably in the high end of four stars and the staff are friendly. 

They could probably do with a few more staff at breakfast and concierge to keep things moving quickly but you can't really complain about this place. Breakfast is actually very good for Europe and there was even a violinist playing whilst you ate.

The rooms are modern but on the smallish size for deluxe. 

Even if your cruise ship isn't docked right outside, within a two minute walk you'll find blue buses that go where the mega ships dock. The bus costs two Euros.

",4,2014,06,01
35,Lovely hotel,"Just spent three nights at this hotel, amazing hotel, fabulous views. I had arranged a surprise for my gf with flowers on the bed and a bouquet, it was wonderful the staff arranged this for me, we got a sea view on the 7th floor it was amazing . Friendly staff , very attentive . Great hotel",5,2014,05,30
35,"Modern, Miminalistic Elegance","My review of this hotel is based on my own experience of staying there.  The room was spectacular and one of the nicest I've stayed in over my many years of travel.  Modern, minimalistic, but warm and extremely spacious.  Breakfast was sumptuous and the hotel staff extremely helpful.

I feel the need to mention that my sister stayed there (for the third time) subsequent to our visit above, and had just the opposite experience, with ragged furniture in the room, deterioration of service and food quality, so much so, she will not stay there again.  It's unfortunate, and I hope they have fixed the issues she encountered.",4,2014,05,28
35,Fantastic Hotel,"Fantastic hotel, lovely friendly staff. The hotel is immaculate, very nicely located to all the tourist attractions, breakfast was the best ive ever come across, a man playing a harp in the marning, simply beatiful although drinks were a little overpriced. Would love to go back there again.",5,2014,05,27
35,Not a good experience ...,"Stayed here for 3 nights over the May Bank Holiday and didn't have a particularly good experience. The hotel has no real character and is lifeless - more suited to corporate than tourists. Some things to comment on for what was billed as 5* - had to ask for tea and coffee/milk every day, it was not replaced by the maid service and the milk was powdered !!. Breakfast is 25 Euros each, per day. Not a concern on a corporate but as a couple bit too steep. Toiletries same as tea/coffee - not replaced each day and if you ask for replacements don't expect a friendly response from the reception staff - bit too much trouble for them. If you get a side room expect a ship to dock and the constant noise that goes with a ships' generator running all day/night as well as regular tanoy announcements.  Oh, and don't be fooled by the picture of the pool it's more of a plunge pool than a swimming pool. The jacuzzi remained empty of water all weekend. On the plus side rooms were ok and concierge staff couldn't do enough to help.",2,2014,05,26
35,Just a business hotel,"The hotel is situated within the World Trade Center that makes it convenient for large seminar as you have all the facilities I would not recommend it for holiday makers 

I got a room in length without balcony and no view room 737 quite depressing make sure you have a room with balcony",4,2014,05,25
35,Exceptional Service,"Stay for 1 week for a conference. I have stayed at many hotels so I have seen both good and bad, Here the service from ALL the hotel staff was exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was great. Lunch was buffet style for our group and was good. (Maybe a little more variety for the week) bar food was very good. Great location, 5 min walk from Les Rambles.",4,2014,05,24
35,Good location and service,"I would recommend this hotel based on the location, the friendly service from all the staff as well as the good quality of the breakfast. The terrasse for the breakfast is great! I don't think it is really a 5 star hotel. We benefited from an offer which made is affordable. I would not pay the usual price for this hotel although I have no complaint. The only down side was the big cruise boats arriving early and staying all day long blocking the entire sea view and making noise until late at night. To consider if you like having long night of sleep!",4,2014,05,19
35,Perfect,"Stayed here last august and had such a relaxing 4 days, staff and hotel where amazing and I m lucky enough to going back on Thursday for a further 3 days , can't wait!
Especially looking forward to chilling out at the super roof top terrace area 

",5,2014,05,18
35,Sleep on the sea,"You will feel like travelling on a mediterranean cruise ship, and not only because those ships are docking right near the hotel :)
It is one of the best places in BCN, in the port area right on the sea, in the building of the  WORLD TRADE CENTER, a few steps from the Columbus monument and the Rambla. 
Spacious rooms and areas, real luxury, one of the greatest breakfast I've seen in a hotel (everything, really everything from salmon to champagne).
Morning view from the upper rooms is really astonishing over the whole Barcelona, although the building of a cable tower right in front of the hotel decreased the value of this real unique feature from some rooms.
Interior design is very stylish and modern.",5,2014,05,16
35,Fantastic,"Staying in this hotel made our whole trip worth while, we booked with late rooms.com and got it for a fantastic price, the room was HUGE and just perfect. Food was delicious and room service was extremely quick. Couldn't ask for a better location, staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We will be visiting again and using this hotel.",5,2014,05,14
35,Amazing rooms,"We stayed here at the beginning of March for a long weekend. Lovely hotel, excellent service and rooms are amazing. Ideally located for a city break and staff very helpful at reception. We paid for breakfast, however this was not 5 star. I would return again but would not pay for breakfast",4,2014,05,13
35,Something missing,"I have just been treated to a three night stay at the Grand Marina with some friends. It is a very nice hotel, with helpful and efficient staff, but we all felt it was lacking in atmosphere. As a base it was perfect, but not the ideal place to spend an evening. The facilities are good, but the pool is tiny, and so is the only restaurant. The room was large, and the bed was very comfortable, but the second night I was kept awake by what sounded like a loud generator. I was on the second floor, and I looked out onto  a large support pylon, but higher up the views would have been much better. The location is not bad, and public transport in Barcelona is excellent, making it easy to get around the city.",4,2014,05,13
35,"A little worn but cosy, comfortable, bright and airy with fab views.","The staff here are fabulous - very warm, friendly and efficient. The rooms showed some signs of wear - some of the upholstery was a little tired but they were clean, spacious and airy and our room had a huge view right over Barcelona (5th floor). I imagine that if you were on the other side of the hotel you would have a great view over the sea too. Beds are very comfortable, room facilities are good. Bathroom is large with a jacuzzi bath. The room receieved lots of natural light and there were ample powerpoints plus an iron and ironing board which came in helpful for getting ready to go out. We didn't eat here so I can't comment of breakfast or anything. The gym was large and the machines in great condition and the pool, while small was ample owing to the large terrace and pool bar meaning guests had lots of space to lounge about. 
The hotel is at the bottom of the Ramblas down by the marina so a longer walk than most into the centre but we weren't troubled by that and there are always lots of taxis or buses around if you'd prefer to take public transport.",4,2014,05,07
35,Lovely hotel but not the best location,"The hotel was wonderful and very quiet. Facilities in the hotel were brilliant, pool was tiny but quiet in April. Views were lovely from the rooftop. The pool bar looked nice although it was closed for most of the time we were there. The room was clean and modern and very quiet at night. No noise could be heard. The location of the hotel was ok, it was a 5 minute walk from the bottom of Las Ramblas (by the Columbus monument) and the walk from there to the hotel late at night was a little too quiet and made me feel quite nervous. There were plenty of places to eat within a 15 minute walk. The reason for staying here was because of the beach but I think I would stay nearer the Olympic port next time.",4,2014,05,05
35,Lost the 5 star way ,"This is a nice hotel but it needs some work. The rooms are nice but some of the furniture it worn and the carpets in the halls need renewing. The cleaners are a bit OTT and try and come in the room even when you have DND on the door. If you are looking for somewhere with a swimming pool this is pretty much a no go and why there aren't many images of it on here, it is on the roof, very small and it can be pretty windy up there. It's more of a gym swimming pool than holiday pool. I would stay here again if I was just coming for the weekend but any longer I would look elsewhere.",4,2014,05,05
35,Very good,"Great location. Luxury hotel. Bus stop right outside for a tour cost is €35 per day. I would highly recommend this the red tour is central to all the cool buildings. 100% must is the rambles you will see ever walk of life. Food and drink in the royal square near the Irish quarter is really nice. I would recommend Rossio for a lovely outside dining experience. It's full on bars and restaurants and 10 min walk from hotel.Weather was good 20 mainly. We took a 3 day trip. Taxi to and from airport was €31. Marina lots to do you can hop on and off the bus tour to check all the locations out. We also went to the norther quarter it's a lot cheaper for food and drink and some nice restaurants. The hotel was very nice. Room we had was over the marina. Breakfast was good... Note order the eggs very top level service. Staff friendly and happy to help. Note you can't take a drink from bar to your room you have to request room service. 2 drinks is about €20! Amazing city. We had room 541if you can get this you will be very impressed. Room service is spot on they came every day with new products for the shower, shoe cleaner, tissues, chocolates on the bed, fresh clean towels. The World Trade Centre location is where the hotel sits. You walk down a long walk way the offices are behind. Reception welcome and check was painless. You can't check in until 3pm but they will take you bags so you can chill in the cube.  Make time for the gothic quarter it is in the centre of the old city. We walked down the small streets which open up into the square. Everyone collects round the Columbus monument to take pictures on the lions. Watch your bag at La Rambla sit in the street cafe's and watch the world go by beer is ceva it's full of tourists and can be crowded. We took loads of photos of the flowers, the florists had multi coloured roses red, blue, orange you can't miss them on the promenade. There is a Hard Rock Cafe it opens about 12 they service the normal burgers and fries it's near the top of the La Rambles. We didn't take the green route but I believe you can see the art hotel from this route. The hotel is near Barcelona's port vell, which offers good shopping, Starbucks, and plenty of leisure activity such as IMAX, aquarium. We walked down the wooden walkway go at night it's beautiful with all the marina lit up. It is impossible to get bored we honestly had the best time ever it went far to quick the best arts and culture and chill we have ever had.",4,2014,05,03
35,Great Location,"If you happen, as were we, to be going on a cruise from Barcelona, there is no better place to stay than the Grand Marina - it is right next to the terminal and we simply walked no more than 200 yards to our ship.

The hotel is also an excellent base for exploring the city as it is a short walk from the bottom of the Ramblas and the city bus hop on/off tour stops a short distance from the hotel.

All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would certainly return as and when we go back to Barcelona.which despite all the reports of pick pockets etc is a great city for tourists with lots to do.",5,2014,05,03
35,Loved It,"I had a one night stay here recently before boarding a cruise ship. I had chosen the hotel because of it's close location to the port. 
I arrived just after noon to be greeted by a lovely doorman who immediately took my luggage from the car (l had pre booked a car service from the airport) and escorted me to reception where l was again greeted very warmly. I had booked a standard room on line (pre-paid) and asked the receptionist if it was possible for me to have a port view. Well he did better than l expected and upgraded me to a junior suite on the 6th floor which overlooked the hotel terrace with a partial port view. The suite was fabulous, exceptionally well laid out and immaculate. 
Upon entering the hallway there was a guest cloakroom with toilet and wash basin. Just after this was a closet area with plenty of room for cases, hanging space and loads of drawers, in which l found all the usual shoe cleaning and laundry bags et al. This was an open area which lead to the first part of the bathroom with double sink units and all the toiletries one could ever want packed up very nicely in a personal bag. Off this area was a large bathroom area with toilet, full bath with shower attachment and a separate large walk in monsoon shower...all set with soft mood lighting. 
This was an open plan suite, the bedroom area was again spacious with a very comfortable king bed and just off this area was a small TV area with two sofas and a coffee table. Just beyond this was another lounge area with a sofa, a work desk and a dining table with four chairs. There was a small balcony leading from this but l didn't use it apart from taking a quick look and for a longer stay it would be lovely to enjoy a quiet drink out there.
The hallways were carpeted and very quiet and the bank of elevators where very quick and efficient. 
Following and early morning start and flight out l didn't wish to go wandering about so ventured down to the hotel terrace for a drink and some tapas. The lovely receptionist had given me a voucher for a complimentary glass of cava which was very acceptable and the tapas were delicious. This area is very spacious with tables and chairs together with lounge sofas and coffee tables. Service from the indoor bar was excellent and the food menu gave a good choice from sandwiches to light snacks which are available all day. 
After a very good sleep l enjoyed an excellent breakfast in the dining area on the first floor. The buffet was extensive with plenty of choice to suit everyone. Service in here was also excellent with staff being very attentive. During breakfast a duo played some lovely classical music which was very pleasant.
Check out was noon and my embarkation was noon, so brilliant timing and as my ship was berthed virtually right next to the hotel the lovely porters collected my luggage and transported it within seconds to the said vessel....it really couldn't have been easier.
I loved the Grand Marina and as a solo female traveller l felt very safe there and wouldn't hesitate to return, even if l wasn't joining a cruise. 
I can't comment on how far one has to go to see the sights but there were loads of taxis right outside the front entrance at all times.",5,2014,04,22
35,Superb.,"I have stayed in many top hotels, this has to be one of the best. The staff are perfect. They are there just enough making for a very unobtrusive and easy stay. I felt very comfortable in all parts of the hotel, bar staff in particular were great, I feel it would be unprofessional to name some of the great people working here but hopefully in just saying that it will give any reader the confidence to expect a great stay here. I absolutely loved the roof terrace/sun lounge. I didn't use the spa but wish now that I had taken advantage of it, however there were plenty of other things to keep me occupied. Location is excellent (I love the sea anyway!) 5 minute walk from Las Ramblas. The gym was good, bar was excellent, food was delightful. Bravo to Eurostars!",5,2014,04,21
35,Good for pleasure and business,"Had a two days business meeting this week and found it extremely nice.
The location is very modern and right on the port. The room maybe noisy if it looks to the port side because of all the boats, ships and ferry with the powerful engines on.

Room are good, though not the best one amongst the 5 stars I have been to. Nevertheless they have all what is needed and the bathroom was really well equipped with a bathtub, an ample shower with massage system and two sinks.

Good restaurant and very nice buffet breakfast. Didn't have the time to see the pool at the 8th floor.",4,2014,04,18
35,fantastic hotel great location,"Stayed here for a long weekend. Excellent location 10mins walk to La Rambla. Some rooms look directly onto offices. Ask for a city view with a balcony....beautiful. nice spacious room. Lovely bar not too expensive. Couple of shops,pharmacy,cafes,bank at the rear of the hotel.friendly staff. Would definitely satay here again. Highly recommend",5,2014,04,17
35,"Great location, comfortable hotel","Stayed here for a long weekend break. Modern hotel in a location that although it feels quite secluded (at the end of the cruise ferry pier) is only a few minutes walk from the city centre. Especially on the weekend when the WTC offices are empty it's very quiet and you feel like you're not staying inside a busy city centre whilst still having all the advantages of nearby restaurants, bars, shops, etc. Perfect. Room was ok but not overly spacious, breakfast very good but overly expensive; walk into the city centre in the morning and grab something on the ramblas instead.",4,2014,04,14
35,"Good hotel for business and leisure , a bet isolated","The hotel is very good for business travellers since it is off the traffic and busy areas , the hotel stand alone next to the World Trade Center business offices , you need to walk a bet to enter la rambles from  Its end , not too far though , you can reach a marina area nearby with nice scenes   and nice Restaurants if you walk a bet further.  Rooms are good and is a true 5 stars property though the AC was really not that effective. Breakfast was great with lots of varieties and true five star level. ",4,2014,04,12
35,Having a great time without leaving the city!,"A few days ago was my birthday and my wife wanted to make me a big surprise.
I had an absolutely unforgettable stay in your hotel. It was awesome to experience real top luxury without leaving my city, in an spectacular room with a faboulous view.
I want to specially thank Manu and the reception team, making things easy, creating this VIP atmosphere at every moment, ensuring that I never, never forget this day.
I like to travel a lot and I've been in many places. Eurostars Marina is really worthy and deserves every star it shows in it's name.
Thank you very much, I hope we'll visit you again.

35,Amazing,"What a fantastic hotel. Clean, spacious. Room service very good. Bar made really lovely cocktails. Staff very very friendly and helpful. Tip- When returning to airport, the hotel have a mercedes for hire. It was cheaper than a taxi. E29 including water for the ride. Would highly recommend. Brilliant location. ",5,2014,04,10
35,Gorgeous!,"Soooo helpfull staff, great value for money, sooo clean..... Very proffesional
Above all great location, if you get the view for barcelona it is just gorgeous!
Although it is near las ramblas but still it is sooo quiet
Breakfast is quiet nice... Simple but nice
WILL DEFINATELY STAY THERE AGAIN N AGAIN!",5,2014,04,09
35,Clean and very friendly,"This is our second visit back to this hotel. It is very clean and the staff are very accommodating. They all speak good English.
The rooms are bright and spacious and we have always had good views overlooking the marina.
The terrace is lovely on a sunny day. Definitely worth relaxing up there as the view over looking the city an sea are stunning. The hotel isn't far from the cable car and all the attractions.",5,2014,04,09
35,Average stay,"Rooms are ok. However bathrooms highly equipped.
Staff are awful and rude when approached for any help. Recommended restaurants that were miles away from hotel. Such slow service by staff at their bar on the first floor- unimpressed. Swimming pool tiny!
Only good things are cleanliness. Hotel is fairly new so rooms are ok. Location is ideal- 5 mins walk to La Ramblas. ",3,2014,04,06
35,Good Central Location,"We arrived at the hotel at about 10.30 a.m., the staff were very friendly and welcoming.  We were checked in, our cases were taken but we could not have the room till 3.00 p.m. (which I knew) We arrived back about 4.00 p.m. and were given our room key, our cases had been taken to the room.  On our way to the room I joked with my hubby about the chances of a room with a sea view, considering it is on the marina, and is a huge round hotel, I had read other reviews about the beautiful views.  I was so disappointed when I opened the curtains that our view was an internal view of all their conference/office rooms.  When I booked the hotel I did mention that it was a romantic surprise trip for my husband on our wedding anniversary, they obviously took no notice of that!  We did not eat at the hotel as it was very pricey, continental breakfast was 25€ each!, and the whole idea was to explore the streets of Barcelona.  It was very well positioned and only a short walk to Les Ramblas (about 10-15 mins).  On our last day we checked out at noon, and they held onto our luggage as we had a night flight.  It was pouring with rain and the porter outside waved for a taxi to come over.  We got in and told him  we wanted to go Ramblas and he was so rude to us, gesturing it was over there!!  Well if you have been there you know there is a bottom, middle and top, he just stopped at the bottom and we had to get out.",4,2014,04,04
35,Attention to detail,"Loved the umbrellas placed at the doors when it was raining - very nice touch. Lunch was mediocre at best and insanely overpriced. The bathroom was amazing,  the room spacious and the bed  comfortable. Those with sensitive sinuses will be happy to hear the pillows are hypoallergenic. Taxis waiting outside all day, convenient for transfer to the airport. Lovely staff .The hotel does lack some charm due to its size and the immediate surroundings so it's not all that suitable for a romantic getaway but perfect for business trips. ",4,2014,04,03
35,Nice rooms good service but so noisy,"This a nice hotel the staff are really friendly and service is super quick .I rang reception twice once because my safe wouldn't un lock and once to get softer pillows both times someone was with me within 5 minutes so super good .
   The room was lovely spacious with opening windows nice bathroom with lots of toiletries and a view of the port . I would avoid the port side rooms at all costs .A ferry leaves nightly at about 11pm so there's no chance of an early night the windows are not sound proofed and the continuous noise from announcements and lorries loading  is intrusive then the ferry literally chugs past feet from the window .Add to that cruise ships with parties that go on until the early hours and you get the picture .My best was one morning when I staggered out of bed threw the curtains open and quickly shut them again .My sea view had been swapped for a cruise ship straight outside the window with hundreds of people on their balconies looking back at me .
   Breakfast was really nice lots of choice and kept well stocked . Other food was disappointing never hot enough but there's so many great restaurants in Barcelona that's not really a problem..
It is however a bit of a hike into the centre but there are lots of taxis just outside the door and they were really reasonable.
  On balance though I think I would prefer a more central hotel.",3,2014,03,31
35,Contemporary,"This hotel is very close to Las Ramblas and right on the water.  Walking distance to restaurants and shops.  The hotel itself is very modern, the rooms are very large and clean.  We had a view of the ocean which was amazing.  The room had a jetted tub and a videt which I thought was very unique.  The concierge was very helpful and friendly.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,03,27
35,"Great hotel, great location.","We selected this hotel due to its location, close to la rambla and harbour. We were not disappointed!  Great clean hotel with nice touches in the room, chez lounge, jacuzzi bath and a big comfy bed! On a personal note, the lady at concierge was extremely helpful and couldn't of done any more to help us!

Some minor down sides. The reception staff were not overly helpful/cheerful. But this did not put me off the hotel! The lady concierge more than made up for this! Also, the shower screen leaked onto the floor and the seal on the bath was cracking. Finally, the rooms have wooden floors, which are very noisy if your neighbour decides to wear heels/ loud shoes!",4,2014,03,24
35,Excellent stay-convenient location,Our room had a spectacular seafront view. The room itself was spacious with a large bathroom. The staff was friendly and professional and we enjoyed cocktails in the great bar while listening to a live quartet.we had a perfect stay.,5,2014,03,22
35,"A nice view of the sea, but a long walk to town","The hotel is very nice and clean, the rooms, standard double, was a bit on the small side when compared to typical US hotels. The location was on the docks so this hotel is designed for those going on cruises as the liners are right outside your door. However, if you want to go into town then it is a very long walk or a taxi ride costing 25 euros (well ours went round the same roundabout twice).",4,2014,03,21
35,Excellent!!,"This is the second time we have stayed at this wonderful hotel before going on a cruise and I was impressed once again.
The rooms are lovely and the staff are so helpful faultless.   The staff even took time to give my husband and I an anniversary cake for our Ruby Wedding.

Would relly recommend to anyone thinking of visiting Barcelona, not the cheapest hotel bt certainly one of the best.",5,2014,03,20
35,Great Location,"We were very surprised by how good the location of this hotel was! Very close to La Rambla (five-minute walk), and also very close to the Metro station. It was by the cruise ship port, but was not noisy at all, and didn't even realize once inside! Would definitely recommend staying here rather than staying on one of the main roads! Breakfast is very costly, and therefore would recommend walking down to La Rambla and/or the market instead. Room was on the 6th floor, and was rather spacious; .the outdoor pool was not open when we stayed, but the gym was well equipped for a hotel gym. The staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the local area. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2014,03,16
35,Better located than it looks!,"I was hesitant as the hotel is on the dockside and seems away from the centre. However, it is a short walk to La Rambla and you can use the metro or hop on the open top bus. The rate (via last minute) was very good tho breakfast was a whopping 27 euros each and not great. Have a walk to La Rambla where there are loads of places.  A 'local' gin and tonic was very nice and strong tho' at 18 euros it needs to be! Nice piano lounge with different musicians each night. Good rooms and staff. However, the pool was closed (March 9th is still winter and it's outdoor so check when it opens if that's important to you). Well worth a look as a 5 star place (just) but at a 3/4 star price.",4,2014,03,12
35,Lovely hotel,This is a fantastic hotel with  staff always very helpful and pleasant.   It is well situated with easy access to shopping at the La Rambla and the tourist bus stops just down from the hotel.   Although the price is a bit high it is well worth it.,5,2014,03,11
35,"Brillaint service,amazing hotel.","We stayed for our 1st wedding annaversary...(which we were upgraded for f.o.c)...reception staff very helpfull,room very clean lovely granit bathroom.
8th floor fantastic views of barcelona...10 mins walk from las ramblas and marina.
oh and please get the room service breakfast very very nice.

thank you for a loveley experiance",5,2014,03,05
35,Great Hotel and Service,"Stayed at this Eurostars for a week long meeting. The hotel was very close to las ramblas which was great for sightseeing after a long day.The hotel staff were very helpful and pleasant. The rooms were very spacious and clean,loved that my room had a tub and a shower.The staff at the front desk even arranged a tour and taxi on my last day and I was able to pay for it at the hotel.The food was great,the breakfast buffet was especially great.",5,2014,03,04
35,It looked so full of promise....,"I arrived on 13 February to join my husband at the Grand Marina Hotel, he was on business in Barcelona and he had checked in to the hotel 2 days prior.
I entered the room (number 607) at approx 14:30hrs, it did not receive maid service. The bed was dishevelled, the towels were dirty, and the room was a mess. It was a bad start to my Valentine weekend. Why did housekeeping not know who was arriving on that day? When I went onto the balcony to admire the view, the glass door on the left was very stiff to open. My husband went onto the balcony using the glass door on the right, it flew open with his hand still on the door, needless to say he trapped his thumb between the door and the glass panel. almost cut his thumb off! When I used there was no overhead light in the shower and it was far too dark. We promptly went down to reception to ask for maid service in the room and the first aid box... all within the first 30 minutes of arriving.
Returning back to the room, I wanted to make a cup of coffee and couldn't understand why the kettle was on a high shelf. I looked for a plug socket but couldn't find one. I rang reception 
and asked where I would find a socket to use the kettle. The response I received was to use the bathroom socket or to use the socket under the table. So I was expected to get down on my hands and knees in order to use the kettle or go into the bathroom to make a cup of coffee. What was all that about?
The next morning on our way out to breakfast a young receptionist asked if everything was ok to which I relayed all of the above incidents. I ended the conversation by mentioning that it was my wedding anniversary as well as Valentine's day to which that evening there was a pathetic tiny box of chocolates on the bed. The box measured 3"" x 3"" and contained 4 chocolates. What was that about?
On the third day I noticed that our coffee cups were still dirty after maid service and the kettle was not put away tidily. Furthermore, I was surprised to see the laminate floorboard had moved and the underlay was on display.
Also on that day the sound of high heels was clattering around from either next door or above. This was annoying.
On the day of our departure, the doorman hailed a taxi from the queue infront of the hotel and instructed the taxi driver to take us to the airport. My husband offered 50 euros to which the taxi driver insisted he didn't have enough change and was 5 euros short. He refused to get out of his taxi to find some change. I had to go out in the pouring rain and ask around for change. It was unacceptable that a taxi driver did not have change. A very disappointing experience at The Grand Marina from beginning to the very end. Would I stay there again? What do you think?",2,2014,03,02
35,Great location for exploring Barcelona,"I stayed here last April and had a very relaxing stay. It's in a good location for the tourist buses and a few minutes walk from Las Ramblas. We stayed on a room only basis and the price of breakfast was rather expensive so we chose to eat out every day. The room itself was spacious and very clean. I'd stay again although I'd hope to be able to make more of the facilities upstairs, as the pool was empty.",4,2014,03,02
35,NIce one,"friendly staff, very helpfull, great advice on nice restaurants
Breakfast buffet was great, plenty of foods, variety... Rooms are clean and very spacious, nice bath.. Ideal for our business trip due to location",5,2014,02,26
35,"Great location, good breakfast, but some rooms can be noisy","My wife and I spent 8 nights in this hotel.

Hotel is situated closed to La Rambla, the mean pedestrian street of the city, La Barceloneta, the seafront where most seafood restaurants are located, and walking distance from the main tourist attractions like Segrada Familia, Cadetral de Barcelona, Park Guell, Palau de la Musica and Museu Picasso etc. etc. All in all, very well positioned for a short stay in this magnificent city.

Do try out the breakfast! Assortment is excellent. You can also order special coffee like espresso or cappuccino at no extra cost. Breakfast service is spotless. Well done!

Need to be aware that there are no sea view rooms as the entire hotel is actually behind the WTC office buildings which are at the seafront, a design failure in my humble opinion...  

The square/city-facing rooms have a more interesting view, but large cruisers are often moored alongside of the square, making loud humming engine noises which are very disturbing in the night. We experienced that first-handedly before moving to the other side of the building... less view, much better sleep...

Talking about night rest... do try out the pillow options! My favorite was ""Sophia Loren"" (all optional pillows are named after famous actresses!!!)

Service is very good in general, and staff has been very friendly and helpful. We received phone call almost every day if all is to our satisfaction! and most of the time we were..

One oddity though... we were asked to settle the bill (or provide guarantee) immediately as the total charge had exceeded 1000 Euros. It gave the impression that the management does not trust their guests (I am sure it was not intentional, but...). So, be prepared if you plan to stay long enough to trigger that threshold... (have never encountered this issue in my more than 35 years of international travelling...)

All in all, a very good hotel for a reasonable price tag.",4,2014,02,26
35,Long Weekend,"Just returned from a long weekend in sunny Barcelona . Great location for city and beach lovely walks to both. Spacious room excellent shower and jet bath great for relaxing in . Friendly attentive staff in bar and restaurant along with the doorman . 

Recommend yes !",4,2014,02,26
35,Good spot for exploring Barcelona,"We were here for 4 nights and were very comfortable.  Room is nice size, bed comfortable, hotel very quiet and breakfast and room service very good.  It was a good spot to explore Barcelona from since we could walk a short distance to Las Ramblas and metro connections to anywhere in city.  Wonderful stay at this hotel in Barcelona.",5,2014,02,21
35,"Quality hotel, very attentive service","Staying here for a week holiday in February. Room is spacious, clean and well appointed; very comfortable bed. Our room has a great view over the marina and the city. Staff is very courteous and helpful without being intrusive. Buffet breakfast has very wide variety and good quality. Location is generally very convenient, less than a 10 minute walk to Las Ramblas, although after dark, it is recommended to return to the hotel by taxi as there is a large area to cross that is quite deserted; no problem in daylight hours though. All in all, a fine hotel in a wonderful city.",5,2014,02,19
35,Great hotel at seaside and close to the Ramblas,"Good location at the seaside and at walking distance from the city centre (that's what we are mostly looking for). Big rooms (thanks to the hotel for the upgrade ...), gentle staff, easy parking place for the car, nice bar.",4,2014,02,17
35,Great location and really pfoffessional,"2 minutes from Las Ramblas makes this a great base to visit Barcelona for a couple if days.
We got a good deal from booking.com - this hotel looks as if it caters more for business users (top end) and is happy to do deals during the low season.
As has been said elsewhere, the hotel is right by the sea and the ferry port so, yes, ferries do dock here and, yes, you can hear them. That said, we did not find this intrusive.
We did not use the restaurant or breakfast as we felt that 25 euros (each) was a bit steep (top tip-turn right out of the hotel and have a coffee and a croissant withe the office workers in the little self service next to the pharmacy, 3.80 euros for the two of us!)
Really smart rooms with a monster bed, really clean, nicely finished with the wood parquet floors throughout the room.
The staff are really helpful and friendly.
We did have lunch in the bar on the first floor which was copious and of a very good quality if a little pricey.
If we had one criticism (and it is only being really picky) there is no delay on the lights in the room when the key card is removed meaning you exit the room in the dark rather that a minute of two delay which we expected - but this is really the only negative we could find so hey!
On the whole, highly recommend and would return.",5,2014,02,15
35,Bad location and service not as good as it should be,"The location of the hotel is not so good: far away from everything and no see view as it is behind another building (WTC).
The service is also quite questionable: I asked for a knife and 2 glasses and they wanted 5 Euros for bringing it to my room. Not really expected for a 5 stars hotel...",2,2014,02,15
35,Eurostar Grand Marina - Honest Review from Seasoned Traveller,"As normal I will split this review into 4 sections:

1. Hotel and accommodation = 7 / 10
A nice hotel with a corporate feel, clean rooms and facilities but lacking the personal touch. It is situated at the cruise port which is nice enough and provides you with a good panorama of the city and is easy walking distance to the Ramblas and city centre (Ramblas 5 mins walk).The rooms are clean modern and spacious and the bed very comfortable, but there we a couple of negatives points. Limited entertainment TV etc and not enough tea and coffee making facilities).

Service = 6.5 / 10
The service and attention from the staff was good but somewhat plastic. Whilst the words they spoke showed a desire to make the stay as nice as possible the actions did not quite follow. Good bar staff and breakfast staff, but the hotel failed to completed some other simple requests for restaurant bookings or suggestions.

Location = 6.5 / 10
If you are looking to be able to walk straight out into the city then this hotel is not for you, if you would rather look at the sea and have a nice view then this is better. Overall I liked the situation of the hotel although it's a little corporate.

Summary = 7 /10 
Nice clean and spacious hotel. Lacking 5 star facilities and service but good value for money.",2,2014,02,15
35,Great post cruise hotel!!! Loved it!,"After sailing the beautiful Mediterranean, stayed here for a night. We were able to check our luggage early to go explore Barcelona. Great location, very short walk to Las Ramblas. Also, amazing rooftop views of the city & the sea-perfect to take in over some wine. We were graciously given a room upgrade to an awesome suite! Wished I'd been able to stay the whole next week! Overall: great service, rooms, location, would love to stay again!!!",5,2014,02,04
35,Absolutely shocking,"Brought a package deal, NON-REFUNDABLE, after flying into Barcelona from gatwick, turned up at the hotel to be told that the room had been canceled, spent over a hour trying to resolve this to be told that the rate that I originally had was not available and it would be a extra £55 a night!!! Bearing in mind the hotel was all booked and confirmed for myself it's was going to cost another £216 for my stay, as they said they have refunded the money from the original booking but it would take upto 10 days to reach my account, so basically I had to pay twice, after a hour long issue I agreed to pay the new rate.... To be told that due to the issues the hotel could not issue me a room and would like me to leave........WELCOME TO BARCELONA!!!! Avoid at all cost, in one review I believe someone was mugged in reception,, I know how that feels.... Maybe the staff did it!!",1,2014,01,26
35,Best Location for Cruisers,We stayed here before and after our Mediterranean Cruise. You can view the cruise port from the hotel as well as downtown Barcelona. The hotel was a good value and the staff were extremely accommodating. It is a short taxi ride to the cruise port. The double decker tour bus picks up out front or it is a short walk to Las Ramblas. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it. We actually went in May of 2010 but the review did not give us that option.,5,2014,01,19
35,Most Amazing Brunch Ever!!!,"The Saturday morning breakfast is phenomenal.  Wine, mimosas, omelets made to order, fresh fruit, waffles, breads and so much more.  You simply can't go wrong with the accommodations, and it's right next to Port Vell.  Stay here and you won't regret it!",5,2014,01,13
35,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location, Staff really tried","5 days, beautiful hotel in a great location.  Close to Las Ramblas (5-10 min walk) which we liked because it enables you to get away from the hustle and bustle of that very busy area. Rooms are nice and bigger than other hotels I looked at in the area. It's located next to the port where the cruise ships dock but we never heard the boarding horns. The gym is wonderful! It has more machines than most hotel gyms including a sauna, shower area and a beautiful view. The restaurant and buffet was okay. Lunch was good but nothing spectacular. Some of the staff speaks really good English and others not so much, but our Spanish was limited as well. There were two challenges: 1. there was two of us and we couldn't get housekeeping to leave extra towels. When we did get them, if we didn't use them right away she would take them back!  We  had to keep requesting them, 2. the phone in the room didn't work half the time. They eventually fixed it after the 3rd request. We had to use the phone by the elevator to call for room service. We like the hotel and the location and would consider staying here again..",5,2014,01,11
35,A Wonderful hotel in a Wonderful City,"This is a true 5 star hotel in the marina section of town and an ideal spot. The room was very spacious and comfortable. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel has a great bar with excellent food. There is a small pool on the upper floor with a gym but go up there for the view at night its spectacular. Whether you walk, cycle, or get a cab this hotel is in a perfect position by the water’s edge. We would stay here again.",5,2014,01,11
35,Grand Marina Magic,Lovely hotel . Worthy of a five star rating.Facilities in the room and hotel were excellent. Staff very helpful. Location was PERFECT for us as we wanted to be as near to the cruise ship terminals as is possible.5 mins walk to the landmark Christopher Colombus statue ( which is also the bottom end of Las Ramblas ) Taxi's stop right outside the hotel . So getting round is not a problem.!!!,5,2014,01,10
35,once again the best in Barcelona,"second time in the Eurostars Grand Marina in Barcelona, this time for New Years Eve.

still the best breakfast buffet in Town and the best bed i've ever slept in a hotel! 

one thing … the whirlpool wasn't full … the only downer … :-)",5,2014,01,08
35,Approach with caution,"Having used the hotel in a professional capacity I can assure you this is certainly not worth the 5 Star deluxe label they boast about.  From leaking air conditioning, to showers falling off the wall and less than helpful staff I find it very hard to say any good about this hotel. Some of the reception staff are brilliant but it is a little hit and miss.  I blame the General Manager who portrays an image of authority but when questioned he disappears.

On a good side the hotel is quite well situated on the right side of the city for the airport and in walking distance to the Ramblas.  It is right next to the docking site for cruise ships which is great if you are on a cruise, but a pain when the boarding horns go off at 6am each day through the Summer.",1,2014,01,08
35,Amazing hotel,This hotel was very nice. You rarely seem to find such hotels in whole of Europe at this price. Our group of 9 pax really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It is very ideally located very closer to Las Ramblas which is a hotspot for tourists visiting barcelona.,5,2014,01,07
35,Not a 5 star hotel at all,"Very disappointing for a supposed luxury hotel! We had a suite in the 7th floor with fantastic views' the best  thing. refreshments tray poor, if you want milk for tea you get charged for a glass of milk on room service!!!! Bathroom toiletries basic and by demand. Temperature control in room either too hot or freezing without it on. No checks from staff that all ok, on the night of 1st jan 2014, removals happening throughout the night keeping us awake, had to ring security to find out what the noise was. Completed hotel satisfaction early to allow for hotel to contact us, nothing!! Would not recommend this hotel try other 5 stars",2,2014,01,02
35,Fantastic Luxury Hotel for Barcelona City Break,"Booked this last minute for a New Year's Eve break. Very well located, approx 10mins walk from Port Vell eateries and aquarium, museum etc and also 10 mins walk from the Ramblas. Well lit and felt safe walking back at night despite tour guides suggesting caution.

Reception and Concierge were friendly and helpful and spoke English (which always puts the British ineptitude with European languages to shame). The standard room was large with sea view. Could have done with more tea / coffee sachets. Room service was excellent and the quality of the food was very good too. Room was clean and tidy. Its pricey, but then again its a 5* hotel....there are lots of cheaper places to eat nearby. Lots of facilities, including a spa and gym.

The hop on/off bus stops a minute walk from the hotel due it the World Trade Centre being attached to the hotel.

Not sure this is a place for kids unless they are used to nicer places. The kids here were well behaved unlike the spoilt brats running riot in cheaper ""family friendly"" hotels!!! lol

The New Year's Eve Gala dinner seemed expensive at E165, but there were 6 courses and wine with each course as well as a free champagne bar...so actually very good value compared to some restaurants offering a lot less for high prices. Also there was no stuffy dress code (having travelled without a tuxedo this was a relief). The party was great and all the multicultures present all got along.

I would definitely stay here again with my partner.",5,2014,01,02
35,Not a 5 star hotel any more,"I visited this hotel 7 years ago for the first time and really liked it. Unfortunately a lot has changed since then. The positive things first: The staff was friendly, the room was always cleaned very well and the views and location are great. Unfortunately for me this is not a 5 star hotel any more. Our room was far too cold because the heating didn't work properly and wind was coming through the balcony door and windows. Wifi didn't work properly, we called the support twice but without much improvements. For a business hotel, I think this is a no-go. Also the rooms need some modernisation: Proper air-con, exchange of cracked tiles and saggy mattresses would be a good start.",2,2013,12,29
35,Convenient pre-cruise stay,"We stayed here in the Summer for a couple days before a cruise.  The hotel is very nice, staff attentive and centrally located to areas like Las Ramblas. also relatively close to the cruise docks. Clean and quiet. good sized rooms were pleasant surprise based on what i had read up about hotels in Spain.  It does come off more as a business traveler hotel than one for kids, but there were plenty of children and ours was perfectly comfortable there.  Nice European/Spanish style breakfast buffet each morning. Nearby the tourist bus pickups, the ferry and walking distance to many of the main downtown attractions of Barcelona.  For you US travelers, remember, different electrical conversion equipment for the outlets. We did not! but the staff was kind enough to loan us an extra from the front desk.  It is in an office park area, so if staying on the weekend or during the summer holiday months, not as much open (snacks and coffee, toiletries) immediately nearby for those who are still adjusting to the different time zones.  So my only real suggestion is that - unless there is one i couldnt find - a little hotel shop might help.",4,2013,12,28
35,This hotel is not for family with kids.,"We booked this hotel over the web, but we wanted to find out if the room can accommodate four of us (we have two kids, age 12 and 7).  Despite several phone call messages and emails to the hotel, nobody replied.  The morning we arrived at the hotel after getting off the cruise ship, we were told that we needed two rooms for our family, even the room was large enough to put an extra bed inside.     If we had known this, we would not have booked this hotel, not only we were forced to pay double the amount we had agreed to, it was also very inconvenient. Though the rooms were next to each other,   there was no connecting door between them.     We waited a long time for the check-in process, we tried to talk to the manager about it , but was told nothing could be changed.    Later that morning when we passed by the lobby, we overheard another couple with two young kids had to split into two rooms which were in different floors.  Their kids were very young that  one adult had to stayed with one kid in each room.  They were very unhappy about it.",1,2013,12,22
35,Eurostar gran Marina Barcelona,"Fantastic hotel,very friendly and professional front of the house,spotless from top to bottom.spacious bedrooms,naturally some have better view than others.excellent breakfast with attentive service,nothing was to much small criticism,should be warm plates for hot breakfast.the tapas we had at the bar on arriving late was probably one of the best meals in Barcelona.with ten minutes walk to the rambler,this is a must stay hotel.thank you.you were all superb...",5,2013,12,15
35,Perfect location!,"We absolutely love Barcelona & this hotel!!  It is in the perfect location to walk (especially to Las Ramblas) & enjoy the people, restaurants & sights.  The buffet breakfast & service were excellent!  Our only complaint is that we couldn't regulate the thermostat in our room.  It was definitely too hot for sleeping so we had to sleep with the window open (no screen & lots of outside noise at times) while other people in the hotel were complaining about being too cold.  Everything else was perfect!",4,2013,12,12
35,Spacious rooms near the ferries,First impression is that without exception the staff was excellent.  In particular the bar/restaurant staff went out of their way to be helpful.  The rooms were spacious and clean.  The location is by the ferry port but a short walk to Las Ramblas where all the action is.  Normally we ate out around Las Ramblas but the first night we at at the hotels small restaurant which was quite good.  Breakfast is buffet but well stocked.  The only negative was our room placement.  The hotel is one quarter of four buildings placed in a circle called the World Trade Center.  If your room is on the inside of the circle and near the end of the building you stare right into a set of offices (and them back at you).  I would definitely stay there again but try and get a city facing room.,4,2013,12,10
35,"Great room, location and staff","We booked this hotel for its centralized location and rating. When we got there, our first impression of the place was great. Staff was very helpful and very nice. Our room was actually good. The letdowns were the very expensive (albeit good) breakfast, and the constantly broken roof deck facilities.
A word of advice: If you go there during the summer cruise season, and you don't want to be woken up at 6AM, pack ear plugs :) It's one of the negatives of being ON the pier. ",3,2013,12,03
35,"Great Location, Helpful Staff","I booked a room online directly through this hotel's website.  We arrived in Barcelona at 9AM after traveling all night from Texas and went directly to the hotel.  The staff apologized for not having our room ready (we were there about five hours before normal check in), but promised the room at noon.  We left our bags with the hotel and opted to take the hop on-hop off bus to see the sites.  When we returned, our room was ready.  We had a beautiful room with a view of the harbor.  The staff was, without exception, very friendly and helpful. After a restful nights sleep, we had breakfast in the dining room and the buffet choices were far superior to any I have experienced at a hotel.  I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2013,12,02
35,Special Birthday Trip!!!! Wonderful!!!,"My husband and I travelled here for my birthday, April 2013. Although we have visited this City on three occassions, there is so much to see and do! Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff excellent location approx 10mins walk to Las Ramblas: Rooms very spacious and spotlessly clean, smoking was permitted on certain floors, which can be requested at time of booking, which maybe important to some travellers. No smoking in the public areas. Very inviting Reception staff with large reception area. Breakfast was very good with lots of choices for every nationality/taste., breakfast staff efficient, spotlessly clean dining areas. Staff at reception very accommodating when asking for directions, restaurants and attractions. Taxi rank just outside hotel so conveniently placed if you needed a taxi into main area of Barcelona, if weather was a bit suspect. We would definetely give this a 5* rating, Ate in the restaurant one evening and food was lovely, had a light lunch outside on the patio area and servisce and food couldn't be faulted.
Very welcoming Hotel.",5,2013,12,01
35,Good location&friendly service,"Just stayed In Grand Marina 3 nights. Good value for money 100,- per night in 5 star hotel sounds awesome. Good room with balcony - some small problems ( heating system didn´t work first night - but fixed in the morning, door locks works little bit complicated, no water in pools…but anyway worked fine) Topfloor terrace is great + gym / sauna ok and the staff is very friedly. Piccolo & doorman service quite good. Breakfast not so special but quite expensive. 
For business & pleasure - peaceful accommodation . Maybe next time back here in few weeks.",4,2013,12,01
35,Amazing view and wonderful staff,"I went to Barcelona for 2 days of vacations before some business days in Madrid. I choose this hotel  and I really enjoyed my stay. Rooms are very good, breakfast is complete and delicious, tour bus is in front of the hotel and hotel is walking distance from several touristics spots like La Rumbla.",5,2013,11,28
35,"Noisy, worn out","Big clean rooms, but furniture shows signs of wear and tear.
Cleaned daily, maybe over zealously, because on the first morning some guy was repairing and cleaning our room's door while we were in (around 8am).
The staff was helpfull since we switch for a room with a view to the city, as the previous one had a view to the atrium and some office building.
Didn't opt for breakfast as it was ridiculously expensive, instead went to La Boucheria green market and had ""jamon"" and cheese and bread (totally recommend).
Hotel has a gym and a sauna (ok), and a rooftop pool which was closed at the time.
Quite noisy: we could hear sounds from the hallway, and constant humming of cruiserships and some PA system.
We were brought really wornout towels with holes and strings hanging out. 
Not a 5 star experience I have expected.",3,2013,11,27
35,"Great Location, dated hotel with bad service","Overall good hotel with great location but it could do with a make-over! Rooms are big and comfortable but not charming or stylish at all. The gym facilities looked great but unfortunately it was closed for renovation when we were there (the reception staff had no clue that the gym was closed and kept telling us it was open, when we showed up in our gym-kit we were turned away.....) The bed was very hard and the sheets clean but not very nice.

I was not impressed by the service from the reception at all - they told us it was not necessary to book a restaurant when we asked for help with this and of course the restaurant was full when we got there! The second day we asked for recommendations and help with booking again and after a long and very frustrating discussion with the girl in the reception she promised to try to book and then call us to confirm. Of course we did not hear back at all. When i later asked her about it she said she couldn't book as the restaurant was full but i managed to make my own reservation so that was clearly a lie. Not 5-star service!",2,2013,11,27
35,Great hotel central to many attractions,"We stayed 4 nights prior to our cruise. It is well located near the base of Las Ramblas ( 5 minute walk ) & close to many sights / attractions in Barcelona.
The breakfast buffet is awesome & has a very large selection ( omelettes / eggs made to order ) all staff we encountered are very helpful & friendly & speak English & made our stay very enjoyable. Concierge is extremely knowledgeable in assisting us with tours / sightseeing. Rooms very spacious & clean. Also very close to cruise ship terminal. ",5,2013,11,24
35,Good for cruise terminal,"An interesting hotel - generally a dour environment but bright and helpful staff - especially pleased with the very early check in. Rooms and public areas clean and well maintained. Best location to get to and from the cruise terminal and easy access to the city centre. A number of good restaurants are within a 15-20 minute walk. Now the not so good. Air conditioning was not working and the bedroom was like an oven. Breakfast was only saved by the variety of cold meats and cheese! I ordered an omelette with all fillings but 95% was caramelised onion - more like an onion compote - I like fried onions but not so early in the day and not for breakfast. Bacon could be used to sole shoes and fried eggs were solid and a little burnt. If you want an evening drink either bring your own, go to a local bar or increase your credit limit!  Big negatives for a 4 star (don't be fooled this is not a 5 star) but fine for an overnight linked to a cruise.",3,2013,11,24
35,Avoid ,"Made a booking through Booking.com.Didn't check the details and found that instead of 3. nights I had only booked in for 1.Totally my fault.However when I found that the cost for an additional two nights I decided to book elsewhere as it was only a football weekend with my two sons.The staff at this hotel made me feel like a criminal, insisting that. I had to stay on the night I arrived and pay. 100 euro deposit.The hotel itself is so overpriced for what is little more than an office block with bedrooms The room was so cold and although they provided a kettle ,no cups.5 star?.On the bright side I was able to find the Hotel SB Diagonal.At a third of the price this 4* offers everything the Grand marina doesn't including a swimming pool which has water in it",1,2013,11,24
35,Great Cruise Hotel,"Pros - Great hotel for taking a cruise, located near the cruise terminal.  Easy walking distance to La Rambles street.  Accommodations excellent, you will need a European electrical adapter to plug in your computer.  We were upgraded to a suite and it exceeding our expectations.  Extremely friendly service.

Cons - Dining at the hotel expensive.  No other food options near the hotel, you will need  a taxi or walk 1/2 mile.  No shuttle pickup at the airport.",4,2013,11,21
35,Outdated,"The hotel is a bit outdated, too far from the main attractions in the city specially from the beach. The hotel is a bit old and has musty smell in the room. The pool is tiny and the bar at the rooftop is not good. Too expensive for what you get for. Very bad hotel for for a 5 star hotel as they claimed it to be.",3,2013,11,21
35,Consistent with Excellent Staff,"2nd time staying with  Eurostars Grand Marina and I must say...the stay was very comfortable. Met with smiling staff, very efficient. Room was provided immediately. Overall, the room was very comfortable, could not really fault, however it was a basic hotel room. Spacious, but basic. The only thing that I was not impressed by was the breakfast. Good selection, but the staff were very ""unwelcoming"". Went one day and decided not to go back as Barcelona has enough spectacular food venues.

Bottom line...I recommend it. Great location. Great Service. I would definitely go back again.",4,2013,11,21
35,"Good location, but you may have a ship sailing up to your balcony","Good service, nice lobby and breakfast/dining area on first floor, and excellent fitness, pool and sunbathing area on 8. floor with overview of Mont Juïc and the old harbor. 
My room had a small balcony, around 30 sqm room with good desk, but terrible wireless internet, nice bathroom with bubble bath and bide. 
The location in the harbor/on the moll is a bit noisy, but quite central with walking distance to Port Vell with a lot of restaurants an bars, to the old town of Barri Gotic and to Las Ramblas. Take a visit to the hidden five star restaurant Somorrostro in Port Vell/Barcelonta. It´s a hidden secret/diamond! 
Good service, own pillow menu(!), el-bikes or scooters for rent. The el-bikes costs 25 euro/day and will easy take you around fast and efficient. 
Nice, varied and good breakfast buffet, 3 of 3 stars.",4,2013,10,17
35,"Good location, nice room, but misses attention to detail","Came here for a technology convention, so liked the relatively easy transfer from the airport and the central location of this modern hotel. The room was large and well equipped, with lots of marble in the bathroom. Staff was friendly and efficient, and the breakfast buffet had a huge selection. Yet, it was the fact that small things were not well executed that was my overriding impression. First, the wifi sucked. Difficult to get on, and losing the connection. Now I know that this is a general issue -- am sitting at Barcelona airport struggling with wifi too! But not what you would expect from a 5-star hotel. Likewise, in room 209 the hot and cold water was switched around (so cold when you expected hot)... irritating. I also found the room very dark (had brown wooden floors), and light switches in difficult places. So,mixed emotions.",4,2013,10,16
35,Fabulous location,"This hotel will not disappoint we stayed in a glass room with a view of the marina the sea & the mountains , food is spectacular , words couldn't describe the amazing stay we had ; A deserving 5 star absolute comfort , ideally located just a short stroll from las rambles , wouldn't hesitate in recommending this hotel for business or pleasure ",5,2013,10,08
35,"Overall, good but not great","We stayed at the Grand Marina for 3 nights before the start of our cruise because it was the ""pre-cruise hotel"" selected by our cruise line. The reservation was for a standard room with no guarantee of a room with a balcony or view. I emailed the hotel before our arrival requesting an upgrade to a room with a balcony and city view, and they gave us a ""city suite"". It was a very large room/suite that had sliding doors that could be closed to separate the 3 sections of the room. We appreciated the upgrade, but our room was not like the photos I had seen online of the city suite. 
All city suites are not the same- some have a real ""living room"" with a sofa and chairs- ours just had a small dining table and 3 dining chairs. They offered us a larger suite as a replacement, but it faced the World Trade Center (no city view), so we kept the room we had. The breakfast buffet had a large selection, but was not worth 25E per person!",4,2013,10,03
35,Location and service,"We really enjoyed this hotel. It was my boyfriends 2nd time there and it wont be our last. Modern hotel with spacious rooms (we got a deluxe)  and great service too. Jacinto provided us a friendly professional service, as well as his colleagues. The view to the marina is nice. Easy walk to Las Ramblas too.",5,2013,10,02
35,Last minute Barcelona Trip,"The hotel  was very central and was  easy to hop on to the tour bus or walk to Las Ramblas. There was a  20 mintute walk to the beach , which was lovely . The Hotel was clean , staff were cartainly not chatty. For a 5 star hotel found it ridiculus  that you only  recieved complimentary coffee & tea on the first night . Did wonder what was the purpose of the kettle  was , so we bought coffee for the room our selfs , however i did inform them that even the most basic hotels give you tea & coffee.  Certainly not worth a 5 star. Having said all that Barcelona was lovely . Beware of pick pockets as a man had his hand hidden under his  jacket and was in my bag , he got nothing as my husband shouted at him .",3,2013,10,01

35,Worked for me!,"Our room was clean. It was a decent size with two easy chairs and a padded bench so we didn't have to lie on the bed to watch TV. Lots of closet and shelf space. The bathroom was nice although they didn't provide much by way bathroom accessories. (shampoo/conditioner in one, shower gel, no lotion, tiny packets of tissue and miniscule bars of soap) We had to ask twice for more soap and tissue because they were too small to last more than one day. However, if that is the worst complaint you could have, it certainly wasn't a big deal. The bed was comfortable. The staff were friendly, and extremely helpful, everywhere. The breakfasts were excellent, as far as selection was concerned, although I do agree with one reviewer that the ""hots"" were not very hot. Our breakfasts and dinners were included so I can't speak to the food and drink prices, or even the cost of the rooms, but our dinners included unlimited wine and the waiters were right there to refill our glasses when it was empty. The dinners were tasty and well prepared. I enjoyed the location and, when where we needed to go, was too far to walk, the taxis were reasonable.",4,2013,10,01
35,Five star this is not!,Room disappointing. Sea view - see photos. Service was well below that expected at a five star hotel. Guests expected to pay €5 for milk to make tea/coffee as milk not included with coffee making facilities. Good selection at breakfast shame the hot options were always cold!  Again would not expect buffet style breakfast at a five star hotel. Pool nothing like publicity shots which must have been taken at a different hotel - more like a plunge pool. Pool side area littered with debris and cigarette/cigar buts. No refreshments available in pool area until after noon!  All in all disappointing stay wouldn't recommend.,2,2013,09,28
35,poor maintaned rooms and basic service,"stayed here 1 week. rooms are worn out in many aspects... uneducated trainees in half of the hotel.... not service at all even close to the pool or roof area.... basic tourist hotel that are not worth the stars or price.. ps. every day you have the ferry waiting minimum 6 hours with diesel engines outside your window.... imagine the great sound :-(
i would definitely choose another well managed hotel ",2,2013,09,27
35,Disappointed,"Good location, rooms not ready on arrival and front desk not very helpful after informing us of this. They did inform us that we had been upgraded but our room was at the top on the back of the hotel. For an upgraded room with views of offices and a constant noise that sounded like fans or a generator that was very annoying. The swimming pool would have been fine although not the hotels fault people reserved the few sun beds with towels and were not to be seen. It was also untidy with empty glasses and plates also half rated apples and cigarettes discarded on the floor.
Totally disappointed would not stay again.",2,2013,09,21
35,stays good,"perfect location, nice rooms, you can walk easily into town with all restaurants etc.., breakfast perfect! service as always, good! And valet parking which is very good if you stay some days and you do not need your car !",4,2013,09,20
35,Great location,"Great location, hotel has no soul or atmosphere, rooms are okay, remember to get a city view, Internet is useless, some people didn't have room ready on arrival, unfortunately the attitude is very relaxed, which makes it very frustrating. 
Would not stay again!",3,2013,09,17
35,Good location hotel,"This hotel is in a very good location, especially for those taking the cruise. The staffs were helpful. However, the room is not what I would expected for a five star hotel. I would rate it 4 if it is a four star hotel. But since it is a five star hotel, it does not meet my five star expectation. Here are what I don't like about the room: no separate shower, bathroom is too cramped, toilet is too close to bathtub, toilet broken later. Not enough lighting in the room and also one of the lightbulb was broken. However, room is clean and location is excellent, close to many attractions. For the right price, I would stay there again.",3,2013,09,09
35,Business like in Barcelona,"This is a very smart, well located and stylish hotel in the port area of the city. It is within easy walking distance of the new marina shopping centre, part of the World Trade Centre and a few minutes from the end of Las Ramblas where you can walk, eat and drink in beautiful surroundings.
This is, however, not a family hotel and does not cater for children in any way. The bars and roof terrace are very adult orientated and do not be fooled by the photograph of the ' outdoor pool'. Very cleverly photographed it is little larger than a plunge pool with 1stroke getting you from one side to the other! The rooms are well designed and spacious with good facilities i.e. safe, iron, ironing board, coffee and tea making equipment. Great bathroom with walk-in shower and whirlpool bath. Breakfast was excellent and served efficiently by pleasant staff. Food generally in the restaurant and bars is of a high standard. Reception staff are friendly but rather thin on the ground with guests often having to wait too long for attention giving a rather harassed approach and perhaps a little impersonal ( depending on your nationality! )
This is not a cheap hotel and I think they could offer a little more for the price but it is well placed for those going on a cruise, as we were ,as it is only a 5 minute taxi ride to the dock. The open top bus tours also leave from right outside the hotel which is a terrific way to see Barcelona and you can buy tickets directly from the hotel.",4,2013,09,09
35,Nice Location,"My Fiancée and I stayed at the Grand Marina hotel for a week in September. The hotel is in a great location to see the sights of Barcelona. The staff were pleasant and helpful especially at breakfast. There are a few downsides to this hotel though for instance charging 5 euros for a bucket of ice when the drinks are very expensive in the mini bar to go with the ice, the outdoor pool is very small considering the hotel is reasonably large, and the fact they asked a lot of people including us who were staying there for a week to pay half the bill half way through the week because as the receptionist put it its because of the crisis in Spain at the moment they wanted to make sure they got there payment which we thought was quite strange. Apart from that it was a great holiday.",4,2013,09,08
35,Poor reception,"While it has been 4 years since I have stayed there, I still get upset about the poor reception that my boyfriend and I received upon checking in.  The girl that checked us in was quite pleasant and helpful but there were a couple of desk clerks that snickered and did not want to give us what was promised us through Travel Zoo.  The girl that was helping us made sure that we received what we were promised but I will not forget the awful way that the other 2 made us feel.  I don't know if they are still there and I'm sorry that I am just now writing this review but my boyfriend became sick while we were on the trip and has died of pancreatic cancer since our visit.  The view that we were promised was of a cruise ship and all the people could look in our room if our curtains were pulled.  How sad that I only remember the poor treatment we received upon our arrival.  Believe me, I did not feel that this is a 5 star hotel.  Sad because I had booked with another hotel in Barcelona but upon receipt of this hotel by Travel Zoo, I changed our reservation to stay here.  Hopefully, this has been corrected and they have quality service since our stay.  Once again, sorry for the delay in my review.",2,2013,09,07
35,Good Business Hotel in Marina,"Nice business hotel with great views of the marina.  Rooms are definitely spacious with walk in shower and bath.  Great location for the convention centre as the 2 are literally on top of each other.

Food was fresh and tasty.

The only negative was on check in you had no welcome to the hotel, not even basic timing on check out, breakfast which is usually standard in every hotel.  Given the reception is on a floor lower than the lobby it also is not a walk by area if you are not leaving the hotel",3,2013,09,05
35,Excellent Location,"We stayed at the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel in Barcelona during a conference last October. The location of the hotel is fantastic, with exhilarating views of the Marina and the city from the rooms. It is at walking distance from the La Rambla esplanade and shopping and dining options are a plenty nearby.

The sight of luxury yachts gliding into the Marina and especially the large cruise liners are awesome. The only drawback being that at time you may be startled by the horn of these vessels.

The rooms are huge, with a separate bathroom area which in itself is as huge as some hotel rooms. The breakfast is average in the restaurant. Surprisingly, there is no spa in the hotel.

Overall, a decent place to stay with the location being its prime attraction.",4,2013,09,05
35,Perfect in every way!,"Staff, the room, the view, the location. PERFECT! Take the hop on hop off bus and go anywhere in Barcelona. Gorgeous room, free plugs to convert American chargers for your phones and laptops. Can't say enough good about this hotel. Highly recommend.",5,2013,09,04
35,Excellent Stay,"The staff was outstanding from the Front Desk to the Concierge and everyone in between. The hotel was clean, well decorated and quiet. The location was perfect. Everything was within easy walking distance. The Hop-On Hop-Off Bus stopped just outside making access to all of Barcelona a short walk, and Las Rambles was a couple of blocks away.",5,2013,09,03
35,"5 star price, 2 star service","The only really positive that I can say about this hotel is its location.  The rooms are nicely appointed BUT well used.  Towels are frayed and discolored, bedding is worn. The hotel was built for the Olympics in 1992 and few if any upgrades since then.  There is no small store or vending machines for drinks on property.  The Bar will not sell you bottled water for your room and will ""tell"" you to call room service.  Which leads to the biggest problem with this hotel the staff.  Every staff member that I came into contact with on my 4 night stay needs a serious ""Customer Relations Seminar"" for example with time change I woke up early.  Went down to restaurant level to see about a cup of coffee.  I was told that the restaurant was not open yet and that I would have to call room service by a staff member while I observed 4 staff members sitting in the lounge drinking coffee and chatting with each other.  Food at the hotel is not worth the money you are much better off eating all meals off property. No direct access to any beach at all.  Wifi is extremely limited on property and most guests could not access from room and needed to go to restaurant floor to access. Taxi is your only option to see the beach.  I will be back to Barcelona but not to this hotel.  For the money I will staying at the ""W"" and paying the few extra euro in taxi service to get me to La Rambla, etc...",2,2013,09,03

35,"Nice hotel, well located, really slow wifi","This hotel is nice, the rooms are good, the food is good, the location is good.  I stayed here on business though and the wifi was frustratingly slow.  It took ages to send and download basic attachments and streaming video was impossible.  I would not stay here again on a work trip for this reason only.",3,2013,08,30
35,Great for a city & beach break,"We've just returned home from a 3-night stay at the hotel & it was great; very clean, good location near to the beach and La Rambla, nice breakfast, very helpful reception staff and very comfortable room. There wasn't much of a view from our room, but to be honest, we only used it as a base because there was far too much to see and do to spend much time inside a hotel room! We had breakfast at the hotel in our last morning, which was a bit pricey (€55 for two of us), but that didn't even seem that bad considering we enjoyed a 'champagne breakfast' with the cava & fresh orange juice! Well, why not? A holiday's a holiday, after all! :-D

35,Watch out if booking with Priceline for a family,"I used Priceline to book this for 3 people (mom, 2 teens:  14 and 17) in August for 3 nights.  The rate was 250 Euros a night.   When  I asked for a 3rd bed for my very petite 14 year old, I was charged an extra 150 Euros a night.  The other option was 2 rooms.    If she were <12 years old the charge would have been less (I think 80 Euros), but she was considered an adult.   The room was very large and nice, but I would not have paid 400 Euros for this hotel, but was locked in.  Be careful if you are booking for more than 2 people.

Do not count on sleeping in on a Saturday morning!  A cruise ship docked right next to the hotel and we could hear the ship announcements (starting when they docked about 7 am) for several hours.     
Location is good:  It is a close walk to metro and Ramblas.  We were looking for something close to the beach in August and it is about a mile walk.   We were going on a cruise and it is a quick cab ride to the port (don't use their 80 Euro service to the port).  

Deck on roof is nice w/small pool and hot tub and nice view)
You have to call for turn down service, so we missed it because we ere out most of day. It should be automatic in a hotel like this.
Staff was good:  very attentive and helpful and speak many languages (impressive)

We had an unfortunate incidence that the battery on the door look went dead Sat. afternoon, which meant we had to wait inline at the desk each time we needed to get in the room to have some one let us in until it was fixed on Sat. am.  they extended our checkout by 1 hour for this (since we spent so much packing time in line).",3,2013,08,26
35,5 star plus!!!!,"We stayed for one nite prior to getting on our 24 day cruise on Holland America. Beautiful hotel. We had a suite and it was just a piece of heaven!!! Relaxing, and we loved walking everywhere. Diagnol Magna Mar mall is so close, and again Las Ramblas is right there. Thankyou so much for your kindness, and all the smiles!",5,2013,08,25
35,"Great hotel, but had it's flaws.","Although relatively expensive, it is a really lovely hotel, in a good location and I definitely had an enjoyable stay.
The staff were seriously helpful and nothing was too much of a chore for them.
When we arrived at our room (after given the choice of 3), we weren't overly impessed by it or the view, so went back to the reception and asked to change to one of the other rooms. This was a lot nicer and wasn't an inconvenience to be moved. We got to pick our own pillows to sleep on and the chambermaid came at times that suited us (some days after 6pm even). The breakfast was tasty, with a huge range of food and drink options to choose from. The beds were comfortable and I had a really good night's sleep. Rooms were spotless and there were no shortage of clean towels.
The only things that let the hotel down were the lack of sunbeds around the pool area, you really had to get there at the right time of day to secure a hotel, which is ridiculous as it is a massive underused area.
The other thing that was a real letdown was the RIDICULOUSLY bad wifi connection, it was virtually impossible to connect and stay connected and when you were connected it barely worked. This meant that I was constantly turning my data roaming on. Finally everything on the pool bar/restaurant/room service menu was ridiculously overpriced and meant that we had to leave the hotel if we were hungry.
Apart from these few flaws, I would highly recommend anyone to stay at this hotel.",4,2013,08,22
35,The only thing that is 5 star is the price,"Despite being extremely expensive, this hotel is in reality a mid-range 3 star establishment.  We booked two rooms each with a double bed.  I made the booking through their own website; whilst a little more expensive they offered a free upgrade, amenities and a late check-out to 2pm.  

We arrived early and they were not able to let us check-in (which is fair enough).  When we eventually got to our rooms we found we have been given two rooms only one of which had a double bed.  I reported the matter and they basically asked me just to put up with it.  I said no.  I the had to wait two hours before they found a suitable room and I was moved two floors away from the other room we had booked.

The rooms were fine ... for a 3 star hotel.

When we checked out I accidentally left a case with some Australian currency in it in the room (stupid!)  I phoned them shortly after but the person on the phone wasn't interested and told me to send them an e-mail.  I did so.  They wrote back and said they couldn't find it, which i",1,2013,08,21
35,Excellent but something's misses for being at the top,"I've been there for business reasons and had a three nights stay. 
At first sight I was stunned by the room, spacious, sophisticated, full of comfort and with an amazing decor. All was conceived to make your stay at most, there was a fitness center and loads of great facilities.
Service in-room was very good. 
The only major issue for a businessman: the Internet connection. I had one RIM, one Android and one OS device and a laptop. I was given four passwords and tried desperately to get connected. I couldn't work. I went down to the reception to ask for solving the issue and I was told that in some rooms of the hotel the Internet connection doesn't work and that the Apple devices can be hardly connected to the system. This is unconceivable for such a hotel which hosts a World Trade Center. 
I needed to go in an outside cafe to work. My company is based in the US and had the time difference. 
I would love to come back to Eurostars Grand Marina, but surely it won't be for business purposes.",4,2013,08,21
35,Very nice BUT,Can use some better customer service.  We needed more towels so called down and it took about five to seven minutes before they answered the telephone. When they came they were frayed old towels. Called to ask for a dinner reservation be made.  I was told they were too busy I should call myself. The room is large as well as the bathroom. The breakfast is lovely.  We enjoyed our lunch there as well. Pool is very small on the roof top. Our friends room had not AC they said it broke but they could not change rooms because hotel was all booked. When they were finally were moved AC was barely working.  Rooks have large terraces but not chairs to sit outside. Beds not to comfortable pillows are flat.,4,2013,08,18
35,memorable stay,"Excellent Hotel, made all the more special by the service of the friendly staff. Attention to detail made our stay all the more special, staff always willing to help. Rooms were very good quality, self controlled air con much appreciated in the August heat!
We didn't have breakfast as we felt it was too expensive, but we were soon into the streets of Barcelona to sample the local food. We really enjoyed the location of the hotel, away from the busy streets and just a short walk to all that Barcelona had to offer.
On our last night we trated ourselves to an evening meal in the restaurant - amazing! The lounge bar also had a beautiful, relaxed ambience with a pianist providing background music.
If visiting Barcelona again we would definately treat ourselves to another stay at this hotel.",5,2013,08,17
35,Yes & No!!,"Good location for a pre or post cruise stay as this hotel is right by the cruise liner port so you can be on your ship within minutes.
A modern so called five star hotel - bit faceless but clean and bright.
On check in we had to wait 1.5 hours for our room, and that was at 4.00 p.m. in the afternoon which is outrageous.
Concierge was helpful and gave a decent recommendation for dinner.
Breakfast was frantic with a long line of waiting guests for a table. To save time we accepted the offer of a table in a rather dark ante-room off the main dining area. Not what one would expect from a five star hotel
The door keys next morning did not work, and had to go down three times before they eventually managed to give us new keys.  Did not bother to wait for a porter as it was obvious the hotel was so busy they could not cope and we would have a long wait so took them down ourselves.  Complained to a desk clerk who just shrugged his shoulders!
So yes for location if on a cruise, but there are many better choices in Barcelona than this in terms of five star hotels.",2,2013,08,15
35,Great Hotel,"During my last trip to Barcelona i had to expand my trip for one more night, unfortunately there was no availability at the apartments where i was staying so i decided to book last minute at Eurostars grand marina, this hotel is a good 5 start hotel, the room is very modern, clean , you have everything you need, small pool on the roof, with a good gym. The view from the roof 't is just amazing to the port. The staff are very welcoming. The location isn't premium if you are on your first visit and you have a tight schedule with a big list of things to do... I loved my short stay and i would recommend it to anyone, solo travelers ( guest friendly), for business or couples.",5,2013,08,12
35,Good but not great,"Grand Marina is a good hotel but not a particular central location in BNC. Big and tidy rooms, nice pool (tiny) and a big roof-top terrasse/sun-deck with a bar. The breakfast is beyond expensive in my opinion(25€) but good. Ps. Almost all the cruise-liners are parkt right beside the hotel...kind of noisy and polutiv.",4,2013,08,10
35,Great 3 night pre-cruise stay,"Stayed for 3 nights the end of July before we boarded our 12-day cruise on the Disney Magic. The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms large, and everything was clean. We had a junior suite that was more than spacious enough to accommodate 2 adults and 3 children. The breakfast buffet that was included was an amazing array of food that accommodated even the most picky eater. The wait staff were friendly and courteous. We also ate dinner at the hotel terrace restaurant during our stay. The food was delicious. An added plus was their roof top terrace. We were able to see the city and the port from high above. We jumped for joy when we were able to see from the roof of the hotel, the Disney Magic as it arrived at the adjacent port! We were a short walk to Las Ramblas, Port Vell and MareMagnum Mall.  Eurostar Grand Marina Hotel was the perfect place to stay.",5,2013,08,08
35,5-stars? Really?,"This hotel was pretty nice - and the rooms are larger than you expect in Europe - but I expected much more since it was listed as a 5-star hotel and fairly expensive.  We encountered friendly staff who spoke English well, which was nice, but I would compare this hotel to a Hilton or Marriott in terms of furnishing. It's in the marina where the cruise ships pull in, so there's a lot of activity.  It's a short walk to La Rambla, and you can catch those double-decker tour buses just outside the hotel.  Overall, a pleasant stay but I expected more.",4,2013,08,07
35,"Fabulous hotel, brilliant service","We stayed at this hotel for a week.  We were upgraded to a superior room (615) with the most fantastic view over the harbour and the city.  Our teenage children had a room with balcony looking over the city.  The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful.  They were all happy to give restaurant recommendations and shopping advice.  The pool on the roof is not really big enough for swimming but great after a long day out sightseeing and the roof area/pool/gym is a lovely place to relax.  We had room service once and found the food very good and service very prompt.  The buffet breakfast was excellent and it was also possible to order omelettes, poached eggs and speciality coffees. The food was a little expensive and drinks at the bar overpriced but I suppose that's to be expected at a hotel of this sort.  But that is a minor complaint.

The hotel is in a great location, 10 mins walk from Las Ramblas or the marina.  Also all the open top tour buses stop right outside hotel.    Great holiday and great hotel. Would be very happy to go back.",5,2013,08,06
35,A little walk to attractions but worth it,Arrived at 0900 and room was ready. Friendly staff who spoke English well. Very modern lobby and large guest rooms with a huge bathroom. Hop on Hop off buses stop right outside. Ice is extra $. Bed was VERY comfortable. It was only a 15 min walk to the start of Las Ramblas and it was great being able to get away from the tourist sections and retire to some peace and quiet.,5,2013,08,05
35,Nice hotel with excellent service,"Hotel located at the habour, not far from La Rambla. Hotel has a very high service level in all areas. Rooms have a very nice view to habour or city, rooms are very comfortable and very big. Bathrooms was equipped with jacuzzi and nice big shower area. On the roof there is a small pool area. Restaurant is very nice, with good prices and very good atmosphere. Breakfast buffet is very good and service excellent. Very good parking posibilities in the basement of the Hotel.",5,2013,07,31
35,Hotel Reception - First Impression,"Th following describe the experience my wife and I had upon arrival at the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel in Barcelona. We arrived at about 2:00pm and the reception desk was staffed by 5 employees all clustered together at the right side corner of the Reception Desk chit chatting amongst themselves and ignoring my wife and I altogether. After waiting few minutes with no one paying any attention to us, I addressed the group and asked how long will it take us to check in?. Only then did anyone notice us and proceeded to pick up our reservation (made by our travel Agent at Pro Travel in NY) and began to process our check-in. I provided my gold Amex card and was immediately billed for the full stay in the hotel. On this trip to Spain my wife and I stayed in 3 other hotels, none billed us up front and never have I been billed up front in any hotel in Europe, Asia North America or Latin America.
The person handling our reception fumbled with the credit card machine and was unable to process the card. So he called on a colleague for assistance. When the credit card was finally swept through correctly the incompetent person checking us in ripped of the printed receipt too soon handing us only ½ of the receipt while the other ½ was still being printed. So far for the unpleasant welcome to this hotal.

The hot water is so hot it scolded my hands when I went to wash them.

Finally as we were leaving the hotel, and having paid in full upon our arrival, I decided anyway to stop by the reception desk just to make sure we are fully paid. The person at the reception desk checked and told us that although we paid for the room we need to be charged separately for the hotel tax which for some reason was not included in the initial charge. So we settled the hotel tax and were glad to get away to our next stop in Spain.",2,2013,07,30
35,Good location,"Went for a long weekend, loved Barcelona will go back again very soon, but I was not impressed this hotel even though was it very convenient the receptionist (blonde girl face like a bulldog chewing a wasp, so miserable) was soooooo rude when I went to the desk she just put her arm out and said move along Ma'am,she didn't even look at me even the other receptionist was shocked ! Our room was very nice, lovely big bathroom good view of the marina, but no tea or coffee making facilities which I was not impressed with, there's a mini bar though so obviously they want you to spend money there instead. The rooftop pool wasn't in use when we went (June) they said it was because it was cold, I thought it was warm but not to worry.",3,2013,07,28
35,"Great view on the harbour, good location, comfortable rooms","We stayed in the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel during a 4-days-trip to Barcelona in March 2013. The location of the hotel is very convenient, it is right at the old port and a good 5 minutes walk from the beginning of Las Ramblas (where you can also find a tourist information). In order to get to different quarters of the city (such as for a visit of the Sagrada Familia) one can use the subway at Las Ramblas; the hotel now also offers bikes for rent (which was not the case when we were there) which is an excellent way to avoid excessively sore feet as there is so much to see in Barcelona. 

One more tip when you arrive at the airport: It's more convenient to get to the hotel by taxi, as the shuttle bus is extremely crowded, does not always stop where it is supposed to (which leaves you stranded with your bags somewhere in the city) and is not that much cheaper than a taxi. 

We had a superior room on one of the upper floors with a view on the harbour which was a real treat - when you wake up to a clear blue sky and can see the huge cruise ships as well as part of the architecture of Barcelona, this is a good start into the day. 

The rooms themselves were quite nice, modern with all necessary amenities, quiet as well (we never had trouble sleeping) and well cleaned every day. Of course there are larger rooms available (deluxe rooms or suites), but if like us you're mainly in Barcelona to discover the city and don't do more than sleeping in the hotel this will probably not really bother you. 

We also quite liked the hotel's interior architecture, already the lobby is quite modern and spacious with lots of light. You can feel that Barcelona is a place where people take architecture quite seriously....!

The service was very good as well, the staff was always friendly and helpful. Breakfast was excellent too, lots of choice and a nice setting (also on a terrace). 

We enjoyed our stay at this hotel very much and would not hesitate to book it again - which we certainly will as it was not our last stay in Barcelona.",5,2013,07,24
35,Very average - not worth 5 stars!,"I used Hotwire to book this hotel (doesn't show name, but tells you stars and approx location). I had previously gotten the w so I was really hoping for it again but instead landed the eurostars grand marina. I was still open minded and excited to try it out, however it did not meet expectations. It's not that it isn't a nice hotel - it's just that it isn't worth 5 stars. Our bathroom would occasionally smell like sulphur (yuck!) and the room service was frustrating - always moving things around and never being able to easily find! But I did enjoy the view from the pool, and it was pretty close to the drassanes metro stop near la rambla. I wouldn't recommend the hotel unless you are getting a really good deal! ",3,2013,07,23
35,You're joking. Not a 5star environment,"Having traveled the world, experiencing some of the worlds most popular 4 and 5 star hotels, this hotel gets a 3. 

The thought of being charge $5 euros for a small bucket of ice says it all. The check in receptionists are not first class customer service agents. 

The housekeeping is one at can be enhanced by a simple box of tissue and better care products. No body lotion, not hand soap. The clean up service is also disappointing. 

They didn't know I spoke Spanish, all they did was complain about their lives. 

Gym is nice, pool is ok, small, but ok.  The bar staff at the pool has attitude. They acted as though I was bothering them for a soda. Really?  

The concierge is also the bell hop,  I laughed out loud when I had to correct him on a simple fact I learned in a tour guide. 

Two worlds ""not good"".

35,"Nice Hotel, Good location.","We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and had a great time.  The rooms were very spacious and comfortable, however we did have two single beds pushed together to make a larger double which was a bit awkward.  The air conditioning in the room wasn't the most powerful and we had a few warm evenings. The staff were very helpful and the facilities in the hotel were fantastic.  The hotel did seem to be a little bit more business orientated rather than geared towards couples or families. The location of the hotel was also fantastic with it being so close to the marina and La Ramblas.  Overall we had a fantastic time.",4,2013,07,21
35,Away from the crowds,"Stayed for a long weekend mid July. Hotel is located next to where the cruise ships come in, about a 5 min walk from La Ramblas. Great location and nice and quiet away from the busy Ramblas. 

Staff on Reception and in the breakfast room excellent. 

Stayed in a Junior Suite which was very big. Even had two loos!

Breakfast was an excellent buffet.

Pool area although small was very nice.

Hotel extremely clean.

Overall would stay here again and would recommend.",4,2013,07,19
35,Perfect location for cruisers,"We stayed 1 night at the end of April and it was in a perfect location literally 2 minutes walk from the cruise ship embarkation point. Couldn't fault the hotel - staff , room and amenities were excellent. Highly recommended.",5,2013,07,16
35,Nice hotel with excellent rooms in a great location,"Upon arrival at the hotel, my partner and I didn't think it looked very luxurious or befitting of its 5* status- the lobby in particular was rather bland and uninspiring. However, the room itself was very well-appointed with excellent amenities: The bed was big and comfortable, the TV large with decent channels and the bathroom huge, with nice toiletries. We were really pleased with the room overall and it was spotlessly clean too.

In terms of location, it was very pleasant to be right beside the water- it's a no-brainer if you're going on a cruise. We weren't, however we found it to be close to many attractions, along with numerous transport options. The area is extremely safe and we had no problem with walking back to the hotel late at night.

The hotel offers a lot: A very small (but nicely done) pool, a gym (which looked excellent) and various food and drink options. We only had time to visit the pool/rooftop bar area once but it was a nice experience. 

The service was good in general, however we felt we received a warmer welcome from everyone but the front desk staff! 

While we were very pleased overall, there were definitely some cons: Prepare to be charged for pretty much everything- even ice! In all the hotels around the world that we have stayed at, this is the first one that charged for ice. WiFi is free but the signal was just terrible and it kept cutting off. Also, turndown service was offered but it had to be requested- shouldn't that come as standard at a 5* hotel? We were also disappointed that we weren't asked if we'd enjoyed our stay when we checked out.  

Nonetheless, we really enjoyed our stay and we will most likely be back next time we're in Barcelona.",4,2013,07,16
35,Lovely hotel would definitely book again.,"Arrived and was pleasantly surprised by the swift check in. Hotel is clean and very convenient for strolling las Ramblas and also Port Vell area. Sightseeing buses stop right outside.
Room was large clean and  airy. Only strange thing was a kettlle and cups but no coffee etc.
Would definitely stay here again",5,2013,07,11
35,"Great Location, Great Room, Nice Restaurant","Some of the best staff we encountered in Barcelona.  Everyone spoke English perfectly.  Got our room early.  Great view with a very nice décor and comfort.  Nice location for cruises, metro and the Ramblas.  The restaurant was adequate with a nice happy hour menu.  They also provided a nice breakfast.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,07,10
35,Not as Expected,"I stayed at this hotel with my wife for one night. The room was very spacious, and the hotel lobby was nice. Yet, I cannot rate this hotel higher than what I did for the following reasons:

The bed was uncomfortable at all, although I was very tired, I could not have a good night sleep, as the mattress was not comfortable, nor the pillows. The staff at the front desk were rude and did not greet guests with a smile. On top of that, they gave me wrong information about the tax free office, where they gave me wrong opening time.

At the time of check-in, one guest was complaining to the reception that his room is not being cleaned although he called housekeeping several times, and then I experienced the same thing. We left the hotel at 8am, and came back around 12 noon and yet our room was not cleaned although the ""Clean My Room"" tag was clearly hanged on the handle of the door. We called housekeeping for extra towels, once, twice and thrice and that's when someone knocked on the door, gave me the towels with a frown and not in a good order.

In this hotel, the guest feels as if he/she is staying at this hotel for free, all hotel staff are frowning and never smile at customers. If you ask for assistance they literally yell as if they are saying, ""What the hell do you want?"". I'm not sure what are the issues but service is the most important thing in a hotel, that's why I cannot rate this hotel more than a 2.",2,2013,07,03
35,Terrible service,"Great rooms and a convenient location but the service is nowhere near that of a 5 star hotel. The hotel was not ready to receive visitors..even at 3pm on our arrival day we were told that our room was still not available. It took us over 30 minutes to check in. We then waited a further 30 minutes for our bags to arrive, only to go downstairs and collect them ourselves as they were still sitting at reception. Very poor experience for a 5 star hotel. ",2,2013,07,02
35,More for business users than family,Lovely hotel all round. Views are not brilliant. Service is a1. Bar staff are a1. Very bland hotel in general though. No atmosphere at all. We have come here as a couple and one year old baby. They accomodated greatly and went above and beyond which was nice but there was nothing to do for the baby. We had to get taxi to the old beach. Nevertheless would definitley stay here again withouth the baby. Staff are a1 and rooms and room service and cleansiness is top notch. ,4,2013,06,29
35,Good hotel and location excellent.,"A short break in Barcelona with one eye on next years maraton.  Hotel location great for walking into the city.  We walked pretty much everywhere from the hotel.  Check-in was easy and quick.  We arrived at 1147 and didn't expect our room to be ready but the staff done a bit of room jiggling and we were able to have a room early.  Nice :-)

Room good, bed comfortable.  We ate in the restaurant one evening and it was OK nothing special and if I consider the cost wouldn't have eaten there again.  Get down the Ramblas go top end or off the sides for some nice eateries.

We had a quick dip in the swimming pool and it is more a plunge pool.  Can't be much than 40ft. in length but was pleasant enough.  The hot tub was good.  Gym very well equipped but I 'don't do gyms'.  Sauna is a one man / woman jobbie in the changing room and staff has to be notified 20 minutes prior to crank the thing up.  It looked good enough if you wanted a sauna on your own.

I would certainly stay there again.  Staff helpful and good.  Clean.  Oh, and if your a true Brit and like a tea / coffee in your room whilst there is a kettle in the room you have to request tea / coffee.   Wi-fi good but slow at night when all the 'suits' are banging away on their lappies at night creating blue sky thinking, out of the box jingoistic nonsense for the next days presentation / course or whatever.

Oh, nearly forgot.  Breakfast OK hot and cold and continental type thing going on.  Again a little on the expensive side.  Coffee poor.  One cup is poured by the waitress and that's your lot unless you ask for another cup.  Just leave us a pot of coffee please.

A good hotel.  Great city.",3,2013,06,29
35,"Fantastic location, great room, reception staff weren't great","The location of this hotel is great, you are on the water, wake up to the view of boats, and can walk to many attractions. It was also at the same time slightly away from the hustle and bustle, which keeps it quiet.
The rooms were also great, HUGE, for sure the biggest room we have ever had in a European hotel. As we were there for several days, this made a difference for our family. We also like the bathrooms which were themselves separated into two areas.
The breakfast was quite good, and there was a nice variety. 
However, the staff at reception weren't very helpful, and made several mistakes on different issues, not only with us, but with the other travelers in our party as well.",4,2013,06,15
35,Great location,"I love the location, central for las ramblas and port.  Minutes walk from choices of restaurants.  Tourist hop on hop off buses stop within yards of the entrance and come every 5-10 mins.  On check in agent was not that attentive, nothing about the services of the hotel were explained.  Had to ask for wi FI details.   Deluxe rooms vary, initially i had one with a balcony, twin beds, seperate dressing area, but I moved out of choice to be near the other members of my family, still in a deluxe room, but had a bath and a separate shower cubicle, no balcony. Room with 2 windows, one with an office view and the other with a slight sea view. Deluxe room has iron & boards, kettle, cups, mini bar - chargeable - we asked for mini bar to be emptied so we could use as a fridge instead and it was no problem. No complementary tea or coffee, bring your own! hair dryer, slippers, toiletries in bathroom - packet tissues, shower gel and hair shampoo. Bed comfy, choice of pillows offered, good wardrobe and drawer space.
Business centre is great, free use of Internet and printer facilities if wanting to print off those last minute attraction tickets.
Outside space, 3 cafes within the centre of world trade centre, mainly business workers use, 8th floor have swimming pool, gym and space if just want to sit and watch the coming and going in the port and sunning one self.
Would recommend to anyone preferring not to have a city hotel and would definitely stay here again.",4,2013,06,12
35,"Upscale, but Service Was Lacking","Very nice sized rooms and beautiful looking hotel near the beaches, World Trade Center, and less than 5 minutes from The Rambla.  Took 3 says to get an iron sent up, and some if staff did not seem as overtly friendly.  My room Internet signal was weak, but others had a better experience.   More appealing option for those wanting to be near the beaches/port than the best shopping, but pricey.  ",3,2013,06,11
35,Great Barcelona Location!,"The best place I've stayed in Barcelona.  5 minute walk to cruise ship shuttle busses (T3), Christopher Columbus Monument, Ras Ramblas Blvd, and shopping.   My window overlooked the cruise ships and the cable car.  Very reasonably priced and friendly staff.  Five stars!",5,2013,06,09
35,Really Nice Weekend,"The Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel is a lovely hotel in an excellent location right on the Marina. Staff were superb all through our stay I must say, the breakfast selection was the best I have ever seen, and the Piano Bar was a lovely place to unwind after a long day. They even mixed up a coctail for me that was not on the menu. The rooms were large by European standards, and the seperate shower and bath areas was handy, as was the double sink. There also was lots of Wardrobe space, free WiFi and a free safe in the room. There was even live music on Sunday morning at breakfast! My only complaint was that the toiletries were poor and not enough towels for the hotel standard. The Pool area was nice (water was freezing) but 7e for a bottle of San Miguel a little steep. I love Barcelona and suspect I will be back at the Eurostars!",5,2013,06,06
35,Great location at bottom of La Rambla,"Great location, Clean modern style hotel, right at the bottom of La Rambla and on the open top bus tour route, whose stop is in front of the hotel. Huge clean room and friendly staff. Concierge gave several great restaurant recommendations.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,06,05
35,Barcelona Bank Holiday,"Great location and good sized rooms.
Really good for Tourist bus and Las Ramblas as both in walking distance.
Safe feeling around.

Little issues make it a good hotel but not a 'luxury'.
-no bathrobes despite having pool
-pool shut but no warning on booking
-poor service at bar for food and drinks
-no choice of room site at check in
-poor toileteries
-noisy rooms if facing in on courtyard

Ask for city view rooms as these have best view.
Breakfast is worth extra and great service.
Would return because of position and safe",4,2013,06,03
35,Bad staff attitude..nothing was possible!,"Good breakfast. Large and sterile environment.  Nice room but no view except into an office complex. Temperature in room could not be adjusted.  Room missing soaps & insufficient towels.

Staff at front desk was rude and inflexible & not at all interested in pleasing customer. Our tour manager had contacted the hotel manager one week before our arrival for an upgrade to accommodate a family member, but they then the desk staff refused me on arrival.  It took the tour manager to straighten it out. Mistakes happen, but no excuse for poor staff attitude.  

Ineptness continued in the bar area where we waited 30 minutes for drinks and over an hour for snacks.  Bar staff was ill-trained and couldn't cope with the guests.  Concierge seldom at desk for assistance.  Front desk refused to set up 2 accounts in the same room so my friend and I could have separate bar charges.  This was also ""not possible"".  

Would not stay here again.",2,2013,06,02
35,Excellent choice !,"lovely staff , great Breakfast , near to Marina and La ramblla . 

We had a triple room and it was huge , room service was great as well .  

One thing , there was no coffee or tea just water , and that was awkward because its 5 star hotel .  

However , I would stay in this hotel if I visit Barcelona again !",4,2013,06,01
35,Great hotel is good location,"When we checked in, we had been awake for over 24 hours and were really ready to relax.  The front desk check in lady told us she was upgrading us to a superior room, however, when I looked at my reservation, I had reserved and paid for a superior room.  Anyway, the room was really nice...with the most awesome shower I have ever used!  The bathroom was the size of my living room, with a bidet and jacuzzi tub, along with the shower with what my husband dubbed ""carwash"" jets.  The king sized bed was super comfortable and the room was clean, nice and pleasant.  We had a balcony and enjoyed the fresh air.  We were able to walk to marina restaurants for dinner and while we had difficulty finding a breakfast location (the hotel wanted 35 euros pp for a breakfast...no way, Jose), we managed to get produce and cheese/crackers from a local market to nourish us on our way.  We spent only one night at the hotel, as we were departing on a cruise the following afternoon.",5,2013,05,31
35,"Location, Location, Location","This is an excellent hotel for a short city break, as it is so central to various sights and travel amenities.  Just a short pleasant stroll to La Rambla, Mare Marina and the port area, and the quite excellent Bus Turistic hop on hop off service stops outside the door.  There are also many taxis outside all the time and the doormen will make sure nothing is lost in translation!  The staff in general are all friendly and efficient and all speak excellent English.

The building resembles one of the cruise liners that dock right along side, and the corridors to the rooms reflect that same feel - wood panelling not dissimilar to liners of old.  Rooms are spacious and chic and bathrooms excellent.  Go for a city view room - the vista is incredible.  Beds are firm and we slept well despite various huge ships coming and going outside - the sound insulation is great.

I would also recommend a B&B package - the breakfast buffet  is vast and will set you up for the day.  The Lobby lounge is a pleasant spot for a drink - waiting staff could be more attentive here however - we felt invisible on occaision and had to go to the bar to order despite several staff being apparently available.

If I was going to be excessively picky I would mention the sometimes erratic A/C system, the temperamental room keycards and the disappointing toiletries.  I would also say that the hotel is quite naughty in trumpeting the swimming pool (a factor which encouraged our booking) without mentioning it is open seasonally (to open 1st June this year).  However none of these factors detracted from a great stay, and we would recommend highly.",5,2013,05,29
35,very good hotel,"An excellent hotel, we were a couple and four-year-old girl and a baby, we got a large family room with a bathtub and a large, comfortable bed,room service was efficient, breakfast was superb rich and delicious and of course the wonderful location on the marina of Barcelona Distance few minutes from the city center, the staff was pleasant and accommodating. Sure go back there on my next visit on this wonderful city.",5,2013,05,28
35,Lovely Suite but Smoke smells Linger,"Stayed three nights at the end of a cruise. Very handy to the cruise docks, in fact a little too handy as there were different ships moored just off our balcony on all three days which obscured the view somewhat. Suite itself was lovely at around 350 euros. Food in the hotel is expensive for a light breakfast but of reasonable quality. Handy to the Marina district and about a 5 to 10 minute walk to the bottom of Las Ramblas. No coffee maker but room service coffee pot was large and served quickly. Take the short walk up to the bottom of Las Ramblas for a couple of little patisseries that provide fresh baked croissants and reasonable coffee for a very modest price. All in all a great location, comfortable room and friendly service. Friends who stayed at other hotels in town with similar amenities paid a lot more so the little irritants were easily tolerated.",4,2013,05,28
35,Great hotel in a good location,"Although advertised as a 5 star hotel, I would say it was more a 4*. Priced very reasonably compared with other 5* hotels. The staff were very welcoming and only to happy to help us. It appeared to be mostly frequented by business travellers rather than tourists. The breakfast was varied and excellent. The hotel contains a small gym on the top floor, plus a small pool on the roof (which was out of use when we stayed).
The room was clean and functional, although some of the furniture looked tired and dated.
Be aware that the large cruise liner dock by either side of this hotel, and they do apparently come in at odd times, so it could get noisy, but we never had any problems. In fact it was a pleasure to look out of our window and watch these behemoths coming in to dock.
It has an excellent location just 5 minutes walk from La Rambla.
Just outside the hotel is a bus stop for the City Sightseeing hop-on hop-off service - we got a 2-day pass (saving money) which allowed us to visit virtually every attraction very easily. The buses come frequently so there was never a long wait.
The marina is just opposite the hotel and is a short walk.

All in all a great stay and would definitely stay here again.",4,2013,05,28
35,Amazing view,"i stayed in this hotel for a week . It was a good place but what i love most the view .. I booked a room with balcony for port vell which was amaaaaazing . Also the staff was friendly in the reception and in the front door and the breakfast . The breakfast i think was under my expectations and did not mach a five stars hotel .
The location was perfect which is about 7 minutes walk to rambala and the metro station ..
There are no tea and coffee maker in the room",4,2013,05,27
35,Location! Location!,"We have just returned from a delightful four night stay at the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel which boasts a fabulous position on the harbour front. We stayed in a superior room which was excellent. However, there were a few points that I would not expect from a 5 star rated hotel.  There were that no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms.On one morning there was a long queue for breakfast although it was well managed. Also we found that housekeeping were not generous with toiletries in fact we had to ring reception who did arrange for them immediately.
Apart from those points fantastic but they should not have been an issue at a 5 star price.",4,2013,05,21
35,Horrible!!!,"I had some clients staying over and I must say I have never had a worse experience with any
hotel.  The Hotel LOST a package for one of the clients and the General Manager was downright insulting when we had a problem with one of the reservations.  
The ground staff is friendly and try to be helpful but Mr. Lagermann (Manager) is not the
best example of what a Director of a 5 star Luxury hotel should be.

Signed: a very upset customer",1,2013,05,21
35,Worth a little bit extra,"The hotel is very contemporary but my husband and I loved it.  You can't beat the location.  Just a couple of minutes from the pier, if you are taking a cruise.  Las Ramblas is a very short walk away.  The marina district is a few minute walk with shopping and tons of excellent restaurants.  The hop on hop off busses stop right in front of the hotel.  What more could you ask for? Breakfast was included in our stay and was superb.  It is pricey but the quality of the food and service is top notch. We had tapas in the bar in the evening and they were very good.  The room was very large by European standards.  Very nice bathroom, Jacuzzi tub, double sinks, the bed was comfortable and you can choose different kinds of pillows to your liking.  The TV had quite a few English channels, along with just about every other language.  The pool was being renovated and that was a disappointment but what can you do?  We would stay here again.",5,2013,05,18
35,A good comfortable stay,"Stayed here with my wife who was on business, whilst I did some sightseeing. Rooms are a reasonable size, great bathroom, walk in wardrobe/dressing room.  A few negatives; no tea/coffee making facilities (come on guys we don't want room service for coffee), no drawers in the bedroom only in the dressing room. Breakfast excellent, coffee is passable if you take it black. Bar is big open space so a bit soulless. They make a great mojito. Tapas from bar were tasty.  The location has it's pros and cons. It's at the end of the pier and a good ten minute walk to the ramblas. There is a taxi rank outside and the number 20 bus from the pier will take you up into town for a couple of euros. ",4,2013,05,16
35,Poor service all round,"Unfortunately our stay with this hotel was not satisfactory for various reasons. We chose to stay at the hotel because it advertised a swimming pool but it was closed until the summer which would have been good to know prior to booking given that it was a main reason for staying – with a small child it's a great thing to have on site. The pool is also tiny in reality.

The walls in our room were so thin that we heard the couple next door to us having sex which was very unpleasant for a 4year old to try to understand. We were informed that they were full and had no other rooms, we were prepared to pay to upgrade room just to move. We also had some laundry done and they charge the same for children as they do for adults which seems ridiculous given they're half the size. We've since returned and found holes in some items.

Our room was also not cleaned on the Sunday and when we returned at 1800 housekeeping were just getting around to our room but having a child and being out all day we did not want to have to vacate our room again while it was being cleaned as we were tired. We would have expected this to have been done during the day. We left at 1000 in the morning. We had to ask for clean towels and soap. When we explained this to the reception staff we were told the rooms are only cleaned every third day - they'd been cleaned the previous day so made no sense and not what you'd expect from a 5-star hotel.

I ordered room service, which was pretty much burnt and inedible. I found most of the staff very welcoming but a lot of the reception staff quite surly, indifferent and unhelpful. The hotel was recommended but would not return or recommend given our experience.",2,2013,05,14
35,Great with a little 'but'...,"Not the type of hotel I would personally choose for myself, but stayed there due to work obligations. Extremely interesting and convenient location, comfortable and nicely decorated rooms (those beds and the awesome choice of pillows!:-) ) and most of all the delightful piano bar with live music, mouthwatering tapas menu and a discreet and efficient service are on the plus side. Yet somehow, the building itself is a bit soulless and overwhelming instead of welcoming. I would say a great business hotel,  but Barcelona offers way more interesting options for private stays.",4,2013,05,14
35,easy for going on ship-cruise,"The location in the WTC is just beside the entrance for the cruise-ships.  The center of the town is very near (Ramblas).
The staff is very helpful to take the suit-cases to the room and to the ship. I even could see our ship from my window.The reception-service is perfect, the room was big enough and very clean. In the hotel are different restaurants with a good service.
I got the very best breakfast-service of my life: sitting in the restaurant the outside-door was open and it was still a little bit cold in the morning. My tea got cold quite soon, so I asked the staff, if they could shange me a hot cup. They did it endeed every 5 minutes as long as I was having breakfast.!",5,2013,05,14
35,Good. Breakfast very crowdy in the breakfast room. Keycards to the sleepingroom did not work all the time.,"This hotel is well recommanded by my family, especially the electric bikes for rent are super!! Breakfast is very variété and fresh, the personell is very helpfull. With Children it,s a friendly hotel vut always  and waiting at the reception desk.
      ",4,2013,05,10
35,Beauiful modern clean hotel,"My husband and I stayed at this wonderful hotel in April-  we stayed bed and breakfast and was delighted that we had as the breakfast was great - service was great too - very friendly staff - from the moment we drove up to the hotel we were made to feel welcome and the reception staff were helpful advising us where to visit etc.
Didn't have any drinks in the hotel but im sure they were expensive but didnt feel the need to as we were always late back to the hotel - nice bar area though.
The room was imaculate as too the bathroom- didnt really hear the noise that a few moaners had complained about- was so tired after touring that we didnt hear a thing.
The walk to Las Ramblers was indeed only 7 minutes - we made the mistake of buying lunch on the main strip which was expensive and not very good- not worth the money - we did however find  Placa Reial which was situated off the Las Ramblas if you turn off towards the entrance between Mcdonalds and Kentucky Fried chicken corner you cant miss the square with lovely outside and inside restuarants- very good value for money- lovely food - our favourite was Les Quinze Nits- always a queue but see that as a good sign so well worth the wait- great atmosphere.
Went on the tour bus both red and blue line- caught directly outside the hotel and dropped off there also- hop on and off buses all day long - got to see lots we would have missed due to our short stay and great views of the city at the same time- well worth doing.
Was going to get a taxi back to the airport but the hotel porter kindly asked us if we would like to use the hotel car for the trip for a charge of 35 euros - this was cheaper than the cost of a taxi so we accepted his offer- so glad we did as a moment later a chauffer driven mecedes rolled up and we jumped in- lovely way to finish off the holiday yaaaaayh!! happy days! will defo be using this super hotel on our next visit - ignore any negative comments u read !!!!",5,2013,05,07
35,Good place at a great location - but plenty of little frustrations,"Located at the Marina, walking distance from Las Ramblas but still very quiet at nights, this is an overall OK hotel but not the best in Barcelona

Pros:
- nice room (we had a city suite) with great view. We could sleep really well
- Restaurant is good quality
- service is nice and kind
- location - really great base to discover the whole city

Cons:
- unreliable WIFI (which was free though)
- would really be great to ahve a sofa in the city suites (there is a table with 3 uncomfortable chairs)
- for some strange reason, they only give one litle soap for the whole suite
- no tissues (Kleenex) in the room except a tiny bag
- room walls are not very thick, you can hear noise from corridor and neighbouring room
- whole place feels a bit empty and lacks character

Overall these are small things, but given the price range, they bug you. So it is good but not great value overall",4,2013,05,05
35,Nice plaze,"A good hotel  with good service and good location. Big breakfast  bufe and friendly staff in the morning 
Good room service!
What one can complain  about is the staff in the bar and dinning area.
Cloese to city!",5,2013,04,29
35,Lavish!!,Amazing property!The pictures on the website not half as good as the property.Very professional and caring staff.Lavish breakfast.The property needs to be marketed better. Great view .The sun rising over the city of Barcelona is a photographer's delight.Attention given to detail...as lavish as it could be.,4,2013,04,29
35,THE NOISIEST HOTEL IN MY 35 COUNTRY TRAVELS 26 APRIL 2013,"This hotel is wlll  set out and positiones...but it appears and performs like it was made on the ""Cheap"".... 
I had a suite on the 3rd floor...walls were made of particle boards no more that 10 mmm thick as were the floors and uncovered...no carpeting whatsoever...

The rooms are like echo chambers or sound  amplifiers...... absolutely no privacy from the occupants next door.... one can hear the neighbours drop a pair of socks on their floor.

In terms of noise and terrible sleeps this place rates the worse my travels spanning a decade and 35 countries.

Be ware...all that glitters is not gold!!!",2,2013,04,28
35,Pre cruise,"A true 5 star. From the location, to the employees, to the ambiance. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. The room was ""hospital "" clean. The front desk was extremely helpful and ""DAMA"" the doorman knew so much about Bacelona. If you asked he had walking direction, Metro schedules, places to eat and where not to go. Last but not least the exchange rate was fair without that huge commission. If in Europe don't miss this hotel or city. Barcelona in one of the most beautiful ,vibrant , friendly cities I have had the pleasure to visit.",5,2013,04,28
35,"Comfortable, clean, great service and convenient",We have stayed 3 nights before getting on  cruise ship.  The hotel is on the Marina so close to the ships and also close to Las Ramblas Street.  We love Barcelona and on the next stay plan to return to this hotel,5,2013,04,25
35,Great location and staff,"Stayed here with my husband on a short break , location great near la rambla and also close to the stop for the open top busses which were recommended by jean the concierge who told us the good places to see and the routes of the busses which we used all day great for seeing most of the city in short time. The port Olympic is a lovely twenty min walk . Staff friendly and helpfull thank you would stay here again.",4,2013,04,22
35,Very nice hotel,I stayed in this hotel in March 2013.  It was very clean and the staff very helpful. It is close to La Rambla which was really nice.  It is not far to get to a lot of tourists places and I would recommend it to everyone.,4,2013,04,22
35,Great location nice hotel,"My wife and I have just returned from a 5 night break to the beautiful city of Barcelona.We stayed at the Eurostars Grand Marina hotel and generally we were very pleased with the standard.
Having read some reviews which claimed the rooms which faced the sea could be noisy we were recommended a junior suite overlooking the world trade plaza and were completely satisfied with the result. Ok the view was poor but it is very quiet.
The check in went smoothly although we had a problem understanding the check in ladies English but we got there.
The location of the hotel is perfect with a 10 minute stroll to La Rambla.
The junior suite was very large, kept very clean and was tastefully decorated.
One fault was the absence of a coffee maker or perhaps the room was so large we just didn't find it.
We didn't eat at the hotel as we believed the price of breakfast was extortionate and really there are so many nice cafes close at hand in the old town.
Beware the price of drinks in the hotel bar,they are really expensive however the bar was usually busy and the staff were very good, especially the girl Ana,I think that's her name, who appeared to be the supervisor. She was attentive and courteous.
Generally we could not find a fault with any of the staff.
On the down side the hotel lacks a spa which really is a no no for a 5 star.
The hotel pool was closed but anyone who would have ventured into it would have deserved a bravery award as the weather was very cold on the fist 3 days of our stay.
All in all I would recommend this hotel.",4,2013,04,21
35,4 day break,"Great hotel, super location for le rambla and the  centre. Reception check in by Hallar srta was very professional, helpful top marks to her. The room was serviced very well again top marks.  

However it stops there. The pool was closed. The hairdressers was closed. 

It took over 30 minute to get served in the 1st floor bar even after we asked a manager Sergio Pascual for the Drinks menu. It was not busy only 7 people in the bar terrible, terrible attitude and service.  We had to call him again before we got served ! 

Would w stay there again? Yes because of location an cleanliness of room, but don't visit the first floor lounge if you are thirsty, you will die before you get your drink.",3,2013,04,20
35,When in BARCELONA do.........,"This hotel is a pretty cool place to stay ! The actual hotel is well appointed and the staff are all really kind and helpful. BUT drinks, coffee, breakfast and food are all over priced. SO in the mornings DO get up ( 8am ish ) and walk about 200 paces to the little cafe under the North ( world Trade Centre ) building and grab coffee, pastries, fresh orange juice and yogurts for about 10Eu total and take it back to the room ( or better still the roof area outside the gym ), the staff dont mind this at all.
DO - Remember that this is a marina hotel and that large Passenger cruise liners and Cargo ships DO dock here and have their engines running sometimes overnight - BUT i have to say that the noise they make is strangely soporific and sleeping is pretty easy even with the noise. 
DO not use the tourist bus ! Its really expensive. 
DO - get yourself a 3, or 5 day Metro ( TMB ) pass at any of the Metro stations - This seems expensive BUT actually works out really really cheap and you can take the bus, tram, metro all over the city. Trust me its fine.
There is a BUS No: 20 almost sat outside the hotel at all times and it takes you towards the congress area - but you can get off at any of the stops and goes right through central Barcelona. Just look at the map on the side of the bus stop and you will soon get to grips with the buses etc. its actually fun NOT to be ripped off.
The METRO is a Fabulous way to travel! But beware pickpockets - DO NOT leave anything exposed - It will get stolen !!....Girls use a small 'zipped up' handbag and guys keep your wallet and phone in front pockets of ( tight ) jeans. In fact that applies to all areas of Barcelona.

Aerobus from the airport is the way to travel at 5.9 euros each ( Taxi is 30 Euros ). It takes you to Espanya or Catulunya in the City ( Plus other stops ) and the Metro ( L3 ) will then take you down to vallen

DO Go to 'Mount Tibidabo' on a nice sunny, calm day. and take the Metro ( L7 ) to the tram and then get the old tram up the hill to where the funicular railway starts. ( DO use the furthest bar at this level before getting on the funicular ) for a drink and a good look over the city.

OK this is going to sound strange BUT also go visit the Port Forum - Its located at the very bottom of your map on the right side. You can use the bus or better still the new high speed tram ( yes your ticket works on this too ) - You will get a good port ( Marina ) to walk around, no hussling, splendid view of the Photo Voltaic panel and in fact its a really nice place to just be....Go for it- you wont be dissapointed.

Places to Eat: 'La Fonda' - Port Olimpic on the side of the Marina, is excellent.
Els 4Gats - Is really cool and dont read too much crap about tourist trap etc - Its Good - very Good.
A small Restaurant on the side of the Port Museum is 'Habana Restaurant' - its small and very nice - good fresh fish and prawns.

The Sagrada and Gaudi attractions are really not worth the queuing - And if you DO want to go then make it late friday or early Saturday morning ( 10 am open ) as this is normally the hotel change over days and crowds are less. 

NOTE: If you like rollerblading - Take your skates - its roller heaven in Barcelona - especially near Port Forum.

The area down near carerra de picasso is also really cool, nice park and we did find the zoo - albeit too late.  But the restaurants and night life very spanish and not at all touristy.

35,Had a wonderful anniversary break here,"We booked this hotel through top secret hotels as we couldn't decide where to stay.  We upgraded to the celebration break as it was our wedding anniversary and got the amazing breakfast and champagne (cava) and chocolate strawberries.  All wonderful.   We asked for a kettle to be put in the room as there was no coffee machine but we really didn't use it all that much.  There are good value cafes and restaurant at the rear of the hotel in the WTC.  It is a short walk to the Drassanes metro station which we used to get around to all the Gaudi attractions.  Also a short walk to the hustle and bustle of the Ramblas.  
The breakfast is amazing-a very wide selection of food and drink as well as champagne and wine.  Staff were all helpful and attentive.  The rooms and public areas were gleaming.  There is a pillow menu which I haven't seen before allowing you to choose your own type of pillow.  Both the shower and the bath have massage jets!
We would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2013,04,13
35,Convenient,"We stayed here before taking a cruise from Barcelona in Dec. We were a short taxi ride from the cruise terminal. This was a great place to tour the city as an On&Off  Tour Bus stopped almost at the front door and we were within an easy walk to the Ramblas.
Included free WiFi also.
We booked online and were upgraded.
Very helpful staff.",5,2013,04,09
35,Perfect mix,"Eurostars Grand Marina is a mixture of business men, families and couples hotel. Once you are inside you can see why ! They manage to have something for every one, nothing more nothing less. 

However there are some down points; the harbor beside the hotel can be noisy especially in the nighttime. The hotel needs a Spa, children playground and a split air-condition between rooms; we were freezing one night.      

On the positive side, The room is excellent! room services very helpful. The hotel location is perfect. Breakfast is acceptable, good but same every day.",4,2013,04,09
35,Decent hotel; location not the best.,"Overall I thought it was average but the individual categories it appeared to be much better.  Never would have found this hotel on Trip Advisor.  Only booked because I decided to spin the Russian roulette wheel on Hotwire.com for 5 star hotels. 

Location was poor in that nothing is around you out on the water. Yes the Rambla is 5 min away but so many other hotels have bars, restaurants, stores, etc outside your hotel. 

The wifi is awful in the room; unusable. 

Bar on 1st floor is nice. Service was good. Their main bartender we nicknamed the ""the mixologist"" was so into his craft that it was great to watch him. 

Quick to get a taxi. 

Computers and printers were free of charge and they have 3 which was nice. Bought Barcelona FC tix easily. 

Rooms were very clean. AC was suspect even in April when it was cold out. 

",3,2013,04,08
35,Fabulous!,"This holiday was an important part of a wonderful vacation in Barcelona.  The room service was incredible, the staff wonderfully accommodating, the room - excellent, and the location of the hotel extremely convenient.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,04,08
35,Erroneous billing,"I booked this hotel nine months ago on their website. I didn't choose to prepay but nonetheless the charge appeared on my credit card statement. I thought that was odd, so I brought a copy of it with me. Sure enough, they wanted to bill me again. I showed them the credit card statement. It did no good. I called the credit card company in their presence, and the representative told them I had already paid for it. That did no good. So it is onmy bill and I get to contest it. They explained it all as a ""pre authorization"". That simply ignores the facts. I definitely would not recommend this hotel. ",1,2013,04,06
35,Comfortable and well located business hotel,"I stay in this hotel very often for business. I have stayed in other business hotels in Barcelona but location-wise this is unbeatable (because its close to my office although being close to the ocean is quite nice). I have stayed in other 5 star hotels in Barcelona and in other major cities in Europe so those will be my point of reference. So lets get to it...

The building
The building is part of a business complex (World trade center) right by the ocean. It is walking distance from the rambla and to tons of nice restaurants. It is a modern building that feels like a business hotel (clean and simple) but lacks the charm or character of other 5 star hotels. 

Rooms
The rooms are spacious with jacuzzis in every room. They typically have the bed, a small sitting area a desk and in some cases a small terrace. The bathroom is well equipped with everything you need (all the way to toothbrushes and shaving cream) but don't expect the typical luxurious brands that you would get in a 5 star GL, here they have hotel branded stuff which is just OK. The bed is not really as luxurious and plush as large hotel chains (large but simple bed). The TV has a reasonable amount of channel options although most hotels would in Barcelona. You get free Internet in the rooms which is a nice plus. 

Breakfast and restaurant
This is very good with a lot of options and typically good fresh fruit and a large variety of food. They have two eating areas, the bar and the restaurant. The restaurant has fairly decent food which is also available for room service (I.e. fairly decent room service). The bar is ok if you are staying in the hotel with a piano which makes for a pleasant chill but very little ambiance. 

Service
Overall nice and attentive (as is common in Spain) but they tend to be a bit slow especially if you have a problem (again probably a country rather than a hotel effect). So if you don't have a problem (which should be the case for 90% of your visits) you will just feel the nice side of the service. 

Overall
If you are looking for true luxury you should go to the Arts or other hotels in Barcelona (far more expensive) but if you look for a comfortable business hotel at a very reasonable price this is the place for you. Although you won't walk away feeling like you just slept at the George V, everything will have been fine so you'll feel like you've made a great deal...",4,2013,04,05
35,Simply amazing!,"Surprised my boyfriend with a weekend trip to Barcelona in December, the city itself is stunning and the hotel surpassed all our expectations. We were made to feel very special and the whole trip was pure luxury from the room to the breakfast. Love it and can't wait to go back!",5,2013,04,03
35,"Super location, great hotel!","We ordered our hotel room online. We were looking for a hotel centrally located in a safe area. When we arrived by taxi, we felt that the hotel was a bit far from city center, but it was completely wrong. We had a 5 minute walk to Christoffer columubus statue at the bottom of La Rambla. 5 more minutes and we were in the old city. We could not have gotten a better location. The breakfast was absolutely fantastic. We had of course Cava for breakfast which was included in the breakfast buffet. The selection of food was absolutely fantastic.

The rooms were large and beautiful, with large bathroom with bubble bath and lovely view.

Should we complain about anything, it must be the silly high prices in the mini bar 5 USD for a small bottle veldi. But we can really recommend this hotel.

LUPS",5,2013,04,02
35,Best views in Barcelona,"My husband and I have stayed in this hotel in the past but it got very expensive so when I saw an offer on travel zoo we booked immediately as I always wanted to return especially as it was our anniversary.  We were checked in by a very helpful young man and were delighted by a beautiful city facing room. The views are amazing especially at dusk when all of Barcelona transforms into twinkling lights. We also enjoyed watching the cruise ships come and go but when the patio doors are closed you can't hear any noise.  The room is very modern. Good points: pillow menu, fabulous bathroom and separate shower, slippers, you can use the mini bar as a fridge, hair drier is better than mine, don't take one, mirror where you can put make up on, this hotel caters for women. Lovely towels.  Impressive decor. Against: no dressing gowns, quite a hard bed and it was two singles pushed together, poor quality toiletries disguised in posh bag, no coffee making facilities, was sheets and blankets!! I am used to quilts. Further, air conditioning didn't work, room far too hot despite it being cold outside. On a very positive side, the breakfast was amazing, we were spoilt for choice and all the food was very fresh and I loved the omelette menu etc. everything was excellent quality. Staff were extremely efficient. Location is ten minute walk to the rambles, but a lovely walk, so much to admire. We ate at rossinis which is located just off the rambles and enjoyed the walk as much as the food. Didn't eat at hotel so can't comment. Had a cocktail in the bar which was delicious and typical price for drink. Only hope we can return.",5,2013,04,01
35,Air conditioning,"I stayed at the grand marinia in march with my son,we had a junior suite which was nice,when we got to our room the heat hit as,when we tryed to change the temp it wouldnt let us.I then rang reception who told us they would sort it,2 hrs later nothing happened so i rang again, this time the receptionist told  me there was nothing they could do as there was only one system and if they change it would mean everyone would feel cold.We then had to open patio doors which isnt safe to leave open but had no choice and still didnt sleep.Next morning i was told there was a problem with room so they would upgrade us,when we got to thee other suite it was cool,but on that night it became a furnice again,so rang down again and was told the same thing,didnt sleep again,anmd next morning saw manager,and he told me it could only be hot or cold.Its a five star hotel,never in all off my travelling worldwide have i ever come across this.It totally ruined opur stay especially as my son was ill on the third day.",2,2013,04,01
35,Fantastic hotel...perfect location,"Stayed here for 3 nights. Location spot on if you want to enjoy the Marina as well as the Ramblas/gothic quarter etc. 5 to 10 min walk from bottom of las Ramblas.
Large rooms, well equipped gym- no air con so gets very hot quickly! toiletries provided down to a shoe horn and comb!!
Clean. No UK channels on television but this didn't matter seen as we weren't there to watch the TV!
Free wifi quite slow. Beds very comfy with great pillow menu to choose your own pillow type.
Would definitely recommend and would stay here again.",5,2013,04,01
35,Four star hotel,"This was advertised to us as a five star luxury hotel but four stars is more appropriate. The location is good, only a short walk from the harbour eateries and Las Rambles. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was stylish and clean, although the noise from the docks was somewhat distracting. Breakfast was amazing, but we were surprised to find that it was not included in the price of the room and was an expensive extra. The main disappointment for us was the reception area, which was dated and soulless - rather like a 1980s airport lounge- giving a rather poor impression of the hotel as a whole.",4,2013,04,01
35,Comfortable business hotel in boring area,"I stayed here for a couple of nights in February. The hotel is large, comfortable and clean. Staff are professional and friendly. My room was fine and I slept well. The food was also good, both in the restaurant and in room service. Good selection overall and tasty. The conference facilities were good and functional. The area is not great, being in what feels like a cold conference area by the harbour and sea (no, it doesn't have that lovely beachy feel!), but this isn't a hotel I would recommend to holiday makers. Mostly for business. There is some interesting stuff to see a 10-15 minute walk away though.",4,2013,04,01
35,Typical 5 star business hotel,"Good value for money.
We choosed this hotel for the good price and the because its situation is just at the port.
We did have a room in the 6th floor with view to the city of Barcelona, was great.
The hotel does not have a very nice athmosphere and is a typical 5 star hotel for business trips.
But we enjoyed our stay there and staff was friendly.
Multi-cultural customers",4,2013,03,29
35,3 star at best.,"Mediocre hotel. Some arrogant unhelpful staff members at the front desk. Situated far from the action so you have to take taxis all the time. Free wifi that does not work in the rooms....a 5 star hotel that has you stand in the passage in order to be on line. When I asked for a different room I was told that the hotel is full; later that day when I complained again I was told that I could change rooms as there were plenty available but too late, I had already arranged to move to another hotel.
Jacuzzi was ok, sauna was hot one day but off the next day. Yeah, tomorrow I leave!",2,2013,03,26
35,Big hotel with boutique service,"The design and grandeur of this hotel is apparent from the moment you arrive on the road leading to the car drop off point. Great service, lovely welcome and nice atmosphere, if a little cold in its appearance. Great location close to the bottom of the Rambla and by the ferry port. The rooms are quite small, though comfy and you can order a range of pillows from firm to soft, all named after female film stars, quirky but fun. The bathroom was a tad old fashioned, and the range of toiletries all individually bagged unnecessary. Breakfast buffet was great, and generally the overall service good. You'd think you were staying at a small boutique hotel. ",4,2013,03,25
35,Lovely time,"Stayed at the Grand Marina for my 50th birthday in December. Greeted by friendly receptionist upon our arrival at midnight and was pleasantly surprised by our lovely spacious room. We went straight to the bar to celebrate my birthday which was great as it stayed open til late so a good start to my birthday. Lovely meal on the following evening, attentive staff and knowledgeable about the food and wine. Loved Barcelona and when we return will book the Grand Marina again. Thoroughly recommend!",5,2013,03,23
35,Grand marina superb ,Great hotel with friendly staff and great service also very good location. Bar also good for an evening nightcap with round the clock service.  Rooms well equipped and great views from all rooms.  Will definitely stay here again ,4,2013,03,22
35,Top hotel with top staff and top views,"Just returned from 3 nights here 14th - 17th March, really amazing hotel! Messed up our dates for our first hotel, chose the wrong month online so we missed our holiday by 1 month oops!! So we booked this hotel for the remainder of our trip, booked online and got a complimentary upgrade and late check out :). Hotel sits on a little plinth right out in the harbour, on arrival there is a posh doorman who deals with the baggage from the taxi straight to your room, reception staff couldnt be more helpful and friendly. We got room 715 WOW!! We had a whole wall of windows looking directly out over the whole marina and most incredible views of the city, brilliant. Room was awesome, cant praise this place enough! Massive bed, huge marble bathroom, incredible! 10 min walk to La Rambla for loads of nice restaurants and bars, 10 min walk across to the MareMagnum again for loads of nice bars and restaurants, tour bus stops right outside. Amazing trip and probably one of the best hotels I have stayed in, would love to come back.",5,2013,03,19
35,"Very nice Hotel, upto expectations from the reviews","Travelled here on our Honeymoon before travelling to italy,.  (Sept 2009)

the Hotel is very nice and modern, with a fantastic view, 
comfortable bed,  and range of hotel amenities
slipper, pads, pens etc. 

the restaurant in the hotel was amazing one of the best steaks I have had, 
continental breakfast was nice, 

location is very good, not too far to walk to ramblas, and plenty of tourist buses outside hotel, 

ordered the champagn and strawberries and was waiting on our arrival. 

very happy with service,",4,2013,03,19
35,bar very slow at serving,"Travelled 13 - 16th March 2013 would not decribe the Hotel as 5 star. We stayed in a room overlooking the front of the Hotel on the 6th floor with views over the harbour and the city.  Overall the room was very clean and comfortable.  We chose breakfast included in the price from travelzoo which was good value for money and plentifull. No Tea of coffee facilities in the room.
Only problem that spoiled the view was a great tower in front of the hotel which is part of the cable car which was a bit of an eyesore.
Only downfall of the hotel was very slow service in the 1st floor bar.
For those of you who are over 65 then it is best to buy your 1 or 2 day hop on hop off bus ticket at the tourist information centre - 25 euros each for 2 days which is less that buying it on line.
Another tip if you are travelling via British Airways from Terminal 1 Gate D do not go through customs control as you are then entrapped and have no access to the main shopping area. Or pay 25 Euros for the VIP lounge which is well worth it.",4,2013,03,17
35,5 star breakfast - 4 star hotel,"Just back from a two night stay in this hotel.
It's only a short taxi ride from Barcelona airport and cost €27 one way and €22 on the way back. The hotel is in a good location, with La Rambla only a 5 min walk and the tour bus stops right outside the hotel. Not much atmosphere outside the hotel as it's mainly offices and ship terminal.
Room was a good size but did not live up to 5 star expectations - have stayed in better 4 stars.
My main complaints were - no tea/coffee making facilities
                                          - no bottled water ( some in mini-bar, but at €4.50 for the Mars  
                                            Bar, I wasn't going near it!!)
                                          - Slippers provided, but no robes
                                          - Towels had seen better days - far from fluffy
                                          - Toiletries supplied were very basic, just shampoo/conditioner,
                                             shower gel and a little pack of tissues
                                          - lots of lumps out of floor and veneer off skirting boards
Good points were really comfy bed and good strong shower.
The best bits were the views over the city and the fab breakfast buffet - I could have literally sat there and grazed all day if they'd let me! Nice terrace outside the bar/dining area to enjoy a coffee in the morning sun.
If you're visiting Barcelona for the first time definitely do the bus tour as it takes in all the major attractions which are spread all over this large city. Cable car gives great views over the city as does a visit to Park Guell (all uphill so wear your most comfortable shoes!)
Would I visit this hotel again? Only for the breakfast!",4,2013,03,16
35,If you plan it this is a top mini break hotel!,"We did a living social deal for a premiere sea view room.  Having read a review where another resident was told that Premiere rooms do not have views we set about ensuring with living socials help that we would 100% definitely be getting the room that the web links (hotel website) advertise.

Upon arrival we were very pleased we had done this as they showed us a premiere room with the dreaded twin beds.  (Who wants those over Valentines Day???)  They made us some offers, to put us in a room with the awful view - the ones at the back overlooking the World Trade Centre and to put a double sheet over the beds.  I think because we were calm and pleasant whist being firm they upgraded us to a suite.  Fantastic!!!  Really comfortable bed.  Nice views. 

The hotel is nicely located to get about, on foot, to see the sights.  The tapas from the bar is very reasonably priced and the breakfast amazing!  We didn't have to have lunch!  Tho we would recommend getting there early as when it's the last hour rush the service isn't as brilliant and the restaurant gets very noisy.

Would definitely stay there again for the right price!  :)",4,2013,03,11
35,Great hotel so long as you don't need to ask for anything when you get there...,"Positives:
Great location
Lovely, spacious and clean rooms
Comfy beds
Jacuzzi baths

Negatives:
Had to request 5 times for the air con to be turned on in the room (apparently outside temperatures of 20C require the hotels rooms to be artificially heated too!), finally had action from a member of staff following a 5am call to reception during a bad nights sleep. This was followed by one good nights sleep, before the air on was turned off again! Basic piece of advice to the hotel - listen to your guests, and when the issue is something that only takes 5 minutes to fix, fix it first time!! We spoke to 5 different people in all, only Harrah followed through and fixed the issue - thank you.",3,2013,03,11
35,"Excellent hotel, great location","One weekend in a great hotel in Barcelona ! Very nice and spacious rooms. Everything worked exactly as it should. Great service and good food! The beds was maybe a little bit hard, but as long as we all had a nice sleep we won't complain ! This hotel has everything a 5 star hotel should have ! ",5,2013,03,11
35,Good location but a bit run down,"I used lastminute.com Top Secret Hotels as it was advertised as luxury close to Las Ramblas.  It is close to Las Ramblas but it's close to the bottom end of Las Ramblas, making it a short walk to get to the promenade.  
The room was spacious.  Big bathroom with bathtub/shower.  Plenty of space for toiletries.  Enclosed toilet.  The entrance/wardrobe area had a sliding door to isolate it from the corridor.  My room was facing the World Trade Center offices, closed over the weekend (good for privacy if you want to open the curtains).  But I could hear a helicopter quite clearly in the morning, which was a bit annoying.  I ordered room service and they took a reasonable time.  I think it's a good deal if you know the exact location and you benefit from an offer.  Otherwise, there are better options in Barcelona.  Nice friendly doorman.",3,2013,03,11
35,"Great concept, meh execution: If you want to sleep on a cruise ship, book a cruise ship.","Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel sits at the end of a pier, a 10 minute stroll from the beginning of the fabled Las Ramblas. I was on vacation and I wanted to go to the beach and get to know Barcelona on my first visit to this absolutely gorgeous city. Well, I LOVE Barcelona. The Eurostars Grand Marina? Not so much.

Here's why it's only so-so:

1. Concept: Great concept. Well, no, that's not true: I like the fact that it HAS a concept. But after this ship sailed, it sank. Why build a hotel at a cruise ship terminal to resemble a cruise ship? Wouldn't you want a break from the ship? 
2. Not 5 stars: Maybe I'm a snob, but this is a solid 4-star property. I'm lucky enough to spend a lot of time at nice properties (and perfectly adequate ones too). The Grand Marina not only lacks character and style, but also class. 
3. Crap beds: My room had two twins pushed together. Very common in Europe. Still, the bedding and the beds were just not up to snuff. 
4. Spacious rooms with amenities (at least my room was spacious, and that was okay, being a relatively modern hotel).
5. Good staff. 

All that said, a hotel is somewhere to sleep. And in Barcelona, a city that seems to NEVER sleep (seriously, bars are empty until WELL after midnight; I don't understand how people work or lead normal lives and socialize there--still loved it), your hotel doesn't necessarily need to be full of character and/or luxury.

Yet, aside from the above, this is why I will NOT book this hotel again on my future visits to Barcelona, which I can't wait to get back to:

1. Location. Yeah, you're a 10 minute walk from the base of Las Ramblas, but it's 10 minutes of walking on the pier. Getting to the actual beach by foot is a 30 minute walk, at least. Nicer walk, but still. Your on a pier where ships dock. If you're not on a cruise ship and this is not part of a package deal, you really have no place here. 

2. Location: Again, you're on the water, but you're a 30 minute walk, each way, to the closest beach!?!

3. Location: You're at the base of Las Ramblas. And, for me, Las Ramblas is not what I loved about Barcelona, although some tourists do. Now that I have a better idea of the city, I will either stay on the beach (if I want a part beach vacation and I'm willing to cab it at night, or I'll stay in one of the many neighborhoods I fell in love with, where you just walk right out your hotel door--and there are tapas bars, stores, life--not storks, bird poop, cruise ships and a cable car. 

Definitely not a BAD hotel--and it definitely might be great for cruise ship passengers or perhaps even for families wanting a quiet get away from the hubub of a city bursting at its seems--without being totally isolated from the pulse of this one-of-a-kind metropolis. 

But, definitely not for me. 

Additional items of interest:

1. Pool: TINY. I've seen many inflatable pools that are much larger.
2. Gym: Okay.
3. Sun deck: Good.
4. Food: Restaurants looked great, but never ate there.
5. WiFi: Available, but I still keep getting emails from their service provider, which is annoying.",3,2013,03,07
35,nice hotel but not Collaborat,"of course the location is excellent maby that why the hotel Administration is was Arrogant

 yes the rooms was nice and clean but not that big the location was nice but not front of the sea except few rooms which is more expensive of course ,the building look like front sea view but its not because Half of it is office's 
I booked before 2 months of my stay and before only one day thay send email to tell me i should book another room for my 13 years old sun because the room i booked was family room is only for 2 adults and one child not older than 12 !! i get confuse i didn't know what to do i cant let my sun stay alone in room thay put me in pad position i had to book a single room for me !",4,2013,03,07
35,Really bad service from junior management,"This hotel is rated as a 5 star hotel. The good part is the breakfast, good food and nice people. Me and my wife stayed from Friday to Sunday. We had a good dinner and came back to the hotel app. 23:00 The temperature were set to 22C but it was more like 27C. We tried to reduce the temperatur, but it did not work. The we opened the window to decrease the temperatur. The aircond was now set to 18C. We felt a sleep, but waked up app. 03:00 again 27C !! The day after I was a little pist after a bad night sleep. Now we reduce the temp down to 16C before dinner. And yes, it was still 27C when we got back to the room. Then I called the front desk and they told me that they will turn on the aircondition? Okay ! After 30 min the temperatur was down to 18C and we were happy. But, then 03:00 the temeprature is back to 27C and now the windows opener is gone. I did not call the front desk since it was very late. The day after I complained and I really expected some response from the management side. But NO ! I guess they save power closing the aircondition during the night? We are frequently in Barcelona with a huge team, but we will never stay here again.",1,2013,03,04
35,Great Stay!!,"Hi,
Stayed here with my wife for 3nights 14-17Feb..Have to say, we really enjoyed our stay..
Check in went very smooth, we got upgraded on arrival to a half city half sea view room, and we also received a complimentary drink..
Location is good, if you dont mind 7min walk to bottom of Las Rambles.
I was very impressed with the service in this hotel. No job was to big, we had a problem with the safe,they sent someone up immediately to repair it..I asked for extra towels..again the service was impecable..
However the best thing about this hotel, was the breakfast..The choices were endless!
I ordered freshly poached eggs every morning, followed by a selection of tasty breads and cold meats, cheeses etc..even tried the Cava once or twice!!
We did not eat in the restaurant any other time during our stay..so cannot comment on that, but if the breakfast is anything to go by, im sure it was fab also..
We only had the one drink in the bar..it was ok bit overpriced in my opinion, and you dont come to Barcelona to drink in Hotel Bars!
The room was also great,,good size and a pillow menu, which my wife liked..
The bathroom was excellent. There was a jacuzzi bathtub and a powerful shower..there was also a good selection of toilitries..and a Welcome pack, which we thought was a nice touch..
The only slight deawbck about the room was that the air-con did not work..However we just left the balcony door open at night, so it was not really a problem..
I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a fun time in Barcelona..
We got a great rate on-line €109 per night which included breakfast!..Which I thought was very reasonable for this standard of Hotel.
Also the Hop on Hop off sightseeing bus stopped outside the hotel door which was handy..
There is also plenty of taxis right outside also..
All in all we had a great time and hopefully we will return soon!!!

Paul

Tip: Go on to the eurostars website, and sign up to receive e-mails about there latest special offers..thats what we did, and got a great deal..",5,2013,03,02
35,Pleasant Stay on the whole,"I would agree with most of the good reviews so far: excellent hospitality, clean hotel, great breakfast.

But for an objective review, I must add that:

1. As far as location is concerned, the hotel is close to Las Ramblas but not that close to shopping belt or other sights along Passeig de Gracia although there is the Drasannes metro stop 10 minutes walk away.

2. Our room had a leaking bathroom sink in our room which wasn't promptly attended to during our 4-day stay. The hotel only informed us on our last afternoon that they could only repair the sink if we moved to another room and by that time, we were already too inconvenienced to bother with that option.

3. Seeing how slow they were to respond, we also bore with the broken lock handle of the sliding glass door leading to the balcony. 

4. One needs Herculean strength to pull/pull the sliding door of the bathroom.

5. We were told no airconditioning is provided during winter so you have to leave the windows open for ventilation.

6. Not not rooms have a nice view and ours faced offices but it was of a decent size. Other rooms have a city view but are tiny in size so it's best to inquire when booking.",4,2013,02,19
35,Great hotel,"We have just come back from a 4 night stay and we really enjoyed it. We stayed in a suite and it was absolutely stunning! We were worried when we first arrived that we were a bit out of the way but it really is the perfect location for everything Barcalona has to offer. The staff really made the difference, everyone we came into contact with was friendly and helpful. I read the other reviews and people who say this isn't a 5 star hotel are talking rubbish it's definitely worth it's 5 stars! The only thing I would say as a minor negative was that our AC was not working in our room, the room was unusually hot and the first night was uncomfortable. I reported it to reception the next day but it was not fixed during our stay. Having the balcony door open made the room a nice temperature so it did not turn out to be a major issue, it just would have been nice to have it working but I would still definitely recommend this hotel!",4,2013,02,14
35,Wonderful hotel,Just had 2 nights at the grand marina.great location.rooms were spacious and stylish.the staff was very helpful and welcoming.the only down side is there is no tea/coffee making facilities.overall a loverly hotel for a city break.,4,2013,02,11
35,"Excellent hotel, great location & fabulous staff.","Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Gran Marina. What a fabulous hotel. Reception was very spacious and clean and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. The room was lovely. Nice size, great views and lovely, big, comfortable bed. The complimentary toiletries were really nice too!  The breakfasts were delicious....everything you could want and more and again, the staff were really friendly, funny and approachable. The hotels location was perfect, on the harbour, at the bottom of Las Ramblas, with excellent views of the cable car and the cruise ships. Great location to jump on the hop on hop off bus tours or to walk anywhere you like! Great restaurants close by, in the gothic quarter, or towards the sea for a great paella! After a long days walking, the hotels jacuzzi was definitely appreciated! Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely return. Thank you to all staff for a wonderful holiday.",5,2013,02,10
35,Classy hotel near the La Rambla,"To begin with the lobby service was very nice and atentive and a nice start  to our visit to this hotel. Moving on to our second floor room it only got better. The room was very stylish and absolutely huge with walk in closet, jacuzzi, a separate shower and a big bed/living room. No complaints about the room, totally happy.

The bar area in hotel is also both stylish but still comfortable altough drinks were very expensive considering the common prices in Spain. The amazing breakfast with anything you might wish for is also well worth mentioning!

Location is not perfect, however it is very good, and as it is a bit off the La Rambla and by the sea, it is nice and quiet. You can easily walk to La Rambla and further to the city. Also both hop on hop off tourist bus companies have a stop right in front of the hotel. You can ride the buses for a day for around 26 euros.

I would most definetely choose this hotel again if looking for a bit more upscale accomodation in this lovely city!",5,2013,02,10
35,A very nice hotel in a great location,"Stayed here for a week after Christmas and had a great time. One of the few hotels that I have stayed in that actually caters for family's with their family rooms. Great location, helpful staff and great views. One minor issue was the quality of room service food. A little below what you would expect. Having said that the breakfast buffet more than made up for it!",5,2013,01,30
35,Very modern hotel at the harbor,"We stayed here one night before a cruise. The rooms are very nice and restful. The bar area is well staffed and in typical Spainish tradition, is not busy until later in the evening. The hotel is located near some of the newer attractions and a longer taxi ride to the more traditional attractions. The bell staff was Able to assist us even during a taxi strike. As a modern hotel it has an excellent wifi service.
A little sparse on food service but within walking distance to several restaurants .
Overall a fine hotel for transients like we were and business meetings..",4,2013,01,23
35,A Good Business Hotel,"I stayed here for a Business Summit meeting and the hotel facilities and adjacency to the Trade Centre make this a good, all round business hotel. It lacks the character of some of the smaller,boutique hotels in the city. Rooms are a generous size and beds comfortable although the air con was not as responsive as it should have been leading to a coupld of very hot nights. Bathrooms are good even if the bath/shower area was a little dark and lacked any direct lighting. Free wifi was on hand and worked well most of the time. Location is good for the port and marina but is out on a limb if you want to walk anywhere - Las Ramblas is nearby but much of the city is a bit of a foot slog. Staff are very helpful - managing to secure 50 tickets for a Barcelona game - and work with smiles on their faces. Nothing was too much trouble. All in all a good Business hotel.",4,2013,01,20
35,Nice hotel near amenities,"We used this hotel after getting off a cruise ship so that we could stay an extra night in Barcelona.

Hotel is very big, modern and clean. Greeted on the front door by the bell boy and service at reception was good.  We ate in the bar at night, food nothing special and overpriced as are the drinks but then that is Barcelona for you.  Our room faced the sea and we had a great view of our cruise ship that we had just got off.  Bathroom spacious (we stayed in a superior double) with a jacuzzi bath, toiletries, gown and slippers.

Big paved plaza outside the hotel where there were a couple of homeless people with bin liners full of stuff  sat on a bench all day and night, not threatening but just a shame thats what you saw when you came in and out of hotel.

Very close to Las Ramblas and all in all a decent hotel. Not cheap but then again you get what you pay for in Barcelona.",4,2013,01,14
35,"Great hotel, wonderful location",We stayed here for a week-end break and it was just fab! The hotel is beautiful and the Marina opposite has great shops and restaurants. It's just a short walk from Las Ramblas and the beach too! I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.,5,2013,01,11
35,Eurostar in Barcelona,"A large hotel shaped as a transatlantic cruise ship overlooking the harbour. Large rooms, the bath room has massage bathtub, in the bed you´ll find a pillow menu to choose the one for your need. The hotel is located 5 min walking from las Ramblas",5,2013,01,05
35,Great hotel in a great location,I stayed with my boyfriend in this hotel in mid November. We found everything to be perfect. We had requested a sea view which was accommodated! The views of las ramblas and the port area was really nice. The room was cleaned every day and bathroom area was vety nice including three setting on the showers and jets in the bath! Also included complimentary toiletries which was a nice touch! All staff were friendly and very helpful! Location of the hotel is perfect for anyone meeting a cruise in the port or exploring las ramblas and the beach areas! .we just had room only board but noted that food/dining in the hotel is abit expensive. 100% would recommend this hotel to all..,5,2013,01,03
35,What a shame for what could be a nice hotel: FOOD POISONING,"I would like to report a food poisoning/intoxication my partner and I just experienced in this hotel in Barcelona.
On Sunday December 30, we had dinner in the bar/lobby of this hotel and had very bad service with a very slow service, our order of tapas was not registered properly and also the lasagna ordered for our son who is 4 years old arrived still frozen in the middlle, which luckily we noticed just before he started to eat it: this is obviously very dangerous especially for a young child.
We expressed our disappointment to the head waiter.
A few hours later, I was severely sick with vomiting and diarrhoea that I can only relate to some of the seafood tapas I was served earlier. Then my partner experienced similar symptoms for the same reasons, having also ordered tapas. Luckily our son escaped this food intoxication... only just about since he as first served a frozen lasagna that we sent back.
On Monday December 31, we reported this situation to the manager of the hotel asking for one extra night as courtesy of the hotel since we were not in a suitable condition to fly back to London on our own with a young child. The manager refused to provide a room free of charge for one extra night and we were forced to fly back that day feeling very sick and having an awful return flight.

It goes without saying that this is absolutely shocking for a 5 stars hotel.",1,2013,01,02
35,Marina in Barcelona,"As the name suggests it is pretty big hotel. You can choose room with view for sea, city or marina port. You can also find here pool, unfortunately outdoor. Rooms are clean and spacious, decorated in marine style. room costs from 300 to 450 euros.",4,2012,12,31
35,Bad experience. Wouldn't recommend,"Stayed at the superior room, and the standard is not too good. Free wifi was pathetic. The worst was that my credit card was charged for a breakfast I didn't have, after my leaving the hotel, and without intimating me.",3,2012,12,28
35,Conference Stay,"High end hotel although for from the most expensive in the city. I was upgraded to a superior room with an excellent view of the city including Las Ramblas. I stayed for 2 nights and got to see the protesters in the steets during the one day strike in the city.

Breakfast was outstanding buffet lunch also very good, the dinner was unusual, although I enjoyed it, very Chefy and it may not be to everyones taste.",4,2012,12,26
35,Wonderful hotel on the Barcelona waterfront,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for seven days in early December 2012. From the front desk to room service and the breakfast buffet, staff members were very attentive, polite and accommodating. The property--lobby, hallways, rooms, etc.--were all very well kept. 

We had reserved a city suite with the breakfast buffet and were not disappointed with this selection. 

The ONLY negatives: 
1. The climate control in our room was a bit tough -- not a deal-breaker by any means, but not perfect. The living room was a bit drafty, most likely because of the big sliding glass door that led out to the balcony. We had a hard time keeping the room at exactly the temp we wanted.

2. The hotel is about a half-mile from the beginning of La Rambla, which is an important main street in Barcelona. If you don't mind walking 5-10 minutes to get anywhere, you'll be fine. 

Other than these two slight drawbacks, I would highly recommend a stay in this beautiful, well-maintained hotel.",5,2012,12,18
35,Great Location & a Comfortable Hotel,"Stayed for 3 nights in October, prior to a Med cruise. Provided you don’t want to stay in the hub of Barcelona [which can be very noisy] the hotel is well presented & located, near the Port of Barcelona and a 10 minute [very pleasant] walk to La Rambla. Personlly, I like to be near the sea. Some previous reviews commented on how noisy the rooms can be at night, because of the local ferries coming & going [right alongside the hotel]. It honestly did not disturb me. Both [primary] hop-on hop-off bus services have stops adjacent to the hotel, so that is an advantage if you plan to use them. Having read previous reviews, I was ‘weary’ of comments about bad staff attitude. However, the staff could not have been more friendly & helpful. I felt welcomed. I booked a City View room but had trouble with the A/C the 1st day. Upon contacting reception to report the problem, they immediately sent somebody to the room & upgraded me to a suite. While that was obviously to my advantage, I suspected they have had this problem before. The hotel is very well presented & the breakfast buffet [part of some rate deals] is very good. I liked the hotel, for its location, presentation and adequate facilities and yes, I would stay here again.",4,2012,12,10
35,Good 4-star hotel in a very good location,"- Excellent location at the bottom of Las Ramblas and close to restaurants in the Marina and underground train.

- Booked two rooms. Requested city view at check-in but couldn't get it.  We were given one corner room with views of the port through large full-length windows - cruise ships sailing in and out was an interesting sight and room was very spacious. But the second room had no views - overlooked windows in an office block and also smaller in size with small windows. 

- Ordered room service couple of times which was prompt and pricey (€6 for a bottle of water). 

- Used the jacuzzi and ""pool"" on the roof. The ""pool"" was more like a large tub but nice views.  

- Staff very generally friendly and efficient. However, no dedicated concierge and the front desk staff must have just landed from Mars as they had absolutely no clue where the public beaches were !  Luckily, a British couple overheard and came to our rescue.  Turns out the beach was within a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. Also, loungers could easily be rented (the staff had actually misinformed us saying that there was no system of renting loungers at beaches in Barcelona).  So advice to the hotel is to set up a concierge desk...I suspect they see a lot of tourist traffic. 

- The beach itself was quite nice, except for the noisy hawkers. 

Overall, though, it was a decent 4-star hotel with good facilities which I would recommend due to its location.  ",4,2012,12,09
35,Superb harbour view,"I selected this hotel because it was a 5 mins drive from the Morocco to Barcelona ferry, I was arriving late during the evening so location was convenient with easy parking and it was a good base from which to explore Barcelona.  The airport is approx 30 mins drive from the hotel.

The reception and lounge areas were modern and airy with an arty design and the service approach from all I encountered (concierge, receptionists) was welcoming, efficient, informative and helpful from arrival through to departure.  

The bedroom was spacious, tastefully decorated, well maintained and the super king size bed comfortable.   It contained all the usual facilities you would expect from a hotel of this ilk including free wifi and toiletries. 

The highlight for me was the view - the room had enormous windows spanning one wall which provided spectacular views of the harbour, particularly impressive at night and the gentle unobtrusive noise from being harbour side enhanced my experience.  If you enjoy this sort of thing ask for the harbour view when booking.

The restaurant food and room service were both very good.  

Overall, a completely enjoyable time.",5,2012,12,06
35,OK - but many more to choose from for quality and price,"General

A modern hotel situated close to the city centre, just a short walk. Good facilities, but in the end not exciting and a little dull.

4/5 Check-in/out: Relatively easy process. 

4/5 Reception/Lobby Area: Spacious and bright but a little cold and lacking in character. 

3/5 Room: Large, bright and good views. Well laid out in a fairly traditional style but larger than average. The state of the furniture and fittings was not what I expect from a supposed 5 star hotel. Torn chair backs and seats do not portray a quality picture. Excellent bathroom and comfortable bed. Internet (free WiFi or cabled), iron, coffee maker, TV. 

4/5 Ambience/General: Pleasant. 

Food 

3/5 Breakfast;  Not bad buffet selection for breakfast.

5/5 Staff; Excellent staff in all areas of the hotel. 

Facilities

5/5 Pool area: Small but pleasant. 
5/5 Bicycle hire: A nice way to get around the city on bicycles available to hire from the hotel. 

Average Summary Score: 4.12 / 5

With such a wide choice in Barcelona I am unlikely to stay here again, especially when one compares prices.",3,2012,11,26
35,Not 5* hotel - too many conflicting details,"It's not easy to evaluate this hotel, as I discovered during my short stay too many conflicting details stopping me to rate this hotel to 5*: very polite staff - and 15 min. check-in standing in queue of only a couple of people; well equiped room - and poor noise insulation from coridor and neighbour rooms ( while I am practically non-sensitive to outside noise ); advanced shower with massage function - and jumping water temperature; rich breakfast buffet - and coffee sligthly below average served from the pot; free cava during breakfast time - and no my favourite ""chorizo"" sosages...
So what is all about ? Hotel is placed in harbour, and looks to be integral part of business complex world trade center. On one side is pier for cruise ships, while on another side looks to be marina for private/excursion ships. I am not sure if much of hotel rooms facing open sea view, maybe only from very top levels. Distance from airport - like 20 minutes taxi drive in midday of working day, 25/27 EUR there and back. Didn't try internet, while wouldn't be surprised it's charged.
Positive: location - stright driving from airport, in the middle of marina, few minutes walk from end of Ramblas ( Columbus statue ); well equiped rooms; about 100 tv channels - include ethnics; rich breakfast buffer; bathroom consist of separate bath and shower with massage function; taxi always available on the stand; spectacular view from rooftop terrace
Negative: check-in took 15 minutes without almost no visitors - 2 out of 3 person were trainees; average quality coffee on breakfast ( no espresso available ); no any welcome soft drink - minibar costs 6,05 eur for soft drink can 33cl ( ! ); jumping water temperature in shower

so, all in all - very good hotel at good location in Barcelona. Would I stay myself in it again - no. Would I recomend to anybody - probably yes, choice might depend on price available.",4,2012,11,20
35,"Well appointed, fresh, modern, spacious and good service","I come to Barcelona once or twice a year and usually stay with friends. This time my girlfriend and I wanted a long weekend to ourselves in a 5 star hotel so we could move around the city as we pleased and come back to very comfortable surroundings. Some may find this hotel set a little bit away from certain parts of the town and the nearest Metro station but Barcelona is easy to get around and we chose Grand Marina as it was well located for the areas we wished to visit. We booked a Premier Room for 3 nights at the end of August and had a very comfortable stay. The room was an excellent size with a small balcony and very comfortable. The bathroom was also a good size with a large separate shower cubicle. Hotel staff were very polite and helpful. Breakfast was fantastic with a large selection of food choices and even free Cava if you wanted it at that time of the morning! There was a large outside terraced eating area, which we opted for, so we could enjoy breakfast in the sun. The roof top pool is on the small side and there is an average sized gym next to it. The hotel isn't cheap, nor is it hideously expensive, so it's probably correctly priced for it's class. While there are certainly more luxurious hotels in Barcelona, Grand Marina is still up there towards the top end of the league and I would imagine is more than acceptable for most people, especially business travellers, who are provided with a wide range of meeting and conferencing options.",5,2012,11,16
35,"Not a 5*, but good enough...A case of too many contradictions...","Has positives and has negatives, but overall, the positives outweigh the negatives. First of all, the location is good...not fantastic, but good. At the lower end of Ramblas, you need a good brisk 5-7 minute walk and you are in Las Ramblas. Also a 10 minute walk from Maremagnum Mall. If you are lucky like me to get an sea view room, you are in for a treat. The views are breath taking.

Check in was amazing, quick, and my request for a higher floor was immediately taken care of and a sea view room was provided. Even the customary credit card deposit was reduced, meaning the full requested amount was reduced.

Check out was a completely different story, it was painful and tedious. The staff was slow and could not handle the rush of clients checking out.

Another positive/negative point was the breakfast. While the quality of the food and the variety was great...it was exactly the same every single day. So by day 3, it was boring. I tried Room Service once, and it was good. Nothing to fault there.

The room was quite comfortable at times, but at other times, unbearably hot. When I complained to the reception, the first response I got was ""we converted the A/C to heater and nothing can be done, so open a window"" to which I replied ""how do you expect me to sleep with ships coming in and out as we are right on the port and the sea gulls wont let anyone sleep""...I spoke to her colleague and he immediately contacted maintenance and they convert the heater to A/C. The next day the room was a sauna again...Again I complained and it was fixed....3rd day...again sauna...so I gave up.

I really want to give this hotel more than a 3/5...but while it was good, it was not a 4/5 quality. As I was on a business trip, I didn't mind, however, it was there for leisure and with my family, I would have been hugely disappointed.",3,2012,11,15
35,Very pleasant,"Overall a super hotel. I thought from the photos etc that it looked out over the port, but it doesn't. The service was very good despite being close to being full, from what I could tell. Personally the bathroom accessories in an arty plastic bag wasn't my cup of tea, but there was a good range of them. The rooms were very comfortable, albeit a bit on the cold side. However I slept amazingly well. I would probably have given them excellent if they hadn't tried to charge us for parking which we didn't use. Someone else had signed it onto our room which means that they were able to. Breakfast was good, but a bit expensive I thought at 25 Euro/head. However unlike some other 5* hotels which were far more expensive they do have free wifi. I would stay there again, but I think that hotels in Barcelona - generally - are very expensive where F&B is concerned.",4,2012,11,12
35,"Holidays good or no so good,!!","We stayed at the hotel for 6 nights, it was a lovely room,very clean, we had to ask to get it cleaned, not once but twice the 2nd time was one and a half hours of hanging about, this was after  we had asked the housekeeper, I know it's a busy hotel, but if you have been out all day the room, should be done by 4ish, the breakfast was  a vast buffet, but the hot was cold!!!We had a meal at the restaurant, expensive and not good, the waiter seemed fed up and kept on saying it was end of season, that may be so but you still had paying guests there,!! But the bed was lovely!!",3,2012,11,07
35,Great Stay,"We stayed at the Grand Marina for 3 nights.  Whether it was the front desk, room service, restaurant or bellman, each did their job with a smile and expertly.  The hotel location in the harbor and at the foot of Las Ramblas is second to none.  Why go anywhere else in Barcelona.",5,2012,10,30
35,Great hotel for city views,"We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights to experience Barcelona. It's based in a complex containing the World Trade Centre that extends into the harbour. It's position means that rooms either have panoramic views of the city and part of the harbour or face internally into a courtyard overlooking the World Trade Centre offices. We opted for a Premier Room which was on the 5th floor (506) which had fantastic city views. Previous reviewers have mentioned noise from visiting ships etc and yes the Balearic car ferries dock alongside the complex. You notice a little low rumbling noise from them but its hardly intrusive and they all departed by late evening. There is also a historic cable car that runs high above the hotel and the gantry support for this is immediately in front of the hotel. It will be seen from all rooms that face the city but it didn't bother us and is just part of the scene. The bedroom was spacious with a very comfortable king sized bed and well equipped bathroom with bath and separate shower. We would have liked to have had bath robes and tea/coffee facilities in the room but otherwise it was perfect. 
The public rooms lack atmosphere but the service in the bar area and at breakfast was good. Quality of food was also excellent although expensive.
The open top tour buses stop just outside the hotel but otherwise its a 10 minute walk to the Metro and Las Ramblas. We liked this as it meant that at night we were away from the 'action' so could sleep easily but were still close enough that good restaurants/bars etc were in walking distance.",4,2012,10,28
35,Not so convenient for cruises but a lovely hotel,"This is a lovely hotel but not as convenient for cruises as you might think. If you are getting one of the smaller ferries to Spanish islands then it is right by the dock but if you are getting a big cruise ship (e.g. NCL, Celebrity, etc) don’t expect to walk right onto the ship as the hotel is some way away from the larger cruise ship terminals and whilst just about walkable the docks are not ‘pedestrian friendly’ so you will still need to rely on either a taxi from the hotel, or the dock shuttle bus which stops at the Christopher Columbus terminal (a few mins walk away).  With this in mind you might as well stay nearer La Ramblas as if you stay in the bottom third of Las Ramblas you will be closer to the tourist area but just as close to the port shuttle bus / taxis.  The one great thing about the location is the hop on/hop off buses stop within 100m of the hotel. 

The hotel itself if nice with a modern design and large comfy rooms. Our superior room was very large with large bed, large bathroom with both shower and spa bath. Has a little outdoor pool with great views as well as an indoor spa Jacuzzi and well equipped fitness room/gym. Food was great and bar and lounge areas nice too. 

A great hotel, but not as convenient for the cruise ships as the map might suggest. Location wise its just as easy to get to the cruise ships from a hotel in the bottom third of Las Ramblas as it is from this hotel.",4,2012,10,23
35,Fantastic hotel in great location,"Stayed for three nights and could not have been happier with the hotel, facilities, service.  Good location at end of Las Ramblas, ideal for marina, shopping centre, bus tour and all facilities. Room was spacious, very well equipped, and very clean with choice of pillows, good towels and toiletries, lovely bathroom.  Breakfast was superb, with everything you could wish to eat and excellent attentive service from waiting staff.  Evening meal and tapas were great.  Would not hesitate to recommend.",5,2012,10,22
35,Great Stay,"I stayed for 3 nights with a friend. The room was a good size with lots of storage and a big bathroom.

The breakfast buffet was excellent with fresh juice and a huge variety of breads, pastries etc. 
 
The hotel is a 10 minute walk to the bottom of the Ramblas and 15 minutes to the marina so it is all nice and central.

 I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend to others.",5,2012,10,21
35,Convenient hotel near Columbus statue at the foot of Las Ramblas,"We stayed here for only 2 nights at the end of a river cruise and we found it to be very convenient for sightseeing. The hop-on/hop-off bus stops nearby; there is a huge shopping mall across the way (about a 10-15 minute walk) which was even open on Columbus Day - a national holiday. There are several restaurants inside the mall as well. The hotel restaurant serving breakfast was very good but the dinner choices are limited. There is just one restaurant/bar combo serving tapas all day and one restaurant which does not open until 7:30pm. We ate at both and found the food to be very good although pricey. Rain stopped us from venturing out both nights - although we did have a nice lunch in Placa Real at Rossini's!
I would recommend this hotel even though it's not in the middle of the Gothic Quarter or on Las Ramblas. It's right at the cruise ship pier which is extremely convenient if that's what you need.",5,2012,10,16
35,Nice hotel in a nice city,"Perfect hotel to stay during your visit to Barcelona.
Perfect location ( sea view) and near the most famous street ( La Rambla). 
And those who are interesting in shopping, will find its location is near to most of shopping malls and Metro stations too.
Rooms were really great, clean and large.
Breakfast was fine with different varieties suitable for most cultures.
Excellent and supportive staff who are ready to help you at any time.",4,2012,10,15
35,Beautiful hotel. Great staff,"Went for a short city break with my teenage son. From the start the staff were attentive, welcoming and very friendly.
The reception area was small, not grand but adequate. The room was lovely. Large, very clean, the decor was lovely, the bathroom was our favourite - they supplied the usual soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash- all replenished daily.  Slippers are supplied  (the floors in the rooms are marble). there is a safe big enough for a laptop, a mini bar and a big balcony.
The view from our balcony was outstanding. It had a good gym with a hot tub - every time we went there we were the only ones there!! In the gym was a big bowl of fruit, which you were welcome to eat from. I was slightly disappointed the sauna and swimming pool were not functional when we were there, but I guess there always has to be maintenance time. 
There is free wifi in the bar/coffee area with a few laptops if you haven't brought your own.
The breakfast was the best I have ever had anywhere! My son loved it. The assortment was huge, I can't imagine anybody not able to find something to their liking. Hot, cold, meats, cheese, cereal, fruit - too much to mention and I couldn't do it justice! The staff were so attentive, everything was very fresh and constantly replenished. The hotel was with in easy walking of Las Ramblas and the beach - the walk to the beach is along the esplanade with musicians, restaurants and shops on one side and boats on the other. It really exceeded my expectations, I would recommend it and I hope to return - what a great experience.
PS they even let us check out at 3:30 with no extra charge :D",5,2012,10,13
35,The Best Hotel I have ever been...,"I have stayed in many hotels in Western Europe. This was the best i have ever been!.. Room was perfect, larger than the usual European hotel rooms. Room and the hotel was totally clean. The restaurant and the abr had a great menu. It was a great thing to eat ""Spanish Tapas"" in hotel bar. The location of the hotel is fabolous. You arrive to La Rambla in 5, which is quite good. But the most important thing for me was the staff. And the staff was extremely friendly, helpful,kind and great. They make you smile during your journey with their kindness,helpfulness and friendshipness. I definitely recommend this hotel if you visit Barcelona!",5,2012,10,13
35,Perfect view's in a perfect city...,"With Eurostars Grand Marina downtown and at the end of the famous La Ramblas... This hotel is not only perfectly situated but also has amazing views of this magical city. This hotel is still close enough to all the hot spots and central to Las Ramblas and if you want to wander the streets of Catalunya, but has all the luxuries one expects from a 5star hotel. Clean, crisp and comfortable, we enjoyed the views, the friendly staff and the yummy spread during breakfast. Will definitely return to this hotel....",4,2012,10,12
35,"Wow , what a view!","Great location, and you can't beat the view.  Located at the base of Las Ramblas and next the tour buses stop a few feet from the front door.  We arrived by cruise ship and were docked at the entrance to the hotel, no taxi needed.  The staff was extremely helpful even lending us a cork screw for our wine.  The breakfast buffet was extensive and very tasty.  Sitting out on our balcony looking out at the city and the marina with a glass of wine was wonderful.",5,2012,10,11
35,"Amazing, a perfect hotel in an amazing city","The rooms were amazing and convieniently close to Las Ramblas
The bar was a bit on the pricy side and one needed a mortgage to get a g&t but the ambiance made up for it.
Breakfast was again flawless including soya milk and other speciality dietary items.
All of the staff were very attentive and seemed more than happy to help and advise
There are great views from the hotel roof terrace and the rooms 

All in all well worth the stay",5,2012,10,08
35,Great hotel,"This Hotel is perfectly located to get into town and sightsee or choose a nice resterant to eat in, the hotel is lovely and clean rooms are big and ours was a corner room with views over the marina would go and stay again anytime superb",5,2012,10,08
35,Ambience was like staying at a parking garage,"This trip to Barcelona came up rather last minute and my favorite hotel was sold out.  I thought it would be fun to stay near the water, and envisioned a weekend enjoying the sun & water and the hotel (since I've been to Barcelona before I was not as keen to explore the sights.)

But the hotel felt like staying in an empty convention center, or in a multi-tiered parking garage.  No one around except half a dozen docked cruise ships.  and all night, you can hear the cruise ship announcements to their passengers on loud speakers.  

The rooftop pool was a disappointment, no shade, no hip pool bar (as I've experienced in other Barcelona roof top pools.)  It, too, was rather like just being in the sun on top of a parking garage.  (See photo.)

That said, the room was large & clean, the staff friendly and responsive.  It just wasn't the luxury retreat I was looking for -- or that I paid for (the place isn't cheap, for parking garage ambience!)",2,2012,10,08
35,"Overall, exceptional.","If you have read any of my other reviews, you will know that I consider myself to be a savvy traveler, well versed in all classes of travel and I feel I have reasonable expectations dependent on the trip, venues or countries visited and the price paid.

I know Barcelona well. It is a frequent stop for me on business. On this trip, I had a full day in the city (Thanks to early flight arrivals from the US) and so wanted to be somewhere central.

One thing in Barcelona. Very, very few hotels are truly central. (To where most people want to be - Las Ramblas area). There are a few hotels on Las Ramblas and Plaza Catalunya, but for the same price, you can get a much higher grade hotel, a mere five minute walk away. It is all about what is important to you.

I picked the Grand Marina, having never stayed there before, but knowing where it was. It is a five minute spritley walk from the hotel to the Christopher Columbus Statue at the bottom of Las Ramblas. (Or a 10 - 15 minute stroll) During the day, a nice relief. Las Ramblas can be crazy busy. The negative of this though was walking back to the hotel after dark, the area from Las Ramblas to the hotel is very, very quiet and kind of eerie. If I was a single female, I may not have felt so comfortable.

On the location, a previous poster talked about being able to walk to the cruise ship dock from the hotel. That is true for some. The boutique cruise ships can dock at the World Trade Center, next to the hotel. The day that I arrived, Azamara and CDF were docked there. These are smaller ships. If you are sailing with mainstream lines such as Norwegian or Royal Caribbean, the pier is a 10 minute ride away and you should expect to pay $10 - $20, depending on the number of cases you have.

So... the hotel. the lobby area is very bland, but check-in was efficient. I was able to get a room at 9.30am, after an early flight arrival, which is always a blessing.

The room was very nice. Some upholstery was worn and strangely, there was about an inch-wide strip of the hardwood floor missing from near to the entrance door, and the skirting board was badly damaged too. Not a disaster, but not a detail I would expect to be overlooked in a 5 star property.

The room was of a good size and very well laid out. I had a room on the 4th floor, overlooking the courtyard at the back, but that really didn't bother me at all. The room is not set up around the view and there are chairs in front of the windows, so I never even opened the curtains fully.

The bathroom is delightful. Very large and marble-lined everywhere. A decent sized jacuzzi tub (That took 20 minutes to fill) double sinks and a closed off side room with the shower cubicle, toilet and bidet.

The TV in the room had English-language news channels (mostly from the US) and also an English-language entertainment channel from Fox, showing dramas from all of the US networks.

Having stayed many times in Spain, one thing I never get used to is what they consider to be luxury linens. The bed and pillows were comfortable, but very firm, and the sheets were well starched. The bedding was also an old-fashioned bedspread. The bathroom towels were also not what you would be used to in a high-end US hotel, but, as I said, this is what you come to expect in Spain.

Overall... the main three things I rate a hotel on (These items should be the same if it is a $20 or $200 hotel room) were good:

Wifi : Free and fast. I was able to update apps on my iPad with no worries. You do need a code, a different one for each device, so if you have multiple devices, make sure you get the codes at check in.
Shower: Hot water and good water pressure. It was a good shower experience!
Bed: Firm, which I like, but comfortable. 

I did the breakfast buffet, open from 7am on the mezzanine floor. The charge was 25 euro. You did get a lot of choices, the hot food wasn't super-hot, but it was OK. Overall, it was no different to what you get at the breakfast buffet on a cruise ship. Some reviewers went over-the-top, in my opinion, on their review of this buffet. It was nice, not amazing. Strangely, there were no bagels, except for ones ready prepared with smoked salmon in. The coffee, as noted on previous reviews, was disgusting. Tasteless sludge. Also, you can request eggs prepared as you wish (There was a menu card on the table), but fried and scrambled eggs were in the buffet already.

Again, as is previously noted, the mini-bar is ridiculously overpriced. I expect a mark-up on these items, but the cost of everything was 5 times what it would be outside the hotel. They are playing on the fact that there is nowhere to buy drinks or snacks within a quick walk.

So, overall, I would give the hotel a 9/10. 
This hotel would be a solid 4 star in the US.",5,2012,10,08
35,excellent location good views,The hotel is in perfect location with tourist bus and the la Rambla at your door steps. It is modern and Chic with good amenities. Rooms with city views are great.,5,2012,10,03
35,Not worth the money,Hotel is in great position but  breakfast was all cold and coffee awful not really anything special for a 5 star I would look elsewhere for better value.Tip go round the corner for coffee and anything to eat in the world trade centre better food and drinks for a fraction of the hotel prices,3,2012,09,27
35,Like!,"Very pleasant stay in this excellent hotel in Barcelona's harbour neighbourhood. Easy walking distance from several (connections to) hotspots.
We've stayed in a city suite and what we really missed was a coffee and tea facility (watercooker) with the minibar, and a comfortable sofa in the sittingroom.
What I really liked was the pillow changing service (read the card!!!)

One big fail! I requested to pay cash but they automatically charged my creditcard for the first night. Keep that in mind. In some circumstances inconvenient.

Overall, I can certainly recommend this hotel and I will be back for sure.  ",4,2012,09,27
35,A Great Hotel in Barcelona!,"We were upgraded from a deluxe to a junior suite. Wow! What a beautiful and spacious room! The bed was  lovely. The bathroom was five star. The living area was wonderful. No free bottled water but internet was included. Overall, for Europe, a delightfully spacious and elegant hotel!",5,2012,09,25
35,Luxurious Hotel in superb location.,"We stayed at the Grand Marina Hotel for 1 night 21/09/12. We booked a deluxe room which was extremely spacious with a huge bed, balcony, separate dressing area and luxurious bathroom. From the website I had the impression we would be have a sea view so was a little disappointed to be told the hotel rooms all look into the courtyard rather than out to sea. Aside from this, the staff were extremely helpful and the level of service we received for our short stay was excellent. The hotel is ideally located for Las Ramblas and the Marina. I fully intend to visit Barcelona again and wouldn't hesitate to book a room at the Grand Marina.",5,2012,09,22
35,Eurostars Grand Marina Barcelona,"My girlfriend and i stayed here for four nights in mid September. The hotel is located pretty much at the end of Las Rambla, and is an ideal place to stay for visiting most parts of Barcelona, as you are nearby Drassanes tube station, the tourist bus stops, and lots of restaurants along the coast.

We were allocated a room on the sixth floor, facing the office buildings and square of the Barcelona Trade Centre. Not the best of views but we hadn't paid extra to have a balcony so the view didn't matter to us. 

We were really pleased with the room and in particular the bathroom, which was huge and well equipped with a large jacuzzi bath, a separate shower and his and hers sinks. The toiletries provided were pretty good and restocked daily. You even had a choice of six pillows. You simply had to phone reception or speak to one of the maids. (All of whom spoke very good English, and seemed genuinely happy to help you).

We had two problems with our room safe. On both occasions we were not able to get to our valuables. The first problem was fixed within twenty minutes, but the second problem led the hotel to have to phone for help. We ended up waiting in for over an hour on the promise that somebody would be able to fix the safe. On phoning the reception again we found that the tradesman had been delayed and wouldn't be with us for another hour. Luckily we had some of our credit cards so we went out for dinner, authorising the hotel to open our safe when the tradesman arrived. When we got back the valuables were locked into our safe with a new code, which we were given at reception. And it was all working as expected.

We used the sun terrace and tiny pool on the roof of the hotel a couple of times. You get an amazing view of the cruise ships, the coastline and the city and it was surprisingly empty there. Each time we went there were a number of loungers available.

We didn't use the gym as we had had enough exercise during the day, but it seemed well equipped with new weights and equipment. 

We also never used the hotel restaurant, as the prices were very high, for both food and drinks. 6 Euros for a can of coke, 8 E for a lager, and i think breakfast started at 18E per person for the basic croissant, juice and coffee. With Las Rambla so close it seemed crazy to spend over three times the amount we could,  just for the convenience of having breakfast in the hotel.

Overall we were very happy with the hotel, and at how new and clean everything was, long with the friendly and helpful staff. The only thing that let it down a bit was the cost of food and drinks.",4,2012,09,20
35,Fantastic hotel,"Me and my wife stayed here for our honeymoon for two nights and loved it. We requested a room with a view and WOW what a view! We overlooked the port and mare magnesium as well as the whole city. We could see all the sights, sagrada familia, torre agbar and the start of las ramblas. It was perfect and the room was clean and well equipped, it had a very chilly pool but in the hot sun it wasn't to bad. The only downside was the price. We had gone for a luxury hotel as a one off for our honeymoon but did not expect the minibar to charge €4.50 for a standard mars bar!
Overall the hotel was perfect with a quiet relaxed atmosphere and suited what we were looking for. Would defiantely recommend to anyone with a big budget. ",4,2012,09,18
35,Great base for a long weekend,"My new husband and I have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Grand Marina.  We found it to be a great base for us.  We walked absolutely everywhere during our stay, so a good nights sleep was a bonus.  I always find it difficult to sleep the first couple of nights in a strange bed, but had no problems at this hotel.  Our room was on the third floor at the front of the hotel and we didn't have any problem with noise.  You could hear the cruise ships, but the noise was usually just a low droaning sound and didn't disturb us at all.  However, the tanoy announcements on one of the ships was quite loud at around 8.00 one morning.  The beds are really comfortable, the room temperature perfect, we didn't hear any noise from adjoining rooms or the corridor.  Spotlessly clean.  Huge bathroom with jacuzzi and walk-in massage shower.  

Well equipped gym on the top floor, a hot tub and freezing cold pool.  Towells are provided on the sun deck.  The bar area is nice, very quiet when we were there, ok for night-cap.  Expensive, but but not ridiculously so.  7 euros for a glass of wine.

We didn't eat at the hotel, there are lots of fantastic restaurants a few minutes walk away.  Particularly La Catalana, Placa de les Olles, El Born. Amazing local food. We ate there twice, we enjoyed it so much!  

On the whole a good hotel in a fantastic city.  Excellent location if you want to escape the hustle and bustle.  We'd stay here again.",4,2012,09,18
35,"Excellent location, Loved every minute.","I have just returned from 3 nights at the Grand Marina, it is also our first visit to Barcelona, we loved every minute of the trip, but i think staying at such a lovely hotel made it even better, we had paid for a delux room as it was a special occasion, when we arrived we had been upgraded to superior, the views were to die for, looking out over the port and city of Barcelona. The beds/rooms were comfy and the breakfast had plenty of choice for everyone. I liked the hotel's location as it was in the quieter area of Barcelona but only a short walking distance to any tourist area. The open top bus stopped right outside the hotel and we bought our tickets from the reception with a small discount. I would recommend this hotel to any one visiting the city.",5,2012,09,18
35,Great stay,"Stayed at the Grand Marina for a long weekend and had absolutely no problems with it.  My partner and I arrived at around 11am and were able to check in straight away.  The hotel staff took care of luggage, ordering taxis, the little things to make your stay that bit smoother.  Bar staff were friendly and provided a good service not that we stayed in the hotel much as we were there to see Barcelona.  The swimming pool is small, but you can tell people that you completed 100 lengths easily without elaborating on details and the jacuzzi was great after spending the day exploring on foot.  We didn't do breakfast at the hotel as didn't want to miss out on spending the morning with the locals in the numerous cafes Barcelona has to offer.",4,2012,09,18
35,5 star building. 2 star service,Great rooms but everything else is just average. The breakfast service is absolute chaos. Not enough staff and the few on duty seem to have no training or idea of service. The laundry service is a rip off. 5 euro for a pair of socks and everything else was poorly pressed. The only staff that even attempted to give a friendly welcome were the bar staff. Felt more like a Travelodge in a posh building. Must be better places than this in Barcelona ,2,2012,09,16
35,Excellent location with comfy beds!,"I stayed here for five nights and having read reviews on here I was apprehensive about what to expect. We arrived at 10am straight from the airport and asked if they could hold our bags until the 3pm check in but they let us check in straight away with a porter taking our bags up to our rooms for us. Room was clean with a sea view - the cruise ships were docked right outside the window (only issue was tannoy announcements in morning but heard no noise other than that). Bathroom was lovely - jacuzzi bath with a shower head attached to the wall. We did have a slight issue that the shower flooded around the bath after very use! 
Pool was small but offseason so we were the only ones that used it and we had no issues getting a sun lounger every time. Great views of harbour from the roof. 
La Rambla is about a ten minute walk as is the Aquarium and nearby shopping centre with restaurants on the next pier along.
Didn't pay for breakfast but there were small cafes behind the hotel that did coffees and pastries for a couple of euros.",4,2012,09,13
35,Expensive but good location for cruise departures,"Right on Port Vell, a perfect location if you are leaving Barcelona on a cruise. Extremely modern and sleek hotel, we liked the incredible 360 degree views of Barcelona and the sea from the pool and roof top deck. Beautiful 2nd floor bar/restaurant too. Rooms are very quiet, spacious, and spotless with entry foyer, wooden floors, multiple device wi-fi, and nice hydromassage showers, even a ""pillow menu"".  Very good room service too but, It should be,, this hotel is expensive. No complaints, except that the treadmills were broken for two days, not a big problem except for the runner in our family. This is cosmopolitan, sleek hotel so don't expect the Spanish flavor and city charm of La Rambla which is about a 7 minute walk away. I might stay here again if I were leaving Barcelona on a cruise as the boat terminal is literally right next door...you still need to take a taxi to the boat terminal if you have luggage as it is still a long drive out onto the terminal (cost is 3 to 4 Euros for cab). Also, pay for this hotel bill with Euros so you don't get dinged by their exchange rate (which is not the daily going rate).",4,2012,09,11
35,Above Expectations!!,"I booked this hotel for my girlfriends birthday, wanting something a little bit special I went for this slightly more expensive hotel, all I can say is FANTASTIC!!.
Not only is the location perfect at the bottom of ""La Rambla"" your right next to the marina, all in all a great hotel, the staff were polite and helpful, the rooms were large and very clean, and the view over Barcelona from our room were perfect.
Thanks for a great weekend break 
PS - If you book this hotel, spend the little extra and get the breakfast buffet, its worth every penny, I've never had such good breakfasts from a hotel A****",5,2012,09,10
35,Comfortable and modern,"Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel is perfectly located at the Barcelona Moll, close to the Ramblas and the Barri Gotic. The hotel is new, rooms are very comfortable, and the breakfast is superb. Don't miss the Parmesan scrambled eggs and the good Spanish jambón. The fitness center is well-equiped - much more than the average. The views of Barcelona Port are awe-inspiring. Ask a room with either Port or city view, or at least be sure you won't stay in those facing the office building close to the hotel. Be advised: you'll listen early in the morning some boats' horns, and you'll need to walk more than you could expect to reach the Ramblas.",4,2012,09,09
35,Pleasant stay,"We found this hotel pleasant and stayed 1 night before our cruise. Staff were helpful although the reception staff with their earpieces and walkie talkies were a bit off putting. Room wasnt ready but no problem we were offered free drink in the bar and as promised receptionist came to get us within 10 mins. Room was spacious and had a great view to city. Location is a 5 to 10 min walk to las ramblas area which is good as we were so glad we didn't stay near there as it was full of people, noisy and a little seedy.",4,2012,09,03
35,Expensive without knowing,"We stayed here recently for six nights and were told it would be $255 per night, imagine our horror when we went to pay  the bill and saw a $1200 per night charge on our account, when we queried this we were told that because Madrid and Barcelona had played this night we were  charged accordingly, we explained that we were not, advised on this when we checked in which I can honestly say fell on deaf ears. So, just be aware that there is nothing happening when you book in because you may be up for a rather, large sum of money unbeknown to you. But I must say there was one chap who worked in the restaurant by the name of Miguel who was a absolute charm to deal with very professional and well mannered. Not a bad hotel but, not overly exceptional for the money you pay.",3,2012,09,01
35,Frustrating Stay,"We had two connected rooms and each day each was cleaned differently, amenities were never the same.  One room they would leave the AC on, the other would be roasting when we got back.  Empty bottles, cans, etc. were never cleaned up by the cleaning crew.  Bedroom and sitting room TV's didn't offer the same channels. Requests made at the front desk for towels, pillows, etc. were never followed through on.  Worst of all the walls are paper thin and you will hear your neighbors every move.  The pictures are deceiving, the pool is not much bigger than a hot tub at a normal hotel.  With 40-50 people on the surrounding deck they were literally bringing out towels 2 or 3 at a time every 30 minutes or so.  There are much better options in Barcelona.",2,2012,08,29
35,"Super rooms, great views.","Plus points: Stayed two nights, rooms very comfortable, breakfast superb. A great base from which to explore the city and the waterfront. Lots to do within a stone's throw. Some noise from ships and ferries in the harbour but I quite liked that.

Not so good: Roof top pool is small and tends to be busy but it's on the roof and you can see everything so...",4,2012,08,28
35,Clean and a great location....but don't get ripped off by the taxis!,"Stayed at the Grand Marina for a night after our cruise. Found the hotel very friendly and the location perfect for tourists! Only downside of our stay was the rip-off taxi drivers. We paid 40 euros for a 5 minutes taxi ride from the port to the htel...we could have walked it in 20 minutes. When we checked out we were pleased to find out that the hotel have their own car service to the airport. We were afraid we'd be hit with another big fare. The hotel car was a fixed price of 35 euros and we were driven by a friendly English driver in a luxury car. If we hadn't had asked about the hotel car, we wouldn't have know about it so don't fogret to ask.",3,2012,08,28
35,very good,For our short trip in Barcellona we stayed at the grand marina hotel.Is a very nice and comfortable hotel in a excellent location.Walking distance to attraction and good restaurant.To bad the pool was closed.,4,2012,08,27
35,Bendigedig,"Ailsa B - I concur.  I looked like a Brit in 35C heat most of my stay and was still treated attentively.  Rooms spacious, well appointed and buffet breakfast best I have seen.  After reading reviews of other accommodation in Barcelona, the main complaint seems to be uncomfortable beds  - not here!  Extremely comfy and very good linen.  10 mins from Las Ramblas (if that), easy stroll to Barceloneta yet peaceful and tranquil.  Look out for good price deals too for extar value",5,2012,08,27
35,Treated like Royalty!,"Have just spent 4 fantastic days at this luxurious hotel and have come away feeling like a VIP.  Check in went very smoothly, room had the most comfy hotel bed, linen spotless, towels thick and fluffy, complimentary bath/shower gel, shampoo, tissues, comb, toothbrush & paste. Extra towels and pillows brought up immediately after request.
Breakfast was a banquet! Cereal, fresh fruit, smoothies, hams, cheeses, smoked salmon, breads, croissants and pastries.  Staff attention was 100 percent at all times.  Individual omelettes or poached egg made to perfection.
Evening piano entertainment to top off an elegant evening.  Yes the drinks are pricey but it is 5star!  Pool overlooking the marina had free towels, shower facilities and gym.  
Location was excellent, very well lit in the evening and felt safe (we were 2 ladies alone).  All in all I really did not want to leave.  A fantastic hotel that could not have done more!",5,2012,08,25
35,THE WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE EVER,"Although Im a frequent traveller, and experienced the good and the bad,this was a nightmare.upon arrival we had to wait an hour to check in,although our booking was done three weeks in advance,the reception staff were rude and arrogant,and none of our room requests
 were granted.of course there is no one to complain to,since the receptionist is the concierge and the porter .Housekeeping is another hassle we had to deal with,I requested my room to be cleaned at 10am,but wasnt attended to until 3 pm,of course ,there were no ameneties,such as water or coffee in the rooms,,and the restaurants were terrible,pillows and towels were smelly and the overall service was totally horrible
I dont know how they got to be a 5 star hotel,but three is more than they deserve,

My advice stay away from this hostel

Simsim",1,2012,08,23
35,Wonderful start to our vacation,"We stayed at this luxurious hotel prior to our cruise.    It is conveniently located close to the cruise terminal.   As we pulled in front of the hotel, I knew we would be very happy with our stay here.   We were a group of 8 adults and each and every one of us were greeted by name and a huge smile :)   Upon check-in we were informed that our rooms were not quite ready yet, but they were happy to keep our luggage for us and offered us water.      We took this opportunity to take a walk and returned a few hours later.    We were VERY surprised to learn that all our rooms were upgraded.   WOW!    We were so impressed with the size and cleanliness of the rooms.   I have stayed at 5 star hotels in NYC and they were not as clean as this.      Oh, by the way, a full breakfast buffet was included!     We all agree, this hotel was a wonderful start to a beautiful vacation!",5,2012,08,22
35,Thank you for a wonderful stay,"We stayed 4 nights at this charming hotel. Its a very well located property on the cruise terminal just next to the Ramblas. The hotel looks basic from the outside but we were very impressed with the rooms. We took a family suite and were delighted by the size of the room. Its the largest that we have seen in Europe. The breakfast room service was excellent. Did not try any of their restaurants. 

The hotel made an error in our booking but more than made up by giving us an upgrade. The pool was really small on the rooftop of the hotel. For those who are looking for a well located hotel with comfortable rooms this is a very good choice.",4,2012,08,21
35,worst 5 star hotel i have ever been to,"This hotels rooms are modern and may appear to be new; but oh my God the smell of their towels and pillows are truly disgusting. Their rooms. have no complimentary water, tissues(Kleenex) or coffee and tea in the room. The staff overall are arrogant and rude, and I really blame the Spanish tourist ministry for giving them a 5 star rating, I would rate them a 3 star hotel at most if I felt generous. The restaurant and bar staff find it hard to serve you properly, so imagine what they would do if their economy was good. Finally the reception staff are truly rude and have no respect for their guests and especially Manuel is the  RUDEST. The only good note was the location otherwise for this kind of service you would be better off at a 3 star hotel with 3 star prices, please listen to me and avoid this hell hotel at all costs",1,2012,08,20
35,What you see is what you get,"We had a problem with our reservation at another hotel and they recommended the Grand Marina Hotel. This is not the kind of hotel that I would normally book, but I was pleasantly surprised. They found us a nice room a the last minute, everything was very clean, and the service was helpful and friendly. If you don't like surprises and want sure value for money, then this hotel is for you.",4,2012,08,20
35,Pre Cruise Grand Marina,"Stayed at Eurostars Grand Marina one night for a pre cruise stay.
I took a taxi from the airport, traffic was busy so journey took about 25 minutes, fare with tip was €40.
Hotel check in was efficient and quick. I had booked a special deal pre paid room with Eurostars website, I did not get a room upgrade but there was a special amenity kit in the bathroom which contained combs, shampoos, toothbrush and paste etc.
The room was very comfortable however on a previous stay I had been upgraded to a larger room with walk in shower room.
The hotel is very convenient for walking to the Ramblas  and I had a reasonable meal in the large shopping centre near to the hotel.
The HoHo busses start from the drive leading up to the hotel which is convenient for those wanting to tour the beautiful city of Barcelona.
I would certainly stay at The Grand Marina Hotel again it suited my travel plans very well.",4,2012,08,19
35,Does the Jon,"Although I wtract tending a conference, the hotel felt more like a resort than business travel (which is a good thing!). Staff were very obliging and full of smiles. We had a few drinks at the bar and found the atmosphere very friendly. The hotel is well situated yet slightly set back from the more crowded parts of town. Rooms were well proportioned and very comfortable.",5,2012,08,19
35,Businesslike but Lovely,"I stayed in this Hotel in late July 2012 and although I had heard and read much about its impersonal and businesslike feel manner I must admit I found it to be both very efficient, friendly and luxurious. My check-in was faultless with everyone on hand to help out with information and help with my bags. My room, although for 1 person was huge, modern and luxurious. The view from the pool area on top was fantastic and a swim in the pool was most refreshing. Free towels and wonderful bar service at the poolside complemented the relaxing feeling there. I most definitely will be returning to this lovely hotel. If I had a problem with this hotel it might be that it is a little bit away from the centre.....this did not affect me whatsoever and to be fair there are 50 taxis outside every minute of the day.",4,2012,08,17
35,"Fabulous location, memorable stay","The Grand Marina is perfectly located a few minutes wakl from Las Ramblas and a quick stroll over to the beach, marina and all of the sights of Barcelona.
The rooms were a perfect size, the bath had a whirlpool and the view was glorious even from the second floor.
The staff were incredibly helpful and there was always a full bank of taxis ready and waiting outside no matter what time of day.
As we were only there for one night we didn't have dinner however lunch the following day was perfectly tasty.
I would highly recommend this hotel if you after a bit of luxury in the heart of Barcelona.",5,2012,08,16
35,"Not much to look at from the outside, quite lovely inside","I liked this hotel a lot. My only quibble is that the food was very expensive . But the lOcation was perfect for me; away from the crowds, on the water, and within walking distance of la ramblas, barrio gothic, etc",4,2012,08,14
35,Barcelona at its best,"Five star service, Five star accomodation ... being disabled (both my wife and I) they took our car at the front doors (and brought it back to us when we left), saw us to our room etc etc - beautiful hotel with fantastic facilities ... room (suite) was a relaxing pleasure - spacious, clean and [huge] ... worth every Five star cent ...!
Alan & Rose Kudarenko",5,2012,08,12
35,Horror!,"Eurostar Grand Marina Barcelona is infested with huge Cockroaches in the bathroom and room. The hotel is modern, well located, the room was spacious, the bathroom was nice but their cleanliness was below standard! It was unhygienic!
I was amazed when we informed the hotel staff about the cockroaches they seemed to be aware of it. They changed our room which wasted a few hours of our weekend in Barcelona. I thought the horror was over till I checked my bank statement few days later. When we booked the hotel we paid the full amount (Euro 470.54 ) £391.83 (room 2 nights plus breakfast). On check out they confirmed every things has been paid and settled. To my suprise they charged us an extra £153.18 on the 20th July! the day we changed our room!!!
On calling the hotel, they asked us to email their customer services.Its now been 2 weeks ,I still have not got an apology or refund! 
Its a pity, though the property itself is great, I would not recommend this hotel!",1,2012,08,09
35,Standard business hotel,"Hotel is modern and clean but nothing special: perfect for a quick trip where you spend most of your time out and about. Location is convenient, near the end of the Ramblas, expect a 10 minute walk from the closest metro.",3,2012,08,07
35,Lovely hotel in great location,"Lovely hotel in a great location.
We pad about £600 for 3 nites for room only via ebookers I think
We slept 2 adults & 2 kids comfortably in 1 room, bathroom was great as shower & toilet screened off from bath & sink area so less queues for bathroom!
Fridge ( minibar) & decent hair dryer in room but no iron or kettle or coffee maker
View from our balcony were great up towards city & to see different cruisers or ferries each day parked up either side of us
Nice bar & restaurant although a bit pricey
1 of the reasons we chose this hotel was for rooftop pool for 4 year old but it was very cold & too deep for him to stand in, but for adults there s a spa with a jacuzzi on the roof & views from roof are great.
Location excellent: 5 min walk to ramblas & port area with lots of restaurants & short walk to beach also
Felt like Maybe a decent 4 star rather than a 5 star hotel
Would stay at this hotel again",4,2012,08,05
35,Eurostars Grand Marina,"Hy to everyone,
A few weeks ago I came back from Barcelona, where I stayed at Eurostars Grand Hotel.
Everything was nice, the hotel is situated in Port Vell and from your terrace you can see lots of ship cruises. Even if this ships have the engine running, in the room there is no noise. ( I posted a view pictures with the view from my room )
I was also very satisfyed of their room service and of the breakfast. 
Another good thing is the location of the hotel, which is very close to Las Ramblas, close to the sea and in front of the hotel you can always find a taxi and there is also the station for the double-deckers. 
Also on the top of the hotel you have a little swimming pool, where you can relax.
All in all I can say that I would recommend you this hotel!
I hope you will find this useful!",5,2012,08,05
35,Quality hotel,"We picked the hotel based on tripadvisor reviews, and were quite happy with the room and service. Some of the advisors have said it was noisy but we didnt notice that at all even tho there was several cruiseliners there at the time. We asked for a room in front of the hotel with view toward the city, and we got a balcony as well. well worth it. The pool was very small and to few sun beds, so it was almost never any avaliable. The bar ripped you of and a mojito cost 16 euro..

5-8 minutes walk to la rambla, 10-15 minutes walk to the shopping center by the marina and the place is not close to any beach at all. So if you need to go to the beach, take a taxi. A bit far from the metro also if you plant to use it, but close to a hop-on-hop-off bus route",4,2012,08,04
35,Nice location and comfortable stay,"The best thing about this hotel was its location - ten minute walk from the La Ramblas, one minute walk from the Hop On Hop Off tour stop and right next to the cruise ships. The rooms were quite large and very comfortable - we had booked four family suites (2x2 interconnected rooms) plus one superior room, for our family of ten (two families of four + my parents). Breakfast was not part of our booking so we ordered room service - the breakfasts were large and sumptuous and two breakfasts were enough for a family of four (2 adults & 2 children). The bags of toiletries in the bathroom were beautifully packed and had everything required and more !

The problem areas in the hotel - their reservations department and front desk don't seem to communicate. I had made bookings well in advance - in early April for stay in second week of July, but when we arrived late night after an exhausting journey, our rooms were not ready. Though we had reservations for five rooms, we were given only three and had to go through almost an hour of harassment and frayed tempers. Only after the intervention of one of the senior managers was the issue resolved and we got the rooms the following morning. The other problem area - phones are not attended to, whether it is the reception or the room service.

However, all in all, we had a very comfortable stay and I would highly recommend the hotel to people on a first time/ sightseeing visit to Barcelona. For my next visit though, I would like to stay in the Barri Gotic area (old part of the city) for it's lovely cafes, narrow cobbled streets and curious little shops.",4,2012,08,04
35,Not a true 5 Star,"We stayed here at the end of our honeymoon. As the hotel did not have our room ready for us when we checked in (we had requested an early check in) reception told us we could have breakfast and relax by the pool. When we went to have breakfast the  lady at the breakfast desk was very rude to us, questioning if we really were staying in the hotel as we did not have a room number. This behaviour by a member of staff to a guest ( who is paying quite a lot of money in a hotel like this) is unacceptable. We had just returned from a cruise with Royal Carribean and they could really teach some of the staff in this hotel a thing or two! The bar staff were excellent, could not fault them, very friendly and very polite. Our room was 210, lovely bed, beautiful bathroom, very clean, however i booked a superior room and expected a balcony, but we got a room on the 2nd floor over looking a storage unit of some sort. I had told the hotel that it was our honeymoon when  i booked, being a 5 star i was expecting a nice treat in our room, but there was nothing, which was a let down I must admit. All in all, I would be very slow in returning to this hotel again. ",3,2012,07,31
35,5 star hotel overlooking marina,"Just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel. I wanted to book a family room to accommodate 1 adult and my 2 children and this hotel had a great offer. It included a triple room, with tickets to the Camp Nou stadium ( a must for any football fans) , 10% discount off the bus truistic and included a fantastic buffet breakfast. 
 
The hotel is situated right in the heart of the marina and you are surrounding by cruise ships coming and going. Its about a 10 minute walk to the bottom of Las Ramblas and Port Vell marina where you will find your nearest shops, restaurants, boat trips, cinema, imax, aquarium. The bus turistic leaves from outside of the hotel door every 10 mins or so on the red route around the city. 

The room is very spacious with 3 single beds, a balcony overlooking the city and harbour, jacuzzi bath with separate shower room and a changing/luggage room all beautifully smartly decorated.

The breakfast buffet has everything from yoghurts, fruits, cooked meats, cold meats, cheese, bread, cakes, croissants, 10 different juices, espressos, cereals, omelettes cooked to order, smoked salmon and nothing is too much trouble , all presented beautifully with happy fantastic staff, our favourite was Albert.

Perhaps the only downside of the hotel is the pool area, its situated on the roof and is a fairly small pool for such a lot of guests with everyone fighting over the limited loungers, although there is an indoor jacuzzi too.

Would definitely recommend and return.",5,2012,07,31
35,A very nice hotel - if not quite top-rank,"The reviews here are more mixed than I've ever seen! Here are my personal impressions.
We booked a flight/hotel package through ebooker.com and got the hotel bit for about £144 per night (we stayed a week) That's a fair bit for the continent, but the situation is very central (5 mins from Las Ramblas) and yet on a wharf into the dock so there's no traffic noise.  There is however a noticable low-pitched throbbbing noise frrom the ferries that dock alongside.  Speaking for myself and my companion we didn't find this intrusive, but some reviewers here did. 
The room was classed as ""superior"" and was extremely large and very clean. It even had an ironing board in the wardrobe - something I've always had to ask for before. The view is of the dock and the ships: quite pleasant I thought.
The breakfast is beyond anything I've ever had in a hotel.  Freshly squeezed orange juice; free cava (the local champagne); smoked salmon and other high-class stuff.  The sting in the tail is that it isn't included and is £25 per person! However, we ate there three times just for the experience. There is a gym with every machine you can think off and it's almost deserted! The pool, as has been noted is very small. The Barcelona playa (sea swimming) is very good however and is about a 25 min. walk away.",4,2012,07,31
35,I would definitely go there again!,"Great location, lovely hotel, superb service. Spacious well equipped room, very comfortable bed with good pillow menu.  Would be nicer if rooms had tea/coffee making facilities.  The staff make you very welcome and feeling well looked after. The pool was very small, so disappointing.  Do not eat in the hotel restaurant.  Breakfast is great but the dinner menu is overpriced and our food overcooked and tasteless.",5,2012,07,28
35,"Great location, lovely hotel","My boyfriend and I went here in July 2012 for 3 nights. The hotel is in a great location 2 minutes from las ramblas, nearest metro is Drassanes and a short walk from Barceloneta!!!  

The hotel is generally airy, clean and modern. The reception were good in that they took our bags when we arrived around 10am but our room was not ready till 2pm so we had to go sightsee but felt tired looking after our early flight. One thing that could be improved upon is that the reception be more helpful and give a map and some tourist information as I have had in other cities.

The room was a queen superior room and was lovely, big and clean. The bathroom was marble and had all the amenities of clean towels, shower gel, shampoo/conditioner, toothbrush/toothpaste, shaving things and combs.  We were on the 7th floor and had a great view of the harbour which was lovely.

The hotel has a rooftop pool which is not very big at all. 3/4 people can realistically be in the pool to paddle about but you cannot have a proper swim. Despite this it was heavenly to have a dip in the cool water after being in the sweltering heat all day. There is also a sauna which I did not go near or the gym. There is a jacuzzi which had pretty hot water in it so I didn;t venture in,  The bar on the roof has reasonable charges of 4 euros for soft drinks 7 euros for beer and they give u free crisps.

The bar/restaurant on the first floor was nice and we went there almost every evening. Their cocktails are pricey at 12 euros and beer for 7 euros but they were yummy and very alcoholic. The best cocktail being the strawberry mojito! We ate there on our last day before going to the airport and I have to say for the price you pay its not worth it when you could get better food out of the hotel.

A taxi to/from the airport should cost around 25-30 euros. A taxi into main area costs 5-10 euros. 

Overall because of location I think its an excellent hotel but the hotel itself I would not say is 5 star as their service and provisions for tourists are not 5 star.",5,2012,07,26
35,Definately 5 star,"The sun terrace is lovely as long as you can get a sunbed, location is brilliant and hotel is stunning to look at from afar, the bedrooms are boutique chiq and have everything you need but no coffee and tea making facilities",5,2012,07,24
35,A big dissapointment,"This is not a five star hotel. We have been at five star hotels and this hotel does not even come close. The chairs in the room were falling apart. The shower door did not close properly so you always walked out to a pool. The air condition broke and we had to change rooms. They insist on valet parking your vehicle but refuse to take responsibility for what happens to it. They dented the side of the vehicle. The food is expensive and not worth the money. The staff tries but has no common sense. My wife has food allergies and what she ordered from the menu did not mention that it had shell fish. This could be deadly if by chance I had not asked that specifically. When you order meat in this hotel’s restaurant, “well done” is the equivalent of “medium rare” in the US. Check because you may have to ask them for charcoal meat to get it well done. There were many more issues but I don’t have the time to or the space to list them all.
Do not use their currency exchange services. There is a bank in the mall and their rates are reasonable without a fee.
The cruise boats make a lot of noise until late at night and early in the morning you get to enjoy the ferries on both sides of the hotel.
A manager (Nacho) promised to refund us the cost for parking (28 Euros) per day due to the damage done to the vehicle and all the inconveniences we suffered. The day we checked out he was nowhere to be found and of course the credit had not been done. He did send me an email apologizing but has not credited my account. 
DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!!! It is expensive and a big disappointment.",1,2012,07,23
35,Contemporary 5 * in a Great Location,"We stayed here for 7 nights. The hotel has a minimalist contemporary design. After the first night we moved rooms to one with a view of the sea/marina. The first room had a fantastic shower and the second a great jacuzzi, standard shower a balcony and a great view! Breakfast is Euro50 for two! If you order room service breakfast it goes up to a ridiculous Euro66 for two!! 

The location is very good as it is only 5 mins walk from La Rambla and the Gothic Quarter and it is 2 mins from the new place to go in Barcelona La Rambla de Mar.

Staff are friendly and helpful and provide the level of professional service you would expect in a hotel like this",4,2012,07,22
35,Mediocre.,"We have been in Barcelona for a week. We changed our stay for the last two nights from the Gran Florida to the Gran Marina. What a mistake!!
This hotel is without character! Cold and minimalistic. 
The staff means well and tries hard but they are completely without support. 
The food is average at best. The only upside of the steak I ordered was the amount of grissle contained in the cut allowed me to floss without buying any. The location has its benefits and is why we chose this hotel. The location is not worth the price or dissappointment.
If you want to experience Barcelona in an authentic way, do not stay here! ",3,2012,07,21
35,Amazing hotel with amazing views!,"We had the pleasure of staying at the Eurostars Grand Marina on our trek across Europe on a Med cruise. This is truly a 5* experience. The location is unique in that it is located directly on the end of a pier. We loved the open, airy feel in the lobby, the elegant furnishings, and the artwork throughout the hotel was tastefully selected. We booked a special that included breakfast and were not disappointed.  The breakfast service was excellent and staff were very attentive.There were a lot of choices available for a palate of tastes. 

Although the hotel is massive, it contains less than 300 rooms because the suites are HUGE. Each suite is spacious with a private balcony and views of the Med. I loved that the suite was completely sectioned off with a separate bedroom, bath, walk in closet and long entryway with hard wood floors. The rooftop cafe, fitness center, and pool were unique. Nicely done. The views of the surrounding area are breathtaking from the rooftop. You can literally see all of downtown Barcelona and at night the city lights are spectacular. The beds are much firmer than what we were accustomed to but after traveling for 15 hours, we hardly noticed. One huge advantage of being in this location is the noise level was minimal. Las Ramblas is roughly a 10 minute walk from the hotel. We strolled down Las Ramblas and as a light sleeper, I could not imagine having a hotel on such a busy avenue. the other advantage is the distance to the cruise port. Staff were very accommodating and the executive shuttle (Mercedes sedan) was only 15 euros to transfer to the cruise port.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and will definitely be back in the future.",5,2012,07,21
35,Great place to stay for a short break,"My husband and I stayed here for four nights in July and thought it was ideally situated for sightseeing the city of Barcelona. All the staff we encountered we very pleasant and courteous. The ""hop on, hop off"" bus stops directly outside of the hotel and it's only 5 minutes walk from Las Ramblas and a twenty minute walk around the harbour to the beach. We stayed on a bed & breakfast basis and the buffet breakfast served a wide variety to suit all tastes of very good quality food and also champagne was served. The rooms were nicely decorated and very spacious. Even though the pool was not very big, the sunbathing terrace was very nice to catch a couple of hours rays after a hard day walking round the city. I would recommend this hotel to anyone spending a few days sightseeing who expect a very good standard of accomodation and situate. The only fault I could report is the cost of the drinks by the pool, expensive....17 euros for a small beer and a G&T...thought it was a little steep.",5,2012,07,21
35,Unprepared for my check in,"Sorely disappointed with the check in. I traveled over 20 hours from India with my wife, eagerly looking forward to this hotel recommended by a friend from London. We were duly given a confirmation by email, number and description of a sea facing room booked for us - and we were thrilled with anticipation. Unfortunately all the excitement was misplaced. Not only did we straggle in tired, and were made to wait for 20 minutes, we were also told our booked room was not ready (at our check in at 12 noon!) and will take another hour. We had no choice but to opt for their ultimatum - a twin bedded room facing the buildings within.
In addition our friend, also staying there had a terrible experience in the bathroom with an unexpected visitor in form of a cockroach.
So - upshot - no ready booking  - no sea facing room, and not a pleasant check in.
Am waiting to see if the next few days throw up any more surprises.",2,2012,07,20
35,Grand Marina Hotel and Cruise Trips,"We stayed at the Grand Marina pre and post cruise in mid June. We flew in from Qatar and arrived at the hotel around 0900 hrs. The trip from the airport took around 20 minutes. We found the location great for what we were there for. It is a five-minute walk to Las Ramdlas (just past the impressive Christopher Columbus monument), which is a pedestrian area full of outdoor restaurant/cafes great for people watching. We came across a great outdoor show of martial arts buskers. The hotel is a business /convention type hotel and overlooks the port. I found the room we had large by European standards (we had three people) with a very nice washroom and a balcony. Our balcony faced into the large courtyard but you can go up on the roof and see your ship berthed in the port. What I was happiest about was the fact on our arrival and return we were able to get our rooms early in the morning (it is a big hotel). That is not a guaranteed feature but was very much appreciated when traveling with a tired six year old. If you have a lot of luggage touch base with the staff on arrival, as there is a big difference if you wish to reserve the hotels Van the night before the cruise and the morning of (I think it was around 75 euros difference). The staff I was dealing with the morning of the cruise told me he would check and see if he could get the advanced price and I did get the cheaper rate. I found the staff professional, the hotel clean, the rooms large and the location great. The pool is small (on the roof) and is more like a plunge pool then a swimming pool but you can relax and sunbath if you wish. Gym is decent as far as hotel gyms go. Breakfast buffet was good with iced sparkling wine available as part of the buffet. Barcelona it self seems to be a very vibrant and interesting city. When we get a chance we will go back for three or four nights and would stay at the Grand Marina Hotel again.",5,2012,07,20
35,"Expensive, but worth it!","We (a group of 14 from 6 to 70) stayed here for a couple of nights in June before going on a Mediterranean cruise.  For a stay of a short period of time, it was well worth it!  The location was within walking distance of Las Ramblas, the ""hop on, hop off"" bus lines stopped in front of the hotel, and the marina was always interesting.  It was easy to get a taxi to the ship after our stay.  The kids enjoyed the rooftop swimming pool after a long day.

The breakfast which was part of the rate for most of the rooms was very good and you could eat outside under the tangerine (or orange) trees. The rooms were spacious and many of the family ones had balconies on which to stand outside.

We did ride the ""hop on, hop off"" bus to the beach, have lunch at an outdoor cafe, and walk back to the hotel (a doable, but very long walk).

In summary, excellent location to see Barcelona in a short period of time, but expensive.",5,2012,07,19
35,Great Luxury Hotel,"This hotel was clean and the staff were very professional. It was centrally located for all of our sightseeing plans. 

The breakfast buffet is awesome.",5,2012,07,17
35,Could do better,"First impressions - Reception area not impressive
Rooms OK, balcony small with no chairs.
Would not class as as 5 star more a good 4 star.
No noise from the cruise lines as others have mentioned, comfy beds and a pillow menu. 
A little out of the way of town but of easy walking distance. Perfect for us unless your walking down las ramblas where you will find prostitutes and drug dealers late at night!
Pool area with a small gym, jacuzzi, showers and sauna area - Lovely, however no shade at all. Bar menu very expensive even for a 5 star.
We had a late flight but decided not to pay 75e for late check-out as we used the showers at the pool area where gowns, towels, shower gel and lockers were provided.
We did use the bar at night on 2 evenings where we found the surroundings very pleasant.
It is was it is, a business centre/ cruise stop hotel.
Yes we would return at the right price.",4,2012,07,15
35,"Smart, Central, Expensive","Smart 5 star hotel in the gentrified docks area.  Perfectly situated for a weekend break - you couldn’t get more central without a lot of traffic noise.  Modern comfortable quiet room, fierce air.conditioning (and you need it in hot and humid Barcelona), free Wifi, very trendy pillow menu illustrated with glamour photos of Marilyn Monroe and Rita Hayworth which may confuse Japanese guests.  Loo a bit cramped with a bidet in there as well, and I really don’t see the point of his and hers handbasins.   

It’s one wing of the World Trade Center Barcelona, a somewhat disconcerting name.  Our room overlooked a courtyard and the WTC offices, a bit of a disappointment as we had hoped for a sea view, or at least a view over the city.

The view from the roof is worth a look though - harbour and city.  I didn’t know that Barcelona had its own gherkin, which lights up blue and red at night.  The pool is very dinky, the gym well equipped but underused.  

We didn’t dare eat breakfast at 33 euros a head, but one morning found a pleasant cafe overlooking the Sagrada Familia, and the next went to the ferry terminal cafe round the corner",4,2012,07,15
35,A Great Stay,"We stayed for 3 nights last weekend. When we arrived I thought the atrium was not very grand however we received a warm wecome and our room was available at 10am which was excellent.
We had paid for the basic room and yet we had an upgrade. We had a beautiful room with a balcony and the air conditioning was fantastic.
The bed was comfortable although some of the room was a bit worn.
Overall the hotel is very nice. It is well located as it is out of hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas but within a 5 minute walk. Also it has a fabulous shopping centre with many nice eateries within 5 minutes walk too! (the Magnum centre) The open top bus ride goes from right outside the hotel and it is brilliant. It is a 10 euro ride in a taxi to port olympic which is great for the evening. We went to a restaurant right on the beach and it turned into a night club around us. As we were sat outside we ended up in the vip area without paying!!!!!
The staff at the hotel were all very courteous and helpful. The pool was very small but nevertheless it was lovely sunbathing on the roof and looking over the Marina.
I would definitely stay again as overall it definitely ticked all the boxes.",5,2012,07,15
35,Optimum comfort in Spanish Splendour!,"The Eurostars Grand Marina is a luxurious hotel located in the attractive setting of Barcelona Port. I would have to say the Hotel staff are wonderful, highly personable and most helpful. Our hotel suite was beautiful, it overlooked the city and was very spacious and furnished to a high level. We over looked Gaudi’s Cathedral- The Sagrada Familia...which is STUNNING! And well worth the visit. A taxi ride from the hotel only costs roughly 10 euro, the cathedral is the perfect retreat for the day...I recommend it highly. As for the amenities in the hotel, the gym is great and boasts an array of equipment. The swimming pool is rather small and is not heated is on the roof of the hotel and overlooks the harbour which is beautiful. There is a large supply of sunbeds available on the roof terrace. This space is comfortable and superbly presented and becomes highly attractive in contrast to the long trek it takes to get to the beach. The Lounge/Bar area is wonderful, there was pianist there most nights, which sets up the perfect backdrop for dining in the evening. The lounge area also offers a relaxing space to unwind in the evening. Lastly, breakfast time! I personally have to champion the array of food on offer, and so can my business partner who revelled in its delights!! The food was fabulously presented and of an outstanding quality, I would highly recommend the breakfast on offer to accompany your stay. With the option of free champagne at breakfast, one can hardly resist. This hotel lives up to its 5 star rating on a number of levels. Not only is this leisure paradise set in a prime location in Barcelona, the warmth and radiance of the people who run it make it a wonderful place to wake up each morning. For this I thank them. Have a wonderful stay.",5,2012,07,13
35,"Excellent quality, not much character","We stayed here after a motorcycle trip around Spain and it felt like a palace with it's spacious, clean rooms, decks and patios. It's in the middle of the cruise ship docks so the location is good (very central) while still being quite isolated. It's not far to walk to anything from there, but it's not really close to anything either. Service is excellent (except in the restaurant where it was often slow) without being friendly. The valet let us park our bikes on the concourse, so that was appreciated. Food was excellent. If anything, it feels a bit sterile but that's to be expected of a hotel that caters to cruise ships and conferences, in my opinion. I don't normally like to travel this way, but it was perfect for us because we had spent a week in Barcelona at the beginning of the trip and stayed in El Gothic where we were more engaged with the city.",5,2012,07,13
35,Good location,"Lovely hotel. Looks very grand inside and outside. We stayed in January and the tempreture was a modest 11 deg. Good location. 20 minutes from airport. 5 minute walk to las rambalas. Hotel clean, lovely rooms and views over the cruise ship dock. Beautifully lit up at night. Good choice of restaurants near by, from fine dining to American grills. Good atmosphere. Would definantly return. Felt safe in Barcelona as a young couple. ",5,2012,07,12
35,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed one night pre cruise at this hotel. The room was beautiful, as was the bathroom with jacuzzi bath.
We did not have to touch our luggage on arrival. It was quickly put on a trolley to be taken to our room, true 5 star style.
We did not have breakfast but the terrace looked lovely, with great views.
The rooftop pool is not big but adequate for cooling off and the surrounding sun terrace was great for sunbathing. Towels are there for you to help yourselves. 
The only downside was the price of drinks. They too were truly 5 star. We enjoyed two bacardi and cokes. On paying the bill the next morning we found our pleasure had cost 22 euros for the two drinks. It was worth it for the experience but I will ask in future.
It was great to see our ship berthed nearby in the morning.
It is a short walk from the Ramblas but far enough away to be out of the bizz, a perfect location.If I were to go back to Barcelona I would certainly stay her again.",5,2012,07,10
35,Great location - good for business,"Stayed here for a business conference, and got to see some of the city.  Redline double decker bus stops right by the hotel, and you can pick up discounted tickets.  Great fun and easy way to see the city.",4,2012,07,09
35,Fantastic weekend in Barcelona !,"Can not fault this hotel. We had room 807 overlooking the port. Lovely view, no noise and lovely watching the cruise ships come and go. Breakfast included in our stay and was great, everything you could want and as much as you like. All staff attentive and friendly. Barcelona itself is beautiful, well worth using the tourist bus to really see the city and easy to hop on and off when you want. Also used the metro which was surprisingly straight-forward. Best food off La Rambla, found a great Italian with reasonable prices. All in all a fantastic weekend and would definitely use this hotel again.",5,2012,07,09
35,Perfect Location,Its in the perfect location for sight seeing and with restaurants and a shopping centre just around the corner it's the perfect place to stay. Rooms are very spacious and are finished very well. We took a trip up to the roof where you can look out over the whole city with fantastic views! ,5,2012,07,09
35,Beautiful with great location,We stayed in a the Marina suite. So we had a a full view of the harbor and city/hills. The room was spacious and felt like a small apartment (no kitchen not even coffee machine) with a great view.  The location was super convenient. walking distance (5 minutes) to La Rambla and the harbor shopping center without the noise.  The breakfast was excellent with an unbelievable variety.  The front desk could have been friendlier. I felt I had to pomp them for answers to my questions and sometimes they weren't helpful at all where they could have been. I rate it very good instead of excellent because of this and the lack of coffee machine.,4,2012,07,08
35,Bed bugs room 801!,"We just came back from Barcelona and we stayed at Eurostars. The location was great and the breakfast buffet was very good. The problem was our bed had bed bugs and when we complained they did not think it was a big deal or they didn't understand. We are still trying to contact the hotel management to let them know so they can do something. Either way if you stay here don't stay in 801, not sure about the other rooms. ",3,2012,07,07
35,Great location,"The perfect location, quiet but very central. Everything is on walking/biking distance. The rooms are spacious, shower is excellent. No possibility to make coffee or tea. Business atmosphere. Value for money: ok.",4,2012,07,07
35,"Nice hotel, but rooms lack 5 star touch","Location of hotel great, close to las ramblas(5min walk) and about a 15 minute walk to beach, Didnt eat within hotel so cannot comment on the food. 
Room was ok - I wouldnt say 5 star though, spacious enough but rooms and bathrooms are slightly worn looking. Also, no tea/coffee facilities within room...if you want a coffee you'll need to pay 5 euro for one from room service! Ridiculous price for coffee! Had a small balcony, overlooked on to offices. Personally for the money, I think you could probably stay in a better hotel in Barcelona. Fine if its for a business trip....and your company is paying for your coffee!!",4,2012,07,06
35,Excellent for families with children,"Excellent for family traveling with children... rooms are big, my toddler slept in the sofa (seating area) very comfortably, and they also provided crib for my younger daughter.
Location is very convenient, close to the port (if you arrive or are taking a cruise), the tourist city bus stop is a few steps away from the hotel door... We found the location very convenient to walk around, near Las Ramblas, Old Port, etc.
We would definitely recommend this hotel.
PS. Excellent Sunday Brunch as well!!",5,2012,07,05
35,"Good location, tiny pool","We booked into this hotel for a long awaited trip to Barcelona and I cannot fault the location.  Our room had a great view over the harbour and the city and you could glimpse the Sagrada Famiglia too, an added bonus.  There are ships coming in and out all day and night, and yet we could hear little from our room.  The room was large and comfortable, as was the bathroom.  We never ate at the hotel so I cannot comment on the food. but the service generally was good, if perhaps a little impersonal.  They have a lot of people who come and go for one night only before or after a cruise to it's like a constantly revolving door of people for them I guess.  

The hotel is very well located.  We could walk to the Ramblas and along the waterfront to find any number of eating options and just for a stroll.  There are some great places to eat in Barcelona, but as others have said, it's good to get off the Ramblas to eat as there are plenty of good value options off the main drag.

My only real criticism of the hotel is the pool.  It is tiny.  With four people in it, it's full.  The photos are very deceiving.  There is also no shade either on the pool or the few lounges ranged along the concrete balcony area.  I do think for a hotel of this standard the pool facilities should be better.

However, I would be more than happy to recommend this hotel to friends.",4,2012,07,05
35,Top Quality hotel on the seafront,"An excellent 5* hotel with spacious rooms and well positioned for exploring Barcelona as the tourist buses are readily available as are taxis. In fact it's only a 5 minute walk from the bottom of Las Ramblas as well.
     We had breakfast include and I have to say it had the largest selection of options I've ever come across with attentive staff as a bonus.
    My only gripe would be the mini bar prices for example £4 for a Mars bar, I don't see why they need to charge extortionate prices for the things in your room, the advice is oviously to leave the mini bar as you found it, untouched !
    The room we had was excellent with sliding panels to separate the lounge (+ TV), bedroom (+ TV) and hall & bathroom, these proved to be both soundproof and light tight so a good night's sleep was assured.",4,2012,07,05
35,» Outstanding Business Hotel «,"This hotel is simply marvelous. The little details make this a great place to stay. 
For example, you are immediately greeted by a top hat wearing doorman that opens the door for you. This is a clear indicator of what you can expect from your stay here.
The concierge staff is quite helpfull, do contact them whenever you need a taxi (And believe me, you'll need it). 

The rooms are outstanding and the views are breathtaking, you can see the whole city from your room (At least I could, but i requested a room facing the city).

Even if you have children you'll be treated like an important business man.",5,2012,07,03
35,Lovely hotel,"Great location on the harbour and at the bottom of 'Las Ramblas', close to public transport links and around 20 minutes from the airport. Room was a junior suite, good size, very clean, but faced the inside of the world trade centre which was a little disappointing as there wasn't much of a view. Breakfast was 25 euro's per head but was rushed and the service was poor. We did complain and the hotel refunded the cost. Gym and leisure area on the roof of the hotel was well equipped and allowed for a relaxing hour after a days sightseeing.",4,2012,07,03
35,Great place,"My wife and I stayed here for four nights in Barcelona and found the place to be great.  We had a room facing the front of the hotel on the 8th floor - it overlooked Barcelona.  I would recommend rooms at the front as the hotel does have many events which can be noisy.  The room was big and the bathroom even bigger - a nice turn down service each night with Godiva chocolates.  The staff were friendly and helpful - my only concern was the pool which become very crowded and no where to escape the Spanish heat of summer.  However, overall a great place.",5,2012,07,01
35,V & M stay at Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel,We stayed at the Hotel for just 2 nights ....good points were ....Staff very Friendly nothing was too much trouble ...we stayed in room 626 small Balcony but sunny in the Morning.... room was clean even by my standards...choice of pillows...large bed ....free fast WiFi ...Roof Terrace with Sun beds and towels ....pool was very small but that didnt bother us ....air con was good ...pretty quiet........just a couple of things i would change and they are ....no Tea/Coffee making facilities in the room and the price of water at the bar was a little bit over the top 6e for 2 glasses .....overall I would stay at this hotel again ......,4,2012,06,29
35,More impressed the second time around,"My husband and I stayed here for about ten days, some years ago, and stayed for one night post cruise this month and the bellman and front desk person remembered us!?!  Unheard of in the hotel industry and unheard of that the same people would still be employed by the same hotel so many years later.  I made a mistake in the booking, which the hotel resolved.  They also checked us in at 8:00 a.m.  I requested a softer pillow from their menu, and it was delivered in minutes.  The room was incredible, included a balcony and a magnificent city view, and we were treated to their breakfast buffet, which was heavenly, including champagne.  It is perfectly located and run by people who really know the hotel business.  We stayed at four and five star hotels throughout our latest meander through Europe and I found this property and room comparable to the Chancery Court in London, the Marriott Champs Elysees in Paris and the Sofitel Lisbon.  The phone service, both calling out and receiving incoming messages don't work well, never did, but I still think that this hotel deserves five stars.",5,2012,06,24
35,"Fantastic location, great breakfasts, friendly staff, poor and expensive  room service, tiny pool .","My wife and I stayed for one week at this hotel on our honeymoon from June 9th to June 16th 2012. We used the famous yellow cab taxi to get from the Airport to the hotel and despite all the warnings we were not ripped off as the total cost was 29 euros incl 3cases in the boot!!. We were welcomed warmly at the reception and our room on the 7th floor had fantastic views over the harbour. The reception area seems very bare and basic for a so called 5 star hotel. We were quite hungry and tired after our journey and decided to order room service. It was well overpriced and they got the order wrong but we waited so long for it that we decided to eat it anyway.We phone several times for them to collect the trolley from our room but after 2 hours of waiting decided just to leave it outside. My tip here is not to order room service.
The location of this hotel is fantastic. ,.. close to Las Ramblas, which despite all the warnings of pickpockets proved to be a great safe place to stroll in the eveinings, although I would avise people to go off down side roads to find the cheapest and best food...it is outrageously overpriced in the restaurants directly on Las Ramblas. I can definitely recommend an open air bus tour at 24 euros per person...it covers the whole city and you can get on and off as often as you like. The buses come every 5 minutes and there are three routes that you can swap on and off all day if you wish. Really good value for money and a great way to orientate yourself with this great City. And it IS  a great city. Fantastic beaches that are walkable from this hotel, wondefful historical bulidings, churches, museums and art galleries and great nightlife if you want it.
The breakfasts at the hotel are superb, fantstic variety, and the staff are so attentive , constantly topping up coffee/ tea and clearing empty plates away quickly. Also they all speak good English and are keen to practice their pronounciation., as a bonus a few of them really helped me with my Spanish as well, and although they were really busy they always had a smile on their faces and always had ""time"" to be attentive. This was a special part of our week.
The roof top pool is tiny but to be fair there were very few people wanting to use it and there are also quite a few loungers to top up your tan. We had uninterrupted sunshine for the whoile week so this was a great alternative to the beach, where the really uncomfortable loungers cost 6 euros each and the umbrella (ours kept collapsing!!!) is also 6 euros. A total of 18 euros a day!!!!
The hotel gym is well equipped and although the hotel was full we seemed to be the only people using it. 
All in all this is a really good. comfortable and well positioned hotel. We absolutely loved our stay there, but compared to some of the 5 star hotels we have stayed at in the Philippines this falls a little short, mainly because of small pool, no coffee making facilities in the room, no complimentary water in the rooms, and a stark and basic reception area.",4,2012,06,24
35,5 Stars?  By What Rating?,"I cannot be any more disappointed in my stay at the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel.  I booked this hotel hoping for a 5 star experience, being that was what I was paying for.  It was for 2 nights following a cruise.  

First impression was the room.  Not good.  The hard wood floors had gaps between the planks that garbage had collected in.  The chair was worn, faded, and the fabric was literally falling off.  The kicker was the bed.  It was as hard as the hard wood floors.  The tv and stand was a sloppy mess with visible wires sloppily hanging in clear view.  To make matters worse, the window handle was broken and could not be opened.  All this would have been fine with me had I booked a 1 or 2 star $100 a night hotel, but this was the Eurostars and I found all this unacceptable.  

We complained to the front desk about the room.  they said they would see what they could do.  30 minutes later in to what should have been our vacation time, we had to call them back to see what could be done.  All they could offer was a room upgrade to a City Suite.  Fine.  However, I had to pay for it.  Whatever.  Just give me the room so I can go see the sights.  They wouldn't even look at our room to verify how bad it was.

The City Suite was better.  However, there were still issues that were far from 5 star.  The bed was still rock hard and the air conditioning did not reach the living room of the suite.  It only cooled the bedroom.  The living room had the balcony sliders, so the room stayed very warm to hot.  To make matters worse, there was no remote for the living room tv.  

Our first night there, we returned to the hotel in the early evening hoping to have a nice dinner followed by a drink in the lounge.  I cannot emphasize how bad of an idea this was.  The dinner restaurant, Aire de Mar, was tiny, very uncomfortable, and was empty.  That should have been our clue, but we had no other option at this point.  Again, we expected good food because the hotel proudly advertised it as a city benchmark.  What?  The food was terrible!  Not only was it bad, it was ridiculous.  It wasn't even Red Lobster quality, let alone 5 star ""benchmark.""

My poor wife's dinner was so bad, she couldn't eat it.  We had to share my tiny, overcooked steak.  She was in tears at this point from shear disappointment and utter frustration with this place.  And as for that after dinner drink, we were so disappointed at that point, all we wanted to do was try to sleep on the rock bed and get the night over with.

I would rather never return to Barcelona than stay at this hotel again.  it baffles me this place can have good reviews.  These people must not know it is advertised as 5 star.  

If there is one good thing I can say about this hotel, it's that the hop on/hop off bus has a stop there.  

Stay away from Eurostars.",1,2012,06,13
35,Lovely Hotel - Great Location,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel last month for 3 nights and we truly enjoyed our visit.  The hotel itself was in an ideal situation, being positioned at the port with only a 10 minute stroll to the bottom of La Rambla.  From our initial interaction, on arrival, with the Concierge through to the excellent and attentive bar / restaurant staff, we felt thoroughly looked after during our entire stay.  We had a suite overlooking the city, which I have to say was furnished to a high standard.  The bathroom was also rather spacious, with a seperate wc / shower area.  Each day our 'luxury' toiletries pack was replenished.  It is the little attention to detail that can make all of the difference.  We dined once in the main restaurant and I have to say that the food was to a very high standard.  We enjoyed breakfast in the hotel each day, and there was a wide variety of food to choose from, including a seperate menu from which you could also order from.  This included things such as poached eggs, scrambled eggs, etc.  Each evening, after we had dined at one of the many seafront restaurants (just a 15 minute walk away), we would return to the hotel bar for a cocktail or two and listen to the wonderful pianist playing many popular songs.  This was a lovely relaxing way to end the evening.  To conclude, my husband and I both have a love for Barcelona and as such make regular visits.  This was our first time staying at the Grand Marina and we will most definately be returning.",4,2012,06,11
35,Great hotel for a short stay,"This was the 2nd time I have stayed here- a last minute booking and got a great deal for a Saturday night (£130). It is short on character but ticks all the boxes for a short stay- easy transfer to airport, always taxis available, tourist bus stops outside, excellent room and service, easy walk to metros and La Rambla, plus you are at the water's edge. The check-in was the quickest I have ever had, and the gentleman at front of house excelled at check -out also. The rooftop terrace is perfect for sunbathing- unfortunately was too breezy to stay out longer, and the small pool offers a nice respite from the heat.The room is spacious, modern & tastefully decorated. It has a jacuzzi bath and you get a nice bag of amenities- tissues, toothbrush, toiletries etc -if they added cotton buds and a cheap razor/foam would be perfect. TV had loads of channels, had ironing board & iron-if they could add a kettle and improve the mattress would be absolutely spot-on. At the weekend there is a charming market at the port side 5 minutes walk away. As other reviewers have said, this would be ideal for a pre-cruise stay but is ideal for a weekender to Barcelona. However, if you want somewhere with more character, look elsewhere.",4,2012,06,10
35,"Close to the ferry, cruise ports and the World Trade Centre","This is a well situated hotel for the ports. It is close to public transport but probably a touch too far out of the city if you want to be in the middle of everything. It is an easy ride from the airport by taxi. The rooms are spacious but the furniture needs updating (the upholstery on my sofa was tatty). A lot of Spanish hotels seem to have hard floors, and this is no exception. The only problem with that is it amplifies noise. Some people might not like the dark wood flooring in the rooms. Contrary to some reviews, I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. 

The breakfast buffet was quite extensive, but I didn't see where you could ask for items made to order and that option was never offered (but maybe that was because I was part of a conference group). The lunch buffet featured lots of salads and it was all fresh and tasty if a little repetitive. There isn't  much of a reception space to sit in and enjoy, but there is a bar at the top of the stairs on the first floor with seating.

I'd recommend this hotel if you need easy access to the port and it is actually part of the World Trade complex.",4,2012,06,10
35,Best hotel ever,"Great hotel! Concierge at the front of the hotel was very polite and very handy to have. The service was the best I had in a hotel before. The rooms was cleaned so well I could see sparkles on each corner of the room. You get what you pay for. The breakfast was cooked perfect and had a big selection of food. 

I don't know how people do not like this hotel, they must be mad. 

I would recommend this hotel to everyone in the world.",5,2012,06,08
35,"Excellent Hotel, excellent service","Arrived by taxi from the airport, only approx 20 min journey.  Hotel situated at 'World Trade Centre', port to many cruise liners. My husband, daughter and I had a suite overlooking the city and we found it fascinating seeing all the cruise liners come and go many came close to the hotel.  Room air conditioned so at night balcony doors closed and you could hear nothing from outside, or was that down to the exhaustion of sightseeing! 
Literally only 10 min walk from Las Ramblas. Personally I enjoyed the fact that it was slightly removed from the busy city night life and anyone doing their proper research of the hotel would notice that it is not in the centre.  But a 10 min walk was no hardship to us.
All the staff were very helpful and extremely courteous. Nothing was too much trouble.  Our bed seemed way bigger that a super king and very comfortable and our daughter slept on a single bed which was far better that some fold up beds she's had to endure.  The room was large, lovely wooden floor, separate wardrobe/changing area and the bathroom was all marble with a monster of a walk-in shower. The bath tub had jets so it was a difficult choice shower or jacuzzi?
Breakfast was to die for!  There was everything you could possibly want. Naturally we took full advantage and found we didnt need a pit stop until our evening meal, which we always took out in the city to get a feel for Barcelona's night life.
Highly recommend the tourist hop on hop off bus, bus stop right outside the hotel. We found that we got a good feel for where everything was initially and then we were able to plan the following days sightseeing.
We took advantage of the roof top pool too which was a pleasing sight after walking all day in the heat (pool freezing!).  All in all enjoyable, we would definitely go back.",5,2012,06,08
35,excellent hotel on excellent location,"the hotel is situated on the water's edge, combining a relaxed and quit location with easy acces to the city ( Ramblas at five minutes walk).Very nice rooms and breakfast.Good and friendly service.",5,2012,06,07
35,Great for business in Barcelona,"The Grand Marina is located right on the water, wasn´t sure if it´s built on a small point or on piers, regardless it´s location is really spectacular.  First impressions, strange tower thing for the gondola ride, not sure what´s up with that.  Lobby is stark and modern, desk and bellman were helpful and spoke english, found service overall at the hotel to be very helpful and attentive.  Room was done nicely, tub has jacuzzi jets, and nice finishes used.  

Rooms have a small deck and a sliding door, didn´t have much of a view looking into the courtyard, but some colleagues looked out onto the water.  Breakfast and dinner down in the lobby restaurant was fine, some of the tapas items were really good.  

My company put on a conference in the attached convention center, so walking over was walking across the plaza noted above.   All in all, great stay in Barca, highly recommend the Euro Grand Marina.",5,2012,06,01
35,Excellent Hotel,"Very good hotel, nicely done and spacious rooms.. Very neat and comfortable stay.

Its right next to ferry port so great for people who want to catch an early boat. Also its a short walk from the famous Ramblas which is an excellent spot for visitors

Views from the hotel top were very cool, breakfast was excellent with a lot of choices. Loved the stay",4,2012,05,31
35,"Good Location, comfortable stay","Location:  Good for getting around the main sites, close to two metros, although the hotel advises you to get off at Parellel metro which is alittle closer I would recommend going to the next stop, Drassenes (Green Line, no. 2) which is at the top of the Ramblas. This line is good for connecting to all the main tourist destinations by the way.  This is a much nicer walk across the marina area as the main road from the Parellel station is a bit run down as other travellers mention in their reviews.  Can be a little noisy at the front as ferries and large ships dock there regularly but it didn't affect our stay there really.

The open topped tourist bus has a stop here so that's an easy way of seeing the main sites of the city and runs into the early evening which is a nice time to go on it.

Hotel Facilities:  Large hotel which is oriented being in the World Trade Centre area towards business visitors but there were some tourists there when we stayed recently.  Piano bar is nice and relaxing and the staff are all very accommodating and friendly.
Room was comfortable but I think the hotel being a few years old is looking a bit tired now, our room was decorated in creams/browns which dated it somewhat.  One of the armchairs was frayed at the top also.  Room was cleaned efficiently each day with clean bedlinen and towels.

Value for money:  booked via a travel booking site and got a good deal with flights from London Heathrow which was very good value.  However, whilst checking in a couple of people asked about the room rates and were quoted between £200-£250 euros per night which I would say is expensive for this hotel.

For the location alone I would recommend this hotel to tourists/business travellers alike.",5,2012,05,28
35,"Good, but not good service","We stay just for one night 05/07 and when we arrived was okay, the only 2 things that I didn't like was at the reception the guy was okay but when I asked him for exchange my dollars to euros he was kind of upset with the situation , then next day I call for an iron to the housekeeping department and my iron never show up!! Mmm little things but ...  A good service is required",3,2012,05,22
35,What a great hotel,This is a great hotel and in one ob the best locations in Barcelona. Just up the street from the Arts and more excellent restaurants than you would think possible. I shall be going back. Excellent value for money.,5,2012,05,22
35,Best hotel stay ever,"Booked a standard room, had a couple of problems so the manager gave me the presidential suite. Honestly I was overwhelmed! It was huge, had a jacuzzi and a huge terrace overlooking barca! 

The room was awesome and with spot on room service and an attitude of looking after guests like that I would reccomend it to anyone. 

FYI

I am writing this review from my terrace now! Experience of a lifetime x",5,2012,05,19
35,Perfect location,"We spent three nights in a Marina Suite at this nice hotel during a weekend holiday in Barcelona. The locations was perfect, just a few hundred meters from La Rambla, with a nice view of the city and harbor. The suite was spacious and very clean, but lacked coffee/tea making facilities. The reception staff was helpful. Roof-top pool and gym nice. Breakfast was excellent, but expensive.",5,2012,05,17
35,Find another hotel to stay at in Barcelona,"This has got to be one of the least welcoming hotels we've stayed at anywhere in the world. The cocktail bar could double as an airport lounge, although the bartender mixers a pretty good cocktail. Unfortunately that's the only good thing I can say about this place. They even told me not to worry about the door not locking from my room onto the balcony, as they'd disabled them all, since a customer got locked out there. Paid a trip to the W hotel while we were there and I'd suggest giving this a go instead.",1,2012,05,16
35,Was expecting a LOT more,"We were very disapointed by this hotel. I had booked a double room, and I contacted the hotel directly beforehand specifically requesting/confirming a double bed on my booking. They assured me this would be no problem. When I arrived we were given TWIN beds. I explained we booked and phoned to confirm a double and they told us to 'Push the beds together' Hmmm Bit of a joke. Patronising and embarrasing in front of my girlfriend and other guests when they suggested this. They then said i COULD have a double but would have to 'downgrade' a room class...the staff (or manager after several emails) STILL couldnt get their head round the fact i was a bit annoyed about this!!! (why on earth would I want to DOWNGRADE to get a bed I already paid for at a HIGHER class) Manager just never seemed to understand this complaint - he kept saying I COULD have had a double (Yes! But in an inferior room to the one I paid for). Needless to say I got ripped off and they just brushed my complaint under the carpet and talked around my complaint - Thats life. Apart from that nasty incident hotel is OK, clean but a VERY lifeless business hotel and in a very quiet area of the docks at night, youll be walking home up a very quiet area of the docks at night with nobody else about. Food is very overpriced compared to eating out in the city and its a lifeless experience as well. Rooms quite small and pokey, although they had a great shower and bathroom and a few free toiletries. You may also struggle to get a good nights sleep..the ferries leave from right outside so the horns and rumbling of the cruise ships can be very loud. All in all I wouldnt reccommend this place The docks are dead at nightime, stay somewhere in the city with more of a 'spanish' experience. Oh and dont get a taxi from directly outside the hotel - walk 5 minutes into town and pick one up...cheaper. basically if your spening this kind of money, you can do a LOT better",1,2012,05,13
35,Best Hotel for Cruisers,"If you are planning a cruise out of the port of Barcelona, Spain then this hotel is a great place to stay before or after your cruise.  It is what I would call the most ""Americanized"" hotel that we have ever stayed at in Spain.  By ""Americanized"", I mean that the hotel is quite modern, very clean and the rooms are large by european standards with a good number of king bedded rooms all with in-suite bathrooms.  The location is very handy to the various cruise lines as the hotel is located in the middle of the port area.  They have a large breakfast buffet, not free or cheap by any means, but if you are planning to stay a few days it would be worth having it at least one morning.  If you are planning to stay just one night before your cruise, I would skip the buffet as your will be sent to the buffet area on the ship to wait for your cabin to be available (most lines it is between 1:30 and 2:30 PM) once you have checked in.  Another plus for this hotel is it's close proximity to the Las Ramblas area which you can walk to in about 5 to 10 minutes...no taxi needed.  The hotel does offer tappas and a small dinner menu at night but the dining area/room that is open at night is quite small so if the weather is good, a walk to Las Ramblas is a better idea.  I would call the price for this hotel reasonable for the area and for what you get but it is not cheap.  Because of the difference between the euro and the dollar you can expect to pay anywhere from $260 to $360 for one night in a king bedded room.",4,2012,05,13
35,"Bit less than expected, can not recommend","When i arrived i found the staff nice, the room clean and beautiful. That is the best to report. Several incidents suggests thatwe were maby not entirely welcome. Examples:

Trash bag left on the furniture in the room after cleaning
Valet telling me to park my own car
Restaurant telling us they were outnofnfood and then serving the same food to a couple next to us 15 minues later
Management being un caring at best and bleigerant at worst regarding my concerns

I cannot say if it was cultural or just apathy, but my tratment was fairly consistent And not consistant with the ratings and price of this hotel. This along with the lack of promised view (we had a view of an inside business court, not the Ocean) keeps me from recommedning this Hotel. I will seek another location upon future visits.
",1,2012,05,12
35,Not the best,Definitely not a four star hotel but good location,2,2012,05,11
35,Beautiful Hotel,I stayed here in February/March 2011 (I think) and was very impressed with the hotel. The pool on the roof (which is very small) was not open but the jacuzzi was.  The hotel was very quiet due to the time of year but that probably added to it's charm.  Our room was huge and immaculate - not only pristine clean but the decor is amazing. It's pretty expensive but you know what you are paying for when you're there.,5,2012,05,09
35,Go and stay just to see the Buffett breakfast!,"Lovely hotel within 5 minutes walk of Las Ramblas.  Away from the noise but close enough to join in when required. The hotel is of a very good standard and the buffett breakfast is very comprehensive with something for everyone.  If I had one negative it is that the although the hotel is by the harbour side, it is also the drop-off and pick-up point for passengers and freight cargo practically outside the hotel door.  This activity does happen later in the evening but as the boat sails it bids a very noisy goodbye by blowing a series very loud blows up a large funnel that can be quite irritating if you are just nodding off.  On balance though, I would stay here again.  Lovely comfortable bed and very clean room.",5,2012,05,08
35,Convenient and pleasant Waterfront Hotel In Barcelona,"This three star hotel has a great and convenient location on Barcelona's waterfront near the docks which service the cruse ships. Unique for an European city hotel, are the large and attractive rooms and the nice feeling of not being crowed.  The hotel is spacious and airy.  The hotel location is perfect for those embarking on or disembarking from cruises, as well as convenient for taking advantage of the double decker Barcelona tour buses.  However, service was indifferent and the hotel restaurant a big and expensive disappointment.  For the convenience and spaciousness alone, we would stay here in the future.",4,2012,05,06
35,Good Location but theft in room,"We recently stayed in the hotel 18 -22 April. Booked two city suites with breakfast included, First day hotel staff refused to acknowledge about breakfast inclusive package,  even after showing the reservation slip with relevant information it took me three days with the same argumant everyday to include the breakfast in the package. Despite this on the final day in our bill breakfast was charged extra. During our stay once we rushed out in a hurry for having our breakfast, In our abscence 500 euros were stolen from the room. Despite complaints to the Manger on duty, no response came to fore. They refused to share the name of employee who had cleaned the room for us to give police complaint. Overall location of the hotel is good. View in front is marred by Tower. Service poor quality.",1,2012,05,03
35,Nice and expencive hotel but very poor services,"Stayed at the hotel for 5 nights during easter 2012.
The hotel looks nice, with a nice lobbybar (in 2.floor) 
The room is big but a little cold and could be furnished much better.
They advertise with jacuzzi/air massage bath in the bathroom, but the bathtub is so small that it hardly fits 1 person. 
The pool is VERY small, just forget to have a swim and it wasnt heated when we were there. Inside the little gym you find a jacuzzi for 4 persons witch is nice.
I tried to conntact the hotel 2 weeks prior our arrival trough email and phone.
The never confirmed my request until I wrote to cancell our stay. They phoned me the and apologied. I the again told them my request and the said they should see what the could do. They never confirmed my request until it was to late and I had to use 350 Euros to hire help.
They even tried to charge me for the request they never aswered me on.

I promise I will never stay there again, theres to many better hotels in barcelona.",3,2012,05,02
35,a great place unexpectedly cheap,"My 16 year old kid and I stayed for four nights in this hotel. We received a free upgrade in the room to a De luxe room. The view was not astonishing because we could not see the sea but it was pleasant. But everything else was great : location,room service, valet parking, receptionists but mainly the room was very spacious good furnished with a great bathroom.
The only black spot is the breakfast which is too expensive.
I would definitely advise this hotel to everybody",4,2012,04,23
35,Great place to stay in Barcelona,We found this hotel thru a friend and booked online.  The prices were very reasonable and the location was perfect - close enough to everything yet not at all noisy - was able to sleep with the sliding door wide open and never heard a sound beyond the seagulls in the morning.  Jacuzzi tubs and wonderful showers made for a very welcome respite after full days of walking and  touring around the city.  I would go back in a minute.  Very nice staff too.,4,2012,04,18
35,Smart Hotel. Well located,"I used this hotel for a 3 day business meeting. The hotel is smart, the events people were very professional and everything ran smoothly. Nicely located on the waterfront and with easy access to the main areas of Barcelona. I would recommend.",4,2012,04,17
35,Great Hotel \With Very Friendly Staff,"Stayed here for my birthday -it got off to a great start when the hotel sent up a  complimentary bottle of  cava and chocolate cake! This hotel is nicely located in the Marina, a short walk from the Ramblas and shops/restaurants. The Barcelona city tour bus stops outside too - the concierge sold us discounted tickets and reommended a 2 day ticket (which was just a few Euro than a 1 day ticket). Great tip as you can't really do everything in 1 day! Our room had a lovely view of Mont Juic and was clean and spacious. We had oom service one night which was very good and quite reasonably priced. The bathroom had both a shower and a jacuzzi style bath which was really nice after a long day walking around the city. I hae to mention the bed which was about the most comfortable I've ever slept in!

The hotel bistro/bar served great food although the service was a little chaotic but I have to say entertaining. The bar area was staffed by guys in black uniforms all wearing pseudo secret service ear pieces. While it did nothing to improve the service (they were easily distracted by whoever was talking in their ears) it was very funny though and there were all very friendly so we didn't ming too much.

Getting a taxi from the hotel was really easy (the concierge whistled for one which took about 20 seconds to arrive) - we needed one to go to the airport since the company we'd booked for transfers 'Aerocity' were abosolutely hopeless. Avoid at all costs.

As for Barcelona,its an amazing city but you will need comfy shoes and a strong bladder - public loos are few and far between and there seemed to be a queue in most cafes/restaurants. Watch out for pettyy crime around key tourist areas too eg Ramblas and Sagrada Familia where my husband foiled a couple of thieves who were tirying to steal from someones bag. Make time ot go to Park Guell its beautiful and you can see the whole city from the viewing point. The zoo was ok too but I think the animals really need more space. Basically lots to see and do - enjoy!",5,2012,04,14
35,Simply the best view in Barcelona!,"I can only agree with the other recent reviewers.  This was our third stay at the Gran Marina and we still love it!  It not only offers great value for money but our suite (Room 741) must surely have had one of the best views in Barcelona - and the most windows!  The breakfasts were some of the best I have experienced with proper freshly squeezed orange juice (one of my bugbears in other hotels who should know better!) and all served by friendly and efficient staff who always knew when to top up one's coffee!  

But above all, we were hugely impressed by the quick thinking and efficiency of the staff who, when we rang them from the airport to tell them one of our fellow travellers had left his passport in the hotel, put it in a taxi in time for us all to catch our flight!  I can think of few hotels who would have managed that!

There are plenty of hotels to choose from in Barcelona but this one continues to excel.  All the staff were charming.  The room was comfortable and elegant.  It boasts an amazing gym on the roof and the port offers an ever-changing backdrop to the whole package!",5,2012,04,12
35,Lovely stay,"Came here with my husband for a long weekend break, and really enjoyed it didnt want to go home, we had a suite and it was clean, lovley views, watched the cruise ships coming in, the swimming pool is on the roof, very relaxing break, La Ramblas is a must on an evening, full of life and entertainmnet, very nice restaurants, and of course The Hard rock Cafe is a must too, i wouldnt say the hotel is for families, its more for couples on a romantic weekend away.",5,2012,04,11
35,A luxury hotel 5 minutes walk from Las ramblas,"I stayed here for three nights with my wife to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The staff were excellent, very accomodating and friendly. Theroom was very comfortable with great views over the harbour to Montjuic. There is a nice piano bar, with free internet access in one corner and there is a fantastic gym on the 8th floor. I'm a regular traveller and this is one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in.",5,2012,04,02
35,Great staff!Amazing location!,"Been there in october 2011.Good food, nice location just near the sea, perfect service, and you can even get a free upgrade on your room.The only minus i can mention is that the pool is so small, looks more like a big bath)",4,2012,03,30
35,perfect,great hotel...great staff and excellent room. I was in room 748 and loved it. All facilities are modern and room was spacious. Had a room service too and was delicious and delivered as promised within 30 minutes; definitely a hotel I will return in the future.,5,2012,03,29
35,Beautiful view over the harbour,I was a bit unsure when I saw the location of this hotel right on the port near several cruise ships but my mind was put to rest when I checked in. My husband surprised me with a weekend stay here to celebrate my birthday and I simply loved it. Our room was spacious and modern with all the normal comforts you'd expect from a 5* hotel. I particularly liked the large sliding wooden doors that separated the dressing area and bar cabinet from the rest of the bedroom. The view over the harbour from our room was terrific. We overlooked the aquarium and all the restaurants on the dock surrounding it. Great for watching all the boats sailing in and out throughout the day. The service here was top notch. A bottle of champagne brought up along with a slice of cake (including a birthday candle) topped off one of several perfect evenings in Barcelona. We were close (10 minute walk) to Las Ramblas so had a good wander around to lots of places. The breakfast was amazing and had absolutely EVERYTHING you could ever hope for. My difficulty was trying to decide what to have each morning as there was simply no way to getting around to trying everything. I would have loved for it to have been a touch warmer outside (but can't be helped with a Feb birthday) as the room never did get warm enough despite adjusting the temperature regularly but all in all I thought the hotel was fantastic.,4,2012,03,27
35,Good Location - watch out for taxi prices,"The location is unusual in that it feels as if is part of the port and in some ways the hotel, from the front,  looks like a cruise liner.  The rooms are spacious and well equipped, although the chairs were a little jaded. The beds were very comfortable and bathroom was large and well equipped. Spectacular views from roof terrace and bedrooms with city/sea views. The breakfast is now 33 euros, however there are little cafe's within the complex that offer much cheaper options and you can sit outside enjoying the atmosphere. The service is exceptional, especially Jean, the concierge who went out of his way to assist me with travel arrangements.  Even he could not sort out the taxi prices.  The trip from the airport to the hotel cost 13 euros, the return journey was 32.10 euros - nearly 20 euros more!!  I had to take a trip to Monserrat area and the trip from the hotel was 89 eruos and the return journey was 65euros!! I took a taxi to a restaurant as I did not know the area and was charged 10 euros from the hotel.  I walked back and it took me 10 minutes, the journey in the taxi took longer??  Clearly the hotel are not responsble for the taxi fares but hotel guests need to be aware.  I have already noted other comments about this problem.",4,2012,03,26
35,Good location,"The hotel is very close to La Ramblas and the staff are incredibly good. I bought a package of Expedia as a surprise gift for my wife's birthday and she was thrilled with Barcelona and the hotel too. To be honest, I was a little sceptical about this hotel and Barcelona as a whole as I had read different reviews about the hotel and extremely weird reviews about Barcelona suggesting it was intolerant to coloured people. I'm happy to say that all these misconceptions were all put to bed by the hotel's lovely staff and overall customer service in Barcelona. Absolutely loved it!

Coming back to the hotel, just outside the entrance, it has a tour bus stop and I personally think that if you're in a city for a few days, the best way to check all the points of interest are by getting on one of these buses and it was very convenient. As for the room, it was nice, spacious and with a city view. Though, the hotel considers it as a city and sea view, but being a port, the sea view is rather pointless. The rooms were clean and kept to a good standard but the furniture did look a bit jaded. Room service was exceptional whenever we ordered so 5 stars for that.

All in all, the hotel has a great location and going around in a taxi isn't that expensive (comparing prices to London here). I didn't quite get on the metro, so unsure how far the closes metro stop is. Lastly, we took the non-breakfast option for this hotel as spending 50 Euros between us per day wasn't ideal when restaurants are just a short walk away.

I will definitely go back to Barcelona and to this hotel, if I do get an opportunity.",4,2012,03,21
35,Stunning Location,"Great Hotel, Breakfast to die for all you would ever need.
Location for Metro, buses, and downtown was perfect we walked almost to all places from the Hotel. It was my partners birthday and the Hotel upgraded us from a Superior to a Suite. All the staff were incredible could not do enough to make our stay as trouble free as possible. Would go back.",5,2012,03,21
35,Nice hotel but felt it is overpriced,"Definitely a 5 star hotel. However, it didn't feel that my stay there was really different considering the price we paid. I liked the in-room jacuzzi but not very modern technology. The night view from my room was lovely, though. Great location and modern design - feels like a corporate hotel so don't expect to understand the Barcelona cultural feeling in there. Restaurant design was great, spacious and with great lighting however breakfast was disappointing for the class and price of such a hotel",4,2012,03,17
35,Great location,"We have stayed at this hotel twice and enjoyed both visits. It's in a great location, only a few minutes walk from the bustling Ramblas. There's a lovely Marina just next door where there are lots of bars and restaurants. Just as well, as the hotel restaurant is a bit pricey.

If you are staying here prior to a cruise beware the taxi drivers. the cost should be about 6 or 7 Euros but they wind the clock up to about 18 Euros. Do NOT pay, give them what you think, no more than 10 Euros and walk away.

I have complained to the hotel about this, but I don't think they have much control over the drivers.",5,2012,02,28
35,Partially Accessible Room,"We stayed at this hotel a few nights before boarding Holland American's Nieuw Amsterdam to cruise from Spain (off in Venice).  We were NOT sure what to expect as all we could book (and we booked far in advance), was a ""partially"" accessible room.  I have attached photos for you to be the judge but other than it being spacious, the room was difficult for my husband, who is in a wheelchair, to function in as the shower situation was very poor.  The hotel itself is in a terrific location for strolling Las Ramblas and catching a bus or taxi AND it is very modern and clean.  The breakfast (do it!) is expensive but one of the best buffets we have seen.  We fell in love with the coffee (warm cream), and even though our room was difficult to function in with the wheelchair, the hotel itself and Barcelona was really fabulous...flat for wheeling, great location, clean and very helpful and friendly staff who really tried their best to accomodate us.  We really enjoyed our trip to Barcelona even if our ""partially accessible"" room was really not accessible in any way.  We did ask at the front desk if there were fully accessible room but no one's English was good enough to really understand what our needs were.  Even so, the hotel happened to be FULLY booked so moving to a better set up (if there was one) was not an option.",4,2012,02,24
35,"Would stay there again, particularly for business.","Let me start by saying that if you are looking for old-world Spanish charm, this is not the hotel for you.  If you are looking for a clean, modern upscale ""business-class"" hotel, however, this is perfect.  It is a short walk to La Rambla, and the double-decker tourist bus stops direclty in front of the hotel.  It is quiet and water-oriented, and the internet service works great.  Unlike many other hotels around the world, the staff here is young, educated, attentive and friendly.",5,2012,02,23
35,Mixed feelings,"This hotel certainly is very useful for conventions. The AGORA conference room is one of the better I have been in during my many years in business meetings and there are plenty other good mmeting or break out rooms available in the hotel or in the adjacent WTC. Less than 50% of the guests will have stunning views: when they look out of the window they or see the concrete of the WTC or they look at a cruise ship blocking their view too. The hotel is modern and this translates in this case in cold - it has not the ambiance one would expect from a 5 star hotel in romantic Barcelona. My room was quiet because I had no neighbours, but when the bed was made up in the next room at the day I arrived I could feel while laying on my bed that the bed in the other room was pushed against the wall. In other words: walls are ultrathin. The bed was hard and the room was or too cold or too warm but never as desired. Room was cleaned very well, water supply excellent, good minibar. TV stations while ample disappointing because of the choices made, enough in a business setting but beyond expectations for international leisure travellers. Personnel was in general friendly and service oriented but with a strictness one would expect in the army - not here.
Summarizing: good to excellent for a convention. For private trips there are far better options in this touristic area of Barcelona.",3,2012,02,21
35,"WOW - Fantastic Hotel, Fantastic Location!!!!","I booked this trip as a surprise for my girlfriend as it is her Birthday on the same day as Valentines Day and i must say we where NOT dissapointed when we arrived. First impressions where Big Hotel and Beautiful Setting, everybody who worked at the hotel was friendly and had a smile especially this one lovely receptionist who bent over backwards to help us, great service and something in allot of top class hotels seems to go missing these days. When i mentioned it was our first time to Barcelona and that it was my girlfriends birthday they suprised us by upgrading us to a suite which was amazing, bed was massive, jacuzzi shower and jacuzzi bath impressive and the view overlooked the city and marina which was very picturescque. Food and drink as expected from a 5 star hotel is expensive but i would recomend if you are staying over a weekend try the hotel bar on a friday night for one drink as you get large measures when ordering spirits and the piano player and lighting give you such a nice relaxed feeling before heading out on the town. I think the only thing i could fault about the hotel was that the pool was very tiny in comparison to the hotel itself and would probably be a dissapointment to sun worshippers at the height of season, alas we couldnt use it as it was too cold in February. All in all if you are looking for a hotel with a touch of class, great setting and easy access to Las Ramblas, the Marina and pick up point for coach tours around the city you cant go far wrong than with the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel, we would definitely go back and stay again. :)",5,2012,02,21
35,"Beautiful Hotel, Fantastic Location","My husband and I, with our two very young children stayed at this Hotel in Feb 2012. All I can say is that we had a wonderful stay at the hotel. The staff were very friendly, the room was absolutely stunning, overlooking the Marina and the beautiful City. Our room was room 506, located on the 5th floor, private balcony (with breath-taking views), very spacious, beautiful bathroom (all marble),flat tv screens & very comfortable bed. Our kids loved it, as there was enough room for them to run around!
The Hotel is very well situated, only a 7 minute walk to Las Ramblas and close to most attractions.
The Hotel does have a pool, but its very small and only outdoor (closed in winter months), but we knew before booking this place, instead the kids had a lovely time in the indoor Jaquzzi. 
Only downside, (as you get with all 5 star properties), is the breakfast/meals was very expensive and drinks at the bar were quite pricey too.. again not too bothered, as the Ramblas is a very short walk with plenty of coffee shops and restaurants.
We would definately stay here again, we actually wouldnt stay anywhere else.
Overall an excellent stay!",5,2012,02,17
35,"Not bad, not fantastic...","Stayed here during a business trip, and though my expectations weren't really that high, I found myself rather disappointed regardless.  On the upside, they have a nice bar/lounge that is great for casual meetings.  On the downside, they put me in a corner room that was essentially wedge-shaped -- so I had to climb over my hard-as-a-rock bed to get to the window -- and was looking out toward the port where the cruise ships dock, which sounds fine in theory but when the ship's engines come on at 7:30 AM, you hear that deep rumble right throught he wall.  The doormen were always helpful in hailing cabs and the location is nice, within walking distance of quite a few restaurants on the water, but I don't know that I would stay here again if given the choice.",3,2012,02,16
35,Pefrect pre-cruise stay,"This was the perfect place for our pre-cruise stay in Barcelona. Location is great for all the main attractions in Barcelona, transportation to other areas, and to the cruise port. We had two city view suites that adjoined that we got a great deal on from travel zoo. I wouldn't stay here if you are looking for something 'authentic' or 'boutique hotel' like, but if you are looking for a good place to rest your head at night, with a very nice room, very friendly and helpful staff, this is the place to do it.",4,2012,02,10
35,beware,"i booked this fabulous hotel in jan this year via travel republic. three weeks later i was told that  my hotel supplier MED HOTELS, (THOMAS COOK) had changed my hotel . my changed hotel was of the same star ratting but nowhere near the quality or the popularity of my origanal choice and on the other side of town. my booking price in jan was £650. three weeks later the price had risen to £980 THIS WAS WHEN MY BOOKING WAS CHANGED. after a few angry exchanges with travel republic i was told take it or leave it..... I LEFT IT.... i have later found out via forums that this has happend to other people and that this is not the first time that this exact thing has happend. HAS THIS HAPPEND TO YOU ??.. there is nothing wrong with this hotel in fact considering the amount of time and research i put in choosing this hotel, it seems to be the opposite. BUT IS IT BEING USED AS A CARROT IN WHAT I CAN SEE AS SOMETHING OF A SCAM....  PLEASE BEWARE AND GOOD LUCK.....",3,2012,02,05
35,"Businesslike, great room and decent location","Booked through lastminute.com as a long weekend break, this proved good value for money.
A 10 minute walk will take you to Las Ramblas and although it seems a little out on a limb, it proved no problem.
Hotel clean and well appointed, a little sterile but guess it caters for business types mainly.
Room was very nice, huge bed, very well appointed bathroom and view not bad either - just make sure you check before opening curtains that there is not a liner docked outside with passengers enjoying the view!
The tour buses run close to this hotel. There are a few tramps parked on (or under) the benches on the boulevard running to hotel but we had no hassle whatever time of day or night we returned to hotel.
Hardly the pretiest hotel around.
Overall, a good experience and decent base for exploring.",4,2012,01,25
35,big convention hotel,"beautiful rooms and public spaces greet you at this hotel.  the Lobby is nothing to look at, but up the stairs and you have a nice bar and dining area.  i have to say the breakfast buffet is amazing for the variety and quality of the food, but I think thats barcelona in general.  These guys know how to eat.  The hotel is a short walk to Las Ramblas and the marina area.  Contrary to some opinions, our group felt extremely safe at all hours of the day. Don't know if I would stay here on my own dime, as this was a convention but a high quality place.  The roof offers great views of the harbour you can sit and watch the big ships come in and out",4,2012,01,22
35,Ideal luxurious pre cruise accommodation!,"We stayed here for two nights prior to our Disney Mediterranean Cruise.  It is a short  (10 minute) walk from the underground at the bottom of Las Ramblas.  We were greeted at the entrance to hotel by very helpful & polite doormen, infact all staff members were extremely helpful & friendly.  Our room (suite) was breathtaking one of the best we have encountered so far, only slight grumble, but seems to be the same wherever you stay in Barcelona, is the lack of tea/coffee making facilities.  The room was, as with all areas we encountered, spotlessly clean, with a stunning view over the harbour, nice to see our cruise ship as it docked.  In addition, there was a great view of Montjuic, where the Olympic stadium is located (a must see and free) .  Breakfast was excellent, however we never tried the restaurant evening meal so unable to comment.  We dined at one of the many restaurants on the nearby marina, one evening we took advantage of the room service meal which was very good.  A must see was the 360 degree view from the rooftop (day and night), also great pool & sun lounge area.  Ideally placed for Las Ramblas & underground which we used for all other attractions, as we are keen walkers we took advantage of walking a fair amount of the city although there is an ideal bike hire service of which a pick up/drop off point was located outside the hotel.  One tip please watch for pickpockets we were lucky on two separate occasions both on the underground!  Our intention was to walk to the cruise terminal, but as the cruise terminal buses were picking up passengers from the Columbus statue,  5 minutes from the hotel, we paid the few euros fare, and were dropped of at the terminal entrance.  Grand Marina hotel is pricey, but well worth it when you compare the price of the other similar located hotels, we were lucky to find a deal on lastminute.com.  We would definitely stay again!!",5,2012,01,21
35,Paradise for resting!,"Luxurious. Exclusive. Avant-garde. Minimalist. Mediterranean. These are the five senses, the five essences that make up the great tourist landmark in the port of Barcelona. The hotel is full of cutting edge design details and repeatedly houses temporary, avant-garde art exhibitions. A vastly varied offer of gourmet dishes mirroring the finest pleasures of Mediterranean fusion cuisine flow from the Grand Marina kitchens. The buffet breakfast which, for six months of the year can be enjoyed on the orange-tree lined terrace, is an unvoiced secret in the capital of Catalonia.The restaurant completes its offer with an intimate, private dining room for 40 persons: the Aire de Mar (Sea Breeze) Restaurant. We will definetely go back there and would really recommend it!",5,2012,01,21
35,Multi-storey car park lookalike,"Ugly hotel, no sky tv, rubbish restaurant & really small spa, in England this hotel definitely would not gain 5 stars, air conditioning broken, we were not offered another room, very clean tho & polite welcoming staff, would only stay if on special offer",2,2012,01,21
35,The friendliest place in Barcelona.,"I have to say it was a real pleasure to stay at this hotel. The reception staff were some of the friendliest people I have ever met as were the doormen.
Location is absoultely spot on.Just a short stroll to various areas of this great city.
Our room was spotlessly clean and had a terrific view over the harbour.It was wonderful to sit out on the balcony and watch the world go by.
Barcelona itself has some great shops and of course the famous Las Ramblas.
The absolute MUST for us though was a visit to la sagrada familia.Truly stunning and breathtaking stuff.Dont forget to take your camera.
Two additional points I would like to make regarding the hotel.If you have a harbour view depending how well you sleep you may be disturbed by the comings & goings from the port.
Also to echo a previous reviewer the bar prices are crazy.
Great hotel though! Would happily stay again.",5,2012,01,15
35,Great Hotel - Great Service,"Just ended our little Pyrenean adventure by stopping at this wonderful hotel. Huge, impressive, daunting compared to our stay in Andorra, however these hotels must be judged in a different manner and so;

The hotel itself is spotless, its as if they have cleaners running around 24hrs a day, the place itself is on the border of needing a refresh however all the tech is up to date, the rooms were huge and well appointed and the views and location were spot on. 

We didn't use the restaurant so can't comment on that however the staff were all highly efficient and everything was done soon after it was requested, not as social but I guess this comes with the territory of such hotels. The doormen tending the cars were superb and always had the best places to go at any time of day.

Great stay, very relaxing - much recommended ! Won't be the last Eurostars hotel I stay in.",5,2012,01,11
35,Wonderful Stay for First trip to Barcelona!,"We didn't choose this hotel, it was part of our 2 week river cruise on Amadeus Line, but it turned out to be a great place to stay.  We could walk to the wonderful pedestrian area of Las Ramblas,  hotel itself was very comfortable, staff accomadating, breakfasts great, nearby Marina and shopping area good for a first time visitor.  We were pleased to have high-speed internet in our rooms that worked well.  All in all a great experience for first time visitors to Barcelona!",4,2012,01,05
35,Vaguely nice and adequately located,"This is the single least memorable stay I believe I have ever had in a hotel of this caliber. The rooms are clean and spacious, particularly by European standards, and the views of the marina are, as frequently noted in the above reviews, very impressive. The common areas including the hotel bar are pleasant and they boast a staircase designed by I.M. Pei, of whom I am a fan. However, it contains almost zero of the spirit that makes Barcelona special and unique and if I were to return, I would stay somewhere with more vibe and culture.",3,2012,01,03
35,Great Stay,"In fact this was my last choice in Barcelona, as it was quite expensive. but all the other hotels were fully booked because it was a busy period (i was there for el clasico match) 
BUT IT WAS THE BEST 3 NIGHT STAY !!!!
great service, beautiful place, beautiful view of the harbour
the location was good too, near a lot of caffes and restaurants. near a shopping center and an imax cinema too. 

easy access to the barcelona tour, the tour bus stops just in front of the hotel
and a lot of attractions within walking distance :) 

but what striked me the most were the spacious and beautiful rooms.",5,2011,12,31
35,"Good location, great views!","4 point review:
- Located right at the Marina and the views are fantastic. There are plenty of restaurants and eateries just a few minutes away and the famous las ramblas is a 15 minute walk
- The rooms are good, what one would expect from a 5 star - nothing special. The room service variety and taste is quite good 
- The service levels are average.
- Plenty of conference options in the adjoining conference center, hence perfect for corporate events",3,2011,12,27
35,comfortable hotel,"I've stayed at this hotel for the past 3 years whenever I have been to Barcelona for work (once a year) and keep going back. The service is friendly and the rooms are large and spacious with everything one would want. The bathrooms are great too. I was a little disappointed this year however, as I have always been given a very good corporate rate and there was a substantial increase this year, with breakfast no longer included and a downgraded year. I would have thought that their records would show better their repeat clients and previous rates paid. Increase are normal, but it was a very big difference for the exact same period. The location of the hotel is also good - you can walk to the centre in under ten minutes and there are always taxis outside. I would recommend this hotel to business travellers and those vacationing who want to spend a little more. The breakfast is wonderful however the dinner leaves a lot to be desired. Unfortunately, I would say to avoid the evening restaurant (only about six tables in a cosy area next to the bar but the food is bland, a little overprices and takes a while to come.) Overall however, I've always had a comfortable stay in this hotel.",4,2011,12,07
35,"Nice, but Noisy","We stayed at the Eurostars for one night before sailing on the Carnival Magic. We arrived at about 10 am and while they could not get us into our room right away, they did accommodate us by allowing us into our room around 11:30 am, which is better than the standard check-in time.

Our room was spacious as far as European hotels go. It had hardwood floors and a comfortable bed, with a small balcony. My only real gripe about the hotel was the noisiness of doors slamming all hours of the night. When you have flown overnight from the U.S. to Spain (no sleep for 36 hours), slamming doors are a bit of a problem. Other than that, the room was extremely clean and suited our tastes fine.

That evening, my husband had a headache, so we ordered room service instead of going out. We ordered a margherita pizza and a pasta dish with cheese sauce. Both were excellent and well-presented. 

The rooftop pool is quite small, but the views from the roof are quite nice, allowing for some good picture-taking.

Compared to the other hotel we stayed in on this trip, the Eurostars Grand Marina was a dream. While not perfect, it was enjoyable and allowed us to recharge before our cruise.",4,2011,12,01
35,Top Class Hotel,"I stayed here on business for 4 nights in October and it was a very nice hotel. The food was excellent, the staff were attentive, and the location is brilliant being right on the marina and just a 5 minutes walk to ""La Rambla"" the highly popular tourist street with lots of bars/restaurants. 

The rooms were luxury and the walk in wardrobe was great. 

The only negatives for me were: 

1. No in-room iron/board and it took 20 minutes to get one sent to the room. 

2. Drink prices were insane.",5,2011,11,17
35,"Great hotel, good location","Great hotel with great service.  Very modern, clean and within walking distance of the mall and La Rambla.  We had a wonderful view of the old city, and all questions/inquiries were answered promptly and with a smile.  It was very quiet.  We'd stay here again!",5,2011,11,14
35,Great hotel,"We did a late availability holiday for 4 days in Barcellona, hotel was excellent in every way. It was expensive but worth the extra. PS we found the 10 trip tickets great value when Travelling on the metro",5,2011,11,13
35,Luxurios,"The hotel is located close La Rambla, Barcelona's main shopping street. The staff was very helpful with all our inquiries. The room was large, elegant, modern and cozy. We ordered room-service and got fresh roses, candle lights, and the food was tasty. The breakfast had a large variety of different food, and you could eat outside on the terrace if you preferred. We had the same waiter each morning, which remembered us, asked us how we had slept and was very polite. 

This is an excellent hotel, centrally located with great staff. Highly recommended!",5,2011,11,12
35,good hotel,"The location is excellent,  Within close walking distance is a brand  mall and Ramblas. 
staff is co-operative and polite. excellent view of the port. i will definitely go back. You can get discounted tickets for the bus tour of which the Stand is exactly outside the hotel. Beautiful view of the city center from the rooms in the night.",5,2011,11,12
35,Lovely Hotel,"This is a very nice hotel situated down by the Marina. Clean and modern it is a great base to visit Barcelona. Barcelona is a great place to visit for the weekend with a fantastic range of places to visit and see. Lots of good and fairly reasonable restaurants but the best for me was having a simple coffee and soaking up the wonderful atmosphere in the food market that is just stunning,",4,2011,11,10
35,Nice stay in Barcelona,This hotel was a good find. We had a view of the harbour and the old city. It was very convenient to the city and to the Metro. The shoping centre was just across the bridge and the beach a short walk away. Especially liked the terrasse on the roof including the gym and jacuzzi.,5,2011,11,08
35,We were treated really well.,"My wife has to use a wheelchair. When booking in the receptionist said ""I am sure you would appreciate more space"" and upgraded us to a suite. This kind approach persisted throughout our stay. The concierge gave good advice for the hop on - hop off bus which had a stop right outside. Breakfast was excellent and I could not fault any aspect of this fine hotel.",5,2011,11,07
35,The best breakfast !,"Possibly the best breakfast we had in a 5 star hotel around Europe.
Good Location and great view, room was clean and modern.
Would stay again !",5,2011,11,05
35,Great location and staff.,"First, the room was good in size and very clean.  Second, we found an extremely helpful employee at the reception desk every time we stopped there to make an inquiry.  Third, the location is fabulous -- an easy walk to La Boqueria Mercat, Catedral, and the beach (Barceloneta).  

The ONLY fault that I had was with the hotel's handling of our 'do not disturb' signage.  We had stepped out for a few minutes without securing our valuables in the safe and put the 'do not disturb' sign on the door to prevent the staff from entering our room.  Upon returning, we found an employee exiting our room.  He claimed to have entered to leave us a letter reminding us to turn our clocks back that night.  Once back in our room, we left the 'do not disturb' sign up, so we wouldn't be bothered.  Subsequently, someone knocked on our door... AND THEN called our hotel room phone.  I've NEVER been to a hotel that didn't respect their clients' wish to be undisturbed.  VERY unexpected given the level of service that we witnessed everywhere else in the hotel.",4,2011,11,02
35,Trip to Spain,"The room was extremely hot and stuffy.  We were told that maintenance would fix the problem.  We received no relief.  We opened all the windows and lowered the thermostat to 16c, to no avail.  Otherwise, everything was superb.  The Harris', Huntley, IL",3,2011,11,02
35,Four night stay,"We were in Barcelona for four nights at the end of August...2 adults and 2 young kids (3 year old and four month old). After reading reviews here, I booked a superior room. The room was beautiful and huge! We had a king bed, balcony, huge bathroom and dressing area. The room had a very classy feel with wood floors and marble baths. Keep in mind that we paid for a larger room so I""m not sure how the standard rooms are. The hotel was close to pretty much everything. With our two kids, we walked to and from the Ramblas daily. I didn't feel like we were in an unsafe area or anything...we often walked back late at night and were just fine. Just be aware of your surroundings like you would anywhere else. We easily took the train from Ramblas to wherever else we wanted to go. We did end up doing the HoHo bus...mainly for ease of access to get around the city. I think you could skip that unless you are short of time but the nice thing is that it stops right in front of the hotel. The only reason I really gave it four stars rather than five is that the hotel hallways, could use a little updating. The carpet does look dated which takes away from the fact that it is supposed to be a 5 star hotel.  I would recommend the breakfast buffet as well...it was very good and just convenient too. The staff was also very nice and helpful as well.",4,2011,11,01
35,Amazing view on Barcelona,"I was attending a conference at the WTC and I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights. The hotel is located in Port Vell, the old harbour of Barcelona. Ferrys are not a nuisance and you sleep very well as there is no traffic in front of the hotel. Breakfast was very good, employees were nice and very helpful.

But :
- TV screnn and the choice of channels in French was very poor
- We ordered a breakfast in our room and the waiter only left the tray, not the table. 

The hotel is overall quite costly for the services that are provided",3,2011,10,31
35,Great,Nice hotel with great a view over the city from our room. The location is excellent very close to Las Ramblas and to the Metro station Drassanes. The staff was friendly and competent. Overall a very pleasant experience,5,2011,10,31
35,Fantastic hotel,"We loved this hotel, the hotel is situated near the marina. We stayed for 3 nights, 11-14th Oct. When we arrived, our room wasn't ready so we were given an upgrade to a Marina Suite, having already read many reviews on here, I had paid extra for a Double Premier, but we were delighted. The room was beautiful, with a large lounge area, big bedroom and huge bathroom, with a big shower and separate bath. We were only on the 2nd floor, so the view wasn't great, but we could still see the city, and marina.  The hotel breakfast was excellent,  with lots of choice, cereal, fruit ,scrambled eggs etc  and we were able to sit outside each morning, which was nice. The hotel is a short walk from the bottom of Las Ramblas, also the open top tourist bus stops outside the hotel too. We eat at various different places in the evening, (marina, port vell and Las Ramblas)  but did get a taxi back at night, as it seemed a bit quiet and lonely walking back to the hotel. It is probably safe,  but we preferred that option. We did manage to sit around the pool for an hour or so on our last day, the pool is on the roof but quite small, but it is a city hotel. The view is really nice from up there too. We really loved this hotel and would definitely go back and recommend it.",5,2011,10,16
35,Amazing,"Absolutely stunning, our room had a 25 foot wall of glass overlooking the Marina. I have never stayed in such a beautifully styled hotel. Breakfast is the best I gave ever tasted, service superb. Give this hotel a try you will love it. ",5,2011,10,10
35,Perfect,"I stayed at the Gran Marina in August for 5 nights to celebrate our 25 th wedding aniversary.
Cannot fault anything.
Yes drinks and food in the hotel was expensive, but you are right at the bottom of the Rambles with loads of choice - so if you dont want to pay these prices dont.
The reception staff were very helpful - nothing was too much trouble.
We found the hotel very peaceful and relaxing.
Yes you are a little out and it does feel like you are in the middle of an office block- but within a few minutes walk you are on the rambles- I liked the fact that we were slightly away , because it was peaceful.
We wanted a special break and we certanly felt special.
I hope to go back one day.",5,2011,10,08
35,"Good, Glad we upgraded","We stayed at this hotel to end our tour of Spain. I was happy that we chose it; it was a good place. 

I decided to just pay the forty euros to upgrade to a suite. The room was not a suite per se (I think of a suite as a room with a separate sitting room.  This was just a large room.)  It was very nice. We got a double bed. There was a lovely separate dressing room so you don't mess up the room with all the luggage. 

We had room service one night, it was slow and expensive and not very good.  That said, it was fine. 

We had a balcony with a view of Barcelona and a bit of the water . The cruise ships do dock right next to the hotel, and some of the guests are from the cruise crowd, but that wasn't an issue. Though the cruise ship horns did blare in the morning one morning, and that was really annoying. 

The service at this hotel was neither here nor there. It wasn't fantastic, but it wasn't bad either. 
The fitness center is nice but the pool on the roof is TINY.  Like, Fifteen feet square. Be warned. They make it look like it takes up the whole roof, hahahaha. 

The breakfast is quite good. Lots of options.",4,2011,10,07
35,"Great Hotel , few minutes from Las ramblas","Located right on the Pier , a few minutes walk from Las Ramblas. Very esy to get cabs, or the local Tourist Hop-on Hop-off bus service.

Friendly staff, Big rooms and good food in Room service.

Only issue is that most standard rooms are inner-courtyard facing, hence it is recommended to book a higher category of room",4,2011,10,07
35,Not a 5-star hotel. Not the bedding requested; staff slow to fix problem.,"For a 5-star hotel, one would expect immediate resolution of a bedding problem. Instead, the situation wasn't fixed until midnight!! We sent numerous emails in advance, stating we were a family of 4, and needed 2 double beds or 2 queen-sized beds in the room. When we arrived, we had been assigned a room with 2 twin beds. We asked for what we had booked. They claimed to be sold out. We waited. They said they would put 2 rollaway beds in the room to accommodate the 4 of us. We got to the room. They had pushed the twin beds together for my husband and self, and put 1 rollaway bed in the sitting area. They promised to bring another into the room while we were at dinner. When we left for dinner, I let the front-desk attendant know we were leaving, so staff could get the 4th bed in the room. We returned to our room at 11:45 pm, and still no 4th bed! I called the front desk, which said it would send someone up with the promised bed within 5 minutes. The bed came at 11:55 at night. The maid was making up the bed at midnight. The front desk did not apologize. The Grand Marina is not worth the money, time or effort, and is NOT 5-star hotel. Two stars for service, at best!",2,2011,10,03
35,Superb,"We have just returned from three nights at the Grand Marina, our room was nice with a view of the city but the staff were outstanding, nothing was too much trouble and they all spoke excellent english which helped. We would definatly return.",5,2011,09,29
35,"eh, not our style","I think hotels like this have a ""type"" and we are not it. The place is nice and it is clean, but it definitely has a coldness to it you don't find often in Spain. I got the sense they must handle a lot of constipated Americans from Nebraska and Texas who aren't really happy people. They seem to cater to that mentality. 

You could tell at breakfast. Now, the breakfast was good however it was considerably more expensive than similar meals at other hotels. And the people there, the guests, not the staff, were not the friendly traveler types, they appeared to be more like stuck up brats. I dunno. It was just the vibe of the whole place.

Breakfast at another hotel in the city was half the price yet twice as good and the guests all were lively and having fun. 

Also, the location of Eurostars may not be the best. They are placed right between where cruise ships come in and out and you may find your room flooded with the diesel exhaust from the ships. And you will hear them too. 

Not a great stay for us. Not awful, but won't be back.",3,2011,09,28
35,*** WARNING: DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL ***,"These total XXXX charged me 845 euro for a now show when my father unexpectedly died. Zero compassion, Zero sympaphy. The just emailed me back thier terms & conditions & the invoice. Please show solidarity and stay somewhere else.",1,2011,09,28
35,Great stay in Barcelona,"We stayed with our baby and 4 year old.  They gave us a free upgrade to a bigger room to accommodate us better, which was appreciated.  The room facilities were good and we enjoyed the jets in the bath.  The breakfast was sumptuous and a great way to begin each day.  The staff were helpful and friendly.  The only downside is that if you are using public transport, it is not close to the Metro.  However, for the hop on, hop off tourist buses, it is in the perfect location, as they stop almost outside the main entrance.  Also taxis are plentiful and not too expensive.  All in all, it was a great stay and I would recommend the hotel.",5,2011,09,25
35,Not the same than in 2007,"We planned to stay over a week end in Barcelona with our 4 months old baby and we decided to come back to this hotel, having had a good experience from new year's eve 2007-08.
All is the same except one point: the Aire del mare restaurant, still promoted in the hotel's webiste, doesn't exist any more for more than a year....As we didn't want to go out and let our baby alone in the room, we had to spend Saturday nigh in the ""bistrot"" area which consists of 4 tables only, fully booked....Therefore no other way than having food at the bar area. The food was less than average and not at the level of a 5 stars hotel. If we would have know that, and for the reason of our baby, we'd rather had booked the Miramar hotel nearby.",3,2011,09,25
35,Excellent location,"We stayed here mid September for a short weekend. The location of the hotel was perfect - minutes walk from the start of La Rambla with tourist buses stopping just a few metres away from the hotel.  With no traffic noise in the immediate vicinity it made for a relatively peaceful stay.  

As we wanted a separate shower, we booked a City Suite.  It was excellent, with a separate basic dining area with a balcony (no furniture on the balcony) and view overlooking the city on the sixth floor, bedroom area and a separate bathroom area with two sinks, a huge bath and a separate toilet and shower. The ceiling shower head broke whilst in use, but still operated in addition to the body and hand held spray.  The hotel has a pillow menu with various options named after iconic old film stars.  The pillows provided (think they were Rita Hayworths!) were not to our liking, so we ordered Marilyn Monroes from Housekeeping who were very friendly and efficient.  Same cannot be said of Room Service - we discovered that they had delivered our meal to the wrong room.  They did prepare a replacement order, but the food was, at best, mediocre.  Who ate the previous meal I wonder!  The breakfast buffet in the first floor restaurant was good, with a wide selection of all the usual hotel buffet fare.  No special order stations. 

As our flight was a late departure, we paid for an extra late check out.  Prices were structured by each extra two hour period, so no negotiation and flexibility.

Lots of guests use this hotel for cruise transfers and I can understand this because of it's location, but think it is equally as good as a base for a city weekend break.",4,2011,09,24
35,Luxury in the heart of Barcelona,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Grand Marina in September 2011 - and we loved it! We stayed in a superior room, and eventhough it was the smallest roomtype the hotel had to offer, it was large and comfortable. In the beginning we thought it was a bit of a shame that we did not have a balcony (which many of the rooms had), however instead we had a GREAT view of the harbour, the city and Mont Juïc! What a view to wake up to in the morning! The breakfast was not included in the rate, however it was only 20 Euros when booking in advance. The buffet was wonderful and had a great variety of specialities. I can highly reccomend to enjoy the breakfast outside in the courtyard among the orangetrees - wonderful! Internet was free of charge, you merely had to ask the staff for a password. Staff was friendly, efficient and helpful at all times. The pool on the rooftop was nice, and it was also very nice with a bar next to the pool. Cocktails were quite expensive but very nice, and the view from the pool was faboulous. Closest metro station was 15 minutes walk away at the bottom of the Rambla! The lobby/bar/restaurant-area is a bit cold and ""unwelcoming"", no flowers only cheap decorations. However this is the only thing bad I have to say about the hotel, and that is merely my personal taste. We would deffinately reccomend this hotel to everyone!",5,2011,09,18
35,"The location is actually not too bad, the roof is a gem.","The noise of the ferries can be a problem for some but if you close the doors to balcony it will no disturb your sleep. 
Cab station and that the tourist buses stops just outside is of great value. The stroll back home from restaurants from Barcelonetta or old town is nice along side the port. The last 100 meters strangly enough contains some poor guys sleeping in the free.",4,2011,09,17
35,We liked it and would go back again.,"We also stayed at the Marina before we went on a cruise.  Very convenient location and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  We arrived at 8 AM.  Jean immediately took our bags and told us to see how early our room could be ready.  He then explained the area to us.  We walked close by the hotel, which is very close to the La Rambla and the mall area.  We had breakfast and at 11 AM, we returned to the hotel, and our room was ready.  I was not familiar with the tipping customs in Spain, and when I attempted to tip Jean for bringing our bags up, he told me that my friend had already tipped him when he took our bags from us earlier.  I have never heard that in the US before (:)), so I went ahead and gave him the additional tip.  He helped us throughout our stay, and I have no doubt that he would have no matter if we had tipped him or not.  Everyone at the hotel was friendly.  The bartender (Fermier?) and Natalia at the front desk was memorable.  Oh, but don't expect air conditioner in the common areas, as it is not widely utilized, as with the rest of Spain.  This was a surprise to us, esp in the 90 degree heat, but it saves our Earth, right.  Also, yes, take the hop-on-hop-off bus to save money.  It really is the best deal for seeing the area, and very convenient.",5,2011,09,16
35,Great Location to Cruise Terminals,"We stayed there before going on a Carnival Cruise.  Rooms were beautiful and the view was spectacular.  We had 4 in our party and they accommodated our rooms nearby.  Also, they shuttled us to the cruise terminal in a mini bus, for a fee, but was so worth it due to all taxis are smaller cars in town.  We walked all over town from hotel.  Even walked to Sagrada Cathedral.  It was a long walk, but doable. We felt very safe walking to and from hotel even late at night.  Definitely would stay there again.",5,2011,09,13
35,Great if you are taking a cruise.,"We recently took a cruise leaving from Barcelona and found the hotel to be a great location for that.  It was also not bad for touring the Old town, only a few minutes walk to the beginning of La Rambla, it was quite a hike to get from the hotel to Sagrada Familia on foot though.  The hop-on-hop-off buses pick up right outside the hotel though, so if walking isn't your thing it is great.  The hotel itself is nothing overly special, but it was clean, quiet, and had a great large bathroom.  The room itself was a bit dated, but large and had everything we needed.  It was the perfect choice for our purpose, we could see our ship when we woke up, and it was a short cab trip over to it, we would have actually even walked to the ship, but could use the bridge we had to cross on foot.  We would stay there again if we were there under the same circumstances.",4,2011,09,12
35,One of the best 5 stars we stayed at – we will be back next time in Barcelona,"We had a reservation for a Premium room!
The room NO the 2 rooms was pure magic
a large living room and a bedroom, 42m2, 
The bathroom had bathtub and a separate 
shower and was so nice.

Our bathroom had al bathroom products you 
ever can require including bathrobe

We had a lovely view towards the City and 
La Rambla. Cruise ships docked along side 
the hotel (also ferry’s).
You hear ships if you leav the balcony door 
open. But when we closed the door we could 
not hear anything.

The Reception staffs was kind and efficient as 
you can expect in a 5 star hotel, but with a smile

I had a problem with the FREE WiFi on my Mac book 
Air, the IT service company did not give up, and after 
5-10 min they solved the issue and I could use my 
Laptop on Wi-Fi. the iPhone 4 was working fine on 
the hotel Wi-Fi al the time!

The buffet breakfast is not cheap, but worth every 
Euro. It include nice cold Cava to start or to end or 
to... if you like that, I do. The buffet breakfast is 
exclusive and you can of course order whatever 
egg etc you like it’s al included, the cappuccino 
was like a kiss 
a Rioja was perfect to the impressive cheese 
plates and Serrano Ham to the end. 
Do not rush this breakfast, spend some time and 
enjoy it as a brunch.

The interior of the hotel can be felt as cold, but staff 
is warm and kind

We had not time to try the resturant, we dined outside 
the hotel.

We stayed prior to a cruise; you can take a taxi outside 
the hotel to the cruise port 
or Barcelona cruise port shuttle 2-300 m from the hotel 
for 2euro

This nice hotel was a perfect start on a fun and 
fantastic 12 days vacation.",5,2011,09,12
35,Good location,"Spent 5 nights. Reception staff not very helpful. Had asked for a room with a balcony view on city side or marina view. When we got to room its was looking onto courtyard with office block. Could not get room changed until next day due to ""no availability"" even though we had specifically requested a city/marina view when booking by internet 2 weeks previously.
Do not have breakfast in hotel as is quite expensive. Much cheaper restaurants a short walk away. If you like a ""fry"" in the morning you will find sausages and rashers not very tasty. Also coffee and tea is at best tepid. The rest of the buffet is quite good.
However, location is spot on - a short walk to La Rambla, Maramagnum Shopping Centre (which has some nice restaurants and shops) and bus stop outside for tourist tour bus.",3,2011,09,12
35,Good location to Cruise Terminal,"Stayed for 2 nights prior to getting on a Holland America cruise. The hotel is located at the cruise terminal, which is also walking distance to Las Rambles. Our room was very large for European standards. Nice firm bed and great pillows. We decided to include the breakfast buffet even though pricey based on reviews. We were not dissapointed and feel it is one of the nicest we've ever had. The bellhops, front desk staff and dining staff were all very professional and attentive. We arrived very early in the morning, and although it was too early to access our room, we were able to leave our luggage so we could go out and tour around. As mentioned by others, many of the rooms face to the inner coiurtyard so you do not have a city or water view. Lovely deck with good lighting. WIFI was included and worked great.",4,2011,09,11
35,"Great hotel, but only if you get a great deal","You should know upfront that Eurostars Grand Marina is primarily for business travelers, and the prices for the rooms and restaurant reflect it.  The rooms are large and nicely appointed, with robes and slippers for your use, and nice toiletries.  The decor is definitely business impersonal--if you are looking for unique, you are looking in the wrong place.  Other reviews have complained about the firmness of the beds; they were firm, but I found they were still comfortable.  The service and staff are average, almost blase--everyone is polite but no one is going out of their way to make you feel special.  Which they should, if you are paying the rates advertised on their website.  When we first looked into staying there, a ""family suite"" was over one thousand US dollars per night.  We ended up finding a good deal on expedia or hotels.com and ended up booking two rooms at 200.00 US dollars per night.  

The pros of this place: 
Large rooms, nice bathrooms, nice amenities in the room, and most importantly, it's very well located, just south of Las Ramblas.  It's a short, pleasant walk to the metro, which is the cleanest and most efficient subway I have ever ridden.  The gym is small but serviceable, and they have a rooftop pool, which is nice.  The picture on the website makes it look much larger than it is, so don't expect to do laps.  

The cons: 
I think the price is the biggest issue standing in the way of a good recommendation here.  The hotel provides breakfast at 24 Euros per adult, and 12 Euros per child.  A family of four eats cheaper and better, by walking 15 minutes up to La Boqueria and finding that nice bar in the back where you can get juice and tortilla espanola for 6 Euros.  Some have complained about the noise, which can be avoided if you get a view of the ""ocean"" (which is actually a view of the building just south of the hotel).  We had a room directly next to the ferry, but weren't bothered by the noise.  

In sum, if you get a decent rate, it's worth booking, but if you are going to pay the rates on their website, there are other, better places to stay in Barcelona.",3,2011,09,01
35,Nothing can beat its location!,"We spent a wonderful time in this perfectly located hotel. We reserved a superior room but fortunately we have been upgraded. They gave us a beautiful room at last floor with a breathtaking view of Barcelona revealed in all its splendour from above and the magnificent Port Vell with its huge cruise boats, just incredible!
Some minuses: the pool is opened only after 11 and is just too small
		 One has to announce the reception before using the sauna
		 The idea of a room resembling with a ship bridge is lovely but they should have took care better of the wooden floor and some of the furniture did not look like should do in a five star GL hotel
		 The wi-fi Internet is free but the signal is rather poor
Of course nothing special. 
The staff is OK, the breakfast is perfect and the service staff in the restaurant area exceed any expectation. There is a business center in the first floor, two restaurants and a bar, and not to mention the biggest bathroom I had until now from all the hotels where I stayed
With some minor issues, the hotel is a true five stars. But not all this recommend it as a perfect destination when in Barcelona. The clue is its unique place which Barcelona World Trade Center occupies. In the beautiful port of Barcelona, up to five minutes walking from La Rambla, Reial Drassanes ( Museu Maritim), The underground station Drassanes, IMAX, Aquarium, the beach, Las Golondrinas …everything.
The rest of Barcelona hotels even though they could be situated on La Rambla lack the space, the view, the silence. Of course sometimes, the boats entering and leaving the port could be noisy but it is a lovely noise and the acoustic insulation provided by the windows is good.
Staying at this hotel you have style, service, proximity to tourist attractions and the most lovely place to admire sun rising from the sea, the magnificent city of Barcelona with its thousands of colors in different time of the day. 
The teleferic to Montjuic has a pole just in the front of the hotel so one can see the hotel from anywhere in Barcelona, it’s just nice.
I can not think of anything better than starting the day admiring the sun and the sea on the immense rooftop terrace of this hotel.
The only resembling location it’s W of Barcelona which is more close to the sea but the city view and the Port Vell you can have it only from Grand Marina.
I can only say if you can afford it,  will be one of the best stays of your life.",5,2011,08,30
35,Good choice but not 5 star,This hotel is in a great location 5 minutes walk to Las Ramblas on the waterfront and has spacious rooms.Our room was a Premier Room with a balcony overlooking Barcelona. Very spacious but badly planned with a seperate living room containing only a table and 2 chairs and the minibar opening onto the balcony.The bedroom is in the middle of the room (quite dark) with a sliding partition separating the living area. The area is quiet and traffic free but don't expect ocean views as many rooms overlook a courtyard or towards the skyline of Barcelona and the ferries. The Tourist Hop On/Off bus leaves from in front of the hotel and a taxi to the airport cost 25 euro and took no more than 15 minutes. This hotel 5 years ago was a 5 star gl property however the upkeep of the rooms and general ambience is not 5 star now more like a 4 star. The walls in the room are quite thin and frequently noise can be heard from adjacent rooms.The rooms could do with a lick of paint as walls are badly marked and scuffed. Tv's are old style and not flat screen. Turn down service is by request - I feel it should be automatic in a 5 star gl property. Breakfast is a good option with variety and quality. The waiters are excellent at clearing plates and refilling cups of coffee and keeping the buffet well stocked. Generally the staff are helpful and early check in was no problem. Check out after 1300 hrs did require an additional payment though. The swimming pool is on the roof and very small - more of a plunge pool. There is a bar serving drinks and snacks and sunbeds but they are in short supply at peak times.(August).The gym is well equipped with water and fresh fruit provided complimentary.,4,2011,08,30
35,Fantastic stay in Barcelona,"We are frequent visitors to BCN and this has now become our top hotel choice there. Location is great, 5 mins walk from Drassanes metro station at La Rambla. The view from our 5th floor room with balcony was fantastic, overlooking the Port Vell, Montjuic, Colon, Sagrada Familia, and the city in general. Noise from the ferries and cruisers, mentioned by some people, was not a problem at all since it ended before midnight. We even found the setting romantic, with the boats coming and departing :) Room was very spacious and comfortable. We would prefer a queen or king bed rather than twins but they were ok. Air conditioning was perfect, almost silent and quite smooth. Staff was kind. We asked for a late check out and we left at 13:30 without any problem. Perfect stay overall!",5,2011,08,29
35,Great room but not a five star hotel.,"Nice and stylish hotel with decent location. The service wasn't great. Rather noisy at night, located close to two ferries that ran their motors all night.",4,2011,08,27
35,Great base,"Lovely hotel, great location for walking around Las Ramblas. Good public transport nearby too.
Breakfast fairly expensive but plenty of choice.
Free wifi but patchy reception.
Be sure to specify non smoking room, we were allocated a smoking room but when we pointed out we had asked for nonsmoking we were given the only nonsmoking room available......a huge suite! Unfortunately there was only one bed and as we were a mother and son we needed 2beds so despite being offered the suite for our whole stay we gave it up so my 6ft3in son didn't have to sleep on a couch.
Overall very nice place to stay.",4,2011,08,27
35,Decent place to stay for a night,"We stayed overnight before a cruise at the Grand Marina. Although we were promised early check-in, our room was not available until 2 pm, which is a long time to wait for a shower after an overnight flight! The hotel is in a good location, blocks away from La Rambla and the Columbus statue. The tour bus picks up right outside. The room was decent, clean and good quality although the beds were hard as a rock. The bathroom was very nice; oversized for a European hotel. Be forewarned - the walls are very thin and we could hear our neighbors very well! Breakfast was included for us with a nice spread and excellent coffee. It was a little pricy overall, although the staff was very nice.",3,2011,08,25
35,More 4 star that 5,"First impressions of this hotel were great, although on closer inspection a few things weren't quite up to scratch. This was our first stay in a five star hotel and we were expecting real luxury but unfortunately a few things let it down. We had a broken tile in the bathroom, walls were scuffed, toilet paper was very thin (these things matter !) and towels had seen better days. Our biggest gripe of all though was the lack of sunbeds on the roof top terrace, over 350 rooms in the hotel and at the very most there was 15 sunbeds. In our week long stay we managed to get sunbeds only once.
I really want to stress that we thought this hotel was of a very high standard and had some really good points like, staff friendly, cleaning spotless, shower powerful and great location.
Usually if I read a review like this I'd thing fussy people what do they expect, but that's when we are staying in 2 or 3 star accomodation and getting what we paid for. So on this occassion i think it definately was more 4 star and definately not 5.
So if you're looking for a great base to explore the city of Barcelona I'd say it's a must but only if you've got yourself abit of a bargain when booking. But if your hoping for 5 star luxury maybe try somewhere else.",4,2011,08,19
35,View of the city was Splendiforous,"The Grand Marina was an excellent choice for a trip to Barcelona. Not cheap but we recognize the benefits of paying for quality. The view from our 'Premier' room was the best view that  I have ever enjoyed in a hotel room. It was one of the rooms that faces the city and Mont Juic with harbour on either side. 
Looked forward to the ""baroom"" call of the big ships, but it was surprisingly quiet.  Only sounded one or two times during our 7 day stay and there are ships coming and going all the time.
The location is excellent and the hotel is nestled in the larger business complex which is one of many buildings that make up the large Port Vell harbour. I would have liked to also have tried out the Pullman Hotel which is right on the beach  although as its in Port Olympique Grand Marina enjoys the superior location as its so close to LaRambla.   While up late one night with the large floor to ceiling doors open I was serenaded by the strangely eerie yet beautiful sound of skateboarders practising whatever it is that skateboarders practice in the avenue. They put me to sleep. 
 Next time I might try and stay on the 8th floor as the gym facilities, pool, hot tub, lounge area are there as well as a more complete view of the city/harbour - no elevators to have to contend with. The entire city and citizens and facilities were, to my way of thinking urbane, chic, welcoming and professional. This is a facility that is housed in a World Trade Centre and it met the expectation that travellers/business executives would expect from such an  establishment. Our room was one of many that faced the long avenue that guests look at as they come up the avenue to reach the hotel. I cant say enough about the view. Ok the bed took some getting used to, but free wifi, a tour bus right outside the hotel, taxis too make it seem inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. Watch taxis dont charge an extra addon except when taking you to or from the airport and you have to pay for each bag. Also when making purchases you should be asked (if the merchant uses it) if you want the price to be on euros or converted when using your credit card. Its another way for the credit card companies to make more money. No language difficulties as Barcelona is very good at making you feel comfortable and at ease. I would recommend this hotel.The view of the city from the balcony and harbour on either side is stunning. The service was great. The hotel wonderful.",5,2011,08,19
35,Great harbourside location,"We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in total having searched out good deals on the internet on a B & B basis. In our opinion it is worthy of 5 stars for both its location and its buffet style breakfast but only 4 stars in other aspects. 

We thought the pool area on the roof terrace was too small and there was no staff there to pamper you which you should get in a 5 star deluxe rated hotel (apart from one person serving behind a bar and the occassional member of staff re-stocking the shelves where the fresh towels for the sun loungers were kept.) 

The corridors to the rooms were  very dark due to being poorly lit and having dark wood cladding on the walls which presumably was to replicate being on a cruise liner from bygone days. It just didn't fit in with the rest of the hotel which was alot more contemporary and classy. 

We spent 2 nights at the Arts Hotel during our stay in Barcelona due to the price being cheaper for Friday and Saturday than the Grand Marina. We tried on several occassions to negotiate a better rate with reception and via email to the hotel but to no avail so we moved out for 2 nights (see separate review of the Arts Hotel which we fell in love with).

So long as you do your homework on the internet you can find great deals for the Grand Marina just make sure you get the ones with breakfast otherwise breakfast will be very expensive if you add it later.",4,2011,08,19
35,Convenient to cruise port,Hotel was clean and rooms were great.  Especially bathrooms.  I booked for a water view but got a view of the courtyard.  Hotel was fine but got a good deal at around $200 night which was all that it was worth for the location was a walk to get to plaza catalunya which is the main center when getting to everything.  If you can get this hotel pre cruise it is great for a relaxing night before cruise but I would suggest getting a hotel in the las ramblas area if you really want to get a good feel for Barcelona. We stayed at Hotel Regina which was very good for the price with a breakfast included.  Bathrooms were not great but decent and clean.  If you get a street view you can see action without all of the noise of being directly on las ramblas.  This hotel is only 1 block from Las Ramblas and Plaza Catalunya.  Location is everything.,4,2011,08,15
35,Nice hotel,"Location was very good, 5 minutes from the metro station in la rambla, there is also a bus turistic stop right in front of the hotel so we did not have to wait long for a ticket as in more crowded areas. The room was clean, had a shower and a jaccuzzi, comforatable beds and a large window looking to the city.

The hotel staff was very helpful, (especially a man from bulgaria in the reception), and they also spoke english which is very rare in barcelona. Only negative were the cleaning ladies in the corridors making noise and talking loud to each other, but that only happened 2-3 times during our stay.

If there was no noise from the ships in the port the location would have been perfect.",4,2011,08,13
35,wonderful stay,"Stayed in the hotel prior to a cruise. The room was fab! Beautiful bathroom with jacuzzi. Separate massage shower. Large room, top for our family of three.
Little pool and bar on the ceiling. The breakfast was very good.
The location of the hotel is perfect for La Rambla and cruises.
A bit expensive, but worth it!",4,2011,08,10
35,Nice and comfortable but not 5 star,"It was a nice-looking room and bathroom. I got a discounted price through Priceline which I thought was fair, but would have not wanted to pay more. The bed was firm, but I did not mind that. The carpet in the hallway was stained and the tiny pool on the roof was empty and out of order. The lobby and check in was fairly disorganized, and because they did not understand I had already paid in advance through the website, they charged me twice. Luckily, I questioned it and had the overcharge refunded just before leaving.",4,2011,08,08
35,Good Hotel   would recomend it,"This Hotel is in a good location close to the Ramblas,but very quiet,good room,large very comfortable bed, well presented bathroom,toiletries replaced every day.Tour bus and taxis right outside.Staff friendly and helpfull.
The only negative thing I will say is that the breakfast although plentyful is a bit expensive.
We would definatly stay here again.
This hotel would also suit people going on a cruise as it is very close to the port.",5,2011,08,08
35,Fabulous hotel,"In a few words, I liked everything: the location, the staff, the restaurant, the views...",5,2011,08,07
35,In the harbour in Barcekona,"This 5 star hotel is on a big pier in tha harbour of Barcekona - very close to the Rambla - and a very ideal location for exploring the city - and the harbour area - and the beaches going from center to the north. There ia a very big traffic of cruise- and other vessels very close to the hotel. Interesting to view - but also a bit disturbing now and then (late evenings). You must have the rooms facing to the city!! A roof-top terrace with a little pool is also very nice - but it can become overcrowded rather easily.
Breakfast is excellent.
Friendlyness of staff at reception is not especially personal...",4,2011,08,07
35,Nice Hotel with Soft Music Anywhere,"Large and clean place for relaxation away  from noise and traffic. You hear soft music in the hotel corridors,reception room and the lift.",5,2011,08,04
35,"Great hotel, great location...consider it 4 star hotel though...","I would consider this hotel to be more like a high-end 4 star (maybe 4.5) than a true 5-star hotel.  It's a beautiful new property --- very close to 5 star standard.  (Though, they need to replace some carpets in the hallways.)  The roof top pool was nice and the gym facilities were great.  There's a really nice bar too.

The staff were very friendly and helpful, but lacked a little ""polish"" that you would see at a Ritz Carlton / Four Seasons.  But if you think of this place as a 4 star (because you should be getting much better rates at this hotel) then you will be delighted with the service.

Three things they should address: 1) pillows in the bedrooms, 2) cleaning ladies volume in the morning, 3) spotty wifi.

They  only have two pillows in the rooms.  We asked for (and received) two more on our first night.  But these were in pretty poor condition.  A 5-star (or even 4-star for that matter) should have extra, good pillows in the closets.

The cleaning ladies were very loud in the mornings, shouting back and forth to each other in the hallway.  It wasn't any ungodly hour, thankfully about 9.30am each day.  But it was every day for the four days we stayed!  For the price we got for the hotel, if that is my biggest ""complaint"" than I'm a happy camper. 

The hotel offers free wifi, which is great, but the reception is very spotty.  It seemed to drop-in and out frequently.  We didn't need to use it much and were glad to have access, but if I needed more reliable wifi, it would have been a chafe.  There are hardwired laptops in the business centre next to the bar, which were great for quickly checking email, etc.

At check-in, I was concerned the location wouldn't be great.  But realized how great it was after exploring Barcelona on the first day.  It's five-ten minute walk to La Rambla and another 5-10 minutes to Port Vell and 10 minutes more you are in Olympico/Barceloneta area.  There was a lot of cruise boat activitiy, which was nice to watch from the rooftop pool or out the room windows.

I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2011,08,02
35,Definitely worth considering,"A great location.  It's only a short walk to the main sights and the beach is within walking distance too.  If you get a room with a view of the city, you will not be disappointed and can watch the ferries and cruise liners come and go.  Not quite sure how they made the roof-top pool look so big on the hotel website, so if that is important to you, then you will be disappointed. The room was a treat ... we've never had a ""pillow menu"" before!  The current exchange rate made the minibar prohibitively expensive and the breakfast was pricey too, but would definitely consider staying there again.",4,2011,07,31
35,Lets just say the hotel tried to cook me in my room.,"Had a superior room here, although there was nothing superior about it. Was at the hotel for 3 nights on business.  Chose to stay at this hotel as it seemed the ideal place to try and get some sight seeing done too. 
The first day there after a lengthy check in went to the room. It was blaring out heat. I know its winter months, but you couldn't even turn the air con on, or turn the temperature down. 

After complaining about the heat for 24 hours, we finally get moved into one of the top suites of the hotel. These are by far nicer, and the airconditiong/heating system works correctly.",3,2011,07,30
35,Enjoyable stay...,"Overall, my stay at this hotel was very enjoyable. This review, however, is designed to be critical enough to be useful to those considering this hotel amongst other 5* hotels of a similar price :-) 

The service was exceptional and the hotel and facilities immaculate exceptional the carpets on the floors leading to the rooms which looked a little grubby (for a 5* anyhow). The food and drink is expensive but only to the extent to which you'd expect at a hotel.

The pool area is very clean, but perhaps a little bland. The main downside here is that sometimes you can smell the fuel from the nearby cruiseliners, which can be a little unpleasant, though there's nothing they can do about that!

Hotel restaurant area is lovely but again perhaps a little soulless for dinner.

Rooms are beautiful and the beds are incredibly comfortable! Could do with a coffee machine though, especially after a night out in Barcelona's many bars ;-)

Overall I would definitely stay again, as faults are petty by comparison to what's great about it. Oh and the location is great for tourists! ",4,2011,07,29
35,Exceptional location,"This hotel is located right in the harbour in Barcelona. The staff were outstanding and on my first visit I said at check in that I would be back later in the week with my wife and the receptionist said that would try to find me a better room (not that there was anything wrong with the one I had) and he did. Rooms large and well-equipped. Excellent breakfast, but 24 euros a bit expensive.",5,2011,07,29
35,Beautifull Hotel but...,"Having stayed and worked in many Hotels before, my expectations were really high for the Gran Marina after looking at all the pictures. The view is definitely stunning and the rooms beautifully decorated and very comfortable. Food was okay but really pricey (we had room service food). The best was by far the Breakfast! OMG that was brilliant! I would totally return just for the breakfast although my personal taste falls on more intimate,  personal Hotels.",5,2011,07,19
35,Excellent Hotel..,"This hotel is an excellent choice if you are about to embark on a cruise from Barcelona. Small yachts/ships dock adjacent to the hotel entrance and the larger ships are 3-5 mins drive away in a cab.  Walking from hotel to Las Ramblas for food/shopping is no more than 5 mins and the hop on/off sightseeing tour bus stops at the door.  Rooms and bathrooms are beautifully presented and most evenings there is a pianist playing in the bar.  Food/drinks are normal European hotel prices, but of a higher standard than others. Breakfast is superb, with a huge selection and in fine weather, breakfast can be enjoyed in the outdoors",5,2011,07,17
35,The Best location in Barcelona,"The Hotel is located to the Rambla and to all main bus, metro stops, you are 5 minutes away from everything.
Staff is great and helpful, we did not eat there since there are crazy amount of places around.
The hotel is clean and no noise can be heard, however they do not offer complementary bottled water , only 2 pillows , they are 5 stars hotel and should spoil the guests
I will return to this Hotel and only this one",5,2011,07,10
35,Modern Euro Hotel,"We stayed at the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel as part of our honeymoon. We would have loved a city view room, but were not able to get one. Nonetheless, the hotel is beautiful on the inside, and very modern. We loved the amenities in the bathroom as well as the convenient location to shops, restaurants. The restaurant in the hotel was quite pricey but would you expect anything else from a supposed 5 star hotel? Nice gym, jacuzzi area. Overall, the staff was friendly enough and the location was great.",4,2011,07,06
35,Beautiful Hotel and Great Location,"My husband and I visited this hotel during a Riverboat Cruise from Barcelona to Paris and loved the location.  It's located right on the harbour where cruise ships come in and out.  On top of the hotel there's a pool and huge balcony - great view of the Mediterranean and the city.  The hotel is about a 10 minute walk  from the amazing, Las Ramblas.  The only downfall is the cost of beverages (extremely expensive)!!  One afternoon, we decided to go down to the lobby and have a cappocino (bad mistake).  It cost us.........are you ready for this...........16.00 Euros.  We should've gone to a cafe in downtown Barcelona.  Oh well - live and learn.",4,2011,06,17
35,amazing service,"the hotel location is nice, nice rooms, the greatest staff especially the room service staff that dani guy is unbelivable, he's always on time, SOO friendly , makes the food taste better,and the city more enjoyable by sending you the greatest spots in barcelona 
dont miss the burger",4,2011,06,16
35,Loved it and enjoyed the stay...,"Hotel Eurostars Grand Marina (Barcelona) is a 5 star hotel located at the harbour. 
Elegant, modern, stylish hotel. Great view over the harbor and to the city.
In walking distance of countless tourist attractions, cultural sites and shopping opportunities in the center of Barcelona.",4,2011,06,06
35,Good facility with an attitude problem,"The hotel was almost great, good facility and views, and the services looked working. But after getting ripped shirt from laundry with nobody really caring about that, made me look the place with a new view. Processes work so to say, but there is a missing link to a 5-star hotel level of service and dedication. Nice breakfast etc. The pool was good, however really tiny. Internet was really a mess.",3,2011,06,05
35,A great bank holiday weekend,"The biggest plus points of this hotel are the location and the staff. The staff were always friendly and couldn't do enough to help you. The location was amazing for a long weekend away as it was 5 minutes walk to la rambla and the gothic quarter, and right on the port front. 5 minutes walk away theres a metro stop at the bottom of la rambla which we used several times to visit the magic fountain, sagrada familia and camp nou. Also, theres a taxi rank right outside the hotel for getting to the airport (30 euros each way). 
  Only two things to note, if you book a superior room this is actually the standard room. The room inside was amazing but the beds are rock hard and none of these rooms have a sea view, they face inwards to the world trade centre courtyard. Secondly, the drinks at the hotel are expensive, 6 euro 50 for a small beer in the minibar, 8 euros for a small beer at the bar. None of these things spoilt our weekend away as we like to go out for meals in the evenings anyway.
  We used the pool which was small but nice, as well as the sunbathing area. We also used the cable cars above the hotel which take you to the beach. Overall this was an amazing weekend and the atmosphere in barcelona was amazing (champions league final winners). The open top bus tour with the players on literally started infront of the hotel which my boyfriend was very impressed with. I wouldnt hesitate to stay at this hotel or barcelona again.",4,2011,06,02
35,services,"the grand marina hotel is very good hotel specially the service there. the people who provide the service are polite and nice specially there were one of them called Daniel or Dany !! he is very professional person, he was provide the service very quick and never let you wait for something you asked. really that person was help every one and always did the thing on the right way and on the right time. at the end I would say i have been to many hotels but their services not that much good as I saw in this Hotel.",5,2011,05,28
35,Brilliant Location - Good Night's Sleep,"Upon arrival (11am) the standard double room we had booked was not available for another couple of hours so they offered us a twin or a two hour wait. After making a joke about rearanging the furniture in a twin room, the reception lady found us an upgrade insead. It should be noted here that we are the type of people that usually stay in cheap hostels. 

The room was excessively large and had a bubbly bath in it and a balcony overlooking the World Trade Centre - which made for good people watching. The bed was comfy and probably big enough to fit six people in it and we got a good night's sleep because it's in such a quiet area - which is a miracle in Barcelona! Oh, except every now and then there was a loud 'PAAAAAARP' from a cruise ship, but not late at night or anything.

The actual location of the hotel was perfect as the open top buses stop right outside it and it's just a few minutes walk from Las Ramblas. Also, there's an excellent selection of sea food restaurants along the waterfront that all do paella. However, if you want the same dish for half the price with friendlier service (but on the road side rather than the waterfront) the restaurants across the road are just as good.

The drinks in the bar were exceptionally overpriced, but there was a man playing some smooth jazz piano in the background (as you would expect). 

Also, the swimming pool was under construction, but that wasn't really an issue as it was faily chilly when we were there.",5,2011,05,24
35,5 star hotel without a 5 star service.,"stayed at the hotel following a cruise , we had selected a non smoking room with sea views at £200 per nite we got neither . When i called reception to speak to reservations manager i was told he would call me back as the room smelled of smoke . I am still waiting on that call. We would normally eat in the hotel & give them more money in drinks etc. however due to their lack of interest we went out for our dinner . The hotel should be looking at the bigger picture making sure guests enjoy the hotel .the room was nice enough but a had strong smell of smoke very  smelly , bathroom was nice with shower & bath. we had no seaview which was also requested at time of booking.

Free wifi also a plus  however at £200 a nite you would expect that.
Breakfast was ok.

overall the hotel is nice but lacks the care & attention of good staff . but if the manager who did not return my call is a role model what do you expect!!!",3,2011,05,21
35,"A lovely little break, with a comfy bed!","I booked this hotel via last minute including my flights. I wanted something in walking distance to the harbour and la ramblas. The hotel was perfect location and took 5minutes to walk to the end of la ramblas and the harbour with the gorgeous fish resturants. The room was comfy and the bed was cosy, and I had a great nights sleep, one of the best I have had in a long time! The bathroom was great with a jet bath and little wash treats when we arrived.

They let us check in early as we got there at 11, so settled down and chilled out.
We didnt have a hairdryer in the room, which does say you do- but that didnt bother me as much. Also no bath mat, but was replaced the 2nd day we were there.

It can be very noisy at night in early morning, but with the balcony doors shut you cant hear a thing! The balcony has a great view also of the town, just the tower can get in the way of your sight.

We didnt eat there, was was quite expensive; thuo my partner used the gym for a quick work out while I sunbathed and went in the jacuzzi, The staff are pleasent and helpful- opening the doors for you, asking if you need a taxi etc. I would say the room needs a little re-paint in the corners and my bathroom needed re-sealing + a kettle would be great for tea and coffee but thats all I can say! I would rate this a 4star hotel with those little bits that are in the way of the stars!",4,2011,05,19
35,"Good, but lacking style","Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel is a good hotel. It's clean, located by the sea, has a professional athmosphere and the rooms are nice, if a bit small. If you stay there, you probably won't regret it. However, if you've stayed at other really good hotels - like Trump or Westin - the Grand Marina feels impersonal and rather cold in comparison. From the room menus to the reception and staff, everything feels like a high-priced Ikea. Taking into consideration the hefty price per night, I'll probably choose another location the next time I'm in Barcelona.",4,2011,04,20
35,Not a 5* Grand Luxury Hotel.  Suitable for business not leisure.,"Having read the reviews of this hotel, we thought it would be ideal for part of our honeymoon.  Unfortunately, we were very disappointed.  The 5*GL status did not to us seem apparent anywhere in the hotel.  We booked a Superior Double Room, which seemed like a standard room to us - we have stayed at many 5* hotels, including Barcelona, and to be honest, we found the Vinci 4* a better hotel than this. When we asked Reception upon arrival if we could change room as we had asked for a sea view on our booking, we were told that there were no Superior Rooms with sea views, which we find difficult to believe for a hotel this size.  It was very clean.  The hotel is more suitable to business than leisure and definitely not suitable for a honeymoon - our mistake.  A word of warning - the bar and room service charges are very expensive - 5 euro for a can of Fanta ... It would have also been a nice touch for the hotel to have put some fruit for example in our room as they knew it was our honeymoon, but they didn't.  The hotel is located on the 'pier' adjacent to the Marina complex, which although is within easy walking distance of Les Rambles, it is actually a very isolated walk back to the hotel at night time with some dodgy characters about the port-side; you need to either have your witts about you or get a cab.   In summary, if you get a cheap deal this hotel is OK as it is more like a 4*, but don't expect a fabulous 5*GL hotel if you are paying full price like we did.  We won't be returning to the Grand Marina Barcelona.",3,2011,03,11
35,Nice location with an attentive team,"We stayed here for 3 nights in February and had a really great stay.  The hotel is located at the bottom of La Ramblas on the Marina near the Christopher Columbus column, so if you’re one of those people who like to be in walking distance to the action but at the same time far enough away to appreciate the peace and quite then this is a great spot.
We had a premier room which was very spacious and overlooked the World Trade centre courtyard which was always empty. As previous reviewers state, there aren’t many sea views but this wasn’t a problem, and despite seeing several cruise liners come and go, we never heard a sound throughout the night. The bed was firm but comfy and the power shower had jets of water that came from every angle imaginable!
The best thing about this hotel was the team who worked there. All were friendly and helpful and nothing seemed to be a problem. The hotel was also very well staffed with at least 3 concierge per shift along with a full team on the desk. My only issue came when we asked for a restaurant recommendation and was sent to a place called 7 Doors which was an overpriced tourist trap in my opinion – Somewhere more unique would have been nice.
 Overall this was a great stay. Staff are plentiful but unobtrusive and the hotel suited our needs",5,2011,03,08
35,Good hotel for convetions,"The hotel and the rooms are all spacious and well maintained. It's more the business convention type hotel, if you are interested. It is 10-15 min walking distance from the center.",4,2011,03,06
35,"Nice hotel, spacious rooms, great view","First of all, the location is great: surrounded by the sea on three sides and just a stone throw away from the city centre. The rooms are spacious and clean as you'd expect from a 5 star hotel. The (room) service is very good - plenty of small items for free in the bathroom (little spa package, tooth brush etc.) and a complementary truffles delivery in the evening. Its the small things that always make the difference, isnt it?

The hotel breakfast is very good for Spanish standards. Just the restaurant lacks a bit of charme. One downside is that albeit the good location you have very little restaurant/bar space with a view. The gym is rather small and the pool only open during the summer. Thats probably the only downside: You would expect better spa, gym and swim facilities is such a large 5 star hotel",4,2011,02,22
35,Three star hotel at five star price,"Although the hotel claims to be at the bottom of the Ramblas, it's actually a good 10-15 minute walk from the Ramblas. Along the walk, you've just got a very long driveway. If you're looking to be in the heart of Barcelona, this is not the place for you.

The beds were not acceptable for a hotel at this price and class level. You could hear the springs creak when you got in. They were also quite hard.

The temperature level in the shower was highly inconsistent -- dangerously so. It would jump around from warm to hot to scalding with no warning.

The hotel offers free wireless access, but it's incredibly slow.

If you're considering this hotel, stay at the Le Meridien instead. It's usually a little more expensive, but a lot better value -- comfortable beds and a much better location.",3,2011,02,01
35,good base for trip to barcelona,"i was on business in barcelona at the attached world trade center but added on some vacation days.  the eurostars was perfect for this.  the room (a superior, i think) was very spacious, comfortable and clean.  my only complaint was the bed.  it was very uncomfortable, as were the pillows.  they actually offer a selection of pillows but they appeared to range from hard to very hard also.  from my perspective, the location of the hotel is perfect.  it is very pretty down by the waterfront and it is a pleasant walk to the ramblas, the nearest underground station etc.  barcelona is a walking city, so do like the locals and walk!  furthermore, this is a city  that doesn't sleep so i would imagine that the hotels in the middle of the city center are quite noisy.  at the eurostars, you get the best of both worlds.",4,2011,01,22
35,How can a hotel on a marina have no sea views? Not what I call 5 star and sooo expensive!,"Q: How can a hotel on a marina have no sea views?

A: When  it is the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel and it's ocean view are blocked by the world trade centre.

Yes the pictures look fab on the website ... but what they don't show is the fact that the hotel is just a small oblong part and not the huge circular building -which id the worldtrade centre.

Now that was not my main gripe with this hotel as Yeego.com had asked them on my behalf for a sea view room and they had said that another building blocked their sea view but they would give us a high floor.

Yes they did - A high floor facing the grey cementiness of the trade centre's high walls and unscenic courtyard.

The trick would be to ask for a town view, then I think you might even get a bit of sea view thrown in on the periphery same as the view from reception.

My problem was that I actually emailed them three times - once through the contact form on the website and no body bothered to answer ... ever.

Disappointing!

I got a good price with yeego.com 289 euros for 2 night B&B. That is good compared with the other websites. I know hotels are overall expensive in Barcelona but 289 was way too mjuch to pay for a stay in the Eurostars Grand Marina in my opinion as it realy lacked the wow factor except for it's location which as I mentioned before is a bit of a waste to put a hotel on a marina and then have no sea views.

Hmmm.

We got a very nice welcome on check in from (forgive me I can't remember her name) a charming young lady with morrocan heitage and were brough up to our room by an equally charming and helpful Luis.

All at the desk were the height of friendliness and professionality at all times - and the conceireges were so very nice and helpful.

One good thing about the hotel is that it is situated right beside a hop-on-hop-off sightseeing bus stop which services all the tour buses.

Our room was a good size, but with a matress like one slab of rock - so very very very hard! I had a back injury 4 years ago and not a twinge since until I slept in this bed ... and now 3 days on my back is agony.Perhaps coincidence but it was very very uncomfortable.

Howver you were given a pillow menu of all sorts and fabrics.I ordered 3 on our second night to try and offset the effects of the rock hard matress and although they were nice the so called scented one could not be diferentiated from the rest.

We also had a mini bar, nice but small balcony and quite small tv, though a great range of channels.

The bathroom featured a hydro massage bath which was great, but what a shame the bath was so tiny.

The shower/lighting/twin sinks and seperate loo/bidet area were all very nice as were the tolletries and cosy slippers, though I could not find any robes.

All in all I would have guessed I was staying in a plesant 4 star hotel.

The breakfast was very nice and a great selection of very delicious food.

However my breakfast on the second day was completely ruined by the restaurant manager Albert who took great exception to my ordering an omlette for my husband who had not yet come down and made a terrific fuss about having it sent up by room service and frankly made me feel like a criminal when I explained that my husband was ill but should he not showw up I would like to prepare a small breakfast for him to bring up.

I was told they would not let me add sauces etc to the omlette they had prepred but were keeping warm in the kitchen and all my husband need would be provided on the tray instead of my simply making it the way he wanted before it was delivered.

Naturally I took this up with the manager on duty who was most charming and apologetic and explained it was a misunderstanding to which I replied that I thought that no missunderstanding gave the restaurant manager the right to bully a guest so they felt unwelcome and overcome with embarrasment over breakfast.

Perhaps it was just a misunderstanding and language problem but I have never been subject to such treatment ever and I have certainly not been made to feel so much like a naughty child since indeed I was a naughty child!!!!

Anyway I realise this was a one off and so my views of the hotel are not affected by this, but I truly think you could do better than the Eurostars Grand Marina.

My second choice was The Pullman Skipper, but as we passed it on the tour bus I was unimpressed both by its dreary pison like facade and location.

When I return I will be looking for a hotel near the Port Vell region, by the beach and all those fab prominades.

My advice on Eurostars - not worth 289 euros B&B for a double for 2 nights, lacks wow factor and really you should expect a 4 star. Roof top pool and free laptops to use on fiorst floor a great asset, the bar was lovely (cocktails 12 euros ...ouch!), beds the most uncomfortable ever, no view, too far from La Rambla .... think you can do so much better and hopefully for less!",4,2011,01,19
35,"Luxurious, well located and comfortable hotel.","I have spent one week in this hotel for business purpose. 
This hotel is not very nice seen from outside (huge building in the Barcelona world trade center), but decoration inside is quite nice and you feel comfortable. 

People at front desk are helpful and efficient. 

Regarding the food, breakfast is very good and generous, however for lunch and dinner there are many better places to eat in Barcelona. 

Standard rooms are comfortable, beds are really good, and light and noise isolation are correct. 

Location is nice, very close from the sea, from the beginning of the Ramblas, but not so close from the city center. You will have to walk 10 minutes to get to the nearest metro station.",4,2011,01,07
35,A wonderful place to spend New Year' s Eve,"My husband and I spent six nights in this great hotel located in the Marina area in the World Trade Center compound. We were allowed an early check-in after a long trip from Dallas, Texas and  were upgraded to a mini-suite with a balcony overlooking the city, the harbor and Montjuic. The room was spacious with hardwood floors, a marble spa bathroom -- in summary, accommodations with many exquisite touches. The hotel is within about an eight minute walk to the south part of Las Ramblas and a subway station. We are walkers, so we walked everywhere, rode the subway, and took cab rides when necessary, There are plenty  of cabs outside the hotel and the fares are reasonable. In addition, the City Tour buses stop a few meters away from the hotel about every 10 minutes. The architecture of the hotel is open and modern with a significant architectural design. On New Year's Eve the hotel was fully booked with guests attending a  formal dinner party which we chose not to attend, not only because it  was pricey, but we did not know anybody.  Instead, we ordered room service and at midnight saw the fireworks and lights of the city from our balcony and  heard the whistle of the cruise boats anchored at the marina for the evening. Barcelona is a beautiful, awesome and  interesting city,  and  the comfort and enjoyment of our trip was enhanced by staying in this great hotel.",5,2011,01,05
35,The pros and cons of a solid 4 star hotel,"Pro:
- location: easy walk to La Rambla and the the Gothic Barrio, very safe even at night (we walked very night and past 2am)
- health club with sauna, good equipment and the sauna works
- good breakfast buffet
- large room, suites 
- very clean
- great connection with taxis and tourist bus
- very quiet
Con:
- indescript business hotel with interior that's starting to look past its prime 15-20 years ago
- not a 5 star as in the US but a solid 4 star
- Internet connection while free is terrible in the rooms
- pillows are either too soft or too hard and there are no nice diver covers
- no alarm or clocks in the rooms
- no fans or humidifiers available
- front desk seemed very busy all the time and response times vary...we had to call several times to get through",4,2010,12,30
35,the Titanic! Our hotel is sinking into the sea!,"This is NOT NOT a five star hotel. My desire was to get a hotel room with 85% of the Westin for 85% of the price w/o the underground train noise but much closer to Las Ramblas than the Westin.  Well, be careful what you wish for.  When we checked into our room, we were greeted by an overwhelming, choking smell of mildew.  We thought it was from the thick buildup of mildew in the corners, the ring around the bathtub and the sink.  So after our complaint, a maid was dispatched for a light spray and a quick wipe which resolved the smell in the bathroom for approximately 180 seconds. We didn't have to worry about the smell of mildew very long since the party boys from Madrid next door asked for a no-smoking room and then proceeded into a smoking marathon.  Halfway into our trip, we were awakened by the sound of water pouring from the roof into our room and covering the floor to a depth of several millimeters.  I called the front desk to report : ""The hotel is sinking into the sea and since we are on the seventh floor, its quite alarming"".   We were moved into a junior suite and if we had been given this room instead of the so-called ""Superior Room"", this might have been a much better review. The wireless internet connection is pretty lousy since there are four wireless channels with the same name and if you are blessed with an Apple Macintosh, it always grabs the worst channel.  The hotel does provide some very nice slippers for wearing in the room and they are recommended, otherwise walking around the floor in either room wearing white socks is an excellent way to gather forensic samples of soil from the Barcelona area.  The front desk people were excellent and the buffet staff was top-notch, so it is obvious the staff needs management leadership and guidance.  It is very apparent if anyone from upper management had bothered to check the room over past year, they would have noticed the overall poor condition of the first room.  Apparently the deluge had happened before when no one was occupying the first, shabby little room and it was never reported, allowing the room to mold and mildew.    There are some good people working here at the Eurostar but the management has completely failed them to provide any oversight.  This is the kind of management style that allows viewing the glorious Spanish Navy from a glass bottom boat.  The Breakfast buffet is good but hugely overpriced at 25 euros per head.  Better to head off to the Boqueria for some langustinos and kava for breakfast.   There is a nearby pharmacy and several places to get water and juice in the world trade center.   The view looking over Barcelona is nice so be sure and ask for a room facing the city, not the sea (which is blocked by the WTC).  Better yet, spend a few dollars more and stay at the Westin or the Arts.",1,2010,12,20
35,"Great hotel, Great location, a bit pricey but well worth the money.","My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights before we went on a 12 day cruise. We live in Denver and are in our mid 40's and 50's, not youngsters but not senior citizens, either.  This was our first trip to Europe and we did a lot of research about Barcelona's hotel's before we selected this hotel. We were not disappointed. We have traveled extensively in the United States, Carribbean, Mexico and Hawaii and we usually stay in better than average hotels. We don't like to stay in cheap hotels but we try not to break the bank either. We chose this hotel because we knew we wanted to be close to La Ramblas and the marina and other attractions. One end of La Ramblas is only about 1/4 mile away or a 5-7 minute walk. The hotel is also right on the marina and the mall,restaurants, and aquarium are all right there next to the hotel, also only a 5 -10 minute walk. There are some smaller cruise ships and ferrys that dock right next to the hotel but the larger cruise ships arrive/depart from a different port about 5-7 minutes away by taxi. I would recommend looking at the hotel's website at www.grandmarinahotel.com to get a better idea about the hotel. First of all, you'll see a picture of a large, round building. The hotel is actually just the front quarter of that building that looks toward that tower in front of the hotel. The other 3/4's of that building are offices for the World Trade Center. So the views from the rooms either look out toward the city or inward to that courtyard in the middle of the trade center. We paid a little extra for a City Junior Suite room and the view was awesome, overlooking the marina and the city and  hills of Barcelona. The courtyard rooms probably didn't have much of a view at all, except for the courtyard. Our room was very spacious with a king size bedroom with a fairly large bathroom  and a separate living room. Unfortunately, it rained for 2 days while we were there but it was really nice to have the extra living area overlooking the marina rather than staying somplace else in a smaller, cramped room without a view. Upon arrival, the lobby was very clean, the staff very professional and friendly. They all spoke english so we felt comfortable from the moment we checked in. We found the hotel to be spotless in every area. There are a couple of computers to use free of charge for web access on the 2nd floor near the bar/lounge. We brought our laptop and they gave us 2 free hours of internet access in our room. But we had a few problems being able to log onto the web but they have an excellent technical staff who came up to our room and helped us get online. There is a fitness center with a hot tub and a small swimming pool on the top floor. (The pool doesn't open until June so it was closed when we were there in May, but that's not the hotel's fault). Barcelona's Hop on-Hop off tour bus leaves from about 100 yards from the hotel's front doors so it's very convienent for sightseeing. On our second day there, we decided to explore the courtyard in the middle of the complex and found a few restaurants that are open for the trade center workers and hotel guests. There is also a little newsstand with basic soda's, candy, medicine,etc., a travel agency, post office and pharmacy. Good to know if you just need something basic. 

Now I want to address some of the ""negative"" reviews that I read before we chose this hotel. First, the beds. Yes, they are a little firm, but I didn't lose any sleep with them. My wife actually liked them and she said it helped her back. Some people also complained about the noise. The hotel is on a dock where ships pull in and yes, if you have your balcony door open, you can hear them loading the ferrys and cruise ships. But when we had the door closed, we couldn't hear any of that noise. We found it interesting to watch all the activity. The breakfast in the dining room is quite expensive. It's a nice buffet, but I think we paid about 30 euros each so for about $70 USD, it was more than one should have to pay for breakfast. The restaurant wasn't open for dinner when we were there but one night when it was raining and we didn't want to go out, we ordered room service and it was good food for a fairly reasonable price. It was about $30 USD for a pizza and club sandwich with fries. Not cheap, but more reasonable than the breakfast. 

But we had a great time staying at this hotel. If it wasn't for 2 days of rain, it would have been a perfect first visit to Europe. Some reviews also talk about crime & pick-pockets, but we didn't have any problems with that. Barcelona is a very nice city. I'm sure bad things can happen in any city you visit, but just be sensible and don't put youself in harms way and you should be fine.",5,2010,12,06
35,Great hotel with excellent service,"Together with a  friend we stayed from 24th till 29th November in the Grand Marina Hotel.
It's a 5* hotel and located in the harbor. It's only a few minutes walk from the Rambla.
Really excellent service and friendly staff. Especially one of the bartenders on the first floor who  makes excellent Mojito! ;-)
Our room on the 6th floor was very spacious,  (large room & bathroom with whirlpool and separate douce cabin, two sinks).  at night an excellent view of Barcelona).

No complaints at all!",5,2010,11,29
35,"Comfortable, well located, luxury at an affordable price","The Euro suits a business as well as a tourist - located close to but not in the noise of the LaRambla. So within a 10 minute walk you could be in the centre of action. The Hop On bus stops right at the doorstep so great for touring the city.
Rooms were surprisingly modern luxurious...and with spectacular views of the city. Staff was extremely friendly and courteous.

If you are tired - it is easy to relax in the room just looking out in the afternoon - just relaxing as you would at home.

After seeing some of the other hotels in the city - I would not stay anywhere else if I was to go to Barcelona again.",5,2010,11,27
35,Great hotel with fantastic location,"We went for the weekend fri - mon. The hotel is very international modern style and part of the WTC. A bit businessmen like, but very friendly staff. We didn´t book with breakfast included sine it was 25 euro/px/day, but when we checked in, we were given an offer on 20 euro wich is more normal in Barcelona. I´m glad we accepted the offer because the breakfast was just fantastic and by far the best we have experienced in Barcelona and Spain. We didn´t use the restaurant other than breakfast, it seemed overpriced but there where many other restaurants in the neighbourhood.
The first night there was strawberry/chokolate and at bottle of cava in an icebucket in the room - excelllent, and a free welcome drink in the bar.
All in all indeed a very nice hotel, wich is highly recommendable.",5,2010,11,21
35,Good business hotel - efficient quality,"I stayed in the Grand Marina with colleagues from around Europe, using meeting facilities in the World Trace Centre for our business sessions. I was impressed with the check-in staff, the food was excellent and the service friendly and efficient. The breakfast buffet was astounding - a great, no... HUGE selection, all fresh and of very high quality. I'm fussy about scrambled eggs, and I can say that these were the best I've ever had. The smoked salmon was also very fresh, no crispy bits round the edges. A great start to the day.

My room was on the 7th floor over the entrance, so I had a great view of the city. As with most business trips, I didn't spend much time in the room, but with good free wi-fi, a decent selection of English news channels (Sky News being much better than the awful BBC World), a fabulous bathroom with a superb shower, I had no complaints at all. Good size as well, with internal doors keeping the noise down, not that there was any. I was right by the lift lobby too, no problems with that.

Other reviewers have commented on the hard beds... yes, the bed was very firm. I often don't sleep well in hotels, but in the Grand Marina I slept like a log and awoke refreshed with no back ache. It won't suit everyone but was great for me. 

Sitting outside in the sun in November having lunch just in a T-shirt and jeans, while looking out over the marine (OK, through the gaps in the Trade Centre) was a highlight.

On the downside, my colleagues mentioned the pool was empty, and it IS a bit far from the beach and restaurants, but taxis are cheap and walking is cheaper.",5,2010,11,13
35,Fabulous Hotel in Good Location,"We stayed in this hotel for one night before taking a cruise and for 4 nights after the cruise as part of our honeymoon.  We'd signed up for the ""Celebration Package"" for the 1st night and for the ""Honeymoon Package"" for the 4 nights.  This is a modern hotel located in the Port area, approximately 10 minutes walk from Las Rambla.  On our 1 night stay, we were upgraded to a suite, which was out of this world.  On our 4 night stay, we were given the Marina Suite, which was beautiful too.  Yes, the restaurant is expensive and yes, drinks are quite dear, but we expected this as it is a 5* hotel and prides itself on this.  The facilities in the rooms were excellent.  I'd also ordered a cake and cava for my husbands birthday on our return from the cruise and what a cake they made plus they'd included candles and matches, which I really appreciated! The swimming pool isn't the biggest but it's up on the roof and there's lovely sunbeds and towels there. All the staff we met were execeptionally polite and friendly.  The only two negatives that I would have about the hotel is 1) In the Marina Suite, we were right beside where the Ships docked, so it was possible, if we had the curtains fully opened, to be seen by the ship passengers! and 2) in the rooms, there is no information book on the hotel, so it's quite difficult to know what number to ring for reception/housekeeping etc or where things are located or how they work e.g. how to connect to the internet etc.  We only discovered on our last day that numbers for reception etc were located on the inside back of the ""scribble pad"" !  We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and despite it's cost, if we ever go to Barcelona again, we will definitely stay here.",5,2010,11,08
35,Much More Attractive than Photos or Website Indicate,"We recently held a conference here and were very happy.  The hotel is much nicer than is indicated by the hotel's website.  The location is very good for both business and pleasure.  It's convenient to La Rambla, the marina, and the old city.  The convenience to the World Trace Center makes it perfect for business meeings and conferences.  The food provided was of good quality and the staff was very attentive.  We had some minor issues with hot water and air conditioning, but all were resolved in a timely manner.  Would highly recommend for both business and holiday.",4,2010,11,07
35,Excellent hotel....good location,"This is a great hotel, located on the port. It is about 10min walk to the main street (rambla) and about 10 min taxi ride to the night life near port Olympic. The rooms are great, really good size and clean. The staff are also very friendly and helpfull. It has great gym, sauna, jacuzzi but was really disappointed with the swimming pool...very small, more for small children. To eat in the hotel is also very expensive but I suppose as you are in the centre of the city this is common for all hotels. Also if you are looking to do the bus tour around barcelona it has a stop just outside the hotel which is very helpful.",4,2010,10,30
35,Comfortable Good Location,"Selected this hotel for location. Hard to miss down by the port.
Perfectly adequate 4 star standard hotel. Staff friendly enough. Bar and restauarant predictably expensive and not good value though they do give you complementary glass of cava. 
Mini bar expensive, no coffee making facilities in room which is a pain.
Good for tourist buses though we managed to walk everywhere.
Well equipped gym",4,2010,10,24
35,Great location for a reasonable price,"A 10 minute amble to Las Ramblas. I usually prefer hotels with a bit more local character -  this hotel was full of businessman and American tour groups, but the location is terrific, rooms a good size, breakfast was expensive but excellent - plenty of other eating places within a 5 - 10 minute walk, but we did have an wonderful meal and bottle of wine on our last night out on the terrace on a balmy night.  Bar and dinner restaurant service was very slow however on all 4 evenings we were there.  Plenty of taxis and tour buses outside.",4,2010,10,20
35,Wonderful!,"Stayed at the Grand Marina during the first leg of my honeymoon.  The hotel is absolutely beautiful.  We booked via their Honeymoon package and had breakfast delivered to our room every morning, along with champagne and chocolates waiting for us during our arrival.  The hotel is very close to all of the major sites and, of course, the staff is incredible.  Now, this place is definitely not cheap.  But well worth it if you want something special.  The views from our suite were absolutely stunning.  The only ""complaint"" is that the bed was a little too hard for my taste (I am too used to American beds which have plush tops).  But it was still comfortable and slept very well, especially knowing that my wife had a great time! :-)",5,2010,10,19
35,great stay,"perfect location for first timers in barcelona, kind helpful staff",5,2010,10,14
35,luxurius palace,grat location u have a grat view a soon as the sun gets down but even during the day. the rooms are woderfull u are getting fully papered there. very clean and comfy. the negative is that during the night u couldnt open the window beacuse it was too loud due to the cruize ships that were at the port. but with the wondows closed u could hardly hear this very annoying sound,5,2010,10,01
35,Horrendous & overpriced!,"For an expensive hotel I was hugely disappointed. The hotel says it's rooms facing towards the sea but fails to mention that this is impossible as the World Trade Centre is right behind it! Its also very noisy at night with the continued engine noises from the parked cruise ships right nextdoor (despite all windows & doors shut tight). Security is loose, anyone could enter all areas of the hotel & bar. Housekeeping is appauling. Together with stealing items from the room, both mine (imported botled water) & the hotels (robes). Marked walls & windows, dusty lampshades etc. Very bad carpet stains in communal areas (corridors). Tiny bathroom - 6' x 6'  for shower over bath, toilet & bidet. Indifferent conceierge, high prices (12 euros for a G&T), completely unmanned gym/sauna/jacazzi/pool/roof terrace. HOWEVER - Free use of laptops & internet in the bar and lovely dressing room/safe area though!",1,2010,09,30
35,Wonderful Stay,"My husband, son and I stayed here in for five days in August of 2010.  Everything was  perfect.  
It's quiet, but with the amazing spectacle of cruise ships passing right next to the hotel - the view from the pool is remarkable.  
Food at breakfast was great- a real selection, and indoor/outside seating too.  Our room was more of a suite with the romantic offer we booked; it was modern, cosy and quiet with a huge bed and panoramic views of Barcelona.   
Staff were really pleasant - Reception are efficient, but a bit unsmiling, whereas the porters cannot do enough to help in an unobtrusive manner.
I suppose the only downsides were that the pool is a little small and without shade - though as a sightseeing hotel, it's great and it takes a long time to be served in the bar.",5,2010,09,26
35,Great location,Spent 5 nights here at a nice hotel in great location - friendly and helpful English speaking staff. Our room was on the 7th floor overlooking the harbour and the city of Barcelona. Easy walking distance to Port Vell and the marina and slightly further to the great restaurants in Barceloneta. Downside of the hotel must be the price of the breakfasts - 26 Euros per person per day added another 260 Euros to our final bill. Despite some of the negative comments on Trip Advisor from other guests we had no complaints and would stay at this hotel again.,5,2010,09,21
35,Far exceeded expectations - go for a Grand Marina Suite,"Stayed 3 nights with ""romantic package"" (£160GBP/$250US per night in suite with breakfast).  Amazing Marina Suite on the 6th floor with a large balcony looking out over Barcelona and the port - loads of space (separate living room and vast bedroom and bathroom).  Excellent service - polite helpful staff throughout.  The pool on the roof is quite small (more for a cooling dip than a pulse raising swim) but it's still nice, plus nice sun loungers with views over the sea).  Breakfast was nice.

15 minutes walk to Ramblas, 30 minutes to the sandy beach... if you want to be right in the centre than maybe not for you, but if you want somewhere close enough but that is also peaceful and relaxing this is the place.

I'd read somewhat scathing reviews on tripadvisor before I went so I was somewhat nervous but the hotel really was top notch and def deserved it's 5 star rating.  I can't say what the standard rooms are like but if you can get a good deal on a Marina Suite then book it!

ps. on another note I was considering staying at the W - I popped in while I was in Barcelona and it was crazily busy - no space by the pool, the bars were crammed.  I guess it's still a novelty as it's new and will calm down but if you want relaxation avoid the W for now (plus it's almost twice the price of Eurostars)!",5,2010,09,17
35,"fantastic hotel, but also check out the Pullman for a price comparison","I booked at this hotel for a 5 day weekend for me and my girlfriend, after a fair amount of research on tripadvisor and asking friends for recommendations. My main criteria that I was looking for in a hotel were (1) proximity to the sea (2) quality hotel (3) proximity to public transportation + the centre of town. After it coming down to the Hotel Del Mar near Barceloneta metro station and this hotel, I chose the Grand Marina as I felt like splurging a little. (I was very pleased with my choice, by the way, as we passed by the Hotel Del Mar and the street it was on was very dirty (although the hotel itself might be nice of course.))

The price to upgrade to a Premier room from a Superior room was only 100 euros for the 4 nights, so I decided to go with that as it guaranteed having a balcony. This also proved to be a good choice, as I saw the inside of a Superior room while passing by and it was a standard, decent-but-not-big size, whereas the Premier room is really spacious with a hallway entrance, walk-in closet and a 2-room bathroom. The only small disappointment size-related to the room was the balcony, it was not small, but I had hoped that it would be larger. We ended up paying $350 per night including a $100 booking fee on one of the sites listed on tripadvisor, which I thought was good value on 1 week notice (the price had increased $100-$150 in the week I had waited to book.)

I've uploaded photos of our room and view, but in short we were on the 4th floor (smoking rooms are only on 3rd+4th floors), directly above the entrance facing the port and with good views of the water, the Columbus monument and the centre of town. Definitely lived up to expectations in this regard.

The bed was very spacious, I think they call it a queen-size bed on their website but it seemed like it could have been a king. One real perk that they don't advertise is that they have a selection of different types of pillows, hypo-allergenic ones are standard but there are 6 different kinds, all named after famous hollywood actresses. 

We went to the beach 3 times during our stay, and each time the room was sand-free after it was cleaned, which was a relief. The airconditioning also worked very well.

The bathrooms are equiped with 2 sinks, a standing shower as well as a bathtub with water-jet functions, all very modern. High quality toiletries and spa-type bath gels were also included.

The breakfast we had on the first day was delivered on time and was absolutely delicious, although pricey enough for us to only order it once. We ended up paying around 40 euros, but we did admittedly splurge a bit.

The staff were helpful and courteous, apart from one time at around 3:00AM when we came back and the automatic door was not functioning and was already ajar, so I pushed it open... the male receptionist sternly told me not to touch the door and to use the secondary door, which I had not noticed... I think they should have put up a sign saying ""use other door"" or something. Was too tired to argue with him though. That said, I don't hold this against the hotel at all, it was a very minor incident.

Transportation was fantastic and more convenient than I thought it'd be. The walk to the metro was 5 minutes tops, and whats more is there is a taxi stand directly in front of the hotel, with taxis waiting for most of the daytime. Note that Barcelona taxis are rather reasonably priced, we paid 22 euros for a ride to the airport, 8 euros for a ride to the beach, 9 euros for a ride from Catalunya place. 

All in all, I really had a fantastic time at this hotel, and would recommend it to anyone. THAT SAID: during my research, I had neglected to check out the Pullman Hotel, another 5 star hotel in Barcelona located directly beach-front next to the Hotel Arts. The average rate for this hotel and the Pullman are very similar, but the Pullman's location is so much better. Each are around 5 minutes walking from the metro, from which Catalunya/Gracia stations can be reached in less than 10 minutes, but the key difference is that the Pullman is beach-front, which means you can just ""pop out"" to the beach for a bit, rather than making an actual excursion to the beach as one has to do at the Grand Marina. It is also located next to a series of 5-6 trendy beach front restaurants and lounge clubs, which we spent a fair amount of time at, so we would have saved time and money in staying there probably. Nonetheless, if you don't intend to spend time at the beach, the Grand Marina has a better location as it is just a 5 minute walk from Las Ramblas etc.

PS: Bring the address with you just in case, and the hotel name written down, as taxis in Barcelona really don't seem to know where it is off the top of their head.",5,2010,09,16
35,Good Hotel - but far from perfect,"First of all, let me just point out that even though this may be considered a 5-star hotel in Barcelona, it would only count as a 4 or even a 3.5 star hotel in the United States or Canada. Perhaps the main problem with this hotel is the beds, which are very hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. My back hurt about half the time I woke up. Other than that, there's just not much luxury in there at all. To give you just a small example, we had a tiny TV with some 20 channels (only about 3 of which are in English) with no opportunity to buy any movies or programs.

Aside from this, the hotel has plenty of good things to offer. Its location is excellent. If you're lucky enough to be on the higher floors, you can have some great views of the city or the coast. It is also situated right next to the bus stops for the Bus Turistic and Barcelona City Tour, whcih are Barcelona's two main tourist buses that take you to all the interesting sites all over the city. Additionally, while other neighborhoods in Barcelona can be intimidating (especially at night), this hotel is in a nice neighborhood and you can feel safe walking the pleasant main street along the coast at all times.

Service is good and the staff are friendly and they all speak English. They have three laptops with an internet connection that can be used at any time.. The breakfast buffet is very expensive (over 30 euros) but it is excellent. You may hear some noise from the nearby cruise terminals, but it is not that bad. The rooms themselves have adequate soundproofing. Overall, the hotel was not a bad experience and I would recommend it.",4,2010,09,15
35,Stay Elsewhere if sleep is important,"The beds are like sleeping on a concrete pad. The furnishings are dated and the chairs in our room were dirty. The ferrys and ships dock directly next to the hotel and the dull roar of the engines go all night long.  Horribly place to get any rest.

The walk to the La Rambla was quick and easy. I would stay elsewhere due to the beds and the noise.... which was unbearable.",2,2010,09,04
35,"Nice Hotel, but really bad services",It is hard to say if i would recommend this hotel for friends or other business people. The rooms are very nice. The location is really good. And the prices are normally high for a 5 star hotel. I would recommend the hotel when they have fix the internet problems that they have.,3,2010,09,03
35,Fabulous location for a city break.,"After reading some of the more negative reviews of this hotel regarding staff friendliness, security and cleanliness, it is fair to say that we were a little trepidacious about coming. However, we needn't have worried. This was a fantastic place to stay, and our room had the wow factor that the price tag requires.

We were met by friendly and efficient staff who after hearing our attempts in Spanish spoke to us in fluent English, but really seemed to appreciate us trying! Our room was a city view room on floor 7, we were rewarded with a stunning panoramic view from our balcony stretching over the port and city. The room was huge with a gorgeous bath and shower room, dressing area and a very comfortable bed, plus a large sofa. The furnishings where sparce but there was nothing that we needed that wasn't there. It felt like coming back to our room was part of the treat of being in Barcelona.

We heard a lot about safety in Barcelona, and so were careful but never had any problems. We tended to avoid La Rambla as (in our opinion) by day it was a dreadful, crowded place and had heard plenty about it not being the safest place at night, but the walk round to Rambla de Mar was both safe and picturesque for an evening meal. Admittedly this was not the place to find the ""real"" Spain but suited us well.

From a tourists point of view this was perfect - the open top buses stop just outside, most major city centre attractions are close by, and the area of Montjuic is an easy walk.  The nearest metro stop is about 5 mins walk away. The kiosk at the end of the road from the hotel was well stocked with reasonably priced water and other refreshements served by a very friendly lady, perfect for the return to the hotel without paying premium prices.

A couple of downsides - the pool was much smaller than the photos make it look, and the breakfast was overpriced. A short walk into the city would find you cheaper options. Also, being by the port meant there was noise from the ships coming in. However,  I think it is important to remember that this is a city hotel, and complete silence is very hard to find anywhere. I personally enjoyed the business of it all, whilst at the same time being far enough away from the traffic to not feel overwhelmed by it.

Overall, the staff were very efficient and friendly, and we would stay here again like a shot.",5,2010,09,01
35,Exceptional hotel but extursionate food & drink,"Having just returned from Barcelona this bank holiday weekend with my girlfriend I'd like to recommend the hotel to the online community!

The staff are extremley friendly and speak very good English. The porter who brought our bags up took the time to tell us about the area, local attractions and transport links which was very helpful. 

However, we did very little in the day other than chill on the roof top pool, which I was a little disappointed with as the photos are quite deceptive - it's a very small pool only really used for a quick dip to cool off from the mid day sun certainly not something you can swim in. 

The first evening we enjoyed the spa bath in the upgraded room and the sat out on the balcony and enjoyed a few drinks from the mini bar. Having stayed in alot of nice hotels I'm no stranger to inflated prices for food and drink, but I would say that this hotel took the raving p1ss!!! Paying 7euros for a small can of beer pool side 5.5euros for a can of coke, and 18euros for a turkey wrap was disgusting. Highly advise bringing a bottle of something back from the local mini-markets just of las ramblas for a night-cap!

We would certainly go back to stay at this hotel and will be recommending it to anyone going to visit Barcelona!",5,2010,08,30
35,"Great for a cool, quiet break away from the heat and crowds","This hotel is in a good location, about a 5 - 10 minute walk from the bottom of La Rambla.  The staff were excellent - extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  The small rooftop pool and sun loungers (towels provided) allowed us to catch some sun and relax away from the crowds and heat of La Rambla and the rest of Barcelona and the aircon in the hotel and rooms was perfect after a day in the August heat. The roof area gave excellent views of the cruise ships and ferries at this very busy port.  
Both of the main city tour buses stop outside of the hotel which is handy.  
We didn't eat at the hotel as it was pricey but we did make use of both the roof top bar and main bar in the evening - pricey but nice.  We had one of the premier double rooms which gave us fantastic views over the city, a small balcony and worth paying a little extra for.  The towels in the room could do with replacing though.  When the WTC is open for business during the week there are a couple of bars/cafes open behind the hotel which are ideal for breakfast.  The pharmacy also sells very reasonable bottled water.  
We got a taxi from the airport direct to the hotel and it was a bargain, compared to the prices for booking taxis in advance (e.g. Easyjet).  I'd say this is primarily a business hotel, but would definitely stay there again.",5,2010,08,30
35,great choice,"great choice, very spacious rooms, excelent view of the marina, it is not in las ramblas, but you can easily walk there, if you want a modern and spacious rooms in europe, this is it, the only bad thing, are that the beds are very,very hard, good, but hard",5,2010,08,25
35,Nice hotel in Barcelona,"The location of this hotel is good: 5 minutes walk to Ramblas
I would take it the next time for a business trip but no for a romantic trip 
The service is very good
The rooms are spacious",4,2010,08,25
35,Excellent hotel with fantastic location definitely 5*,This hotel was definitely 5* with such courteous staff willing to please at all times. Fantastic location next to the port and 5 minutes away from city centre. We were so pleased with our premier room as it came with an amazing city view which to us was an added bonus.We would definitely return here as overall everything about this hotel was brilliant.,5,2010,08,23
35,Relaxing,"Just back from a wondeful relaxing weekend in Barcelona courtesy of my mother in law taking the kids for the weekend. We stayed in the wonderful Grand Marina near the trade centre.  Whilst the hotel is not situated on a main thoroughfare the fact it was a short walk from the end of La Ramblas really suited us. Not sure if the area is buisier when the trade centre is operational during the working week but very quiet at the weekend
                                                                                                      For us personally it was great that all the staff had absolutely perfect english and couldn't have been more pleasent and helpful. Reception was a big open space and we were delt with promptly on check in and out. Rooms were well stocked with towels and the shower/toilet area was very big with a great shower area. The bed was very comfortable plus with none of the children jumping on top of us we had great nights sleep. The mini bar was a bit expensive and we didn't use it , for a 5 star hotel not sure why it wouldn't be free. Breakfast was superb , plenty of choice for the health conscious or the person who wanted to pig out. There was seating indoors and out ,both were perfect. Staff were extremely helpful.
                             We didn't use the restaurant so can't comment. There was a small rooftop pool suitable only for a refreshing, cooling dip which I think suit everyone fine. Sundeck with great views of the harbour, a nice bar  and a well stocked gym with good changing rooms.
                              Since we had a late flight out of Barcelona the hotel allowed us use all facilities after checking out so there was no worries regarding bag storage, showering using the pool area which allowed us have a really enjoyable last day. we are looking forward to our next trip to Barcelona where we will book the Eurostar Grand Marina again",5,2010,08,23
35,"Good location, lots of amenities","Location is good by the water, next to the Port and at the end of La Ramblas.  The hop on/hop off bus tour has a stop right in front of the hotel.  We took a taxi from the airport as the airport bus takes you into the centre of the city only.  Although if you want to save money, I suppose you could have taken the airport bus and then a cab or use the tour bus to take you from the hotel to the city centre (if you have time).

Hotel is clean, and internet is free in the room.  Great views from the roof top.  If you are lucky try to get a room that has a view of the water.  Didn't get to take advantage off the pool and hot tub, as we didn't have enough time.  Hotel staff is helpful and gives a discount for the tour bus.",4,2010,08,22
35,Fantástica (pero cerveza costosa!),"We just arrived home from our 7 night stay in Barcelona, and what a fantastic trip it was. With a view to exploring most of the city on foot we selected the Eurostars Grand Marina due to its good location. It is in the harbour next to the Rambla de Mar (a very tourist-friendly restaurant and shopping complex) and a short walk from La Rambla (one of the main tourist areas in Barcelona). There is also a pharmacy just round the corner, handy for buying bottled water (essential). Due to the location there are large boats and cruise ships in and out of the harbour which can be noisy but it didn't disturb us - in fact we rather enjoyed watching the larger vessels try to manoeuvre out of the harbour.

The staff are very friendly and spoke excellent English. We had a standard room which was spacious and had a great view of the sea.  The bathroom is luxurious with his/her washbasins, a good shower and a spa-bath. Also handy was the multitude of complimentary toiletries, which even included a shaving kit.

We didn't have breakfast included but we tried it once and it was very nice if a little overpriced. Which leads me to the only real negative point. A beer at the poolside bar cost an unbelievable 7 euros. It wasn't even a pint - more like half. As a frame of reference 7 euros will get you a full LITRE of beer in one restaurant on the Rambla de Mar. It was a similar story in the piano bar - a White Russian (cocktail) cost 12 euros (most restaurants around the city offer a full bottle of wine for this price) A coffee (in fact it erroneously turned out to be an espresso) cost 4. Because there were no in-room coffee/tea facilities we walked to Starbucks on the Rambla de Mar for our daily caffeine hit.

If I'm being really picky it was a struggle to get a sun lounger up on floor 8 (the otherwise decent pool area). Such a large open space that currently the hotel are failing to use to its full potential. On a more positive note the views of the city and harbour up there are breathtaking.

But to linger on these minor issues is to overlook what a friendly, well-located hotel the Grand Marina really is. I would thoroughly recommend it and would return in an instant. But I'll be bringing my own beer.

To summarise:

Pros

- Great location for exploring the city
- Amazing views
- Friendly (and English-speaking) staff
- Clean and modern throughout
- Luxurious bathroom

Cons

- Ludicrously expensive drinks
- No in-room coffee-making facilities",4,2010,08,11
35,Great hotel in good location with very helpful staff,"This is a lovely hotel with huge, spacious rooms and great jacuzzi baths.  The hotel is situated a 5 minute walk from Las Ramblas which was perfect as it was just far enough away from the noise and crowds.  The breakfast was wonderful with lots of choice and you can even sit outside and have breakfast in the sun (and also enjoy a glass of cava with breakfast if you wish).  The staff were all so helpful and recommended restaurants or things to see and when we called room service Daniel couldn't have been more helpful.  Great hotel and I'd definitely go back.",5,2010,08,10
35,Wonderful Views - Very Stylish Hotel,"We (my husband, 2 teenage daughters and I) booked this hotel for a 1 day stay after completing an 8 day Disney Cruise. I first want to say thank you to all of the trip advisor reviewers for their entries!  I read many different reviews before deciding on this hotel. We wanted an updated, clean hotel, in a safe area, close to the cruise terminal and convenient to sites without breaking the bank - a good value. The previous reviews gave me a good sense of what to expect from this hotel. We encountered much of what was written earlier: Rooms were very nice, clean, and modern. They offered free wireless internet and had 3 computers with a printer in the business center/restaurant area. The bed was hard, but that was ok for me. Hotel staff was VERY cordial, helpful and spoke english. 
We took a taxi from the cruise terminal (approx 8 euros) and arrived at the hotel at 8:30 am. We were able to check in to one of our rooms right away-Sweet!  It was about a 10-15 minute walk to La Ramblas and to the waterfront mall/restaurant area. La Ramblas was more roudy and the waterfront area was more upscale/family orientated. Both are worth a visit. The Taxi from the hotel to the airport was 33 euros for us. The only other advice I have is:  If you don't speak Spanish, learn a few key sentences because they seem to only speak Spanish in many of the area shops and restaurants-including Starbucks. If you are from the US and have never traveled to Spain, find out ahead of time if your ATM card will work in Spain and plan accordingly (as I did not). For some reason my bank's ATM card wouldn't work in Spain and we were low on Euros at that point -oops. We had to limit our activities to those establishments that took a credit card.  The hop on hop off bus was not one of them unfortunately. Luckily there was plenty to do on foot. 
We were very sad to be off our cruise ship, but Barcelona and the Eurostar Grand Marina offered us a nice conclusion to a wonderful European vacation.",4,2010,08,10
35,Very reasonably priced with friendly staff,"The hotel is right next to the middle tower of the teleférico at the harbour, a few metres from the Columbus statue, so many sights are short walks away. The rooms are spacious, elegantly furnished and everything worked. There's a nice roof terrace where you can enjoy the maritime breeze and some drinks or go to the gym and have a bath in the small pool afterwards. The staff is very friendly. The only drawback is the pricey minibar.",5,2010,08,09
35,"Great hotel, great location, great deal","We booked this hotel for one night after our arrival in Barcelona before travelling to France. We got a deal on a ""romantic package"" which was outstanding, but that isn't the only reason we loved this hotel. First of all, the staff were excellent - pleasant and efficient, more than happy to help out. Our room was spacious and modern, well-furnished. The hotel had an excellent gym, and a great pool on the roof with adequate chairs and a more than adequate eating area next to it. We had a drink in the bar that night, and once again the staff were terrific, as they were the next morning at the breakfast in the hotel restaurant, which, again, was outstanding. We would stay here again in a heartbeat! The location is attached to the World Trade Centre in Barcelona, which is on a little finger of developed property that sticks out into the port  - perfect. It is a five minute walk to the old city, and maybe 20 minutes from the airport - an easy uncomplicated drive. Check it out!",5,2010,08,07
35,Nice stay,We liked the hotel very much as the hotel had a good location and it was only a short walk to the city centre. The area around the hotel was also nice. The room we got was also very nice.  Good service at the hotel too. Good gym facilities. We will definitively stay at this hotel again next time we visit Barcelona and we may recommend it strongly.,5,2010,08,06
35,Away from the bustle clean and friendly,This hotel was down on the port with the ships coming in either side of the hotel. Because its away from the crowds it actualy made it very quiet and the rooms were well soundproofed. We dont mind a walk to retaurants and shops but for anyone that cannot walk too far it would be a bit out of the way. The standard of service and the cleanliness of the hotel was definately 5 star worthy. The only thing that let it down was the hard matress. Tip; if you have breakfast its actually cheaper to order it in your room.,4,2010,08,06
35,Average,"I reserved junior suit so I expected I will get superior service but I didn't, they even did't present fruit salad... neverthless the reception is too small and not suitable with 5 stars hotel
I was chocked from swimming pool size as when i ckecked it on net it was big one but on reality it's just 4 SqM maximum",3,2010,07,27
35,Fabulous Hotel close to Port,"We stayed at this hotel for one night prior to our cruise. They did not have 2 rooms adjoining, so they upgraded us to two suites. The rooms were gorgeous. They were contemporary in design. The beds were extremely comfortable. We ordered room service for dinner. The sea bass was superb.  I slept for 14 hours that night. The breakfast buffet was excellent, if a little pricey. I would love to stay here again.",5,2010,07,24
35,Hotel from heaven,"We stayed at the Grand Marina for 5 nights in the middle of July. We have stayed in hotels across mainland Europe and the UK and this is number one in our opinion. From first arrival, with a delightful welcome from Reception where the Bellboy takes your luggage to the room you just know when he turns the key in the door everything will be fine. The suite  we stayed in was spotless, huge, and nothing was omitted.  It is helped with stunning views of the harbour and city on two sides and a balcony. In fact after our first night, when we returned to the room we found chocolate and sparkling wine.   This is a hotel which knows how to delight its customers!  The next morning we were treated to a breakfast which cannot be matched anywhere. The range of food is quite extraordinary, the sumptuosness quite decadently extravagant. All in all the experience was such that we will tell everyone we know to visit the city and stay at Eurostars Grand Marina.... we, of course, will be back",5,2010,07,23
35,the best choice,"we spent five days in this Hotel last week.
We are from poland and this was my third time in Barcelona with my wife and it was the best. 
In my opinion one of the best hotel where I have been in my live.

The staff is very helpful and nice. the bell boy help us with the luggage and the Recepcionist  always kept an eye on all of our requirements.
the restaurant's  service was also excelllent . they offer a hight quality and fresh mediterranean food.
The hotel have also a Spa , jacuzzi and swimming pool area with amazing views of Barcelona.
I really recommend this hotel for a short holidays in barcelona.",5,2010,07,15
35,Excellent holiday hotel,"Good hotel positioned right on the marina, with nice outlook onto the bay and the cruise ships.  Easy route from the nearest metro station, Drassanes, even with luggage as it is pretty flat all the way.    The hotel is on the Tourist Bus route and also on the cruise ship connection bus route. 

The reception desk is very efficient and will arrange trips and transport for you if required.  The breakfasts are great - good variety and buffet style.  

The restaurant provides tapas, cava and a good variety of foods both local and international with both bar seating and more formal dining.  Full cocktail menu, bit pricey but worth it when you're on holiday I think.  

There is a pool on the rooftop (which was smaller than I thought it would be for this size of hotel and compared to the photos on their website) but then you are near the beach and a large jacuzzi there too.  

Rooms are very well organised and maintained with good soundproofing, views of the marina and lots of space.",5,2010,07,07
35,Excellent staff and location,"we have an excellent holyday in this Hotel. the staff always have a smile. Great breakfast and very clean .
My familiy enjoy an unforgettable holiday in Barcelona and this Hotel made us a strong and great impression.",5,2010,07,02
35,Excellent hotel in perfect location,"We have seen some negative reviews of this hotel and frankly cannot recognise the picture painted.

We were warmly welcomed - in English- and given helpful suggestions about activities, breakfasting and internet access which is completely free. Our luggage was promptly taken to our spotless room and the porter took care to check we were properly settled in. Breakfast was excellent with a good range of items on offer and even complimentary newspapers available. We were given every assistance with airport transfer arrangements.

The best test of an hotel is when something goes wrong. During our stay there was a serious domestic disturbance and violent assault in the room next door to us in the early hours of the morning. We alerted reception and within a minute security staff were dealing with the situation professionally, decisively and discreetly.There was no impression of staff being less than wholly committed or simply going through the motions. They even followed up with us to confirm the actions taken. We would certainly use the hotel again.",5,2010,06,30
35,Hotel Staff Couldn't Care Less,"The Grand Marina is definately not 5 Star by my standards!  And my standards are quite simple!  The staff don't smile or even look interested, they don't offer to help with your luggage. The laziest staff ever!

The only good things are the location, reasonable size room and the gym. 

My husband and I had bad experiences trying to get ice! of all things!  I had to go down to the bar to ask for it and had to wait for the rude bartender to finish his conversation with another staff member to get served.  He made me feel like I had to buy a drink first.

One of the most common views when we left the room was a maids trolley that was always in front of our room.  One time the maid forgot to leave towels in the bathroom, so it was quicker for me to grab them off the maids trolley rather than risk a long wait or  difficult staff.

We wanted to check out a day early and that was a big problem!  The staff member my husband spoke to said we couldn't cancel because we were already booked in.  The staff member just wanted to argue her point and implied that it was our fault and we should cancel online! Terrible customer service! she didn't even want to know why we wanted to check out early! 

Not a very welcoming stay at the Grand Marina.",2,2010,06,30
35,"Fawlty Towers - Enter at own risk... The Good, The Bad & The Ugly","What a shocker.  Whoever rated this a 5 star hotel from the Hotelliers Assoc. needs a kick in the pants.   After much research on Trip advisor, we decided to stay here as part of our Honeymoon trip.   Unfortunatley, I made this booking sometime ago when their rating was much higher.   The recent reviews and they're rapid decline down the trip advisor scale explain  why its going all so wrong.

The Good
- Big spacious room on top floor (upgraded due to honeymoon).
- Good selection of toiletries
- Extensive Gym
- Good location (10min walk to Ramblas)
- Great View from top floor.

The Bad
- The LAZIEST staff I have ever seen in any Hotel.
- You have to take your bags to your room (I have no problem with this, but it is a requirement of a 5 star hotel)
- The HARDEST bed you will sleep on (Great if u have just had a spinal operation) and the standard pillow is just as hard (luckily you can change pillows)
- 'Sauna' is a joke.   It is a 2 person cabin in the changeroom.   You must contact reception to turn it on.   The first time, I did so 3 times and the receptionist insisted it was on and that I must be mistaken.   After complaining to the duty manager, they sent a maintainence man up who discovered the control box had a blown fuse.   The 3rd day they just forgot.
- The hall areas outside the rooms are filthy. The carpets are stained and dirty.
- The maid service is poor.  Twice we had to get our own towels from the maid trolley in the hallway.
- Staff extremely unfriendly.   I went downstairs to get the bar to get 2 glasses of ice (so we could have drinks in our room).  The barman did not look impressed that I asked...it really was like extracting Teeth.

- EXPENSIVE, EXPENSIVE, EXPENSIVE.    There are far better options and better value in Barcelona.   I know because we tried to check out early.    We inspected 3 other hotels which seemed far better - unfortunately for us they were booked out.

The Ugly.

We were booked for 5 nights, but checked out 1 day early.  As mentioned before, we would have checked out on the 1st day had we had found another hotel.   Here is the ugly bit.   On day 3, I informed the front desk that we will be checking out next day.   At no time did the male clerk enquire why we were checking out, just to point out that my booking was for 5 not 4 days.
The next morning on checkout we met the 'lovely' Ivanna (I got the name this time).  Once she realised that we were checking out early, she stated she could find no record of the computer entry the male made the day before.   Then she went on to 'interrogate' me as to whom was this person I spoke with, what was their name etc.  I said to her what Tourist has the habit of getting every clerk's name they speak to (I know now - hence why I remember Ivanna).   Then the most idiotic thing I have ever heard - she told me that I should have cancelled the last night from the computer in my room not at the desk.   I then told her that was the most ridiculous thing I had heard...to not speak directly to the reservation staff if I am staying in the hotel.   Just to get the final word, she took great pride in telling me that she would be 'checking this out'.   As the hotel had my credit card details (and based on past performance would charge me regardless) I insisted on speaking with the Duty Manager.  She informed me that there was no duty Manager on until 9.00 a.m.  - A '5 Star' hotel that does not have a duty manager on 24/7 - What a JOKE.

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE - Learn by my experience and mistake.  This hotel's negative reviews are becoming all to familiar",1,2010,06,29
35,Dissapointed by maintenance and service.,"Everything was fine but... there was no hot water in the room at all. When we asked to solve a problem, manager proposed to use shower in the some other place of hotel. Room was not chaged, no discount or other compensation... 
So, only because of this moment I'll never recomend this hotel to anybody and I'll never stay here again.",1,2010,06,29
35,really disappointed with so called 5 star hotel!,"My husband and I were really looking forward to staying here after our cruise. We had spotted hotel as we got on ship and it looked lovely but after staying for only one night our opinion changed. The hotel room looked nice but soon spotted lots of faults. Our window handle was broken, phones in rooms did not work, television reception was a joke and jacuzzi bath also not working.Also bath was not very clean. Tried calling reception from bathroom phone but very few spoke good enough english to understand us. I cannot believe that this is a 5 star hotel and have e-mailed a complaint to them. This is not a cheap hotel so we feel very let down. We were only there for one night but will not be returning",2,2010,06,23
35,lovely room with view of beautiful marina,"We spent one night at the Grand Marina before embarking on our cruise, and, from our terrace, we were delighted to see our cruise ship docked right next door! When we checked out, the hotel porter just wheeled our luggage to the cruise terminal from the hotel.
Our room was spacious and beautiful, and our view of the marina couldn't be beat!  
After an expensive room service breakfast, we walked all around the marina and found a good seafood tapas restaurant over the sea.  It was fun eating dinner and lunch there.
Las Ramblas is within walking distance, with crowds of all kinds of people milling around.  We preferred walking along the pretty marina.
My only complaint is that I could hear loud music from, probably, one of the boats until midnight.  Other than some noise from the port, I enjoyed the hotel.",5,2010,06,19
35,Great location hard beds,We checked in before a cruise our flight had gotten in early but they bwere unable to get us in early because it was a Sat and they were full so early check in was not possible. The staff there was very friendly and helpful. We went for a walk down Los Rambles which was just minutes away. The best thing about this hotel is the location which is in walking distance from many cool sites even just minutes away from a very cool shopping mall thats just across a bridge from the pier. The rooms are just like they look in the pictures perhaps even a little bigger. Here is the downside-Its very expensive here but there are lots of places on Los Rambles to eat for a lot less. The walls here are paper thin which is a real bummer when trying to sleep after a long flight we heard the neighbors tv all night long. Also outside in the courtyard there is a cool little water fountain show going on with fireworks sound effects. But its very loud when you are trying to sleep. Yes a lot of people say the beds are rock hard and you know they are exactly right. The beds were harder than even described here. So great location but forget about a good nights sleep.Also if you have a bit of luggage for your cruise forget about taking the bus or subway which is packed liked sardines. You will have to take a cab. Which even though the cruise terminal is only a stones throw away you will end up paying around 30.00 euro for cab fare. Had a nice amenity package in bathroom though and the shower was a 6 sprayer shower which was very good.,3,2010,06,15
35,Great Hotel,"Firstly please do not listen to the usual complaints from the whingeing Brits!!!

The reception staff were very friendly and speak perfect English if you want an English hotel then London is the place for you!!

We had an inside room which was clean, with hydro bath ,perfectly functioning air conditioning and wifi access.The fully stocked mini bar was pricey but we kept our own drinks in the fridge and must have replaced the stock many times without being charged!!

I must admit that it had a rather conference feel about it but it is large, roomy and clean. The gym on the roof top is well equiped and had a jacuzzi which led onto the roof top pool. Whilst this was fairly small it was lovely and refreshing and since we were in the Spannish summer I do not feel that it needed to be heated. I have a daughter and would be happy for her to swim in it since she is not spoilt and would not expect it!!

There was complementary bottles of water and apples on the roof top. I did not try the breakfast as this was expensive, there are pleanty of cafe bars on La Rambla which is a very short walk away.

Taxi's and busses are outside the hotel watch the cab drivers who must be on Comission to take you to Salamanda restaurant which is good, but rustic and expensive. Agua near the Marina was in a beautiful setting and the food was yummy.

On the whole we had a lovely stay in a lovely hotel",4,2010,06,15
35,Excellent service,Stayed here for 3 nights in june 2010. Started with premier room 405 which had a not functioning a/c. After complaining we were upgraded to a marina suite which was excelllent. Also an excellent breakfast. We don't recognize the complaints of other travellers; staff was kind and helpfull. We will definetly return!,5,2010,06,08
35,Very disappointing,"I would not reccomend this hotel. We had booked a Superior Room, but there was nothing ""superior"" about it. The room was very small, with marks on the walls and floor. The bed just  had an old looking, snagged bedspread, not what you would except from a 5 star hotel.
The airconditioning did not work, when we told reception they said that they did not have another rom available. It took 2 complaints over 2 days to get it fixed and we were only staying 2 nights. We could not sleep with the window open because the huge cruise ships moor right alongside the hotel and keep their engines going all night. So in the June heat our room was unbearable.
When we checked in we were not given any information about breakfast, where/when/how much (we subsequently found out it was 27 euros each!) and there was no information in the room about any of the hotels facilities.
We decided to pay alot extra to stay in a hotel with a pool as it was June. In the previous 2 weeks to our stay I emailed the hotel twice asking if the pool was heated. Both times I receive an auto reply stating that they would deal with my email shortly, they never did! After a long day of sightseeing in the heat, our 7 year old could not wait to jump in the pool, only to find it was not heated! He promptly sad there sobbing as it was too cold to get in!
So much for spending alot of money on a hotel thinking that you will get a luxurios room with airconditioning and a heated pool! 
There were no leaflets on sightseeing trips or any tourist information.
This hotel is 3 star",2,2010,06,06
35,Perfect hotel and in the perfect location for a stay in Barcelona,"Just returned from a four day trip to Barcelona staying at the Grand Marina. The hotel is beautiful, gorgeous bedrooms with luxury bathrooms - hydromassage bath and great showers. Lovely touches, slippers, fluffy towels and a bag in the bathroom full of shower cream, shampoo, comb and toothbrush. 
The staff are very friendly and helpful and want to make sure you have a lovely stay. 
The hotel is situated in the marina and is part of the World Trade Centre. You can catch a tour bus from outside the hotel which was really handy (the bus service was great value and a brilliant way to see the city). Just a short walk from the hotel you have a shopping centre and restaurants in the marina and in the opposite direction is La Rambla. The Gothic area is about a 15minute walk from the hotel - if you love architecture you'll love it here, fabulous! Also Gaudi's Casa Batllo and the Temple of the Sagrada Familia are breathtakingly beautiful.
We ate at a great little resturant in the Gothic area called 4Cats. 
We also ate at an awful resturant on the main street in La Rambla called Top Tapas - very expensive for the quality and rude waiters. 
The hotel has a terrace on floor 8 with a few sunbeds and a small pool, this area is lovely and relaxing and a welcome oasis after a hard day sight seeing!! 
Breakfast was lovely, although expensive - 20 euros per person, we only ate there once and picked breakfast up at bakeries etc for the other days. 
The only complaint was that if there is a ferry or a cruise ship at the port the engines are noisy and this distrurbed our sleep - not a major problem, but if you are a light sleeper this could be very annoying! 
I'd recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Barcelona for a great central location and for a touch of luxury.",5,2010,06,05
35,Nice Location,This hotel has an awesome location if you are cruising out the Port of Barcelona. Depending on your cruise ship you could even walk to it as some ships dock alongside the promenade that leads to the hotel. The rooms are well appointed. The bed is a little tough but the rooms are large.,4,2010,06,03
35,Air-conditioning in some rooms not working!,"We had a party of 8 staying in 4 rooms.  The air-conditioning in 2 of the 4 rooms were not working.  Despite contacting the front desk multiple times and the maintenance persons working on the air-conditioning several times, the air-conditioning still did not work.  The worst was that the event dragged till past midnight on our first night.  We got so tired of waiting and giving them time and opportunity to fix the problem, and simply couldn't stay awake anymore when it was approaching midnight.  At 11:40 p.m., we asked to be transferred to another room where the air-conditioning worked since it was getting too late and we simply couldn't wait anymore.  A very rude male front desk personnel promised and assured us that the air-conditioning definitely would work in our room in another 20-30 minutes and refused to move us to another room.  We fell asleep on the chairs while waiting.  At 12:15 a.m., the air-conditioning still was not working!  We were very disappointed.  Finally, we were given another room to sleep for the night.  We were simply too tired and were walking in mid-sleep by that time.  We asked to sleep in that room without moving our stuffs over since it was way past our bedtime to pack, thinking that they would have the air-conditioning in our room fixed by the next day.  On the next night, when the air-conditioning problem was still not fixed, we asked to be transferred to another room by 10:30 p.m. so we could at least sleep well on the second night.  

Later, we learned that the air-conditioning in some of the rooms were not working and were surprised that these rooms were not blocked out.  What was frustrating is that they didn't switch us over to another room right away and kept assuring us that the air-conditioning would work if we could wait and give them time to have the problem fixed.

On the other hand, there are several positive aspects about the hotel: (i) the rooms are comfortable, nice and of a good size; (ii) the front desk personnel speak English; (iii) complimentary high-speed Internet is available in each room.

Other negative aspects are: (i) neither the housekeeping nor maintenance staff speak English; (ii) the restaurant staff do not speak or understand English well; (iii) only a few pieces of tissue paper (in 1-2 small tissue packets) available in each room (since I caught a cold, they were not adequate for my use); (iv) it's hard to tell if someone knocks on your door or the door next to ours -- I opened the door several times when someone knocked on the door next to ours (this was quite frustrating because it also happened in the middle of the night).",2,2010,06,01
35,Arrogant 5 Star Hotel,"Stayed for an overnighter before a cruise.  After 1 hour, my wife and I were still waiting for a room.  Room 1 was a smoker - although I explicitly stated at check in that I wanted non-smoking - the guy assured me it was.  Hey, it wasn't.  Room 2 was bigger (to make us feel better I think) but after 30 mins of messing around with the A/C - including hotel techies - no joy.  Room 3 was a junior suite...getting better....at this rate I'll be in the presidential suite in a few hours.  A/C was still dodgy but I was now fed up and left it at that.  The point here is that if this is truly a 5 Star hotel, the Front Desk should care more about the plight of its' customers.  They don't.   A Laissez-Faire attitude at best I would say.  By the time we refreshed ourselves etc..it was too late to go out so we ate in the hotel.  Food was good...but horrendously expensive.  Location of the bistro was a few tables at the end of the bar area.  Pathetic.  A small bottle of water from the mini bar was 4 Euros.  The whole place is geared for World Trade Centre (next door) delegates on generous expense accounts (in Europe...thats our tax dollar!!!).   I would suggest anyone staying and paying themselves, stay well away from this place.  I know - I stay over 100 nights a year (minimum) in 4-5 star hotels around the world and would still find it hard to justify to spend company money on this place.  One final note.  The bell boy who kept dragging our luggage from room to room deserves a mention.  He was brilliant, if suitably embarrassed at his purportedly senior managers' performance.",3,2010,05,29
35,Modern Hotel - Excellent Rooms,"We were a little skeptical about the location of this hotel prior to booking, but after staying there we are delighted we booked this hotel.  We made our reservation on lastminute.com and got a really really great deal.  

The rooms in this hotel are fab, probably the biggest hotel rooms we ever stayed in; separate walk in wardrobe, double sinks, separate shower and toilet, jacuzzi bath and a huge bed area.  My only quibble would be the shower, far too complex and not near strong enough spray.

Location wise, it's about 10 minutes walk to La Rambla and 15 minutes to the Gothic area.  The hotel area are is not dangerous like some of the other posts.  Plus, we never heard any of the cruise ships which docked there.  Tourist bus stops right outside the entrance of the hotel.

Hotel bar was quiet, modern and fits in well with the hotel style, but we preferred going to the bars in the city centre to experience some Catalan culture.

Hotel staff were excellent and very helpful and forthcoming with sightseeing tips and restaurant tips.  They also checked us in online for our return flight and printed our boarding cards for us at reception.

Swimming pool on the top level of the hotel was closed when we were there, though it looked as though it has been that way for quite some time.

Taxi from to/from the airport cost us €20, journey took 15 - 20 mins, much faster than getting the metro in to the city!

In summary, we loved our stay in this hotel and would definitely return.  Other hotels closer to the city centre seemed far too noisey and not great value for money.",4,2010,05,25
35,GREAT STAY IN BARCELONA,"We spent 3 nights at the Eurostar Grand Marina Hotel prior to embarking on a  Cruise. We selected it after reading good ratings in Trip Advisor and for the convenience of the location, right at the Port very close to Ramblas, Maremagnum and our departure deck. But our expectations were excedeed by the great staff service and the nice room we had. Specially Pedro from Reception who sent us wine and chocolates to our room after realizing that we were honey mooners. 
We couldn´t get a Queen bed due to occupation, but two double beds were arranged to become one Queen. Facilities are great, the bathroom and the amenities provided. as well.

We definitely recommend it and would stay there in our next visit to Barcelona.

35,"Great hotel,good price, recommend to stay!!!!","Very nice hotel clean and at the excellent price, 5 min from main street -Rambla and historical and shopping area.Very quite, free internet. 

But if you considering to be more on the beach, not the best location.20min by walk or 5 min with taxi that willcost you 6-7 Euro.",5,2010,05,10
35,Best Breakfast ever!,"Really enjoyed our one night stay at this hotel. Rooms are spacious with the most generous toilettries I've ever seen.
But the real gem is the Breakfast- you name it they've got it. It's a buffet breakfast but the quality of the food, display,range of food on offer, cleanliness and attention to detail is incredible. Staff continually make sure the Buffet is perfection, clean up all the time and the customers are well catered for. A delight! Honest!
Ok, the rooms are huge, peaceful- breaktaking views, generous sized bed, spotlessly clean throughout.
Hotel has a great location by on the Marina- but sooooo quiet just the same.
Just enjoy your stay here- I did!",4,2010,05,03
35,Good Hotel. Good Stay.,"Modern Comfortable Rooms.
Bed and Pillows too hard.

Good Location. 
10 Min walk to Las Ramblas. 
5 Min walk to Tour bus stop.
* Bring comfortable shoes",3,2010,05,02
35,Fabulous stay in a great location.,"What a great hotel!  We booked on Expedia, and we were very impressed with the hotel.  The lobby is a bit plain, but the upstairs and the rooms more than make up for that.  The staff is overly helpful, the rooms/bathrooms are beautiful, and the location is very conveient.  In fact, the Barcelona Tour Buses pick up at the hotel, which is a great way to see Barcelona.  Our room also had a large balcony with a beautiful view of the marina. The bar had very good Tapas and wine, but of course was a bit pricey being a 5 star hotel.  The pool was not open during our stay, but it appeared a bit small. The gym appeared very nice as well.  There are two lap tops near the bar on the first floor with unlimited internet use, which was very nice for use since we planned our trip as we went.  Overall, a fantastic stay ... we went from a one night reservation to a three night reservation based on how impressed we were!",5,2010,04,29
35,"Excellent value, wonderful views, outstanding service - can't wait to return!!","We are an Australian family currently living in a Spanish town outside of Barcelona. We had never stayed in Barcelona before and wanted to do something special for our anniversary. After looking up advice from tripadvisor, we got a great deal from TravelZoo.com which gave us a free room upgrade and 2-for-1 breakfast buffet. When we arrived we were given a beautiful room although it didn't have the views we were hoping for so we asked for a change. Within 5 minutes, the porter arrived at our door and took us to our replacement room. When the door opened we just couldn't believe our luck - they had upgraded us again to a city suite room which had breathtaking views of Barcelona!! They also provided a fully made up cot for no extra charge and a super-late checkout on departure of 1.30pm!! After a day out in Barcelona we decided to get room service for dinner. Although a bit pricey, it was worth every Euro. A waiter arrived at our door and proceeded to assemble a fully set dining table complete with vase in our room! The next day we had the breakfast buffet and it was the best brekky buffet I have ever had! I can't think of one thing that it was lacking - it even included cava! The staff accomodated our every need and the whole experience exceeded expectations. We are looking forward to going back!!",5,2010,03,29
35,"Excellent hotel, professional staff","Brilliant hotel with fantastic staff and service. Great clean rooms, very comfortable beds, air conditioning / heating works flawlessly and quietly. Breakfast is excellent - food choice and quality is outstanding. This hotel is perfect for business conferences, as well as very conveniently located for leisure trips. Not much more to add apart from if I am in Barcelona again, this hotel will be the first one I will consider.",5,2010,03,29
35,"Clean hotel, rude service definitely not a 5 star luxury hotel.","This is a nice and modern hotel, the best thing is that the rooms where clean. However, the hot water in the shower did not seem to work for more than a couple of minutes and the sliding doors to the balcony did not close properly, you could hear the boats and traffick more than expected.

I went to the restaurant and was attended by a super stressed waiter that was running all the time in what it didn't seem rush hour at all. I left almost all of my hamburguer because it was not great at all and the service did not ask me anything about it. I ordered a simple tea and they charged me 4 euros!

This hotel is nice but definitely not cozy or a 5 star luxury hotel.",3,2010,03,25
35,"Pricey, but very nice rooms","My girlfriend and I stayed at Eurostars Grand Marina in front of our Mediterranean cruise with Voyager of the Seas. We choose the hotel because of the distance to the cruise harbour. I dont think we couldnt choosen any better. Good location, nice rooms, but a bit pricey. But hey, you get what you pay for!",5,2010,03,20
35,"Lovely hotel, shame the City lets this place down","After a 6 hour delay we arrived from London on a Friday night and were given the key card to our room.  Upon entry to the room we discovered the door was already open and that the lock was broken as we could not get the door to shut so we had to go back to reception and advise.  They wanted to fix the door but we declined as we wanted to rest and asked for another room.  We got an upgrade to a premier room 530 which was really nice.    Comfy wide bed with nice furnishings, 2 chairs to relax in, a balcony overlooking the offices, a seperate jacuzzi bath and massage shower and his and hers sinks. 

The hotel was quiet on the first night during the early hours but we heard a lot of noise right up until 6am on the following night which disturbed our sleep.  It was people coming back drunk to their rooms and being very inconsiderate, never heard any noise from cruise ships etc.

Had drinks and a meal in the restaurant on the Friday.  Food was ok, nothing special and the drinks were expensive, equivalent to £10.00 for a Malibu and a Diet Coke.  Although you expect to pay more in a hotel I thought that was a little pricey.  As we were staying for a weekend none of the shops by the offices were open so I would suggest bringing a few bottles of water/soft drinks with you as otherwise you will be spending a fortune in the bar just to have some liquid!

We were expecting good things from Barcelona but found a lot of places shut up and wherever we seemed to eat , the staff seemed to find it acceptable to serve us cold lasagne, cold pizza etc, one place we had to walk out off as this happened twice with the same dish.  None of the Spanish seemed to encounter the same problem so not sure if it was because we were English?

We decided to eat at the Hard Rock Cafe on the Saturday night as being a chain we knew we could be assured of 'warm food'.  Whilst waiting at the bar for a free table ( a 2.5 hr wait on a Saturday night, finally seated 11pm) we noticed the barmen were charging what they wanted for peoples drinks.  My husband ordered a beer and someone else ordered the same beer from a different barman and was charged an additional 20 cents, not much but it seems they do like to rip off the tourists in this place.

A final warning be very wary of pickpockets on Las Ramblas.  Before we went to Barcelona we were warned.  Whilst looking for an eatery on Friday we noticed a man and a woman following us everywhere we went and when we stopped they stopped.  I had my handbag attached to the front of my body and my husband had his wallet in his front pocket.  When we stopped and looked at them , they said ' Assistance?' and we walked away quickly in the opposite very lit direction.   This question is noted in our guide book as to what they ask if they think they are rumbled.  Did not feel very safe in the city after that experience and that was 2 hrs into our trip.  Would never go back to Barcelona.",5,2010,02,15
35,if you dont mind sleepless nights stay here,a birthday celebration trip ruined by the noise all night from the ferry  engines running nonestop and lorrys being loaded  on board if you are very lucky as we were you will hear all the ships tannoy announcements throughout the night as well. avoid premier room 646.we had booked four nights but left after two due to sleep depravation  on checking out reception advised us to stay in bed allday and rest not quite the reason we had visited barcelona for.,1,2010,01,28
35,perfect!!,"we stayed at the grand marina hotel for two nights in january. the journey took about 20 minutes from the airport and cost 25 euro. the service was exellent as soon as we got outof the taxi. we checked  in straight away even though we were early.
we stayed in a deluxe room and had the celebration package so we got a welcome drink  in the bar and champagne and chocolate strawberries in the room - perfect!
the hotel is at the front of the world trade center and in the center of the port, there were nearly always ships either side of the hotel- i had read in other reviews that the ships had caused some disturbance but we never heard a thing! our view from our room was amazing we had half sea and half land (room 707) the sky lift is directly in front of the hotel which is the only thing that lets the view down- this part of the sky lift is not in use anymore. breakfast is from 7-11 am and has the bigest range i have ever seen but not a lot of hot food only eggs boiled poached os scrambled and these have to be ordered.

this hotel was booked for a special occasion and we had a really lovely time !",5,2010,01,26
35,Find a great deal and stay here!,"We took advantage of a travelzoo top 20 deal.  120 euro got us breakfast and a superior room.  The rooms were amazing.  I'm not sure how the standard rooms are, but the superior rooms are draw-dropping.  The ceilings are high, the floors have a great wood floor, the showers are out of this world, the balcony is great, enormous sliding doors, and the rooms are huge.  The staff is extremely helpful and friendly.  The location is quite close to the ramblas and a nice 10 minute walk to the metro.

If you can find a great deal, I would certainly stay here.  Also, the breakfast buffet is great.  With a huge selection of cold and hot items, juices, cava, made-to-order eggs, etc.",5,2010,01,09
35,Great Hotel - Perfect location to visit the city,"No need to beat around the bush, this is a great hotel. Service is prompt and professional, though there is still room for improvement. The rooms are comfortable and very clean.  The hotel is located right across the street from Las Ramblas, which is THE main street of the city and an ideal point of departure for sightseeing. One comment on the negative side, maybe the hotel lacks a little charm but perhaps that’s just me. Overall, I will most certainly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona and looking for a great place to stay for a few days.",5,2010,01,05
35,Perfect location with the best view in town,"I cannot believe the negative views on here.  We absolutely loved this hotel and the view compared to others in the city is the huge bonus.  Hard beds? poor soundproofing?  Our 9 foot king in the huge Premier room on the 4th floor was very comfortable and we never heard anything fom above, below or from adjacent rooms.  The breakfast is one of the best I have ever seen in many years of world travelling.  Everything you could dream of immaculately presented and absolutely fresh produce. No expense has been spared with the materials used for fitting out the interior.  All sliding doors in the room were noticeably solid and top quality and the use of beautiful timber was very pleasing and almost ""old passenger ship"" style.  We also had the Travelzoo offer of 125 euros per  room including breakfast  which we thought to be amazing value",5,2009,12,30
35,Nice hotel and great location,"We independently booked a room at this hotel for a single-night post-cruise stay.  Of course, we debarked our chip early, caught the bus from the port to the Columbus Monument and hung out at the Maremagnum for a a couple of hours with some new friends we made on the cruise.  Around noon, we walked to the hotel to see about dropping off our luggage so that we can conduct some additional city exploring.  Surprisingly, the hotel allowed us to check-in early!  

The staff was great from check-in to check-out.  Very friendly, courteous, and multilingual (even the valets!).  We needed some additional Euros after our cruise and the hotel was able to convert USD to EUR with no transaction fees.  The desk staff was even able to order us a taxi to the airport for our early morning flight the next day.  The front desk was even considerate to call our room the next morning to make sure that we were awake and such, despite us not having ordered a wake-up call.  When we arrived downstairs, avalet was there to great us at the elevator and took our bags to the waiting taxi.

The rooms were HUGE with separate baths, closets, etc.  The hotel had free internet (at least landline, not sure about WiFi).  

The view from the room was a little disappointing.  Our room/patio only opened to a view of the WTC's courtyard.  

Overall, a great hotel and stay.",5,2009,12,18
35,Great location pre or post cruise,"Stayed at this hotel prior to a transatlantic crossing and thought it was an excellent choice for cruisers. The room we had was very spacious with a balcony and the breakfast buffet was great. 
I found a special rate of 125 Euro including breakfast on Travelzoo.
We walked everywhere and our cruise ship was a 5 minute cab ride. I highly recommend this property.",5,2009,12,14
35,Loved this hotel,"We booked the hotel for several purposes; it was close to the cruise ship, it was close to the Ramblas (approximately 2 blocks);  and the price.  We weren't disappointed!  We stayed three nights at the hotel, two before the cruise and one more when we returned from our cruise.  

Yes, the beds are hard--ok-very hard-but we had no problem falling asleep and staying asleep and did not have any aches or pains in the morning.  The bathroom was fantastic.  I loved the shower and jazuzzi.  

It was a great experience all around.  When we return to Barcelona, and I know we will, I will definitely book this hotel.",5,2009,12,06
35,Great hotel,"I've stayed at Grand Marina just for 3 days but can say that this hotel is great.
The staff is very polite, efficient and speaks on a lot of languages (on Russian too).
The hotel has great location, very close to Columbus monument and La Rambla.
The tourist bus of Barcelona also stops near the hotel, so if You want to discover the wonderful, magnificent sights of Barcelona, Grand Marina is wonderful place to stay at.
My room was large and clean with jacuzzi bath and the shower. 
So I recommend this hotel to all travelers.",5,2009,12,05
35,Fabulous,"Simply fabulous. The hotel rooms was big sized, with a huge bathroom. Bathroom had a separate shower area and a bathtub with jacussi.
When we reached the hotel, we were upgraded to a higher class of room because it was available. 

We spent a lot of time in the hotel because it was so nice. 
There was free wi-fi in the lounge.

The hotel was located very close to the main areas and the beach too.",5,2009,12,04
35,Not a luxury hotel but close to cruise ships,"This is a standard hotel (not 5 star along the lines of Four Seasons, more like 3.5 star like Hyatt).  The beds are VERY HARD, it is quite noticeable. A few things missing in the room such as alarm clock/radio and mixed amenities, some days they left soap, others they didn't, not what I would expect at a hotel of this category. It was very clean and non-smoking and with hardwood floors. The walls are thin, I could hear the person next door snoring. Also when they ran the whirlpool tub it sounded like a huge motor right in my room. 
There is no business center and unless you bring your own laptop to access wifi, you cannot go on the internet. I would not recommend this hotel for business travelers at all.
The restaurant was very expensive and so was the bar. No atmosphere and was empty all 4 nights I was there.  
Location is good if you are going on a cruise, otherwise it is not ideal. The walk to south Ramblas/Metro is approx. 10 minutes and not safe at night. There are also no nearby cafes or bars/restaurants other than the world trade center ones.  There are a few cafes for the world trade center nearby, open for breakfast/lunch and good for a coffee and croissant type of thing.I was lucky in having good weather and could walk, at night I had to take taxi for safety reasons, about 10 euros from most places. 
The staff was friendly and tried to be helpful but the concierge gave wrong directions a few times to do to restaurants and didn't provide good recommendations.
If you want to save on airport transport, take the bus (5 euros) to placa cataluyna and then taxi to hotel (7 euros).  Otherwise taxi is 25 euros and hotel car service is 35 euros.",3,2009,11,29
35,Great Hotel close to cruise terminal,"Very close to the cruise terminal – 2-3 mins cab ride.  5 mins walking distance to the La Rambla, Drassanes metro station & Port Vell for shopping & dining.  15 mins to El Prat Airport.   Hotel staff had excellent customer & professional service.  Stefan at the reception was very courteous & helpful.  Rooms were nice & big.  We were given a corner room facing the cruise terminal, so had a great view.   Free wi-fi in front of Concierge desk.  2 desktops for guests complimentary usage.  Hop-on & Hop-off bus has a stop right in front of the hotel.  So very convenient for those who wish to see all the tourist destinations.",4,2009,11,22
35,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel - worst sleep ever!,This hotel is situated in an absolutely fabulous location. It is approximately 20 minutes from the airport by taxi which cost 20 euro for two people and two suitcases. The location of the hotel is the real draw here. It is located on the marina with water on both sides and a 3 minute walk from Las Ramblas. The suites are very big with a seperate seating and tv area but don't even attempt to order room service or take anything from the mini bar unless you feel like being robbed! It cost 5 euro and 50 cent for a can of coke/fanta from the mini bar and a club sandwich from room service came in at 18 euro. Barcelona is full of wonderful places to eat so avoid the food in the hotel and save yourself a lot of money! The overall quality of the room was very good. Unfortunately the same can't be said for the bed. Definitely not suitable for anyone trying to get a quality night's sleep - hard as a rock and very painful on aching muscles. This is the one and only reason I wouldn't return to this hotel as everything else was great. Barcelona itself is fantastic and the location of the hotel really allows you to take it all in.,3,2009,11,20
35,"Great service, beautiful rooms, poor soundproofing and few views",Has everything except so poorly sound insulated that when ships dock you can hear talking from the ships. Not good for sleep. Unlike the Waterfront hotels in Cape Town with excellent engineering. Also most rooms have a very depressing view: best views given to offices.,4,2009,11,15
35,"Great Location!  Not bad, but unhelpful concierge","The title says it all.  We stayed here the night before a cruise.  The hotel is VERY close to the cruise ships and walking distance from Las Ramblas.  Very clean, nice rooms, nice front desk staff.  VERY VERY unhelpful concierge (wish I'd have gotten her name).  Iberia airlines had lost our luggage and she refused to help us translate in communicating with them.
The other reviews are right about the price of food here.  2 hamburgers $50.00!  take a walk across the stree and eat elsewhere.
If you don't use a concierge, I'd recommend this place.",3,2009,11,13
35,Grand Marina Hotel - Great View of Barcelona,"We stayed for 4 nights.  We checked in early after an overnight redeye from New York.  The hotel staff was very pleasant and we received a large room, great views of the city.  The bathroom was large as well with a wonderful set of accessories.  The hotel also is like a convention/conference center so there is a mix of business as well as leisure guests.

The hotel has a great restaurant.  We had a nice buffet and dinner was excellent.  The hotel delivered a bottle of cava to room the first night we arrived but we were so exhausted that we asked the hotel to keep chilled for the following night which they did along with chocolate strawberries

The hotel is at the end of large pier that has a tour bus stop out front that you can buy tickets to as well as lift to the main hills/tourist village above Barcelone.  The walk to Las Ramblas is about a half-mile walk.  The location is quiet but it is we did hear the heavy bass from a nightclub across the harbor at the shopping center.",5,2009,11,09
35,Luxury Treat with fabulous Suite and Views,"I found a ‘Romantic’  deal for 3 nights stay in one of the gorgeous Marina Suites for my husband's 60th birthday surprise. By no means cheap, but you get a lot for your money, in our case including breakfast (which is otherwise expensive). Our suite was stunning, with full seating and dining area, a huge bed in its own spacious 'room' , an efficient wardrobe partition (which included  ironing facilities ) and 'duo' bathroom with massage bath and basin in one part and large shower/ loo/bidet in separated area. The floor-to-ceiling glass 'walls' of our room looked out on 3 sides to city, port and marina, with what I would call a viewing terrace.   It felt like being on a huge ship - even down to the occasional smells and sounds of the cruiser dock on the other side of the hotel - but only if you had the window open.  Otherwise it was lovely to be removed from the city buzz.  The room could be totally darkened with good black-out curtains.  . The service and staffing was terrific; smart, polite and efficient. We were particularly impressed with Felipe, the concierge, who soon realised how much we enjoy seeking out good food and enthusiastically advised us on lots of fine eateries.   Sadly we do have three ‘niggles’;  (1)  the very hard bed;  I actually woke up several times with pins-and-needles!  My suggestion to the management would be to add soft 'toppers' to the existing mattresses, perhaps ‘to order’ like the lovely pillows?   (2)  the bar prices;  we only had one drink each at the bar (a beer and a vodka/tonic)  and the bill was 20€.   This is downright greedy!     (3)  the breakfast coffee;    I can only describe it as ‘thin’  in taste,  possibly it had been stewing in a  thermos pot  for too long;  I even thought it might be Instant…..  When there is so much delicious coffee available,  I think a 5 Star hotel should produce a  proper  Cafetiere or made-to-order Americanos.    Don’t let this put you off!  The Ramblas and Marina area are only a short walk away, the Barceloneta a good  but pleasant walk away,   and there are always Taxis right outside.  SD,  Bath, UK",5,2009,10,27
35,Mark this hotel for visit,"My husband and I have spent 6 sunny and wonderful days in Barcelona and booked this hotel.
The hotel is has a very good location, 5 minutes walk form La Ramabla and Porto Veil.
Be aware to request a room having a the view to Port Veil because otherwise you will have a room with the view in the inside court of the hotel. And this image is not so impressive as the port. We enjoyed a lot the view from our balcony, seeing every day the port full of life, with cruise ships coming and leaving, and Coulomb statue pointing out the Americas lands.
The hotel is clean nice and with a beautiful architecture, the staff is very professional and helpful. Please note that  only a part of the building is the hotel. The rest is a business center. The room had jacuzzi and it was very nice and warm and cosy. The air conditioning was working properly for that period of the summer.
On the top of the hotel there is a small pool, if you are a swimmer and prefer this instead of the sea.
Very closed to the hotel is a modern shopping center where are a lot of restaurants and terraces where you could eat the local specialties: las tapas, paella, sangria.
The prices are a rather high in this area, especially on La Rambla where all the tourists are walking by.
We did not have the breakfast booked when made the reservation and the breakfast price was rather expensive, even this is a 5* hotel. So we preferred to eat at the terraces near by.
In front of the hotel there is the tourist bus stop. It is a very good facility for the tourist. You can stop to every Barcelona's attractions and then get in with the same tickets.
Barcelona is a brilliant city, but do not visit it in August because the temperatures are hot. Starting 11.00 am until 11 p.m there is at least 30-35 Celsius degrees.
As top tourists' Barcelona's attractions: Sagrada Familia, Gaudi's architecture and buildings, Bari Gotic, Guell Park, The Science Museum (our favorite), Barcelona's soccer team stadium.
Quite disappointing was the Aquarium. It is too expensive and it is not so interesting as it should be comparing with the ones in Italy and Belgium.",4,2009,10,26
35,Good hotel but very expensive,"Based on other reviews I have read about the hotel and my own choosing that this hotel is very convenient for stay pre-cruise since you can get right to the cruise ship, unfortunately based on the experience, the trip to the port is not that fast, since it still requires quite a loop, so my next stay will not be based on this. If based on this sole reason this is a very expensive price of the hotel, in regards to all other aspects, there isn't much to the hotel, the location is nowhere walking distance, the amenities are nothing extra ordinary and there was nothing that gave this hotel a five star feeling.",3,2009,10,15
35,Very Disappointed,"We stayed at the Grand Marina Hotel for 3 nights after our Mediterranean Cruise. From our cruise ship I e-mailed and asked for transportation from the cruise port to the Hotel. They wrote me back and said they could provide the taxi and would charge it on my room bill....93 Euros!! We declined. When we arrived at the cruise port...we took our own taxi to the hotel and it was less the 8 Euros!! 
 The room was very large and we had no complaints about that. They would not bring us any ice...only room service woulddo that  at a very high price.The hallway carpet was filthy, with large spots and stains. The pool was small and the jacuzzi had no handrail or easy way to get in and out. We tried it only once and would not recommend that to anyone!
 We have traveled a lot in Europe and this was the first Hotel we ever stayed at in Europe that did NOT include the breakfast!  They offered a breakfast buffet for 28 Euros...we declined that and went to Las Rambles for all our meals.We also went to La Boqueria for a lot of meals...that was great.
 Everytime we asked the consigerige for directions...they pushed for us to take  a taxi. Myabe they get a kick back?? The area around the hotel is relatively safe. We asked a policeman and he said during the day it is fine, but he suggested us taking a taxi at night, which we did at a relatively low cost.
 The location was alright. It was in walking distance to Las Rambles and  near most of the sites we wanted to see. We also took the Metro...which was very easy to maneuver. Next time we go back we will difinately stay in a Hotel on Las Rambles itself. This is definately NOT what I would consider a 5 STAR Hotel.
I would not recommend this Hotel to anyone. It is not worth the money!!",3,2009,10,13
35,Great hotel for pre-cruise,"We stayed at the Grand Marina for 4 nights prior to boarding the Oceania Insignia for a Mediterranean cruise.  The hotel is comfortable, but our room was on the small side.  The hotel sits out on jetty and when our cruise ship arrived in port - the ship with less than 200 feet from our hotel room.

The hotels has a fantastic breakfast buffet with just about anything you might like  - the cost was 24 Euros per person - but if you pre-pay upon arrival they give you a special rate of 24 Euros.

The health club is hot and almost unusable and the pool is tiny.

The city tour buses stop right out in front of the hotel - I highly recommend this as a way to explore Barcelona.

When we checked out of the hotel our bellman brought out luggage right to the ship - no taxi, no hassle.",3,2009,10,12
35,"Ok, but some faults!x","This hotel is lovely, and is very clean and contemporary. my dad and i went last december, and we arrived in barceloa airport at about 9.00. By the time we had got the bus to te place de la catalunya, we looked in the el carte de ingles. then, we asked at a tourist information place, how to get to this hotel. we had to walk down all of the ramblas, where there were lots of dodgey people, an it was not safe! if i was there on my own i would have been soooo scared! I was just sooo lucky to have my dad there. there were pickpocets selling us flowers, and the car driers were mad! Its quite hard to find! We finally found it, then we checked in, it was really nice, nice service, and it was lovely. We got to our room, and as per usual, i had the winter cold! and i really needed a drink,and there was no source of anything! the minibar was wayy to dear, and the  tap water was un-drinkable. but luckily we had a token for a welcome drink n the bar! well, that Saved my day!!!! the hotel was very deserted, and there was only a few of us there! the breakfast was amazing! 
One other problem was, some people may see that it is not that far out of the town, but i have a flat foot, and walking around barcelona for three days, gave me alot of pain, and i could hardly walk the second day!
Lovely hotel, just dont arrive late at night!
We are going to barcelona again this december, and we are staying in the hesperia tower hotel!!",4,2009,10,10
35,lovely hotel disappointing pool area,"We arrived at the Eurostar after a short flight from Belfast in late September.  On arrival we were checked into our upgraded junior suites which where absolutely beautiful.  The hotel itself is a very easy walk to all the amenities.  When we wanted to relax and sunbath in the afternoons we found a severe lack of any staff and sunbeds, and although there were quite a few people around the sundeck area the bar was closed.  The pool area could definitely be a little more welcoming.  The bar staff obviously work on 2 speeds slow and stop as when we ordered drinks eventually it then took a long time for the waiter to deliver them.
All in all and nice clean central hotel that needs a few details ironed out.",4,2009,10,09
35,Great location Nice staff,"Hotel is in a great location, right off Las Ramblas. Convenient to sites and cruise ship docking location.",4,2009,10,08
35,Expensive but lovely hotel,"Stayed in this 5* hotel as we found a half price deal on ""lastminute.com"".

The standard room we stayed in was ok but nothing different from a 'Thistle' hotel here in the UK.  A nice touch was the complimentary dressing gown and slippers provided.  There was also an iron and ironing board and hairdryer in every bedroom.  I was disappointed there were no tea/ coffee making facilities in the room as I am partial to a brew when I wake in the morning and made a suggestion on their feedback form.

Internet access was free which was a bonus as quite a lot of hotels here in the UK charge for this service.

The restaurant and bar services were expensive.  We had a last night drink in the bar and for 1 pint of beer and 1 vodka and coke we were charged 18 Euros.

The hotel's position was also a plus for us as we wanted to stay fairly close to The Rambla and this was about a 10 min walk if that.  If you like shopping it was very close to the marina shopping centre.

Views from the hotel were good especially if you like cruise liners.  The hotel had a pool on the 8th floor which was small but there was also a hot tub in the gym area.  The sunbathing area was ok but sadly lacking in sun beds in the evening as most people seemed to sight see during the day and chill by the pool early evening.

Despite the above we had a really good time and would recommend this hotel if you manage to get a good price as you need to be pretty well off to pay the full price and eat and drink here.",4,2009,10,01
35,"Fantastic staff, wonderful service, beautiful location","Arrived in Barcelona on Monday for a 4 night break, and boy; did I wish that I had booked a longer stay! I had read a couple of reviews about Eurostar Grand Marina, and decided that everything looked consistent with their own website and so would not be in for any bad surprises. On arrival, check-in was very speedy, and on entering our room, the panoramic views of the sea port was the first thing I saw.....I was gobsmacked....as it was absolutely breathtaking. Three sides of the hotel are surrounded by water so I’m guessing that all rooms are subject to similarly stunning views.

Located in the Port Vell area and just a 10 minute stroll from the beginning of La Rambla (add another 10mins to get to Merccat de la Boqueria- food market, and another 5-10 to get the Cathedral).

This hotel is definately well balanced to meet the needs of both business travellers and holidayers, as it was located right next door to the World Trade Centre Barcelona, though also situated within easy walking distance to all the action.  

The room was spacious with the décor being tastefully understated, whilst still maintaining 5* sophistication. Food and drink were quite pricey, though little touches made it seem worth it e.g. live piano music in the bar & lounge, complimentary Japanese cracker bites with cocktails etc. The gymnasium was well equipped and very modern, with an indoor hot-tub, sun loungers, and small outdoor pool in the same area.

The staff were extremely helpful, with an impeccable level of service being delivered by all! They would always go the extra mile to ensure that nothing less than a 5* service was being delivered. It was my birthday on the last day and Chris from room serive added so many extra touches to our usually in-room spread overlooking the sea including chocolate dipped strawberries served on a black slate tile. 

There was a taxi rank directly outside the hotel doors, ordinary bus stops 1 min away, and open-top guided tour buses that stopped literally 2 minutes from the hotel. The guided open-topped tour buses offered transportation to all parts of Barcelona- North , South, East & West (blue, red, & green routes) with stops at all of the sight-seeing hot spots directly en-route. I would highly recommend this as it ensured that a greater area of Barcelona could be covered between visiting the tourist destinations of your choice. It cost approx €20 per person for 1 full days unlimited use of all 3 routes; hopping on and off as and when. We took it to get to many places including: - Parc Güell, La Sagrada Familia, Casa Batllo to name but a few. 

Barcelona is a wonderful city drenched in culture, mind-blowingly beautiful architecture and delicious gastronomic delights, and staying at Eurostar Grand Marina was the icing on the cake. I will definitely be returning to Barcelona next year and will stay at Eurostar Grand Marina!",5,2009,09,25
35,Great Service,"We had booked another hotel, but they were literally flooded out the evening we arrived.  They arranged for us to stay at the Grand Marina Hotel and we were very, very happy there.  The hotel is centrally located on the waterfront and close to everything.  Best, the hotel honored our original room rates which was amazingly nice of them.  In all, they saved our week vacation to Barcelona from becoming a nightmare. Thank you, thank you, thank you!",5,2009,09,23
35,Quite the disappointment,"We stayed here for a nice weekend in the city. The service was extremely slow and sloppy. Ordering a drink in the bar when it was almost empty still took 8 minutes and then another 8 minutes for them to make it.  In general the staff made the impression they would rather be somewhere else than working here.

Location was also not optimal, as you are kind of in the centre but on top of the world trade centre and next to the industrial port. So not a lot of holiday feeling there. The pool on top was a disappointment aswell, really small, dirty water.

The building itself inside and the furniture was quite nice. But still that does not make it a 5-star hotel.",2,2009,09,17
35,Nice hotel!,"The hotel was excellent in a very central location. General hotel decoration was very stylish and modern and extremely good upkeep. The room was also modern and clean with a balcony looking over to La Rambla. Great location, but a little difficult to find in the car as there didnt appear to be any signs for the hotel and it didnt come up on the GPS. Unusual in that we were able to see several large cruise liners docked just alongside the hotel and the cable car to a hilltop viewpoint was also right outside the hotel.One downside was that the hotel bar drinks were overpriced and we felt that they should have been lower priced for guests.",4,2009,09,09
35,Excellent Service,"The hotel has excellent location, about 1km walk to most of the nice areas and restaurants (about 3 km to the beach). The rooms are large and nice, HOWEVER the wood floors shouldn't be in a 5* Hotel because of the noise, especially if the guest in the room above you is wearing heels. The pool was very very small and not enough room for sunbathing. The service and concierge are excellent. If you really have to take a taxi (highly not recommended) do not ask the doorman to call one for you as they'll add 3 Euros just for that, just wait 2 minutes and they'll come (even at 5am they'll come without phoning).",4,2009,09,08
35,Modern hotel in an interesting location,"Been to Barcelona many times happy to stay in a slightly different location near water.

Travelling after work and having been delayed by poor airline service we arrived at 1am, stodgy welcome , maybe the receptionist was also tired... Check in took a full 5 minutes or more for no obvious reason, there was no queue. I think the computer may have been blamed at one stage. Other staff encountered were fine.

Nice room with a view of an inner courtyard and also subject to noise from a bar/club. Everything in the room fine liked the bathroom especially.

Remember most of the building is not the hotel but part of the World Trade centre.

Learned to like the location, right there for the waterfront, ferry terminal and cruise ships and near the bottom of the Ramblas.

We didn't eat at the hotel. 

Nice roof  terrace with a small pool which was inexplicably closed on our visit and great views.

I feel it is slightly dear in relation to the Barcelona market as a whole. Would stay there again but have never stayed in the same hotel here twice just because there are so many good ones in all sorts of locations and I like variety.",4,2009,09,06
35,Excellent hotel,"My husband took me here to celebrate my birthday weekend and we had a brilliant time.  The hotel suite was spacious and clean, the staff were very friendly and the hotel location was perfect as only a short walk to all the local attractions. There was a good choice of food at breakfast and the rooftop pool was nice to cool off in after a days sightseeing.  Would recommend this hotel and stay here again if returned to Barcelona.",5,2009,08,27
35,"Fantastic hotel, service, location - everything!","What a brilliant experience!

If i struggle, the only negative thing i can find to say is that i would have liked coffee/tea facilities in the room. Other than that it was perfect - quiet, spacious room, lovely bathroom with jacuzzi whirlpool, out of the centre so quiet, well positioned (10 minute walk) for restaurants, shops, beach etc.  Helpful and friendly staff, spoke English very well, air con worked, panoramic views from the room of the port, and amazing views of the whole city from the roof, leisure pool and bar area.  Just wonderful.",5,2009,08,14
35,Stunning Hotel,"Truly lovely hotel, beautiful position with easy access to lots of sights etc.

The hotel itself is decorated beautifully the service was out of this world, we booked a junior suite which was spacious with lovely panaramic views across the marina.

The roof top pool and jacuzzi had gorgeous views over the city

Perfect for a romantic getaway",5,2009,08,01
35,Great Hotel... 10 Minutes for Las Ramblas,"A nice hotel.. The rooms were very nice, somewhat small but this should be expected in Europe.   The service was great and the concierge was very helpful.

It is not far from Las Ramblas, and the sightseeing bus picks up right in front of the hotel.",4,2009,07,27
35,Fabulous hotel with wonderful service!,"This hotel is one of the best we've ever stayed at and we travel extensively. From the expansive and delicious buffet for breakfast (and I'm not a big fan of any buffet) to the service at every level to the wonderfully knowledgable and imaginative concierge Phillipe, I can recommend  and compliment without reservation. If you're traveling to Barcelona, don't miss a great hotel experience.",5,2009,07,26
35,great stay with Prestigia.com,"I'm so happy to spend a wonderfull stay in Grand Marina. It was a heven, romantic place with all what a young couple will expect.Profesionnal consultants in PRestigia who dealt seriously with each detail of your enquiry... I'll book again for sure

35,Good Hotel,"Pleasant stay without any problems. Nice personel- Amazing location near Las Ramblas to where you can just walk. find many restaurants and some shopping. As Business hotel that it is could have wireless as well in the bedrooms.
If I am back to Barcelona for businnes porposes I will stay again.",5,2009,07,13
35,"Overall, wonderful stay!","Overall, staying at Eurostars Grand Marina was a lovely way to start our trip in Barcelona.  The hotel was beautiful, the room was great and the location was wonderful.  Negatives include: no internet in rooms (although free in lobby), VERY expensive food, and the pool was pretty tiny (and closed early.)  I recommend walking to the port or LaRambla for food/drinks as in hotel, it was beyond acceptably priced.",4,2009,07,08
35,"A lovely hotel, slightly inconvenient location","We stayed here prior to taking a cruise, thinking we would simply be able to walk to the ship. That's not the case, but it's only a short taxi ride around to the other side of the wharf area and there are plenty of taxis available.
As`others have written, there are some good options for reasonably priced meals in the small cafes and wine bar at the rear of the hotel, both take away and eat in. You need to be aware though that these are not open at the weekend.
The hop on hop off buses leave from the front of the hotel, but I would recommend you use the blue bus line, not the orange Barcelona Tours one. While both cover virtually the same destinations, the orange one is one long loop with less frequent arrivals. the other has about three intersecting shorter loops.
The staff at the hotel were charming and very helpful, the rooms was beautiful and so was the view, but i think next time I'd probably pay a bit less and stay where I could walk more easily to a variety of restaurants and acitivities.",4,2009,07,08
35,Fine Hotel,"My wife and I celebrated our 50th anniversary with a cruise out of Barcelona and stayed one day before and three days after the cruise in this hotel. On arrival we were give a complimetary upgrade to a suite (possibly as a result of my email asking about special rates for the occasion although they do not seem to respond to email). It was a wonderful experience, and we deliberately stayed over a Saturday evening to experience the opera singers performance in the lounge --- it was worth it!  We enjoyed the sleek modernism of the hotel and its rooms, the high magnification shaving mirror was very useful!  The breakfast buffet, while pricey, was the best we had experienced anywhere in the world.  We found the staff to be friendly and courteous, and very helpful --- and we had to bug them often about the card keys to our room which operated intermittently for some reason.  The hotel is very convenient to the piers and to Las Ramblas, all the amenities of the waterfront parks, to the cable car to Montjuic and the parks and citadel, and to scores of downtown museums.  It has a nice pool area on the roof, which was in use even though not formally open yet in April-early May. We were allowed to store in our Frigo bar food purchased in the little shops in the Convention hall plaza just outside.  We had a wonderful time and this hotel and its staff had a lot to do with that.  We do not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.",5,2009,07,04
35,Great Hotel & Location!,"We were there for 4 nights on holidays. The hotel itself is sumptuous and is part of the World Trade Centre complex: the public areas are very nice and the hotel's restaurant Aire de Mare offers lovely Mediterranean dishes.  We loved it!  

On the roof there is an outdoor pool not huge however on the terrace there are many sun beds as well a nice pool bar.  The sea views from there are fantastic.

Our Premiere room at the 4th floor was extremely specious with lovely wooden floors and a separate dressing room.  The bathroom was large with both shower and bathtub.
We also had a small balcony with panoramic views of the City and the Port Vell.

The location of the hotel is nice as well. It is practically on the sea at the marine station, and 10-minute walk away from the famous Las Ramblas where lots of restaurants and entertainments are located.

This is the second time we have visited Barcelona.  The first time we stayed at the ""Ritz-Carlton Arts Hotel"" which to my opinion is the best hotel in Barcelona, but this time we stayed at the ""Grand Marina Hotel"" as we were attracted by the unique architectural stracture of this hotel and its location. 

Generally we had a lovely time at this hotel and we have founded very practical been very close to the city (easy for shopping or going to restaurants).",5,2009,06,19
35,"Horrific experience! Do not stay here, it is not safe!","Do not stay here, it is not safe!  You can expect a strange man to enter your locked room during the night and rummage through your stuff.  I stayed here in August 2008 with my boyfriend for a long weekend trip.   We had a superior suite so there was a large door separating the bedroom from closet/bathroom etc.  On the second night, I was awoken to hear someone moving stuff around in our room. I thought it was my boyfriend so I went to back to sleep.  However, a few minutes later when I realised that there was a stranger in the room we got up and the man quickly left the room.  When I informed reception of the man in our room he said it was a maintenance problem in the room next door and it was a member of staff that had made a mistake. This does not make sense as the receptionist had to key the wrong number onto the card and hoew did this 'maintenance man' coincidently know that he had the key to our room?  Reception were very unhelpful and seemed to be angered by my questioning this man entering our locked room in the middle of the night.  When we returned home, I sent an e-mail stating what had happened and how upset I was over the whole situation and how rude and unhelpful the reception staff had been, and as of yet I have not received a reply.  The whole experience was very traumatic and the hotel staff did nothing to ease the situation.  My only regret is that I did not call the police and get them to speak to the man in question. So unless you want a man letting himself into your room while you are sleeping, doing God knows what, stay away from this hotel as I would not want anyone else going through that ordeal.",1,2009,06,14
35,Expensive but lovely hotel - great pool area - near to las ramblas,"I chose the gand marina after reading the reviews on trip advisor and getting a good rate on last minute.com We stayed on the sixth floor and the rom was to a high standard but pretty much a stadard room but you got slippers and a robe and there was an iron and proper board which was a great help. 

It was about a 10 minute walk to las ramblas but very easy to find. Also the tube station was just at the end of the ramblas as well. The tourist bus stops just outside the hotel which is good - takes a long time to go round the whole of Barcelona but drops off outside each of the main attractions - better than having to walk from the tube station which we did on first day!

The hotel has really nice facilities and the roof top pool is small but the beds are really comfy and the view is lovely - over the harbour and you can see all the cruise ships docked. The gym is good and there is free water and apples for all. The bar is extremely expensive 19 Euros for half a larger and a glass of sangria!! OMG!! So we only had drinks there one night.  

Use the concierge on the first floor as he is a mind of info and told us a lovely restaurant which we would never have found. Very spanish!",4,2009,06,14
35,Excellent Modern Hotel,"We stayed here recently for one night prior to joining a cruise out of Barcelona.  We found the staff extremely helpful.  They gave us rooms upon arrival even though we were way early for normal check in.  They also extended our checkout for a bit so that we could go straight to the ship without storing luggage.

The hotel is a modern business oriented facility though its location at the foot of Las Ramblas makes for a convenient location for exploring the older sections of town for tourists.  The HOHO bus has a stop right outside.

The price is not cheap, but the American dollar isn't what it used to be so nothing in Europe is cheap.  We paid roughly $225 which isn't that bad.  Food prices were on the business oriented side but there are cafes just behind the hotel with more reasonable prices allowing a traveler to skip the breakfast buffet which made no sense for us as we were heading for 2 weeks of excess food on a cruise.

The rooms were reasonably spacious, well appointed with comfortable beds and clean.   The soap provided was in strange little plastic packages but if that's all there is to quibble over, they get a A+.",5,2009,06,12
35,Perfect,"Although the hotel staff was not able to check me in early, they did check my bags while I toured. The people at the desk were very courteous and helpful.

I returned to a very pleasant surprise. My room was absolutely beautiful and over looked the Marina. I had views from many angles in the room as it seemed that there were windows everywhere. My room was a very good size and featured a large desk , double bed, chairs as well as a flat screen TV. It was extremely well appointed and sparkling clean.

After a hard day of touring, the beautiful jetted marble tub was a welcome reprieve. The bathroom was huge and featured a separate shower stall, bidet as well as the jetted tub. There was a generous supply of toiletries as well.

The closet space was generous and of course, there was a safe in the room.

There was a very nice wine bar that featured a pianist for a relaxing after dinner drink.

The hotel is extremely well located, especially if you are departing or arriving on a cruise ship. The Hop on Hop off bus stops very close to the front door. Also, you are a very short walk away from the bottom of Las Ramblas.

This hotel is definitely 5 star and I would stay there again.",5,2009,06,12
35,GREAT LOCATION BUT STAFF NEED MOE TRAINING,"We felt that the hotel staff  was anti-American. They needed more training in service and information regarding the city sites. We were given direction to the Monastery but was not adviced about the length of time or the connecting trains to get. Recommendations for the restaurants were inadquate.
The hotel is clean, new and the rooms are large as in most USA hotels.",3,2009,04,30
35,Great hotel overall!,"The Grand Marina Hotel is a great hotel in Barcelona for many reasons.  First, it is in a super location right near the port with ocean views all around you (although not viewable for any rooms).   My wife and I arrived in Barcelona at 6 a.m. and were able to check in to a room right away so that we could sleep.  Everyone speaks English at the hotel and they are very accomodating!  Our bags were moved into our room promptly and the room was VERY large and clean!   The hardwood floors all throughout are a very nice touch.  The bathroom was large and modern with marble floors and granite countertops.   It had nice condiments (toothbrush, paste, soaps, creams, etc.).    We had a room with two double-beds which were joined to form a Queen.   The biggest negative of this hotel is that the bed was not comfortable at all.   The mattress was way too stiff and felt like a rock.   On the plus side, the sheets were good quality and you can pick from several pillow options.   The hotel is only a 15 minute cab ride from the Barcelona airport and you can walk just a few blocks (10 minutes) and you are in Las Ramblas and right in the middle of all the fun action.   On a side note, I highly recommend dining at the restraurant ""Aqua"" nearby.   Take a cabe ride there and order the breem fish.  It is unbelievably tastey!    Cheers!",5,2009,04,22
35,Beautiful Hotel in the heart of the action,We stayed here 2 nights March 27-29 2009 and were given a upgrade to bigger room and an early check in at 9am.After a long flight it was great to get to room for a quick shower so we could enjoy this incredible city as soon as possible.The hotel is first class and very modern we got the best rate on hotwire.com and checked rates until 2 days before stay for best rate.It ended up costing less than many 3 star hotels in our search.location is 5 minute walk to las ramblas.and is very convienient to the beautiful port area.,5,2009,04,16
35,Overrated for the price,"This hotel doesn't come across as a 5-star at all.  Room is smaller compared to even cheaper hotels in town and doesn't have a lot of storage space. Decor is modern but a lot of hotels in Barcelona has modern decor and this hotel certainly doesn't stand out.    We were also put off by a few other things, such as the lopsided mattress, the stained walls, mildew in the bath tub, thermostat that doesn't seem to work.   The view we got is the city with partial view of the harbor, which is nice, but there is also the cable car tower right in front.  The business center is basically a 2-computer little corner by the concierge, though the same area provides free wi-fi.  The only thing outstanding about the hotel are probably the location which is only a short walk from La Ramblas.",3,2009,03,22
35,Truly 5 star,"Stayed at the hotel for 5 nights with my partner and absolutely loved it, arrived at 11.00am but i was still able to check in, i had booked a junior suite room which is quite a big size room, bathroom includes a bath jacuzzi/spa and shower, the room itself consists of three rooms, a lobby room, a seating room. and of course the bedroom all of which were adequate enough sizes.

The staff are very friendly, helpful and have well spoken English, the concierge helped us with places to go i.e. restaurants, activities, museums and general sight seeing.

overall i would say my stay at the hotel was very pleasurable and i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in a good hotel which is local to the main district (La Rambla), i would definitely stay in this hotel again on my next visit to Barcelona.",5,2009,02,11
35,Barcelona,"We stayed in Barcelona for the New Year at the Grand Marina hotel which is classed at a five star hotel. Quite frankly I have stayed in better three star. Hard beds, air conditioning not working, no tea and coffee and noisy. Certainly not value for money. 
Barcelona is a typical tourist city which does not give value for money and on top of that it is plagued by thieves. Our friend had this  wallet stolen by a well practiced gang on the Ramblas.",2,2009,02,10
35,"The great, the good and not so good","Stayed for 3 nights 29 Dec to 1st Jan 2009
Greats
Staff at hotel friendly and welcoming
Room and bathroom - modern, clean, nice balcony
Beds large and for us comfortable 
Goods
Large airy room - good climate controls
room service food quick and efficient - try club sandwiches - Yum

Not so good
No tea / coffee facilities in room - coffee 4/5 euros per cup!
Only 1 bar - expensive  G&T = 12 euro + beer 7 euro a bottle
Breakfast OTT - up to 33 eruo per person - go out many places along Rambla
New Year hotel party - 198 euro per person for dinner - to encourage you to join hotel put 50% extra on room service costs- we went out - plenty of places with availability 
TV limited - movies 16.95 each - 
JUST A TIP whilst in Barcleona- Be vigilent after dark - we just left rest at 11.30 on New Years eve, was on a busy main road, and was hailing a taxi when 3 guys tried to mug us - old trick of dropping a ticket in front of you and trying to pick it up whilst pulling you down to ground and 2 others trying to pick pockets - thankfully my husband saw it coming and he is a big guy, also  luck was on our side and  taxi pulled in just after it kicked off - this time nothing stolen and no one physically hurt .....!",3,2009,01,04
35,Luxury? I don't think so.,"OK, this hotel provides all the amenities of a good 4*: very clean rooms, comfortable beds, nice breakfast, designed lobby. The price is rather of a 5*. But I'm not sure I felt anything special to be called luxury in it, if luxury means perfection and a bit more.
 
The reservation website of Grand Marina is terrible: they turned our booking of a package in a normal (and even more expensive) fee. When asking to the reception, they asked me a copy of the confirmation mail, which is a bit rude for a ""5* Grand Luxury"" (we had to go to the business center, check my mails, go down to the reception etc...). And when coming back in the evening and asking if everything was OK , the only apologies we received was ""no problem, the package you paid included a bottle of cava, so we'll bring it"". How romantic!",2,2008,12,19
35,just ok and expensive,"stayed for long weekend,hotel just ok,not good not bad .staff very good and nothing is to much trouble.but very expensive to have a drink and unwind here,decore ok,very modern if that is what you like.breakfast very good but be down early or not much left.location is the best thing about hotel and dont be fooled by picture of swiming pool,it is just the size of a large bath.
but overhaul not bad",3,2008,12,18
35,Fabulous experience,"Arrived 10.30 am and obviously the room was not ready but we left our bags and we asked to return at 2.00pm which we did and the room was still not ready.  We waited another half an hour and the lovely receptionist came over and apologised profusely and offered us room 715 which was a far superior room to the one we had booked.  It was just gorgeous. Enormous with amazing views even from the bed,when the huge expanse of curtains were drawn back.

The breakfast was one of the best ever, and the staff were wonderful - didnt have to ask for a thing as they were there to look after every whim.

Didnt eat dinner in the hotel as it was dreadfully expensive but would love to go back again if we could afford the better room.  I think the room we booked through hotelconnect would have been quite a small one overlooking the Trade Centre, but this time we struck lucky and since have been back to Barcelona but have only gazed at the hotel from one of the bars, and the size of the room we stayed in still amazes me.",5,2008,12,08
35,Not loving the Grand Marina,"Our second time in Barcelona, previously we had stayed at the H10 Montcada and quite enjoyed it. This time around we got what we thought was a great deal and chose to stay on the water. 

We're still here as I write this, but are thinking of cutting our reservation short perhaps to take a train to explore more of Spain.

I can see why those about to board a ship would choose this hotel, as it's literally on the pier where you would board your ship.

The hotel design is cool and contemporary, but this is where the love stops.

It's the little things that are driving me nuts. Our room in on the 7th floor (of 8) and we've got a great view with a little tiny balcony that looks out to the city. I really liked this until night came and the winds changed. The sliding doors to the balcony don't seem to close correctly, so you get this sporadic wind shrieking as you try to sleep. Perhaps this is something that only happens in the winter?

The temperature controls in the room seem useless. No matter how I set it, it seems to jump back to 20 Celsius.

The only clock in the room is actually part of the flat panel TV. Once you shut off the TV, the clock can no longer be seen.

We were welcomed on arrival with a small plate of chocolates and some bottled water. Lovely. But for a 5-star luxury hotel, it would be nice if they would drop off a bottle of water every day. The only alternative is the min-bar's teeny-tiny 330ML bottles - that cost 4 Euros each.

We had wine glasses in the room on the first day as well, but those seem to have disappeared.

I'm dying to find out what happens with the bathroom amenities today. We don't seem to be getting anything replenished and are down to one tiny bar of soap that we keep passing between the shower and the sink. It literally feels like the hotel is saying - you've used up your allotment, time to check out.

On the bright side, we did partake in the morning buffet on our second day (not included in our package). It was really lovely. But unless you're boarding a cruise ship, or maybe if it's the middle of summer; I'd choose differently.",2,2008,12,03
35,Ideal location,"Stayed at Grand Marina for 4 nights for a long weekend and found it to be in an ideal location for visiting Barcelona.The hotel has very simplistic decor  but  as the design is based on ship this could be expected. We booked a suite on a romantic package- B & B basis with champagne and strawberries. As breakfast is about 40 euros the package is really worth looking at and great value for money. Buffet breakfast was lovely with lots of choice. Our suite was very nice indeed with all the usual 5 star frills.Hotel is in great location and the city hop on hop off bus stops outside so thats a bonus for sight seeing.Most shops ect are within walking distance. The hotel is at the end of a pier and the view  of Barcelona from the roof / sundeck is amazing and unrivalled. Yes the hotel is not priced for budget travel but what you get is great accomodation, great location and great service. Definetly worth a stay.",5,2008,12,02
35,"Nice Hotel, Good Location","Spent 5 nights in Barcelona, wanting to see the sights and stay at upscale hotel at a reasonable price. If you are looking for European Old World elegance, this is not for you. If you are looking for a modern, clean, better hotel, that is on the water, close to La Rambla,  this hotel is for you. At $176 US, Priceline awarded us with a stay at a comfortable hotel. Arriving on Saturday evening after a full day of traveling, and a layover in Madrid, we pleasantly greeted at the reception desk and given a very nice room overlooking a not so nice office building. We were offered complimentary glasses of Cava in the lounge. Being it was Saturday, we were lucky to see that the lounge featured Opera night, which showcased four very good performers. We ordered some tapas, an additional drink and called it a night. The prices were in line with what you would expect at a better hotel. Not outrageous by any means.

The room was nice, bathroom had a jacuzzi, but the bed was a little hard. With all better hotels now offering plush bedding, we were surprised. 

The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to the top of La Rambla. We are walkers and found we were able to walk to many of the areas most tourists would want to see. La Boqueria a short walk on La Rambla is great way to start your day and load up snacks for the day ahead. The On and Off Tour Bus stops by the hotel. I suggest if you are staying a few days, to get the 2-day pass.  It will take you to the places that are too far to walk to.

Now for the best part of the hotel...Felipe, the concierge. Felipe was like a local tour guide for us. He advised where to go, where to eat, and how long to spend at each site. He even advised us where to rest, take out our snacks we bought earlier, and just take in life. Felipe made sure to ask us, on our return from sightseeing, how our day went. If a 5 star hotel is based on services, Felipe might be the reason (maybe the only reason) this is a 5 star hotel. 

We would recommend this hotel as a good place to stay for seeing the sights.",4,2008,11,19
35,"Good, if not expensive base","I didn't read any reviews before but probably wouldn't have changed my decision anyway. Yes, I do agree that the hotel doesn't have a lot going on - it is really a business hotel, however, it was classy, clean, efficient & decorated to a good standard. Location is a little wander to las ramblas or la barcleneta, but actualy a nice walk to build up an appetite or walk off a meal.

One thing to look out for though are the bar prices. €17 for two beers is pretty steep! Also, as it is a little out of the way, cabs, on a friday or saturday night round 10pm when you want to go out to eat are in short supply so be prepared to walk or queue early.

Staff great, nice hotel, yes pricey, but no real complaints.

enjoy!",4,2008,11,17
35,Excellant hotel,"We flew out the day before our cruise and stayed at the wonderful Eurostars Gran Marina (£173 on eBookers).  The cab from the airport was €26.  It is a very modern building - not very attractive to be honest, but inside it is very 'funky'.  The room was large with a great bathroom (always a monitor for me!). We were offered a complimentary glass of champers which we did not decline.   We strolled into town for dinner - it is probably 10 mins to the foot of the Ramblas if that. Prices have certainly gone up with the rise of the € – tapas and a bottle of wine at Teller de Tapas in the old town was €70.   Back at the hotel we stopped for a nightcap, we slept well, and woke to find a cruise ship docked right next door (unfortunately this was not the one we were on this time!).  There is an office complex attached to the back of this hotel, we stopped at a cafe there for breakfast - freshly squeezed orange juice and a pain au raisin (not very Spanish) for just €5.   Checked out and caught a cab to our cruise ship over the big bridge.   We were very happy with this hotel and would happily stay there again.",4,2008,11,03
35,I Liked It...,"The location was very close to our ship we were going to board the next day.  Unfortunately, it's not close to many city attractions, however, got a taxi to Parc Guell and it only cost 15 Euros.  Well worth it.  It was a good distance, but the ease of the taxi and the sights along the way are spectacular. 

The room was very elegant, clean and worth the price.  Check the photos. Both from within and looking out of the room.

If you don't mind the location--and can afford it, I'd say stay here.

One negative.  The concierge, although very helpful and nice, recommended ""El Noe"" Restaurant.  Within walking distance.  There were many restaurants in the area and while this one appeared charming--the waiter over charged us.  Incidently we took a taxi there and the taxi driver was lost as hell...again, the hotel was great--just watch where you go from there.",4,2008,10,28

Bathroom huge seperate shower that had 6 heads, bidet, then double doors to jacquzzi bath and double sinks,bathrobes slippers toiletries etc.Iron plus board,safe flat screen tv huge bed, well stocked mini bar very dear but we just got our fizz and beers from supermarket and put them in there and took everything else out. 
Excellent turn down service and room was spotless.
Breakfast was included in the price, ok if you like cereals,fruit,cooked breakfast, omlettes, meats and cheeses,pancakes,so many pastries and cakes oh and cava and strawberries, thre list goes on the best brekkie we have ever had!
Yes the  bar was expensive but 4 opera singers made up for it.
A real positive experience in a plush hotel just beautiful.",5,2008,10,28
35,nice accomodations but not nice policies,"Grand Marina was a nice hotel, very modern and European in design and good location.  The location was on the water, a short walk from La Rambla.  Very quiet.  However, had a problem on checkin.  I had booked a room with 2 twin beds for myself and 2 children.  On checkin they insisted that I upgrade to a more expensive room and pay extra for another bed even after I insisted that we didn't need 3 beds.  They said it was their 'politics' and I didnt have any choice.  This cost me an additional 100 Euros per night!  Then the concierge was very demeaning and condescending to my children, kept saying they would hate everything there was to do, I must  spend 12 days in Barcelona, why would I want to go to Montseratt??? How absurd and then made sure to point out all the Mcdonalds on the map for the entire time, even after I told him I would not be going to McDonalds.  On top of that, he told me I would be mugged or pickpocketed if I took a purse with my anywhere in the city.  Needless to say, my children were very put off with Spain within the first hour.  I must say that the trip was fine after that despite the first few hours.

Other than that, I liked the location and the rooms were very modern and clean.",3,2008,10,28
35,bar prices extorionate - even dick turpin wore a mask!,"not a 4 star hotel, the hotel has no soul. the only saving grace were the staff who were very pleasnat and efficent. after we check out we retired to the bar to await our departure for the airport and ordered 4 local beers 'san miguel'. We were presented with a bill for €28  ($50), an absoulte rip off. We quereid the bill with the waitress 'surely there was a mistake'. no mistake. considering the bar in the conference center  in the same complex at the back  of the hotel sold the exact same beer a €1.50 per bottle this represented a +400% mark up. It completely spoiled what was a plesant enough stay a the hotel.  Would not recommend the hotel to anyone based on this.",2,2008,10,19
35,good good good,got a great discount thro travelzoo 50%off .cant beat the location .forget the ship noise your sleep thro it go go go,5,2008,10,17
35,good hotel,Overall we had a good experience at this hotel however must say facilities like gym swimming pool etc. are not 5 star standard.       This hotel would be ideally suited for people visiting the city for 2/3 days [ city bus tour drops you right outside ] or if boarding one of the large ships that tour the med [ again just outside entrance ].   I also saw a lot of corporate delegates working rather then on holiday. Breakfast was good and staff helpfull with directions and general questions . Will stay here again hopefully the hotel facilities will be improved. Mr Mauro Pettinelli.,5,2008,10,16
35,nice hotel,"Stayed at hotel for only one night before taking cruise.
Arrived at hotel early at 11 am but reception managed to find 3 rooms early as i had requested so were able to book in which i was impressed with.
All the staff at the hotel were helpful and friendly.The only down fall i found was the price of the restaurant which we found very expensive for an evening meal, but the service was excellent. 
The hotel is a short walk to the bottom of Rambals approx 5 mins.
The hotel is right next to the cruise terminal, which was one of the reasons for staying at this hotel, however the royal caribbean terminal is over the other side of the port and is to far to walk and will require a taxi with suit cases about 12-15 euros. Some other cruise companys do dock next to the hotel with smaller ships.
The hotel staff were happy for the party to return the following week and leave our luggage at the hotel for approx 6 hours untill are evening flight.

Overall a very nice hotel but eat out if you can.",4,2008,10,16
35,"Great views, fine rooms but too many problems","This hotel is impressive in scale but soul less in character. Arriving a 10.00 pm, I was escorted to my room by a charming manager who explained how everything worked. A fine plate of freshly prepared fruit awaited me. The view of Barcelona was superb. The shower was extremely powerful but did not drain properly. In the morning I was told that shower water had penetrated the room below and I was asked if I would move to a better room. The better room was not as good and the television didn't work. Tissues had to be requested and neither cotton buds not a nail brush could be supplied. This could be an outstanding hotel but my experience was disapointing. I also visited the Arts hotel for a meeting - this looks like a better bet - although you have to take three elevators to reach the penthouse duplex suites.",4,2008,10,01
35,Nice quiet place to stay in Barcelona,"The Eurostar Grand Marina in Barcelona was a great hotel. It was in a good location for exploring the city but not smack bang in the city centre (although this was very easily walkable). The Ramblas was about a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. It took about 15-20 minute taxi ride from the airport to get to the hotel which cost about 26 Euros.

The hotel was nicely furnished and the room we stayed in was nicely decorated and very comfortable Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2008,09,28
35,not 5 star,"This never struck me as a five star hotel. As soon as you walk in it's a soul less place - efficiently run, but very corporate. It seems quite 1970s in its decor. The room was OK but no balcony which we missed, and it was facing the cable car tower which had all the appeal of a construction site. Because of this we spent most of the time exploring in town as the hotel wasn't nice to hang out in - concrete ""gardens' with no views.
The pool is ridiculous - billed as a roof top pool you get the idea that this is some type of 5 star luxury but it is little bigger than a bath. Also it didn't open until 11am for some obscure reason. Instead we walked to the beach (25 mins) and enjoyed swimming in the sea which was a very positive experience.",3,2008,09,09
35,Great Position,"We have just returned from a week in Barcelona with our two teenage sons.I searched long and hard for the hotel that would allow us to be close to the centre of Barcelona, yet make the most of the coast and have a pool to return to after a hard day's site seeing. The first objective was well satisfied, as the hotel is within easy walking distance of Las Ramblas and the Metro. The beaches were also easily reached by taxi from the hotel costing approximately six euros. The pool, however was a major let down. On the hotel's website it appears to be the size of an Olympic pool, but in reality it was nothing more than an ice cold plunge pool. It was surrounded by a fairly large open space that should, for a five star hotel, have been filled with sun beds. It had about sixteen with the vaste majority of guests having to sit or lay on the floor.
We arrived at the hotel in the morning and were told our rooms would be ready at 2pm. We returned at 2.30 and were given the key to our son's room, which was on the seventh floor facing an office block, not good! After six phone calls and six times of being told that our room would be ready in ten minutes, we finally got in at 4.30. Our double room also faced an office block, but did at least have a second window to the side. The rooms were beautifully presented and very well cared for by the cleaners, who scowled at us daily because we chose not to rise until about 10am.
To summarise - a grand building, some highly dodgy positioning of rooms and views. A rather souless hotel whose service is not, despite the excellent concierge, that of a five star hotel.",3,2008,08,26
35,"Lovely rooms, good locaton","This hotel definitely needs a bigger pool.  We booked this hotel specifically for the pool and location.  We also laughed when we saw it.  Also there were no umbrellas over the 15-20 sun beds available.  There is a little seating area which has umbrellas but it would be nice to be able to lie out in the sun with part shade.  The location is great, at the end of Las Ramblas.  It's about a 20 min walk to the beach on Barceloneta.  

The staff are very helpful and friendly.  We didn't find that the restaurant or bar were very atmospheric because there were never really many people in them but they were beautifully decorated.  There are little restaurants and take away fresh food places behind the hotel and below the World Trade Centre which we only discovered after a couple of days.  These were handy for breakfast.

The concierge was very helpful but both recommendations he gave us were not good so do your homework before you go.  

My recommendations :- Argentinian Steak House Patagonia on Gran Via is excellent, I've been there on two trips and it was superb both times.  

4 Gats restaurant is the restaurant Picasso used to hang out in and is worth a visit.  It's in the Barri Gothic which is lovely to walk around and to shop in.  It's got a lot more expensive since our last visit two years ago.

We ate Sushi in a restaurant near the hotel on Av. Parallel.  It was tasty though the restaurant was only ok decor wise and the area is not great - we didn't feel 100% safe walking up there.

The hotel recommended Little Italy restaurant with live Jazz music in the Born district but it wasn't great for food.  That area is lovely however for bars and a stroll.

Citrus on Pg. de Gracia is lovely but indoors.  There are lovely tapas bars on that street where you can sit out and people watch and enjoy the great food at reasonable prices.

The Vila Olympica is worth a visit.  Hotel des Arts is worth a visit for a cocktail (€18).  Enjoy the decor and view.

Nearby on the beach is great for night life.  On Maritim Barceloneta there are restaurants which convert to night clubs about midnight; Opium with it's white leather couches was lovely but a lot quieter and more expensive (€15 per drink) than Shoko which was really busy and had good music.  The music in Opium was not great on the Tuesday night I was there but it might be better later in the week.

Buddha bar was empty.  They said it's quiet in August.",4,2008,08,25
35,Some good some bad,"Just arrived back yesterday from a three night stay.
Rooms good size and nice and comfortable.We laughed at the pool when we saw it.You expect a pool to be a reasonable size when you see it advertised but this one you couldn't dive into .More that two people in it and you would be bumping into each other.
We ordered room service which is not always a good idea but hey 5 star hotel can't go wrong. Yes you can food was poor quality.
So what did we do order a night or so later. Even worse this time, so we sent it back.
We are daft ordered food in the restaurant thinking it must be better than room service. No it isn't 
San Miguel cost 7 euro a bottle, TV has pay to view hear everything even music channel.
It is obviously a hotel out to make a quick buck and appears to be doing so very well.
Apart from that the room itself was good and on a room only it is a good place to stay, but don't be fooled by the five star rating",3,2008,08,19
35,Outstanding,"I work for the airlines and send many nights in hotels.  This Hotel was FANTASTIC!  The service, location, everything was A PLUS.  When returning to Barcelona I will Stay at this hotel again!!!",5,2008,08,07
35,Fantastic!,"A very brief stay at this hotel left me wanting to come back for more.  I cannot praise the decor, cleanliness, comfort, staff, service too much.  This was a short break booked and paid for by my daughter so I'm not aware of the cost but whatever it was, it's worth every penny.  The room was superb with a separate dressing room with well stocked fridge and storage. The bathroom had twin wash basins, and a jacuzzi bath and other items separated by an opaque sliding door. The only slight drawback was that the shower screen was not large enough to contain the water from the power shower, which splashed on to the floor.  Rooms were air conditioned with a thermostat and sliding doors to the balcony to let some heat in if preferred!  The lounge area was comfortable with excellent service and the breakfast was 'to die for'!  Phenomenal choice of fresh fruit, traditional cooked, lovely breads, pastries and much, much more, eaten outside under the lemon trees.  Convenient for exploring the city but also near the yacht marina, with good shopping and tapas bars nearby.  Thoroughly recommended and I can't wait for the chance to visit again.",5,2008,08,05
35,Fully satisfied,"We had a reservation for one double room with breakfast, March 3-4, 2007, for 244/night through sunhotels.net . On our arrival, we were given a junior suite. I don’t remember, but I am pretty doubtful that I booked a suite. 
Therefore, for the sake of prudence, it would be appropriate to add a caveat that this very positive review might not be applicable in all cases. 

Anyhow, it was a suite worth its name. Quite spacious, and everything, right from toiletries to sitting arrangement, was of top class. We had planned several meetings with our business partners, many of them could be executed quite comfortably without leaving the room. 

It wouldn’t be wrong to say that the breakfast was probably the best breakfast I have ever had at any hotel.

Strangely, access to the internet was not complimentary, something I consider a big minus for any aspiring hotel nowadays.",5,2008,07,31
35,Nearly Cancelled Three Times - Glad I Didn't,"Have just returned from staying in Barcelona for four nights at the Eurostars Grand Marina which I booked following a lot of research on where to stay in Barcelona.  However, after I booked I discovered some very negative reports on the service, tired and worn interior, location too far away from everywhere and tiny pool being the main complaints.  So much so I nearly  cancelled three times.  I am SO glad I didn't.

Having travelled extensively on business staying in first class hotels, I expect the same when I'm paying.  This met every expectation.  My Superior Double had a jacuzzi bath, balcony overlooking the Marina and decor you would expect in this class hotel.  Didn't look at all tired to me.  

Check in staff were courteous and the Concierge extremely helpful in advising where to go for the best restaurants off the tourist track.

The pool was indeed small, but at least that meant that after a long day sightseeing you weren't competing for sunbeds and no crowds.

Location is also perfect.  Away from the noise of Las Ramblas but you're at the  bottom of it within 5 minutes walk as well as a Metro stop.  Not only that all the ""Touristic"" open top buses stop outside as well as the cable car going to the beach and Montjuiic  (but a slight breeze seems to mean they don't operate it!).

Being a beach dweller a sightseeing holiday is normally not for me but my last day planned for the beach was sacrificed because there really is something amazing to discover every day in Barcelona.

The only downside was that our aircon packed in on the second day and they had trouble fixing it.  However, they offered to move us (them doing the moving) which we declined (couldn't be bothered) and instead offered us a couple of days worth of free breakfast and it was working in the end before we left.

All in all a great trip and would definitely stay there again if I return to Barcelona",5,2008,07,24
35,Same again! Absoutley outstanding!,"This is our second stay at Eurostars after a wonderful stay just last year. We returned simply because of the wonderful facilities and service!

We arrived about 5pm with a swift check-in followed by Champagne in the room which we requested upon arrival and was called for by reception when we were in the lobby thus it was clearly fast to be in there so quickly with an array of belgian chocolates. 

After looking around the bathroom, (bath with jets, wonderful aromatic power shower, his and hers sinks, toilet and beday, also lovely gifts and toiletries with robes and slippers) and the room which was very large including a desk, two armchairs and a table, balcony and seperate dressing room - we sat and enjoyed the freshly chilled champs!

Having unpacked (a little) we ordered room service for dinner being tired after travelling all day. It was delivered promptly, well presented and hot. 

For the duration of the stay we used all of the hotels amenities including the pool (which is admittedly small but heated with salt water and very plesant, this is not a thomson holiday resort after all), jacuzzi (which is inside but surrounded by glass casing so views are around), sunbathing area (lovely), roof bar (drinks wonderful and quickly served), restuarant (aire de la mare which is the high cuisine restaurant - absolutely wonderful!!! food is amazing, as is service and wine list!), lobby bar and terrace for lunch, concierge (excellent) amongst others.

I really can never understand the quarrelsome approach some take to the Grand Marina! If you want a family hotel where children run and scream and decadence is not your thing try a package holiday! 

The hotel was excellent, smartly presented, well managed and excellently staffed. I would never hesitate to return and can thoroughly reccommend it to all! 

If decadence, luxury and real enjoyment is what you are looking for - this is your hotel. 

Oh and most importantly! A great location is a definite feature of this establishment!",5,2008,07,20
35,"Great hotel, a bit far from metro","We were there for 4 nights on a business trip. The hotel itself is sumptuous: the public areas are very nice, and the gym+outdoor pool (not huge, however) on the terrace are a great add-on.
The double room was extremely spacious: there were also a wardrobe room and a large bathroom with both shower and bathtub.
Towels were changed daily even without request (what a waste), and room cleaning was really good (even too much, a staff member opened my door during an afternoon rest).

The location of the hotel is nice as well. It is practically on the sea (at the marine station, and 10-minute walk away from Rambla del Mar, where some restaurants and enteirtainments are located. The only issue regards public transportation: a 15-minute walk is required to reach the nearest metro station, while the terminus of no. 20 bus is very close.",5,2008,07,16
35,Stay away!!,"I stayed in the hotel Grand Marina Barcelona on the end of June and beginning of July. The hotel was chosen because of the sea view.  When I arrived no non-smoking room with a sea view was available. I got cleaned smoking room without any cigarette smoke, so I accepted the one. 
Finally I did not have any sea view anyway. Due to the traffic on the port I could see just huge cruisers in front of my windows. Whole day and night fuel suppliers and catering companies were running up and down through the port making annoying noise.
For the breakfast there were not many varieties of food to choose and in the restaurant from 4 p.m. only snacks and sandwiches were available.
Hotel´s outdoor swimming pool is too small. Concierge staff was unhelpful providing wrong information about boat trips, sightseeing tours, directions to the beach, interesting sites, etc. 
I will never stay again in this hotel and never recommend it to anybody.",2,2008,07,09
35,"Enjoyable, but expensive","We had a 3-night stay, and found the hotel perfectly acceptable. Okay, so some of the carpeting was a little worn and it is set in a concrete jungle  - but the Staff we very helpful and accommodating, the deluxe room was very nicely appointed and the bathroom was quite superb. We found the location great for views over the city and it was quite fascinating to watch the cruise ships come in and out, but it is a bit of a hike to get to the main touristy areas.
Plus points - interesting ""liner"" concept and good standard of rooms,  excellent buffet breakfast and (for a city centre hotel) great views.
Minus points - pool, what pool - more of a footbath, location slightly off the beaten track (10-15 mins walk to any shops/restaurants)",4,2008,07,04
35,Terrible Staff - Not Five Stars,"Quite simply one of the worst hotels we have ever, ever stayed in!

The pool is non existent. Don't go there for a pool or any outdoor space.

We stayed in a Deluxe Room for a week long vacation on the second floor with a view of a concrete wall! On our first morning we were woken up by staff shouting singing and banging as they were setting up for a party that night. This was at six thirty am on our holiday in a supposedly five star hotel.

When we complained the manager said there was nothing they could do. We asked if the party was going to go on late and keep us awake that night and he responded by saying he did not know.

So we went out that night and returned at one am assuming that the party would be finished or at least quiet by then this was not the case with a band playing right beneath our window all night until three am!

When my girlfriend called reception and the duty manager to ask for us to be moved the manager hung up the phone on her! That has never ever happened in my life!

You may think this is just a one off bad experience but it wasn't there were several other instances of not just bad but appalling service even by three star standards.

We went to the concierge one day and asked for a dinner reservation he insisted that we take a taxi to this beautiful romantic restaurant he knew of we asked if it was close he said yes five minutes. Forty five minutes later and 40 Euros worse off we were dropped off at a Cafe with plastic tables and a load of Dutch tourists from a cruise ship! Not what we expected when we asked for a high class romantic restaurant in Barcelona!

Don't stay at this hotel there are so many better hotels with better facilities and location and most of all staff with brains and some decent training. Even the three and four star hotels would be better than this place. Its a hotel for business guests only or cruise ship guests for one night.

Other than that stay away!",1,2008,06,27
35,Definitely not 5 stars and too far from Metro,"Was transferred to this hotel, supposedly 5 stars but i will at most give it a 4 star rating.

Stayed for 5 nights and my comments are as below:

Good:
Room is relatively clean, spacious

Bad:
Too far away from the metro, about 15mins walk. Nearest shopping at Maramagnum is also about 15mins walk. 
As said by many, carpets look old at walkways and probably need a change or cleaning.",3,2008,06,04
35,Good location,"Nice hotel in a great location. Only problem is for the price we would have expected wireless internet in the room, but you had to go to the lobby which was inconvenient.",4,2008,05,30
35,not bad,"definately a business hotel rooms were good.
on websie looked like hotel faced the sea but the conference centre is on the sea front and the hotel at the back. The indoor pool is the size of a postage stamp and the outdoor one very small. Drinks extortionately expensive would stay in las ramblas centre next time",3,2008,05,12
35,Nice Hotel....not a 5 Star one though!!,"Having stayed at this hotel last July for a friend's hen weekend I knew it was a lovely hotel and for a 5*, good value, especially with the location.  I re-booked it for this May for a friend's 30th and was disapointed that the prices had gone up by over £50 each PER NIGHT despite only being early May but felt it was worth it as we had used the facilities last year and it was superb.  However, we were extremely disapointed to discover that the swimming pool was empty and were told this was because ""it wasn't summer yet"" despite the temperatures being 29 degrees????!!!!  Also, the rooms were not as good as they were the previous years and I just felt that overall, this was not acceptable for a  far from cheap 5* hotel.  I won't be staying there again which is a real shame.",3,2008,05,07
35,Fabulous,"Myself, husband and two teenage daughters stayed here for a 3 night break over Easter and had a fabulous time. The hotel was clean, the rooms were beautiful and spacious. We have spent a lot of money on a super king size bed at home and hardly ever sleep in a more comfortable bed than ours but this was, and my husband was well impressed with the ""pillow menu"". - We could have chosen different pillows to suit us.
We had no noise from outside or other rooms whatsoever, and the views over the city, and the water at the side was lovely. There were cruise ships moored up whilst we were there but heard no noise from them, and although other reviews have said the staff were unfriendly, we found them friendly, very attentive and could not fault iour stay at all. The prices in the minibar, restaurant were expensive - but in a 5 star hotel in a eurpean capital city that is only to be expected. We would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.",5,2008,03,24
35,Inflated prices,"Arriving at the hotel we were impressed with the room quality and luxury. 
We paid around £200 per night but it soon became apparent that all you get for your money is the room - nothing more. The mini bar rates were ridiculous, bearing no resemblance to normal rrp. For example a can of Coca cola was £4.50!!
Also, despite the 5* rating, we were woken on two consecutive nights by the noise of ladies shoes on wooden floor and the noise of joking and laughing at 1am in the adjacent room. Having reported it to staff they simply requested that we call security if it happened again. Not much good once you've been woken!!
In addition, there were only four or five English speaking channels on the TV and they were predominently news channels. To watch a movie was 16 euros or £12.50. Surely for £200 per night you'd expect free movies and a good selection of channels.
Whilst the room was nice, that was it for your money. Unless you're prepared to accept these expensive extras I'd search for somewhere else.
However, location was great and the gymnasium modern and clean.",3,2008,03,23
35,Kids 12 years and older need their own room,"When we got to the hotel I was told that my 12 year old son must have his own room. I had to pay for a room that my son never used. They claimed that this was government regulation that 12 year olds must have their own rooms. My son was frigtened to sleep in a different room in a strange country. When I got back home, I found that this was a big lie since there is no such government regulation. I have been writting to the corporate offices for almost a year and yet I have no answer. Do not go with children.",3,2008,03,10
35,"NOT 5 star, Horrible service, Unbelievably expensive","I just got back from the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel and I am very relieved to be back home.   I was in Barcelona for a large conference and I was eagerly looking forward to a stay in this 5 Star ""GRAND LUXE"" property.  I had stayed there for a couple of days back when it was brand new and it was pretty nice then.  

 Boy was I disappointed!

 The prices had shot up to absolutely unconscionable levels and the property is now showing its age with shabby dings and dents on the furniture, nasty muddy stains on beige bedroom carpets etc.   

This is definitely not a 5 star ""grand luxe"" property in any way, shape or form. It's ""facilities"" are a generic,  trendy restaurant and a lobby.  No spa, no amazing pool, no choice of bars. In short, a generic, modern 4 star business hotel.  If you compare this to even a 4 star hotel in say, Singapore or Hong Kong, you will come away shaking your head in disbelief.

If the blah facilities were the only issue, I would have ranked this place a ""neutral/average"" --after all I have stayed in FAR worse in Europe but it was in the area of the absolutely uncaring and snotty service that I think moved it's rating one step above ""terrible"".      

The heating was turned on full blast at night, for example, and when I complained that I needed some cooling in my room, the lady at the ""service desk"" said that I should just open the window.... OK... except that there was a 110 decible Telecom Rock Extravaganza put on by some company in the courtyward ! I just sweltered until 1AM when the rock music finally stopped blaring.  

The next night, I had to put up with hammers and machine tools being used to take apart the rock stage from midnight to 2AM.  The management took  a ""who cares, this situation can't be helped"" attitude!  While this is understandable for an IBIS or MOTEL 6 type place, it is ludicrous treatment    when one has paid EUR 900 / night (they jack up the rates  during the GSM conference).   I don't know about you but at this kind of price, I expect very courteous and responsive treatment, not some kind of insulting ""manana maybe"" shrugging.    I don't care if there's a conference going on: if you can't take feed  your guests even tuna, don't charge them caviar prices!  

The Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel, I am afraid, is a bit of a dud. Greed, apathy and rudeness characterized my stay there.

 Save your money, nerves and aggravation and consider staying elsewhere.  Certainly for the money I paid, I received probably the worst price/performance ratio in terms of quality of stay of my entire working life.",2,2008,02,16
35,Terrible Service & Lost My Case,"We booked a long weekend at the Grand Marina and on arrival were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the rooms. Very modern with a seperate lounge area and comfortable. The rooms were spacious and everything was fine. The problems started when we went to check out on the final day. We had a flight booked at 8pm on the Sunday and so, wanting to enjoy our final day in the city, checked out and left our bags with the concierge. He presented us with a ticket for the bags and off we went for lunch. On our return, we presented the ticket and expected to get our bag. The concierge could not find our bag and a phonecall soon after confirmed that a gentleman at Barcelona airport had found our bag in the boot of his taxi when he got to the airport. The only option had been for him to ask the taxi driver to return the case to the hotel. Honesty in Barcelona is not a strong quality and the bag had never arrived back at the Grand Marina. We were getting nowhere with the management of the hotel who clearly did not care and so that we did not miss our flight, we left for the airport empty handed with the promise of an explaination from the manager the following day.

Back in the UK we made a claim with our insurers but needed to get confirmation from the hotel of the events that took place. We made call after call to the hotel who would never allow me to speak with the manager. I emailed the hotel asking for confirmation and again received nothing. All in all the service after the loss, for which they were responsible was awful. In the end, I managed to get a friend who was working in Barcelona to visit the hotel in person and stand over the manager whilst he wrote an email confirming events. If I had not had this friend do this, I would never have got the claim through.

In summary, whilst the hotel is well positioned and the rooms are lovely, the service and attitude of the staff and management is appalling.",1,2008,02,03
35,Not a 5 Star Hotel,"This is the first time I have ever posted a review, but I have to share my experiences of staying at this hotel with others so you don't experience the difficulties we encountered.
I normally write off bad reviews I read as whinging hard to please pedants, but this is written in the hope that it is helpful information for anyone seeking to book a quality hotel in Barcelona.
I booked a late long weekend break at the end of January and booked two rooms for 3 nights at the Grand Marina. There were actually 5 of us staying including my 3 children (youngest is 9), but the website - similar to most - couldn't cope with booking a family of 5. I therefore called the hotel after booking and explained that there was an additional child and I was happy to pay the extra charge involved. I would have booked direct with the hotel but their website does not feature their telephone number (!) and would not accept an e-mail. 
When we arrived late on Friday our rooms were not interconnecting, even though the hotel was almost empty and interconnecting rooms must have been available. On the Saturday I decided to check exactly how much they were adding onto the Bill for my 'extra' child so I had no nasty surprises at checkout. It worked out twice what I was paying as an adult. I queried this and the Duty Manager agreed to a small reduction, but still I was paying more for an extra 'Z Bed' stuck in one of our rooms than for my own stay. This hotel definitely does not want kids. It's a business travellers hotel, as witnessed by the bizarrely expensive minibar prices only to be tolerated if on expenses. Please don't think I'm stingy - I don't mind paying for quality - but this is a 3 to 4 star hotel masquerading as 5 star because the building looks good. 
The pool was closed, the view was of cargo ships being unloaded (which continued noisily overnight) rather than the sea and the staff at reception were less helpful than a famous Torquay guest house. On checkout I asked whether they could advise what times the buses left for Gerona airport as my flight was at 10.30pm. I was made to feel like I was being a nuisance and was told that the last flight from that airport was 8.30pm so I should get a bus around 6.00pm. I checked my ticket and the flight was later as I thought, so we carried on without their uninformed guesswork. Comapre this to the last time I stayed in Barcelona, at the Neri Hotel (4 star not 5) where the staff printed out a bus timetable from the internet for me and could not have been more helpful. 
It was an appropriate end to a generally poor hotel experience. Thankfully Barcelona itself more than made up for the over-priced and under-delivering Grand Marina. My daughter did have her bag stolen in the city, but at least the thieves involved in that instance don't call themselves 5 star. 
If you're planning to stay in Barcelona, take it from me, there are much better 4 star hotels than the Grand Marina at around the same price or less - I'm only sorry we didn't stay in one.",1,2008,02,02
35,Great hotel,"A really gorgeous hotel.  Standard ooms are amazing, as are the suites.  Brekfast was very delicious and lots of choice. Good location.",5,2008,01,10
35,Shady Hotel,"There were problems from the start.  Upon arrival we were forced to upgrade or leave the hotel due to lack of rooms.   A day later, the hotel's water supply cut off until 12 pm, this happened several times.  The toilet had to be fixed about twice which is really annoying.   There is black mold in the bathrooms and around the airconditioning.  

The pool is tiny and covered in black mold.  The only positive thing this hotel can offer is space.

The manager at the time was just bad, first initial J.",1,2008,01,10
35,Stunning room.,"We used the celebration break offer which included the upgrade room, bottle of Cava and chocolate dipped strawberries. The window in the room overlooked the port and was 50ft long!
The hotel is smart but was a bit characterless, probably due to the lack of customers so soon after christmas, however the staff were very friendly and helpful. We used the restaurant which was high quality but expensive - and empty.
The location is good, but the long entrance to the front of the hotel makes a stroll to Las Rambles quite long. On the negative side, the pictures are misleading as most of the building is the World Trade Ctr and not the hotel, and the front view is spoiled by the big pylon/tower in front, but this did not spoil it for us.
I would recommend the hotel and hope to return next time I visit Barcelona.",5,2008,01,08
35,Good hotel in an excellent tourist location,"I chose this hotel for a two night stay in Barcelona for quality and location at a good price. At around £125 per night it offered great value.

The hotel itself is classy and modern, rooms well furnished and services as you would expect. We did not eat at the hotel so can't comment on that, and we did not experience poor service or stuffy staff.

One specific area of excellence was a great information desk on the first floor, complete with laptops and two people to advise on where to go, how to get there etc etc. Extremely useful and knowledgeable.

Others commented on the noise from ferries. We saw two ferries and a cargo ship come in, but were not disturbed at all at night and this had little, if any, effect on our stay.

For location, the hotel is 5 minutes walk from the bottom of Las Ramblas. This also means many bars and restaurants are within walking distance and there are many more just a short taxi journey away. The nearest Metro is 5 mins walk at the bottom of Las Ramblas. It's in a great spot for seeing the sights of the city.

In summary, a very comfortable hotel in an excellent location.",4,2008,01,04
35,I love this hotel,"We stayed here for one night at the beginning of December and were very impressed.  The room was large, well decorated with a lovely bathroom.  The breakfast was very good and it was lovely and quiet at night.  

The view from the room was fabulous too, we loved being able to see the entire harbour.  

We ate in the hotel bar once and the food was very nice although nor stunning.

All in all this place is lovely and I would definitely stay there again.",5,2007,12,30
35,"Better than suggested - but could do better, nonetheless","There were no cruise liners or ferries moored up against this impressive hotel when I and 20 of my staff turned up for our Christmas party.  The resultant peace and quiet, therefore, seems considerably at odds with other reviewers' experiences.

That said, we found the hotel altogether friendlier and smarter than some would have you believe, too.  Live jazz over breakfast was a particularly nice touch.

Sure, there are small bits of housekeeping that could be improved upon and a few glaring design faults - such as the gap in the ineffectual shower doors - that make you think 'maybe it's four and a half stars, not five'.  

But if you're not a professional nit-picker then this place is cracking value for money, in an outstanding location and with a rooftop terrace and pool that offer stunning views up and down the harbour.  

My room was the size of Birkenhead, though I took it as compensation for the absence of any view.  Others in my party fared somewhat better on that front so it's well worth specifying harbour views when you book.

The meeting room for our annual conference was smart and set out as required and the beds were delightfully firm.  I slept like a log and will definitely return.  My team gave it a major thumbs-up, too.",4,2007,12,16
35,My nightmare at the Eurostars,"In my opinion this hotel was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The hotel itself was Ok but the carpets in the walkways were filthy, the reception was draughty and unwelcoming, the staff were rude and arrogant. We ordered room service with English tea with milk and grilled slamon, the tea arrived with no milk and the salmon was raw and cold. (I was told this was normal in Spain)
On the second day I realised that I had a pot of Estee Lauder foundation missing from my dressing table, I reported this and nothing was done, it took a further 2 emails and two phone calls before I had a reply to say that I should have kept all items in the safe. I was shocked as the safe was only small, would you expect to keep coats and makeup in the safe. This has never happened to me before., all they offered was a free upgrade to a better room next time we stayed but they would have to pay me to get me to stay there again. I am not the complaining type but this really shocked me.",1,2007,12,10
35,If you want a good nights sleep do not stay here,"This is not a 5 star hotel more like a 4 star. The staff are brilliant but the building though reasonably new is starting to fall appart through neglect.

Check-in was fine as were all the staff encountered but the room was below 3 star as to maintenance. All facilities were there LCD tv, mini-bar, power shower, whirlpool bath the list goes on.

But the maintenance of these was none existant.

Cheap laminate flooring was starting to lift leaving sharp edges to catch your feet on, the shower door failed to close as it was coming away from the wall so massive amounts of water covered the bathroom (remember it is a power shower).

The Patio doors on the minute balcony refused to close or lock.

The noise from the cruise liner outside our room until the early hours precluded any sleep, not that that was possible as the mattress and the pillow appeared to be made of some stone substitute. Even with the pillow menu a restful night was impossible.

The general air of the hotel, as with the World Trade Centre complex is a little unloved which concidering its age is surprising.

I could not in fairness not recommend the hotel, I may just have been unlucky, but for the money any other hotel in Barcelona would be better value. The possition of the hotel is great, near the city but not too near, easy level walks to all sites. Tourist bus stop outside the door and the ever attentive staff are all plus points. But oh the bed and the noise! And the appearant lack of any maintenance in room 751.

Not recommended to people with a back, good hearing or thoughs who wish to wash beyond that it is a very nice expencive and convenient hotel in which to stay.

We had booked three nights but checked out after the first.
.",1,2007,12,03
35,Great views but stuffy staff,"This hotel is not a 5 star hotel ! The prices are but the rooms and amenities are not. Some people may not split hairs but I would rate this a good 4 star hotel. Its not refined enough for a 5 star hotel in my own humble opinion. 

Check in was great and easy and the rooms were modern and bright with plenty of wood, sliding doors and mirrors. LCD TV but no music at all unless you pay for it. The whirlpool bath worked though not grand enough to be a feature. The mini bar was well stocked but the prices !! don't go there.

Carefull in the bar, the prices are not cheap, perhaps to be expected in a 5 star hotel. Three single malts in the bar cost me 66 Euros ! more that the price of the bottle, yes I expect a large mark up in any hotel but come on.

The views were great but you are are bang smack in the middle of a working and busy port, I imagine its noisy in the summer with windows open but when we were there it was a gentle hum in the background. Quite pleasant I thought and would not stop me going again.

The staff walk about in dark suits and ear pieces, you think you have just walked into a security guard conference or an american presidential stop over. They are very formal, too formal in fact, someone ought to teach them how to smile and relax and be natural when dealing with their customers rather than impersonate someone with a serious case of piles.

Breakfasts were great, they couldn't be faulted but in all honesty a 5 minute walk up La Ramblas takes you to the most amazing food market with about 3 superb tapas bars, their breakfasts whilst not as elegant will be fresher, tastier and a more authentic taste of Barcelona that anything a five star hotel could offer. But then I suppose most people staying in this hotel would probably find a 5 minute walk  too much of an inconvenience to get breakfast.

Room service was really quite good, polite and fast with a great selection.

Checkout was a nightmare, there was internet access on the bill we didn't use, and before they would allow us to settle up the bill they had a member of staff check our departed room for a tapas book from the bar that we had borrowed the previous evening. Rather than take it back we left it in the room, not a big deal but I think they thought we were going to steal it, but they wouldn't say as much. Of course it was in the room but I'm well presented with good clothes a good watch and the right age to not be viewed with suspicion by staff at check out time.

Would I stay there again? No probably not, not really because of any of the bad points mentioned, there were enough good to balance them all out, but in my mind I've stayed in far better places and life is to short to revisit a place in which your senses were not set alight.",3,2007,11,28
35,Noisy Hotel,"The bar on the veranda 5th floor, was not up and running  however the bar man laid on free fresh fruit to compensate it was a gorgeous display everyday.
Ordered a massage via hotel, they came on a Sunday which was really nice.  It is quite a walk from anywhere, the cable cars were just outside, but the wind meant they were not in use for easy drop off to the beach as usual.  The red bus stops right outside.
The staff were extremely nice, the breakfast under the orange trees was excellent. However very noisy hotel, the cruise ships are constantly in and out of the marina at all times of day and night.  We did not get a balcony room, although paid quite a lot of money.",4,2007,11,20
35,Fantastic Hotel,"My wife and I stayed 3 nights in this hotel in November and have to say that it was sheer luxury. The service was fantastic from the moment we arrived until we left. We paid for the celebration package which included breakfast, and what a breakfast it was. There was everything from Champagne and strawberries to cooked meats and pancakes and syrup. The hotel is in an excellent location just 5 minutes walk from the bottom of La Ramblas. The Port shopping complex is only 5 minutes away and the Barcelona Tour Bus goes from right outside the hotel. There is also a taxi rank next to the hotel. Cruise liners did moor up outside our room but we slept with the window open and they did not disturb us at all. The best restarant we found was Les Quinze Nity in Placa Reial. It opens at 8.30 and you will have to queue but I assure you it is well worth it. The quality of the food and service is 5 star and the prices so cheap. Can't wait to go back to Barcelona.

35,Great Hotel,"A girlfried and I stayed in the hotel before leaving on a cruise the next day Friday.  Although we arrived at the hotel earlier than check in time, the staff accomodated our request and we were immediately shown to a room (when I booked I did request early check in and wasn't disappointed).  Our room overlooked the main entrance to the hotel with a balcony so we had a view of the city (La Ramblas) and the water.  The jacuzzi tub was wonderful especially after a long flight from California.  We did have some minor problem with the electrical, using a universal converter for a flat iron (straightener) which ""went poof"" as the engineer put it (that actually became the joke of the trip).  The staff was wonderful even allowing us to stay later than the usual check out time because of the electrical problem which they fixed immediately.  We were too tired to go outside the hotel for dinner so ate in the beautiful bar area, a little pricey but found Europe in general pricey because of the exchange rate.  This was a great way to start our vacation and were very happy we chose this hotel for our first night.  I would recommend this hotel with 5 stars, worth every penny and loved the choice of pillows, I had 4 different ones and enjoyed the concept.",5,2007,11,06
35,"Fantastic Hotel, Brilliant staff, let down by NOISE","On Arriving it was a relief to arrive to some normality from staying in Paris for two nights, the staff were faultless from start to finish, the room, which i paid extra to upgrade on arrival, was fantastic, nice dark wood floor, great bathroom, travertine tiles, spa bath, the bedroom was brilliant, pillow menu, kingsize bed and 180degree views of the harbour, however the view was the let down, 5am a ferry docked up right outside my window, to be honest it would have been everyone on that side's window as it was so big, cue a very loud PA speaker for 15 mins, followed by men hitting metal on metal for i have no idea what reason, all in all a great stay completley ruined, if i had any heavy inate objects i would have thrown them at said chaps with hammers or whatever it was they were so carelessly using.

i would have given this hotel a 4 or 5 rating but the noise really did ruin everything, it's totally without justification for a hotel of this price and class to sell someone a room knowing that at 5am there will be noise that literally no one could sleep through, earplugs and double-tripple glazing couldn't have drowned it out. 

that being said, do stay here, but make sure that if you do, as you look at the hotel from the front, only stay on the left hand side looking onto the city rather than the harbour, even then i think that PA will travel.",2,2007,10,29
35,Great hotel,"Stayed Grand Marine on Aug.24 for 1 night. As it was a special day for me, so I booked a liitle more higherend hotel as I usually book. As I work for travel industry, I know all good and bad. After my thorough research and arriving this hotel, I was very happy with my choice. Very professional employees, very spacious room(we stayed primier room), very modern but not cheap interior,excellent breakfast, etc. We got a room for city view with terrace whcih we could enjoy nice Balcelona city night view. 
We arrived before check in time and our room was not ready, but they took us to their cefeteria which was also nice(we sat terrace) and being offered drink while we wait. Great location. Convenient to walk to main street. The only negative  part was jacuzzi in our room was not working. But even with this negative part, I score 5 stars with the price compare to much more price other 5 star hotels charge.
",5,2007,09,17
35,"Fantastic staff, very freindly","We have just returned from a very quick 2 day 1st Anniversary break at the Grand Marina, and both have very mixed feelings about this hotel, the staff are exceptionally freindly and helpfull, having arrived at Barcelona airport to find one piece of our luggage had not come with us was quite upsetting, and spending an extra 2 hours at the airport trying to track it down was really annoying but it seems to happen all the time, after receiving a reference number for the missing luggage off to the hotel,  We had booked a  romantic double room which lived up to expectations with Cava and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us. The views from the room were amazing across the port,and we felt very happy to have found such a wonderful hotel, however not so amazing at 5.30am when the biggest passenger liner docks by the side of the hotel, with engines running, the noise was 2 say the least unbearable, and i'm a heavy sleeper!!! asked to move rooms for the next night as felt could not go through that again, staff very helpfull and seemed use to this complaint. 
We were moved to a room on the Trade Center side of the hotel, overlooking a concrete jungle but at least, had a good nights sleep. Breakfast amazing, drinks very pricey, the hotel is very central for walking to all that the city has to offer, tourist bus very handy to get on just outside hotel and a great way to see the city, and find your bearings. Nice roof- top sun-bathing area, pool very small but ok for a dip, the hotel was very quiet when we visited, not sure how relaxing it would be if busy. We had to be out of room at 12.00pm, but were still able to use pool facilities, showers etc  to freshen up befor evening flight, which was a nice touch. Baggage arrived back in UK a day after we did, so must add that the shoping in Barcelona is quite good if you need to get essentials and something to wear if your unlucky like us for the airlines to loose your luggage.
",3,2007,09,05
35,Excellant service,"My partner and i stayed in this hotel for one night and it exceeded our expectations.  The room was more than a generous size and the staff could'nt be more helpful.  I also phoned up the hotel before our arrival   to upgrade to a romantic package, which for 50e got us a welcome drink in the bar, a bottle of champane in the room, chocolate covered strawberrys in the room and breakfast . This turned out to be extremly good value as we found out that if we'd wanted breakfast only in the morning it woud have been 30e each.  I would highly recommend this hotel
",5,2007,09,03
35,Good But Not Great,"This is the case of a hotel that is disappointing simply because it has been awarded the 5 star GL status. Otherwise, it is a sleek, modern, comfortable hotel with the absolute best location in all of Barcelona. The entire staff speaks English and is very polite. In brief, everything spot on. 

But, simply not the level of a 5 star hotel. Nowhere is the price paid for this hotel justified. And that is quite unfortunate. It has made this hotel one to go to solely if you are a business traveler or someone that needs an overnight stay near the harbor to catch your cruise ship.
",4,2007,09,03
35,"Stolen iPod Nano, but OK besides that","Biggest problem: our iPod Nano was stolen from our rucksack, most likely by hotel staff. We checked out at 12pm, and left our bags in their storage, since our flight was not until 10pm. After sight seeing, we collected our bags and went straight to the airport, in a taxi, with the rucksack at our feet. After check in, (we had no check in luggage) we realised the iPod was missing. We've since contacted the hotel, but they say they cannot find it, and have no idea. I remember packing the iPod into the top pocket of the bag, and it had been in the hotel's care between the time we checked out of the hotel, to the time we were at the airport. There was no way it was stolen while at the airport as i was carrying the bag infront of me.

Gym: great equipment and range of weights; better than most hotel gyms. However, the air con was not on high, so it got really hot. Plus, they played the same music everyday, and it was very slow and mellow, totally unsuitable for a workout.

Pool: Small

Lobby Lounge: great tapas, especially the seafood. The best meal of our trip. Cost about 100 euros for about 7 tapas and wine, and coffee

Room: great little touch of a choice of pillows to choose from, all named after old hollywood actresses.

35,Great view if you get it,"We had great 4 nights here. Room was spacious and comfortable and breakfast buffet quite good. I can recomend restaurant for diner as well - meal was really delicious.
At check-in we asked for room with seaview and got it! View on sea and Barcelona was really great.
But if reading about pool you expect swimming forget it - that's too small. And if you have champagne in minibar you expect at least wine glases in the room. Here were only for whisky.
",4,2007,08,28
35,Perfect when visiting Barcelona  in summer,"My husband and I were looking forwards to our first visit to Barcelona this summer and decided to stay at the Grand Marina Hotel due to its location near the beach, the swimming pool and the great reviews on tripadvisor.com! And we were not disappointed, the service was excellent and when we asked to get a room with a balcony as the first room we got did not have one, they were very accommodating and a room with a balcony was provided! The breakfast buffet was fantastic and even though it was not included we ended up eating there almost every day. The hotel is not far from Las Ramblas and a subway station. In addition it is only a ten fifteen minute walk to the beach. We ended up spending a lot of time on the beach, and as such only enjoyed the pool of the hotel one day. I must say this about the pool, it really is very very small, but very nice.
",5,2007,08,12
35,Ultra Modern Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for a 5 night break.  We wanted a 5 star hotel and that is exactly what we got.  From the minute you walk into the Reception the staff are there to look after you.  Every single member of staff spoke english from the girls who tidied our room every day to the waiting staff.  We arrived at the hotel at 11.30 a.m. we were taken to the first floor lounge, served two glasses of champagne and within 20 mins. the girl who checked us in brought us to our room (our luggage was waiting for us). The room was spectacular and the views were breathtaking.  I have read previous comments of ships docking and distrubing peoples sleep etc.  and I am a light sleeper! but this did not distrurb me.

The breakfast is wonderful with the choice of sitting outside or inside.  There is a wonderful choice and everybody is catered for.

The only downside I would see to this hotel is that it is definitely geared more towards the business traveller, being in the world trade centre it attracts a lot of business class visitors. In saying that it did not bother us, but if you are looking for a hotel with character, charm etc. I dont think this is for you.  It is ultra modern and ultra chic and unfortunately, the two do not go hand in hand.

One word of warning, there are a lot of homeless people just outside the hotel and I found this quiet scary at times.  There is a lovely park outside the front of the hotel and these poor unfortuantes camp there for the night. It is worth taking a taxi at night as some areas of barcelona can be quiet seedy.

35,Honeymoon,"We stayed at this hotel for one night.  We had planned a cruise that was leaving Saturday afternoon, and we wanted to stay in the area.  The hotel was clean and the staff was nice!  The rooms were a bit small and the beds were very hard, but they were nicely decorated and clean.  There was a TV in the room, but nothing in English.  There were places to eat around the hotel and there were a lot of beautiful buildings and churches within walking distance.  This was next to a shopping area and we had enough entertainment for a full day of walking around the area.  We checked out and they called a taxi for us to get to the cruise line...less than a 5 minute ride and $10.00.  We would stay in the hotel again in a heart beat!
",4,2007,07,29
35,Great hotel but not without it's (bad) surprises,"Having stayed in Barcelona a number of times decided to treat myself to the Grand Marina - brilliant location, brilliant views over the harbour/Mare Magnum and good sized rooms with equally good sized and well equipped bathroom.

All was well until 1.30am when a ferry proceeded to moor outside the window of my room and then leave it's engine running all night (and through to 17:00 the next day when I left).

No amount of double glazing was going to stop the noise but on a 5* hotel I'd expect at least a warning to be prepared for noise.

Not surprisingly no response to a complaint (both in person at departure and in writing) hence time to make others aware so that they book well aware of potential issues.

35,the hotel don't allow parent with two children,"I just arrived today 7/25/07 the place look nice but I have been around the world and I never have seen unprofessional director like Jose Maria barren that he said that he was the director but I think that he doesn’t has any education, I make a reservation with five star alliance two junior suite for my brother and my family when I get to the hotel after 14 hour of airplane trip I went to the from desk to do the check in and the from desk Alexis Barceló told me that the hotel doesn’t allow parent with two child, I though I can believe it 
I came with my wife, my daughter one years and my son 6 years, I never have his problems in any other hotel, I have been hotel Danieli in Venice, hotel crillon and Athena in Paris, mandarin Oriental London,Bermudas,NY,Chicago,Praga and much more and I never have no problem then there was a person Jose Maria barran that get into the conversation without any presentation very unprofessional and I told him that his hotel doesn’t has good service and he told screaming me he out from my house, go to hell and my only answer to him was if he was the owner of that place he doesn’t treat a customer like that ,thank god I just came to majestic hotel and I got a reservation very nice ,more beautiful better attention and care of the customer.

The room we were given had the most wonderful views of barcelona and the Mare magnum couldn't have been better.

We stayed there for our aniversary and booked a celebration package upgraded room breakfast( one of the best hotel breakfasts we have ever had) champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries.

We found every member of staff to be very friendly and attentive and we will be heading straight there next time we visit barcelona.

35,Great Hotel,"Beautiful rooms, great view, nice bar, lovely location (but not right in the centre - close enouh to walk to many restaurants, bars etc)

Only grumble would be the food - very limited choice in the restaurant, the tapas in the bar was great but far too expensive for what you get - much better walking 5 minutes to a nice restaurant on the marina for half the price.
",4,2007,07,16
35,To be honest we were disappointed,"I have to say that our stay at the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel in Barcelona was disappointing. Our summer break this year consisted of a number of short european destination breaks all strung together. We began in Amsterdam for 3 days - moved on to Milan/Lake Garda for 4 days - Barcelona for 4 days and finished off in Dublin for 3 days.

Amsterdam was primarily an excuse to see Genesis - great concert incidently - we stayed at the ACH Leidse Square Hotel - a 3 star hotel - reasonable daily rate at about £85 per night - room was small but I've read other reports about this hotel were guests say their room was large - our room was fine for us - it was what we were expecting. 

Lake Garda was to die for - we stayed in the Hotel Continental, Sirmione - a 4 star hotel - we were upgraded to a junior suite - daily rate approx £131 - every thing about this hotel was just perfect - location could not be bettered - beautiful views - our own sun terrace situated right on the edge of the lake and a lovely pool - the grounds were maintained immaculately and all the staff were frindly and helpful. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to all trip advisors - I will return to this hotel and this is very unusual for me as my normal stance is that there are so many locations in the world to visit that I can't afford to visit the same place twice - for Sirmione and The Continental Hotel I will make an exception.

You can imagine our building expectation when moving on from Sirmione to Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel in Barcelona - this was a 5 star hotel and the most expensive of the 4 hotels we were to stay in - approx daily rate £154. However, expectation was not to be matched by what we actually received. The hotel is advertised as a 'luxury hotel' and I'm sure there are some rooms that fall into that category but our rooms were the cheapest available in the hotel and as such tend to be the rooms do not warrant the tag 'luxury'. We were given a room that was smaller than our 3 star hotel in Amstedam - there was only one chair in the room - the second person in the room would either have to sit on the bed or use the desk chair - walls were very badly marked - floors were very badly scratched - these were the only rooms in the hotel that did not have a balcony and the view was off the boat terminal roof - we were so disappointed - we did complain and to be fair they did move us immediately to a bigger room with a balcony (I'm not sure whether this was an upgrade or just a better room within our grade of room - I expect it was an upgrade). Unfortunately the spa bath didn't work in this room - I asked reception everyday for 3 days if they could fix it  with no success - the day before we were due to leave the maintencance engineer visited whilst we were out to try and fix the problem - unfortunately without success - how did we know that the maintenance engineer had paid us a visit? - he had forgetten to put the the bath panel back. I hate complaning, it is not something that i want to spend my holiday doing - however I was so disappointed I did speak to the reception staff - I managed to negotiate the waiving of our roomservice charge (€30 - well better than nothing) - but the point is that you go on hoilday to relax not complain and argue with the very people that you hope are going to help you unwind. The common areas of the hotel were delightful although I thought the restaurant had all the charm and  ambiance of a large staff canteen. Swimming pool was very small and probably best left to the serial sunbathers. We left the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel feling short changed - would definately not return.

It rained in Dublin and it rained. We booked the Stay Dublin Apartments to try and economise after Barcelona - mind you they were still approx - £115 per night - I think these apartments are aimed at the many hen and stag night groups - where several dozen can share a few apartments - it was expensive for just the two of us - I think in my student days I would have enjoyed the Apartments -  unfortunately those days are long gone.

35,Grand,"My partner and i stayed in the hotel over the christmas period of 2006. We can truly say that we had a most enjoyable stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone

We found the staff at reception to be extremley helpful and professional. We were very happy with our spacious and comfertable junior suite over looking the harbour.

After a thoroughly enjoyable evening in Las Rambles & the Old Town  we made our way to the bar for our complimentary drinks. We arrived 30 minutes before the bar was supposed to close only to be told the bar were shut  and no more drinks were being served. After phoning reception to complain we recieved a complementary bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberrys from Daniel the night porter. We thought this was a fantastic touch and Daniel was most helpful with advice in regards to local attractions.

Overall we would recommend this hotel to anyone. The rooms are gorgeous and luxurious!  The beds were extremely comfortable and the location is ideal for city centre sightseeing! 
From the momonet we arrived i felt we recieved the full 5* treatment!

35,Ideal,"We found the hotel to be very good overall. Staff friendly and attentive.
Room was excellent overlooking the inner harbour and as we were on the 7th floor, we did not experience too much noise etc from the cruise ships and ferries. However a room overlooking the Trade Centre would probably have put a completely different slant on  things.
Breakfast was excellent with just about most things you could want and as it is buffet style, you simply have as much as you want from a very comprehensive choice.
Other than breakfast we did not eat in the hotel, preferring to explore the city. The evening menu did not look particularly exciting in terms of choice but neither was it that expensive. Probably similar prices to many of the restaurants in the city.
It is not too far a walk to Las Ramblas, the centre of much of the city's evening activity with the benefit of when you get back to the hotel, you are away from all the hustle, bustle and noise of the city.
We would definitley stay there again.

35,Great Hotel,"This is a great hotel, if you want modern style as apposed to old world charm. The rooms, mine 538 was a deluxe and enormous, had a dressing room 12 feet of windows looking over the port and city.LCD tv marble bathroooms and great cleaniliness and quality.
Most of all the breakfast is enormous, every food you can imagine.
Only downfall is that its not in the city centre, but hey nothing a 20 minute walk wont fix.
Well worth the money if you get a deluxe room with breakfast included.

35,5 Star *****,"Spent celebrating the New Year in Barcelona with my sister & could not have chosen a better hotel to spoil ourselves! It was 5 start treatment from the word go. Had a superb room on the 7th floor overlooking the gorgeous harbour. I absolutely loved the bedroom. It was tastefully decorated with beautiful trimmings. The bathroom was also a dream and every woman knows what a difference a good bathroom makes! Being in a foreign country, the staff were most hospitable and pleasant! It was worth the price and I would highly recommend anyone looking for luxurious accommodation.
",5,2007,07,11
35,A few days at the Grand Marina,"This is my second stay at the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel. I have stayed in two other hotels in Barcelona, but  I still prefer the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel, because the rooms are very clean and comfortable. Modern decor.

At first the hotel appears very grand and impressive, but I have to say that for a 5 star hotel, it was not entirely what I expected. Overall, I enjoyed my stay, but certain things could have been better.

LOCATION

The hotel is right by the Mediterranean Sea. Not many rooms get a full view of the sea. However, it is ideally located near the Barcelonetta restaurant area as well as the famous Las Ramblas street. Definitely convenient for visiting the tourist destinations as well as restaurants. In fact, the Bus Turistic stop is just right outside the hotel entrance.

FOOD

Barcelona has so many great restaurants that I never ate at the hotel. As such, I have no comment on this subject.

SERVICE

The service is not bad at all. But to be honest, for a 5 star establishment, the service could be pushed to an even higher standard. Many times I would ask the concierge to help with my dinner reservations. And many times they were not able to help me because they could not find the phone number on the internet or because they could not get through to the restaurant. I would expect a 5 star hotel to get my reservation taken care of, no matter what. 

CLEANLINESS

The hotel is VERY clean and comfortable.

ROOM & AMENITIES

The room is very spacious and the amenities are complete. It is exactly what you would expect of a 5 star hotel.

PARKING & INTERNET

There is free wireless internet by the concierge desk. Parking is available for a fee in the communal parking lot (shared with the World Trade Center).

35,Frostbite in July!!!,"Stayed here for one night in July, during the Fashion week in Barcelona - place full of very fashion conscious people!! I rate it with a '3' here because, for a 5 Star hotel it was just average.
On presenting ourselves at reception we knew we were in a 'cool' hotel - thanks to the frosty reception we received. In fact it was more than frosty it was aggressive. When we eventually got to the room (having had to endure the endless telephone conversations of our particular receptionist) we were pleased with the room. It faced the city and was well laid out and the balcony was a pleasant space to stand and watch the world go by. I have stayed in a number of 5 Star hotels and the mini-bar is usually very expensive but this one was outrageous - a litre of water would set you back €12 (33cl. bottles for €4) a mars bar for €4.5 - simply crazy, when asked at check-out if I had taken anything from the mini-bar, all I could do was smile and shake my head. The bar area is so huge it lacks any personality whatever. The staff there so cool they were almost frozen! The prices, however, were enough to burn a hole in a wallet. Would I stay here again - highly unlikely, I can do without frostbite in July!!
",3,2007,07,08
35,Ideal location and good service but no atmosphere,"This hotel was ideally located  for us on a four day family first visit to Barcelona.  The tourist bus stops outside; as does the cross-harbour cable car.  There were always plenty of taxis. The bedroom was excellent.  The staff were friendly and helpful.

We were lucky to have a room facing the city and inner harbour otherwise we would have been looking out on the courtyard of the World Trade Centre which would not have been inspiring. The downside of the port view was the noise of the docked ships until quite late at night when they seemed to depart.

The hotel does lack atmosphere. It could just as easily be a modern office complex. The bar food menu is very limited and over-priced.  The breakfast buffet was fine but I've had better in 4* and some 3* hotels.  It's the first hotel I've ever stayed in that couldn't respond to a request for ice cream!

Having said all that, we enjoyed our stay, and would probably go back.
",4,2007,07,02
35,It's the business,"I stayed at this hotel with my husband who was on a business trip.

It looks very central, but is actually quite a walk from the cafes bars and shops (circa 1 mile) as you have to go along a long promenade before getting to the harbourside.

Good points:
Our room was very clean and tidy with a great bathroom. It's very quiet at the hotel, even with functions taking place. They have a nice open-plan bar area.

Room service is excellent - very quick, courteous and reasonable.

The staff are all highly professional and nice-mannered.

The breakfast buffet is comprehensibly excellent - whatever you like, you will find it is available. And they provide international copies of newspapers if you fancy a read over your croissant.

Downsides:

The pool and gym area were a little disappointing for this class of hotel. The outside pool was closed while we were there, but is tiny anyway. There is a jacuzzi, but as it's in the gym equipment area, it's not exactly the most relaxing place to lounge. 

The gym is pretty good and well-equipped.

There is little atmosphere and you're in the middle of a 'dead' business plaza with quite a walk to a good tapas bar.

Generally, I recommend dinner at Botafumeira which was quite frankly superb.
",4,2007,06,18
35,Great Rooms,"Having stayed at the Arts for the last couple of visits was a little bit anxious as to how the Grand Marina would compare. We had a 2 bed executive suite which was less than the cost  of an excutive room at the Arts. Decor and facilities were excellent as was the hotel restaurant where the staff accomodated us ( 3 adults plus 4 kids) perfectly. Staff were all very helpful. I would agree that the place is somewhat souless but as a family with young children the positives about the room facilities etc. far outweighed this. If I was travelling as a couple would stay at the Arts but as a family the Grand Marina was fine. A bit of noise from the ferries and port but overall a good experience and will book again
",5,2007,05,31
35,"Modern elegance ,excellent location","I just returned from two weekend visits to this elegant hotel.  The stays were 2-3 nights  both before and after a  mediterranean cruise. First let me say that having never been to Barcelona before I made and canceled three other hotel reservations. I am very glad I finally settled on the Grand Marina.
     From the name it is clear that its convenience to the cruise ship pier is perfect. The location is wonderful in other ways. While it is within walking distance to attractions such as the fascinating  Las Ramblas it is also in a quieter area near the waterfront and not as congested in terms of traffic and noise as some other hotels. For me this was a great plus.
     The hotel is cutting edge modern.  The lobby and dining areas are open and airy. Our room was spacious and had a spectacular bathroom. I will say that the AC was not as effective as we would have liked.
    There were a couple of service glitches, that is the only non perfect element.Misplaced bags, failure to repair AC,but always polite and concerned.
    Everything was very expensive but I would definitely return.
",5,2007,05,29
35,Handy for the Port,"We stayed here for one night prior to joining a cruise in Barcelona.  We landed at the airport at about 9.30pm, and were clear of customs and reunited with uor luggage by about 9.55pm.  We took a taxi to the hotel and were in the room by 10.15pm.  Checkin was swift.  Room was very very big.  No balcony, but a 40 feet (about 11m) long window with fantastic views over parts of barcelona, the port, and the med.  We were within easy walking ditance of the Ramblas so went for late nght tapas which was easily found.  On returning to the hotel we tried the bar which was large and very pleasant, but quiet.  The next morning there was a cruise ship parked right outside of our window! (which was a bit of a surprise!).  If we had been going on that particular ship the terminal would have been right next to the hotel. Instead, we were a short ride away in the hotel car.  It would have been walkable (and we did walk on the return leg) but it takes about 30 minutes over a very large bridge. 

The hotel is everything you would expect of a good 5* hotel.  Cant really be faulted.
",4,2007,05,18
35,Very nice and reliable hotel,"Very nice, reliable, sophisticated, clean, safe and comfortable hotel. It's newness is probably why it is clean and pristine. 

Would recommend the hotel to visitors to the city. The location is good, just 200 yards from the sea end of La Rambla. As it is at the end of a pier it is also quiet as it is away from the traffic and the crowds.

Regarding rooms - ask for one that looks out on to the city - the views are fantastic. The rooms on the other side of the hotel overlooks a courtyard and do not have as nice a view. 

If you lare looking for a hotel that is classical, themed and with plenty of soul then this is not the place for you. It is only for this reason that I would rate the hotel a 4.5*
",4,2007,05,18
35,Great Hotel - what a treat to have stayed here!!,"We stayed at this hotel for three nights in May 2007 & had an amazing time.  The hotel is very swanky, polished and modern.  We don't agree with the other reviews which state that the hotel lacked soul or character at all.

The hotel has great state of the art amenties, gym, jacuqqi, sauna, Roof top terrace, lobby bar, etc....... The only negative is that the pool is really very small (almost child paddeling pool size!)

Our view for  our 7th floor room was out of this world!!! - We had a panaramic view of Barcelona city, and the harbour.  Yes big ships did often dock outside but this just added to the character and atmosphere of the marina.  

The colouful Rambles is a 5 min stroll away & the tourist bus stops right outside he hotel.  All in all we had a wonderful stay in Barcelona and this hotel and the staff helped in making our trip even more special.  We would definately stay here again and strongly recomend this delightful hotel.
",5,2007,05,12
35,Excellent Hotel,"Really good hotel, Spotlessly clean, attnetive staff. Rooms are spacious and comfortable with all the usual 5 star touches. Restaurant  was very nice, huge breakfast buffet. Go for an inclusive rate, its better value but definately worth having breakfast either way. We ate outside on the terrace each day and it was lovely. Pool on the roof top is small, however there are sun lungers and they serve cold drinks and fruit etc up there. The gym, Jacuzzi and sauna are all spotlessly clean and well positioned. We also had food in the bar and ti was very good. Our room was facing the front, overlooking the city. Yes the cruise ships and boats do pull up beside the hotel, but so what. It adds a bit of life to the marina area and they really dont interfere with your stay at all

Probably a more business type hotel, yet still very welcoming for tourists to Barcelona

Woudl definatley recommend and will stay there again.",5,2007,05,08
35,Barcelona's best hotel option,"Having slated the America Hotel last year and having confessed to only having posted one bad review I thought I would try to clear my conscience and give my fellow travellers some positive reviews.

Barcelona is a city close to my heart. My family are half English and half Spanish and the Spanish side live in and around Barcelona. Therefore it is a city I know very well and have seen both the good and the bad. The hotel Gran Marina definitely gets a mention in the good box.

Its first positive feature is its location. Those who do not know Barcelona might very well think, looking at a map, that the hotel lies a little out of the action; but they would be wrong. The hotel is no more than a 5-10 minute (very pleasant) stroll from the beginning of Ramblas. Having stayed in many hotels I can say hand on heart that I enjoy approaching the city from the direction of the sea in the morning considerably more than walking out of my hotel directly into the throng.

The hotel itself is unashamedly modern, albeit not minimalist. The reception desk gives a misleading impression of what lies beyond and is probably the most minamalist area in the hotel. It is expansive, quite cold and not particularly welcoming. On reflection it is probably the hotel's least well thought-out and therefore least endering feature. The staff, however, have always amply made up for this. Multilingual, helpful and charming I have never had cause for complaint on any of my stays. In fact, they have often gone out of their way if there has been a problem.

The rooms are quite varied, but as a rule of thumb there are two things I would always advise. Firstly, ask fo a room which faces onto the rear courtyard. Whilst it is tempting to think that rooms at the front of the hotel look out to the city you can actually see very little bar the approach road that links the shore to the island upon which the hotel is built. The rooms to the rear have two advantages. Firstly they tend to be quieter, secondly many of the deluxe rooms have balconies looking into the courtyard. That leads me to my second tip; go for at least a deluxe room but never a suite. The deluxe rooms are worth the extra money, the suites are nothing more than two junior suites connected by interconnecting doors (and, unless there's four of you or you've had a falling out with your billionaire wife, what's the point of that?).

The pool area at the top of the hotel gives excellent views over the sea, harbour and the city. Whilst the pool is small (but I don't think any smaller than many hotels in its class - ie the Claris) the roof area generally has a lovely feel to it. I think this is to do with the fact that you are sufficiently removed from the city to have a degree of tranquility and the fact that there is water all around. In the evening it does not, however, have the charm or the romance of the Claris roof terrace. On the first floor, however, there is a bar in an interior courtyard accessed by a bridge over a shallow pool that is, whilst no more than a modernist box, quite charming. Even so, I would not advise a romantic evening here; possibly just a cocktail before hitting the city.

I have never eaten in the restaurant, but then again why would you? Barcelona has a fantastic array of restaurants for all budgets and the Barcelonetta, which has some truly outstanding seafood/fish restaurants, is a only a short stroll along the harbour. I never understand any criticism of any hotel in Barcelona on the basis of its breakfast, lunch, dinner or lack thereof unless it is so far removed from the city as to make a short stroll to a cafe/bar/restaurant impossible.

In short, this is a great hotel for those wanting to sample the delights of Barcleona in the comfort of a modern, but by no means soulless hotel.

35,Served its purpose really well,"Stayed for three nights in early April 2007 in a Premier room overlooking the City, so a superb view from the small balcony.  The hotel is certainly modern and perhaps appears a bit focused on the business traveller, but we also found it very well appointed and comfortable.  The room was modern and well equiped,  The young staff were all excellent - very friendly, efficient and happy to help.  The location we thought was great -  OK it's a ten minute walk to the bottom of Las Ramblas, but once you have been there for a promenade up and down, you don't really need to do it again (in reality the best bits of Barcelona are slightly further afield) so you are going to be jumping into taxis anyway, and these were plentiful right outside the hotel entrance.  Compared to some hotels we have stayed in in Barcelona the Grand Marina is very quiet, but be prepared for the rumble of the occasional ferry docking or departing from the marina.  Overall, would definitely go back.  But if you want a more quirky boutique hotel then this would be too ""high end corporate"" for you possibly.
",4,2007,04,08
35,Minimalist efficiency but no charm,"Stayed for 2 nights to attend a conference in the hotel.
The position is not great given that it is by the water as it is a long walk to the main areas of interest.
A large modern hotel with no charm whatsoever. Efficient staff and restaurant good. Room was not large but acceptable. Bathroom clean but bath plug broken. Otherwise all OK and lots of hot water.
My room on 2nd floor was quite noisy.....glazing didn't seem to cut out the noise from the outside.
Fine for a business stay but not really ideal for tourists. It has no local charm and could be anywhere in the world. It is expensive and there are other better placed hotels giving better value.

35,Great hotel,"We stayed at the Grand Marina for my 21st birthday.  The rooms were fantastic and spacious.  We had a room that was more like an apartment, although my parents' was slightly smaller.  The view was great and it was ultimately a high class stay.  We had chocolate and strawberries with a bottle of Champagne on arrival which was a lovely touch.  I would definitely stay here again if travelling to Barcelona.  The city itself was fantastic and you are never short of something to do!

35,Five stars for Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel,"My Husband surprised me for my 30th and this was an amazing surprise and definately a 30th to remember.  The hotel itself was at a prime location, within walking distance of many attractions and the sight from our Hotel room was unreal.  The room was very spacious and modern and almost like a 1 bedroom apartment without a kitchen.  On our first night there was champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us.  There was a jacuzzi in our bathroom.  The live entertainment every evening was very relaxing and the Hotel's restaurant menu was absolutely delicious, with very friendly and helpful staff.  I would most definately stay here again and me and my Husband intend to spend one of our anniversaries at a Eurorstars 5* Hotel in future, if not the one in Bareclona

35,Good But Cold,"Just back and it was as expected. Rooms good but poor view. Service excellent. Breakfast was without doubt the best I have ever had EVER EVER. Bar was Soulless are very Expensive €7 for a small beer. Staff very aloof . Location is quiet which is good and bad. The Ramblas is reasonably lively but the people are docile and the taxi's couldn't give a hott about anyone. The rooms were not too expensive and overall i would easilt recommend

35,"5 star, but souless?","Stayed for a conference - so not paying myself. A 5 star hotel. Rooms could accomodate a average sized  family! Very high quality fixtures and fittings, but very clinical. Would suit couples with money to spare looking for luxury. If I was paying I would choose somewhere with a little more personality.

35,"Very clean, friendly staff!!","I think these days five stars are given out a little two easy, don't get me wrong this is a beautiful hotel, very clean and modern, but is not, by my standards, five stars.
I think a five star hotel should leave you a little lost for words, something you don't usually experience, unique!
Anyway great hotel none the less, and would still recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona.

35,This Place is Fablous!,"We arrived on new years day 2007. A last minute decision to leave behind the dreary weather of britain. We arrived at the hotel and was immediately impressed by the welcome. Staff fabulous.Couldnt do enough for us.Room ready even though we arrived earlier than expected.And what a room! It says 5 star and it sure is. The view over the harbour was awesome (ask at reception as not all rooms have the view - we got lucky).Facilites in the room were very traveller friendly.Lovely toiletries, ironing board, hairdrier etc.It was that nice and barcelona that wonderful that we actually stayed an extra night.We had just one little hic-up when the loo broke down one night but we reported it the next morning and when we returned to our room that afternoon it was fixed.We didnt eat in the hotel but we did have drinks in the bar. Expensive but the service and atmosphere is lovely. There is easy internet access at the guest relations area.The hotel is advertised as having a pool (but it unfortunately is the size of a postage stamp) although it doesnt say it is outdoors so we didnt get to swim although we did use the jacuzzi. The sauna isnt communal. There is one in the male and one in the female changing area which it also doesnt say on the hotel blurb which we were a bit disappointed about but it wouldnt deter us from stopping again. The location is also excellent. just a 5 min walk from la rambla the main street. Close enough for comfort but far enough away so no noise and hassle at night. We will definitely be going back!

I can say it was tthe cleanest (all though expensive) hotel ive stayed at. Spotless rooms, fantastic views from balcony. Only downside was the breakfast, not very nice if you like a full english, (stick to continental), but apart from that cant find any faults with it. Everything was in walking distance to hotel for the perfect sightseeing holiday!
",5,2007,01,04
35,"Good, quality hotel","Good, quality hotel.  Large, very quiet, clean rooms with excellent bathrooms and one of the best air conditioning system I ever experienced (also really quiet, why can't the US hotels get it?), good service, good choice of European TV channels.  Actually a surprisingly good location: 10-15 mins walk from the Rambla, stop of a tour bus in front. 

Negatives: not cheap, not particularly attractive from the design/appearence point of view (very modern with a somewhat packaged resort feel at the reception, hallways and rooms, though bathrooms are once again great), in-hotel food options are limited and expensive (restaurant is great, but there is only 1 and it's open late; bar choice limited; breakfast very expensive), bed is indeed hard (for my taste). Also agree with other comments about paying for the music in the room (no radio); this is not the best, at least for expense-concious business traveller...

Overall, very positive.

35,Lovely but EXPENSIVE,"DUBLIN , IRELAND member
We recently had a three night break at the Grand Marina and found it to be faultless in service and quality of food and rooms . The down side of the hotel though is that if your travelling with young children this it not the hotel for you due to the Bar and Resturant area being very formal ( our 2 year old daughter was travelling with us ) , there is a roof top pool which is very small and in our opinion unsafe for any child of any age , there is a railing around the roof which is hip height on a adult and very easy for a child to climb    
A example of the prices were 2 bottles of Heiniken and 2 Gin & Tonics and one open Ibernian Ham sandwich cost  70.00 EURO
But for location and amenities for Barcelona it is excellent with the tourist bus outside the door  , the marina next door , Las Ramblas 5 mins away , the Cable car outside the front door , and last but not least   The Staff were excellent anything that was asked for was done with perfection

35,Dreamers Paradise!,"Went over to Barcelona for a quick weekend with my girlfriend, and found this an absolutely smashing hotel.  Stayed during October, so the pool wasn't in use, but the jacuzzi and sauna were available.  The bathroom in our suite was clean, although we did have a couple of problems keeping the bath full when using the jacuzzi feature.

Most impressive were the beds - probably the most comfortable we have ever slept on.  The pillows are about 3 feet long each, and we literrally were asleep within seconds of going to bed.  Getting up in the mornings was a real struggle!

The operaretta feature in the lounge bar on the Saturday evening was a nice touch, with some fine vocals, and good audience interaction.

We drank from the fountain on La Ramblas, so we will be going back to Barcelona, and I would definitely go back to this hotel.

35,Must Try!!,"We have just returned from a fantastic stay in the Eurostars Grand Marina which i booked for a friends 30th. The hotel is in a prime location beside Port Vell which is less than 100 yds from Las Ramblas.
The rooms are a good size and have magnificent views of Barcelona City.
The bathroom has his/hers sinks and seperate bath/shower/toilet. Bath has jacuzzi function ,which after a hard day of shopping is a must.
The continental breakfast for 30 euros was fantastic with a choice of cereal,pastries,fruitsyoghurts,ham,rolls and freshly squeezed orange juice.
The standard of room is excellent and the decor is very modern. 
Las Ramblas has a very seedy atmosphere about it, especially at the bottom end near the sex shops and peep shows
Catulyna Sq. and Gothic Quarter are a short walk away.

35,"Great hotel, but beds as hard as a rock!","I agree to all of the other positive comments, but if you have a problem with a hard matress, then don't stay in  this hotel. Everything else in this hotel is perfect. In southern Europe people still think that a hard matress is good for your back.

35,Great rooms/service/location  ...,"Spent 2 nights at this hotel recently.

Location is within 10minutes walk of the main city-centre areas,
so within easy walking distance of the hotel. Rooms are excellent - quality of decor, furnishings are very high. Bathroom was even better, whirlpool bath/Bidet were nice touches. Room service food was high-quality & service was professional, prompt & helpful. Small issue at check-in but nothing significant. Lobby is a let-down decor & style-wise (given the class of the hotel) but this is a very minor gripe.
 
Bottom-line, if you're happy paying the room rate, you won't be disappointed with your stay at this hotel.

35,enjoyed stay at the Grand Marina,"Stayed at this hotel for 4 days.  I had requested a marina/port premier room but this was not ready when we arrived at the hotel at 14.00 hours, so they give us another premier room, which was nice but had a front view of the hotel and so was very noisy from ferries docking. There was also a disco in the base of one of the nearby buildings which was noisy as people exited in the early hours at weekends (Both of these noise problems would probably be solved by an ""inner"" room but sacrificing the views)

We booked direct with the hotel and the rate was for room only.
We had breakfast in the World Trade Centre for 4 euros as the hotel breakfast was very expensive.

The hotel staff was excellent.  Each night they recommended restaurants and made our reservations for us.

There is a tourist bus which runs on a pre-planned route around Barcelona which stops outside the hotel about every 10 minutes and stops at regular intervals near to the main attractions all day. This is handy to get around and only costs 18 euros for the day and you can get on and off as you please - good way to rest your feet.

The cable car to Montjuic is also just outside the hotel.

Restuarants are within a short walk and there are plenty to choose from, and the main street La Ramblas is about 5 minutes to walk to. 

There is always a line of taxis outside the hotel if you need one also.

The taxi from the airport was only about 15 minutes and only cost 23 Euros

Positive points: 
+ beautifully furnished, spacious room 
+ the view 
+ big bathroom with separate shower and bathtub
+ porters and hotel staff excellent

Negative points: 
- the roof top swimming pool is small and not heated
- the ferries make a lot of noise
- this hotel is maybe more of a conference hotel
- no tea/coffee making facilities in room
- you had to pay for music in your room!

35,Great stay at the Grand Marina,"We stayed at the Grand Marina for the birthday of my girlfriend for 2 nights in september. I sent an e-mail to ask for an upgrade to a suite the day before leaving. They kindly upgrade us and we also received a bottle of Cava and strawberries covered with chocolate in our room !! they are very attent to all your desires.

Breakfast was realy to die for. What a nice buffet. As the weather was good, we were able to take it on the terrace which was most enjoyable. Location of the hotel is great ! Tourist bus just in front of the hotel, Las Rambles 5 minutes walk, Port Vell 10 minutes walk, plaza real 10 minutes walk : try the restaurant  "" les 15 nits"" : it is fantastic and very cheap also. I understand why you have to queue some time before getting a table !

35,Great Location. some room issues,"We booked this hotel for 5 nights to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary.  We originaly booked a Premier Room but on check in we realised it wasn't quite as described on the website...the sitting area consisted of two uncomfortable chairs facing the room with the backs to the balcony and the view, at least you get a sofa in a Travel Lodge !!  We immediately went to reception to voice our disappointment and were informed we would be upgraded but would have to stay in that room for that night.  We went off into Barcelona to eat and when we returned there were Cava and chocolate covered strawberries in the room with the hotel's compliments...a nice touch.  The next day we were told to leave our key card at reception and collect our new keycard on return. We were assured our luggage would be moved to the new room...it wasn't and we had to go with the bell boy to move it, however the new room, a junior suite was fantastic with a proper sitting area and as the room was on the 7th floor the views over Barcelona were spectacular.  Turn down service in the evening was a bit hit and miss, we got it 3 times out of 5. We had 2 nights where our Hydromassage Bath didn't work due to a loose connection but when we informed reception, both times the maintainance guys were there within 10 mins.!  We opted for a room only rate as we aren't big breakfast eaters and wandered into the City for Breakfast at a different place each day.  The Tourist Bus is a must..such good value and so convienent right outside the hotel.  Make sure you visit the Fountains along with the Gaudi Trail, also the cafe at the top of El Ingles Cortes in the city centre has wonderful views. When we go back to Barcelona we will definately stay here again.

35,Great Location,"We have just returned from a 4 night break to Barcelona. We travelled with 2 children (age 12 & 6).
We booked two interconecting Queen rooms but were upgraded to two suites. The quality of the rooms was excellent, plus great views over Barcelona.
The hotel staff were very friendly and the service was good. We booked directly with the hotel and our room rates included breakfast. This was excellent ,probably one of the best we have ever had in a five star hotel. It is expensive if you do not get it as part of your room rate - about £25/head we think.
The hotel is primarily used by business travellers but nevertheless we found it ok for a family. It is ideally located for the Ramblas , the Cable car and the marina.
We chose the hotel primarily for its pool which was disappointingly small but nevertheless did allow some periods of relaxtion after a busy time sight seeing.
A great factor was the Bus Touristic which stops right outside the hotel, it is a super way of seeing the city.
Would  recommend this hotel as a good base to see Barcelona.

35,Check in problems,"This hotel is in a fabulous location - 2 minutes walk from a cable car and the tourist bus stop and 15 minutes walk from the bottom of Las Ramblas and the port. We had an excellent stay and the breakfast was delicious. The pool, although small, was plenty big enough for the children and it was great to watch the ships come in to port - especially as we were waiting to go on a cruise!
Now to the negative bit:
On booking we had been given a written guarantee that we would have inter-connecting rooms for our 6 and 11 year old but on arrival this was not the case. We did get upgraded to a suite which was fantastic and we had a lovely view of the port but the childrens room was very small and stank of smoke. They also changed this for us but as we were not comfortable with the children staying on their own at such a large and high hotel we each had to share with a child - not the most relaxing break! They also managed to lose a teddy bear in the wash with the sheets and even when found the bear was returned to the wrong room!
We did have a lovely break in Barcelona but the service was a bit lacking for a 5 star hotel.

35,Truly grand at the Grand,"What a great place to stay. Quiet location but less then 10 minutes from La Ramblas (although why people want to go there is a mystery as it is dirty,crowded and full of tourist traps from the relatively innocent to the criminal. See other reviews for details of scams and thefts) and Port Olympic. The tourist bus stops right outside the hotel (22euros for 2 days which covers the main city sights). Overall an excellent location.
The hotel is chic, cool and welcoming and everything is finished to an excellent standard. It does lack Catalan atmosphere but it scores on quality and convenience and the rooftop views are spectacular. We stayed in a Premier room which had a large king size bed and a marble bathroom with jacuzzi bath, twin sinks and walk in shower. On arrival the jacuzzi bath wasn't working but was rapidly fixed and we were sent wine, water and chocolates by way of apology. A nice gesture.
The breakfast was included in our room rate and proved to be a good move. The buffet was excellent both in quality and variety. The restaurant staff were excellent indeed all staff we encountered were very helpful and courteous as you would expect.
I travelled with my wife and  5 years old daughter and in this part of the city we felt safe. We previously stayed at the Hilton near Barcelona football ground which is also a safe part of the city. I have to say there are some areas I would not wish to stay i.e La Rambla, Placa de Catalunya and parts of El Raval which all take a turn for the worse at night. Port Vell is on the doorstep with it's shopping mall, aquarium, mini fun fair and restaurants so it was ideal to stroll over there in the evening and have things to do that we could all enjoy to varying degrees. The beaches are about 15 minutes walk away or you can use the tourist bus.
The highlight for me apart from the overall Barcelona experience (it truly is a great city) was simply wandering around the Gothic quarter and sampling the atmosphere.
We will be back and while tempted to maybe stay close to Passeig de Gracia next time (just to get a third perspective) I think in the end if I can get the right deal again (we paid 200 euros per night including breakfast) I would stay at the Grand again. Make your reservation with confidence.

35,Top Shelf,"We stayed at this hotel because of the high ratings given by previous reviewers and we were not disappointed. 

The location is excellent - close to Las Ramblas but away from the noise. The rooms were modern and tasteful - the bathrooms were awesome, multijet showers, separate bath. The views over the water back to Barcelona were spectactular. It was normal to see cruise ships dock alongside the hotel which adds colour to the experience. The restaurant is of a high class but there is only one in the hotel so to have variety one needs to go to the city for evening meals. However, in the World Trade Centre below the hotel there are several bistro type eating places where one can find good value breakfast and lunch. 

When next in Barcelona, we would defintely stay here again.
",5,2006,08,12
35,Excellent hotel - some air con issues,"Really enjoyed our stay at the hotel which is conveniently located at the World Trade Center. Rooms comfy and spacious. Free internet and wi-fi in the first floor lobby/bar. Only complaint is that the hotel seems to have a policy of restricting the air conditioning during the day when the corridors are cooler than the rooms!
",4,2006,08,04
35,Lovely Contemporary Hotel,"Stayed at the Grand Marina with my husband between the 19th - 23rd July to celebrate our 17th wedding anniversary.  I contacted the hotel via e-mail the week before to request a room with a city view and received a confirmation e-mail from reservations saying they would try their best.  On arrival at 12 noon, the very efficient and friendly receptionist told us that not only was our room ready (unexpected, as we'd read reviews here that check-in time was 3pm) but we had been upgraded to a deluxe room.  Our room was beautiful and extremely large, the bathroom in particular was a treat with walk-in shower and a separate bath with jacuzzi.   The hotel itself is very modern and I suppose could be described (as it has been) as being primarily a business hotel, however, I feel it is more than that.  One benefit of being out of the main tourist hotel area is the fact that you get a peaceful nights sleep yet it's only a 5/10 minute walk from the end of Las Ramblas.  The breakfasts were nice with everything you could really want and to suit all nationalities, the service was excellent.  We loved Barcelona and had a great time experiencing most of the attractions, my favourite thing though had to be wandering through the narrow little streets of the Barri Gotic and in particular enjoying a tapas lunch in one of the leafy squares with the sound of chiming church bells in the background - wonderful.

Check-out at the hotel was speedy and efficient.  However, the return journey marked the only negative of our whole trip.  We travelled with Monarch Scheduled and experienced a 9 hour delay which meant spending almost the entire night in a hot airport with no information or advice with regard to compensation (apparantly due to recent EU Legislation you are entitled to a refund on your ticket if delayed over 5 hours, overnight accommodation and two free phone calls home - none of which Monarch disclosed - obviously) - we are currently making a claim but nevertheless would avoid Monarch again in the future especially as we have since learnt they are renowned for long delays.

Despite the above, we had a fabulous time and would strongly recommend this hotel and indeed vibrant Barcelona for a break.
",5,2006,08,01
35,Grand Marina - the best so far,"I stayed at the Grand Marina with my husband who was there for business for a couple of days. Overall, the experience was really great!

Positive sides: 
+ beautifully furnished, modern, spacious room (even though it was a standard room)
+ the view towards the city
+ big bathroom with separate shower and bathtub
+ wonderful and varied breakfast (especially the jamón iberico and fresh fruit were great)
+ good sound isolation

Negative sides: 
difficult to find anything major, but some small things: 
- the jacuzzi did not work, but we didn't bother to contact the reception
- the roof top swimming pool is small
- on mornings the ferries make some noise
- this hotel is maybe more of a conference hotel, but it's suitable for tourists as well

This was my first 5-star experience, and I enjoyed it very much. =)
",5,2006,07,29
35,Loved it,"Initially booked another hotel in Barcelona but decided to change to the Eurostars.  Glad we did because it is a fabulous hotel, very modern and clean with friendly staff in all areas, not the usual surly spanish we have encountered in other parts of Spain.  We asked for an early check in which we didnt get (seems to be impossible as other reviewers have had the same problem) but did get  the requested sea view, high floor. Cava and chocolate coated strawberries in the room and a free drink each in the bar were nice touches.  Room was excellent.  Large and airy, huge bathroom with jacuzzi bath and double sinks but only a hand held shower over the bath, very strange.  It was described as a superior room but I think a superior room is their basic room.  Breakfast looked nice but cant comment as we didnt eat there as it was £15 each.  We had breakfast in the World Trade Centre behind the hotel for £5 each.  Did eat dinner there one evening and the service was outstanding.  I am a vegetarian and was offered three or four options which were not on the menu.  This is very unusual here in England but unheard of in Spain.  Cost was what you would expect in a high class restaurant, cant remember exactly how much but it certainly wasnt a rip off.  Overall wouldnt hesitate to recommend this hotel, cost £238 for two nights through Bargainholidays and was well worth it. Suspect it may be cheaper to book directly with the hotel.  Location is five minutes walk from Las Ramblas which must be seen.  Dozens of street entertainers and cafe bars and restaurants.  We had been warned about crime in this area but didnt see any at all, felt very safe wondering round late at night.  Tourist bus stopped right outside the hotel and was an ideal way to see Barcelona but be prepared to queue.  Overall it was a fabulous weekend break and we wouldnt hesitate to stay at the Marina again.
",5,2006,07,24
35,A pleasant stay,"The room was very comfortable, nicely decorated, with a closet area and a large bathroom.
Breakfast was good, with a wide variety of sweet and savoury choices.

It's primarily a business hotel and very large, but all in all a good choice. Cannot comment on the price as it was a company trip, but I'm sure it's not cheap.

It's situated at the edge of a 'quay' so be sure to know the way back, otherwise you may find yourself walking a very long way...
",4,2006,07,10
35,"OK, but seen better for the price","We stayed at this hotel for one night on July 1st, and were not too impressed. First of all, we could not get our room until 3:30 pm, although we had checked-in at 11:00 in the morning. We had payed 300 euros for a city suite, and were pretty turned off by the reception staff who only found it normal that the room was not cleaned so late in the afternoon?

The room itself was very nice looking, and offered a great view of the city. We went out for dinner, as we are familiar with Barcelona and wanted to go to a special restaurant we enjoy. When we got back around 11:00 pm, we asked if we could order a crema catalana and coffee. It took three staff members and a few phone calls before they finally agreed. And they call this a 5+ star?! We also asked for some information on the shopping  tax refund, nobody knew what we were talking about.

We thought this hotel is really for conventions and business travellers. We have traveled quite a bit around the world, and this hotel does not deserve 5+ stars. You can get much better service and attention from lower rated hotels.
",3,2006,07,03
35,"Eurostar a good hotel, but not for the value minded","We stayed at the hotel for a pre cruise adventure.  The Eurostar was very, very nice.  However for the price, I thought it could have been better.  We paid over 350.00 for one night.  The room was on the small side, we usually stay in suite hotels in the states and the carribean. The bathroom was wonderful. I must say this bathroom even beats the best hotels in LasVegas!  The staff was very helpful and spoke english w/o problem  Great location as well.  The costs of the food wayyyy to high.  We ventured out about a 5 min walk and came to a great cafe' with wonderful food, and cheep.  It looked like the locals ate there.  We found Barcelona to be very safe, and the area around the hotel appeared to be fine as well.  We had an inside room and about 2 am, the night club let out and the noise was very loud, for about 1 hour.  We had a good say, but again, for the price, I did expect more.
",4,2006,07,02
35,Grand at the Grand!,"stayed there recently with some friends, fine hotel, helpful staff, nice rooms, & good service.  Location is failry central but away from the madness. Views from some rooms are stunning

Only downside as far as I could see is that the pool is tiny, so dont expect to be doing many laps
",5,2006,06,01
35,Good hotel,"This is a very good hotel. Overlooking the port with nice balconies I suggest u got a room with city view. It is much better.
We arrived there. Lobby was really nice, however, the receptionists had a huge problem with their English. Very poor language skills. Quite jolly people. Went to our room (just a standard one). It was very stylish and big. Bathroom was nice and balcony was very pleasant overlooking the city. Quite centrally located (not right in the centre but not too bad either) this is one of the nice hotels in the area. Don t forget to visit the lovely bar and the exterior toward the world trade centre. 
Just a tip. We went end of May. Website shows a lovely air lounge with a swimming pool. In fact there was nothing up there (dont know whther it was too early) apart from the pool and some lounges. Good facilities, gym etc, however no towels provided ot any staff present.
",4,2006,05,30
35,Stunning Barcelona Views!,"Flown some 18 hours from Singapore into Barcelona, and spent two nights from 4 - 6 May in the Eurostars Grand Marina, under its Celebration Package - a Deluxe room with free breakfasts, water, fruits, Cava wine, Casino entrance tickets. Our requests for an earlier check in was not met with, and only allowed to check in at 2pm. However, other requests for a higher floor, quiet room with superb ocean views was met with, thus quite happy. 

Room was huge, with a closet area, balcony area and a huge bath room. Everything is modern and yet functional in the room. Breakfast was even better than the 5 star Ritz in Madrid - with the widest selection of bread, cakes, cold cuts, fruits, hams, eggs. And the lounge area, which is just outside the breakfast area, has Wi-fi, which allows free internet access! Just bring your own laptop and you are connected to the world. 

The only downside I found is, the closest subway is a good 10 minutes walk away. If you are fresh in the early morning, having rested well the night before, its fine. Otherwise, it would just be taking taxis whenever you want to go out or coming back. Fortunately, unlike Madrid, taxis are in abundance in Barcelona, and the charges are reasonable, too. 

Currently, in May 2006, the cable car in Montjuic is under repairs. After the tram ride, it is advisable to take a taxi up to the Montjuic Castle, otherwise, you would have to spend the next 20-25 minutes, climbing up a hill. The Castle is, however, nothing much to see but the views at the top, are to die for. So for the next few months in 2006, for those wanting to travel up the Montjuic, be forewarned. 

Lastly, most guidebooks would recommend to take a train to Vallcarca station to visit Parc Guell. However, its a long and tiring climb up a hill (though there are escalators along some sections), then down the down hill again, before you can finally visit Parc Guell from its back. This is the most silly way to visit, we thought, very cumbersome and tiring indeed. The best way would be to take a cab, which is inexpensive, directly to the Parc's main entrance, that's it!

Overall, loved Barcelona for its fresh Mediterranean air, and stunning ocean views. Most importantly, unlike in Madrid, the place is not overly crowded and taxis are easily hailed from the street. Good Barcelona stay indeed.

35,"Super staff, super views","I had invited my parents to the Grand Marina, and the experience was spectacular: starting with the welcome chanpagne (I had only mentioned that the travel was a birthday present), the service continued to be outstanding. In some high class hotels the staff may be a bit arrogant, but not here - they were all more than ready to answer questions and help out. The breakfast terrace is stunning too - orange trees on the second floor- truly nice. 
Just one little thing to be aware of: some rooms looks to the world trade center and therefore don't have city views and, if you have the city view, the harbour activities can be a bit noisy - but that's the price for such a central location and being close to the sea at the same time. At least you can open the windows (unlike at the Arts Hotel). Fabulous experience - I'd go there again any time.
",5,2006,05,17
35,Great Hotel.Friendly excellent service,"We chose Eurostars Gran Marina after looking at tripadvisor reviews. We stayed for 4 nights 19-23rd April as birthday celebration. Requests for a room on a high floor with a sea view were met although we were on the side where the big ships dock so our view was obscured (yes even on the 6th floor!! ) when the big ships docked.We were also treated to cava and chocolate covered strawberries on arrival which was lovely. The room was beautiful, frequently cleaned and beds turned down.We stayed on St Georges Day and were given a book and rose which is traditional .
I loved the location and the ambience of the hotel it felt very light and spacious and was breath of freshness after the bustling city however it was still just 5 mins walk to the bottom of the Ramblas.
We had breakfast in the hotel one morning which was very good there are also plenty of good local cafes.
All the staff went out of their way to be helpful and friendly.
",5,2006,04,23
35,Enjoyed This Hotel,"This is a sleek, contemporary hotel located on the Barcelona waterfront, which is a great place to spend some time. Rooms are large and immaculate.  Just about every toiletry article you can imagine is supplied in the all marble bath. The hotel is well located just a 10 minute walk from the bottom of La Rambla -- close to the action but quiet at night.  Paid a little less than 200€ per night.
",5,2006,04,22
35,Excellent room,"My wife and I stayed at the Grand Marina for 3 nights in April 2006. We travel a lot but don't usually spend as much as this on a hotel (170 Euro a night, room only). But it turned out to be an excellent choice, and worth the money.

I booked direct with the hotel, selecting the cheapest type of room. What we got was excellent, a room on the 7th floor, at the front of the hotel with superb views over the city and harbour. You could see the bottom of La Rambla (5 minutes walk away), and in the distance the Sagrada Familia was visible.

I think we got lucky here, because I would have expected the lowest priced rooms to be facing the offices/courtyard at the back. The hotel did seem quiet, maybe that's why.

The room was very comfortable, and nicely designed and decorated. Very peaceful too, and you could even slide a partition to shut off the doorway/bathroom area. No noise from outside, apart from the rumbling of the engines of cruise ships and ferries that would come and go.

The room has a safe, and the TV had the BBC News and Sky News channels in English.

Bathroom was huge and well stocked with toiletries, not to mention dressing gowns and slippers. The bath took a long time to fill, but the optional jacuzzi jets made it worth the wait.

On arrival we got a voucher for a glass of cava at the hotel bar, very modern and spacious. Luckily the voucher actually allowed us a free glass each (and a bowl of poppadom snacks) because it would have been very expensive to buy anything there. And as for the minibar, just don't go there. We bought bottles of water while out exploring.

We also didn't think it was worth paying £15 each for breakfast. Looked very nice, but there are a few cafes just behind the hotel.

The staff were very friendly, helpful and efficient. They also speak great English, unlike the locals you encounter in shops, restaurants, taxis etc. English tends to be their 3rd or 4th language, but it was never a real problem.

Out and about, the tourist bus is a good way of seeing the city, but it is slow and crowded. If you know exactly where you want to go, use the excellent Metro.

Barcelona is a vibrant and interesting city, and the Grand Marina was a good base for exploring it.
",5,2006,04,17
35,Great Location Hotel - Eurostars,"Stayed in this hotel mid March for 4 nights for a leisurely weekend with my husband.  It was our first trip to Barcelona and this hotel was recommended by a friend who had stayed there for the New Year.
It lived up to our expectations which were quite high.  We stayed in a Premier Room and it was worth the upgrade as the standard superior looked to be much smaller.  It was like a mini suite as each area of the room is divided by leather sliding partitions.  The bathroom was my favourite with a big jacuzzi bath and double sinks - leading into a seperate room containing a double shower with jets all over the place!! 
The view was stunning from the balcony and we had a seperate sitting room with table and chairs.
Definitely a place to visit if you spend a bit of time in the room in your robe and slippers!
The facilities in the hotel were good, gym is small but has most of the necessary equipment.  Swimming pool was closed and looked to be tiny so not for those who want to laze by the pool.  There was a seperate jacuzzi in the gym which was available but also very small.  
My one problem with the hotel was the price of food and drink which was quite expensive.  I think they would get a lot more business from guests if they reduced the price of eating there.  When you compare it to other 5 star hotels in the area it was a bit too dear.  Our air conditioning was on the blink also so the room appeared to be warm all the time but we just opened the balcony door.
Hope you enjoy your stay and we would definitely go back.
",5,2006,03,31
35,Excellent if a little lacking in character,"Stayed with a friend in two rooms. Spotless, very nicely decorated hotel with nautical theme. Service faultless. Few minutes walk from La Rambla.

Problem with booking when we arrived so upgraded with no fuss to two adjoining suites with port/city views at no extra cost. Rooms large and sophisticated. Bathroom huge with superb shower and hydro bath.

Breakfast excellent - service outstanding. Did not eat lunch or dinner at hotel so can't comment. 

Front of house good, porters fantastic - helpful with a smile.

Would not stay here with my children or in a young crowd looking for a lively time, but excellent for business or friends/couples.
",5,2006,03,22
35,"Good Location, friendly Hotel","Just got back 17th March 2006. Stayed 3 nights on a room only basis. Room very spacious & modern, good bathroom with all the usual freebies + hairdrier.
Staff very friendly & helpful, all speak english.
Only negative from our stay was the Breakfast (fabulous but expensive £15 each), better alternative is to go directly behind the hotel where all the business people working on the marina eat, cereal coissants, orange juice & coffee only £4 pp & is good quality.
Also Mini bar 5 euros for a can of coke, suggest buy from many supermarkets just off las ramblas for less than 1 eruo.
A good way to find out all the sites quickly, is to get a day pass or 2 day(which we got) on the tour bus
which has a stop right outside the hotel, before getting on go the the hotels conierge desk they will give you a discount voucher that takes 2 euro PP off the price.
Places to visit we found Parc Guell on the Red route of the tour bus great, there is plenty of places to just chill out & relax & have a beer or something to eat.
Eating out- avoid port Vell opposite the Hotel, most resturants are part of chains food not good & slow service. Go a bit futher along if you want authentic Spanish resturants  near the Muse d'historia de Catalunya, great resturants.
Be carefull not to get ripped off in las ramblas in the outside resturants, the food looks reasonable but no prices are published for drinks. We paid £15 for 2 orange juices, which was as much as the food for a small tapas for 2.
Overall great break, tempreture average 16-18 over our stay. Would go back.
We had a great 3 day break
",5,2006,03,18
35,spring break,"premier room very spacious, we requested a balcony, but this is really only necessary for a stay later in the season when it would be warm enough to sit outside.
If on holiday do not stay in an inner room, it's a waste staying in such a luxurious hotel without the great views of the outer rooms.
Room service,food & drink very expensive in the hotel, but on one night a special gallician dinner menu for two with wine cost us €111, and was the best meal we had in Barcelona.
Hotel location is excellent, tourist bus and taxi's right outside, Maremagnum shopping centre and restaurants etc a short walk away over a footbridge.
Also treat yourself to the breakfast in the hotel, even though €21 it is really excellent.

35,Good and Comfortable hotel,"We decided to spend Christmas and New Year in Barcelona and decided on the Hotel Gran Marina - less than a 10 minute walk from the old port to the Ramblas.I planned it was quieter than being right amongst the action in the town or Ramblas.

I got a good deal over the holiday period - surprisingly better than all the online hotel finders, by going directly to the hotel itself. We did book it in July but it was a good lesson in that all the ""cheapest deals"" offers are not always the cheapest. 

Closer to the holiday I ordered some flowers for the room as a present for my wife and even though the hotel already had my credit card details as part of the booking process, they wanted payment up front and I had to mail photocopies of my passport and credit card. I was unhappy at this risky exercise and it certainly was not what I expected from a 5 star hotel.
I also wanted to reserve a table for New Year's Eve and this also was subject to the send payment up front process.

We arrived to a friendly welcome and a very comfortable King Premier room, which I had requested at the front of the hotel so that there was a view of the city and waterfront. The rear of the hotel faces into a large inner square, bounded by office buildings and does not have any views.

Breakfast was good at a fixed 15 euros for a help yourself comprehensive buffet but if you only wanted a coffee and a croissant, it was still 15 euros.
We ate most breakfasts by having a short walk to the Ramblas and trying the different bars and restaurants there.

The hotel is on a large arm that projects into the port area and it is a very busy ferry terminal as well as cruise ships port - presumably many cruises in the summer. This did cause some continuous noise during the evening and early morning. There was also a disco in the base of one of the nearby buildings which was noisy as people exited in the early hours at weekends (and summer ?). Both of these noise problems would probably be solved by an ""inner"" room but sacrificing the views - you pays your money and takes your choice.
Room was very comfortable, complementary cava and chocolate strawberries on arrival (absolutely recommended) and there were fresh sheets put on the enormous bed every day by a very efficient maid service.

A relaxing and very friendly bar lounge and a roof top area that would be great in summer - just a little cool in the December sunshine.
The door staff also worked hard and responded to quips and jokes.

Reception and Concierge were overall friendly but not very efficient. We tried to book for Christmas Lunch and were told that there wasn't a table available, then there was, then one concierge team did not pass on our booking for 2 days to reserve a table. When Christmas lunch came, a very well prepared 4 course meal, there were only 4 tables in the whole restaurant occupied - you don't expect to be given this sort of run around in a 5 star hotel !
Concierge had advised us that there were some areas in the city that needed to be avoided and that very late at night we should phone Reception, who would send a taxi for us. We went to Christmas Eve midnight mass in the old Cathedral and on exiting after 1am we phoned for a taxi. The response was "" very busy, not many taxis, you'll have to walk, I can't help you"" !!!
I would be dismayed if a 3 star hotel staff member told me he couldn't help me but when a 5 star hotel Reception member tells you that, then I question their commitment to guest service. We walked home and did arrive safely but it was the low point of the stay.

Because we were staying for a 3 week period the hotel requested me to settle an interim bill half way through, something that puzzled me as I had given them my credit card detils back in July (and had posted them with my passport details). Anyway I paid it but found on my return home that they had debited the amount twice on the same day and even though they refunded it a few days later, it had sent my bank account into the red and I had to pay bank charges on it - so much for 5 star efficiency !

Overall - yes we enjoyed the stay despite the hotel's failings and I think this was made up for by the atmosphere in Barcelona. It was buzzing in December, so goodness knows what its like in the height of summer. We had read about the ""iffy"" areas and the scam merchants but our impression was that the city takes it's tourism seriously, there were always police about (not in an unnerving way) and the streets were always clean ( we saw street sweepers cleaning up at 1-30am on Christmas morning !) They are making big efforts to further ""clean up"" the old areas and overall we felt safe and relaxed, even on the metro - which is a fabulous system, as indeed is all the transport set up. Just be aware it is a big tourist city and keep your wits about you - don't flaunt money or cameras, etc..

The Barcelona people are a strange breed. We came across waiters who were unfriendly to the point of hostility but if you just accept this as some city quirk and let it go over your head, then its quite fun to be really friendly to someone who is having a permanently bad day, every day. The friendliest waiters and bar staff are the ones from out of town!
One tip - check your change, as many waiters and taxi drivers decide what tip you are giving before you have thought about it and take it upfront !!

Barcelona - yes, loved it - the difficulties just made the experience more interesting !!!

35,Nautical but nice,"The Grand Marina hotel is perfectly placed for enjoying the best bits of Barcelona. Its a big, smart, international, slightly-like-being-in-an-Ocean-liner hotel with gently curving wood panelled corridors and beautifully fitted rooms. We had a junior deluxe suite - expensive but fab with a shower to die for and bags and bags of space - at a premium in Barcelona. We loved the clothes storage area, the settees and the table overlooking the balcony. The hotel is at the bottom of Las Ramblas, 5 mins walk to the Gothic Quarter and 10 mins to the trendy Born area with its funky bars and restaurants. There are trendier hotels but not many with great big rooms within walking-supper-off distance to the Born / the Gothic Quarter. Internet is extra and a bit pricey. We bought croissants, coffee and orange juice from a small cafe in the trade centre for breakfast most days - hotel breakfast is lovely but expensive. Save your money for tapas and great meals out.

35,Chic!,"We stayed two nights at Grand Marina at a promotional price (160 € per night for a double room). For that amount, the hotel is excellent value. Rooms are large and elegantly decorated, bathrooms are wonderful (jacuzzi and massage shower, all posssible amenities). We found the staff very nice and friendly. We did not take breakfast because we found it expensive as we are not used to eating a lot in the morning. We went to a coffeeshop (""Fresh and Ready"") at the centre of the WTC, 20 mts from the hotel door.  
The only problem we had was with the noise from a ship that anchors in front of the hotel. For this reason, even though with a room on the outside you have a great view, we preferred to change to a room on the courtyard, which was very quiet.

35,Great city - superb hotel!,"Just got back from Barcelona yesterday, 11/02/06, and have no complaints about this hotel at all.
The location of the hotel is great and makes for a nice break from all the hustle and noise of La Ramblas. If possible request an outward facing room (towards the city) as the hotel at the rear only faces into the center of the World Trade Center.
The staff are friendly and informantive and helped with any questions we had.
The room we had was huge with a bath & a walk in shower, bedroom and lounge area and a balcony - the rooms was always immaculate when we arrived back at the hotel in the evening and the beds were even turned down after arriving back from a night out.
There is a tourist bus which runs on a pre-planned route around Barcelona which stops outside the hotel about every 10 minutes and stops at regular intervals near to the main attractions all day. This is handy to get around and only costs 18 euros for the day and you can get on and off as you please - good way to rest your feet.
The cable car to Montjuic is also just outside the hotel.
Restuarants are within a short walk and there are plenty to choose from, and the main street La Ramblas is about 5 minutes to walk to. There is always a line of taxis outside the hotel if you need one also.
The taxi from the airport was only about 15 minutes and only cost 23 Euros.

35,Excellent Hotel!!!!,"stayed at this hotel in august 2005.  had a room with city view, amazing at night.  rooms were spacious and clean with dressing room, seperate shower and massage bath.  Breakfast good and plentiful.  Reception staff were very helpful especially booking tables at nice restaurants.  I recommend eating at a restaurant called 'les quinze nuits' because it was really good value and food was very nice.  Try the squid ink rice, looks horrible, but extremely tasty!!!!  Taxi drivers in Barcelona are quite honest compared to other destinations.  Overall Barcelona is beautiful and hotel was excellent.  Highly Recommended!!!!",5,2006,02,02
35,Excellent hotel for the price,"We stayed for ten days over Thanksgiving.  The king room was modern, beautiful and comfortable with a lovely, but narrow, terrace facing the city.  The hotel and room were extremely clean.  The bath was luxurious and the plush bathrobes and slippers were a nice touch.  We received delicious chocolates in our room on arrival and coupons for free glasses of cava from the hotel bar.  

The hotel was significantly, $100+ per night, less expensive than other comparable hotels.  And some of the others, like Hotel Arts, are not walking distance to many sites.

The hotel does try to make the money up in the prices charged for food, telephone calls or Internet usage, but we tended to try to avoid those charges.  We generally had an inexpensive, but good, breakfast in one of the cafeterias surrounding the hotel and the WTC office buildings.  However, Sundays they are closed and ordering two coffees brought to the room was like $15 and not big coffees either. The phone call prices were also ridiculous.  I would recommend using the phones at the Internet cafes for both local and long distance.  

My biggest complaint was that there is no answering machine on the room phones, so it was very difficult to receive messages.  When a call comes in, the hotel forwards the call to the room, letting it ring.  If there is no answer, the caller must call back and ask to leave a message and then someone will bring a written message up to the room.  Kind of like the Pony Express days.

The front desk staff, doormen and bellmen are very professional and courteous.  Room service was laser fast.  The concierge is on the second floor, not at lobby level, which I found a little odd.

The location is excellent.  It is an easy (less than fifteen minutes) walk to Las Ramblas, Maremagnum, Barceloneta or The Born.  The tourist bus and the funicular also stop right in front of the hotel.

Note that the hotel was very quiet when we were there and it is a little dark walking back late at night.  Although we didn't feel unsafe, it is perhaps better to take a taxi.  They are plentiful and inexpensive.

All in all, excellent hotel for the price and we would definitely stay there again.

Tip: our favorite restaurants were Paco Alcalde in Barceloneta for excellent seafood, expect to be treated like family, and Asador Aranda for lamb.  We went to Aranda in Tibidabo and in the city center and found the food more amazing in the city.",5,2006,01,31
35,Excellent Choice,"We stayed here to celebrate my husband's birthday, after reading the reviews on this site.  It was an excellent choice.  Buffet breakfast is well worth it and sets you up for the day.  We booked direct with the hotel, which worked out the same as Expedia, but in a superior room and with breakfast thrown in.  We also received the complimentary Cava and chocolate dipped strawberries, which was a very nice touch.  The room was very clean and comfortable, bathroom luxurious and with a nice selection of toiletries, slippers and robes.  We had a room on the eighth floor (great views of the port and city), near to the gym (looked well equipped), the hot tub (great after walking round Barcelona all day) and the roof terrace and pool, which being Jan was closed, although this wasn’t a problem for us.  Service was great.
The hotel is a short walk (5-10 mins) away from the nearest metro and the port end of the Ramblas. Taxis are also frequent. We found the best restaurants within walking were at the Palace du Mar, along the sea front about 10-15 mins stroll. (But you need to book).  The MareMagnum shopping centre is around a 5-10 min stroll from the hotel. We found this a great base to stay and sightsee the city.  Would recommend wholeheartedly.

35,"Lovely breakfast buffet, nice bathrooms and very clean. But much noise.","My wife and I stayed at this Hotel this week (jan. 06)for three nights. First impression was great. The location of the hotel is very nice (a pleasent walk from the Metro, but a cab only costs 20 dollars from the airport during the day). The view from many rooms including ours were greate as you can see Barcelona and the habour. We had payed 500 euros to sleep there, including a very nice breakfast buffet every morning from 7-11 am. The room is kept very clean every day. The bathrooms are very nice, and especially the spa-function is nice.

At 01.30 the first night all the good things from above, kind of left our midns. Our next door neighbors came home. Actually it was just a guy unpacking his suitecase and getting into bed, but it was like being in there with him. The walls must be made out of paper. I do not think that loud people normally goes to a 5 star hotel, but at this one thats not the point. You could hear if someone was just breathing normally next door. I could not imagine how it would be if someone realy noisy ever stayed at this hotel (earplugs not enough, tried that).

All in all its a good hotel, but if your sensitive to noise, then pick another hotel in Barcelona.

35,Post christmas stay better than the arts,"I stayed at this hotel just after christmas with my wife. The service was fantastic, and I told them it was my anniversary and they sent a bottle of reserva cava and chocolate covered strawberries.

The staff remembered our name throughout our stay and remembered my newspaper choice and placed it on my breakfast table every morning.

Don't be put off by the modernist look and sharp corners of the decor, it is made up for with the best in traditional and proper 5 star service.

35,We wil be back,"I have stayed in Grand Marina before with work this time I was with my wife and it was top class it is not the place that makes this hotel it is diffently the staff very very welcoming and helpful. We stayed in a standard room which was top class what a view over Barcelona which I requested the sea side. As the stay was between Christmas and new year we got a free bottle of cava in our room. The only downside as the hotel is so new it has ultra modern style sharp corners every where my be a little cold but the staff are so friendly and all speak english this is not so bad. very central location near Ramblas. Glad it was to cold to use the swimming pool as it is so small The hot tub with a view on the top floor made up for that !!! We will be back here for sure on our top list for sure

35,Great staff and suite,"The staff is really nice and helpful> Location is great as you can easily walk to the old city and also up the Montjuic hill. The bed and pillows were a Dream, bathroom great (jacuzzi and power shower), suite was stunning, big and very clean.
The only down side is the hotel restaurant : the chef is trying too hard to be original with scary reasults ! About room service, just avoid the hamburger, the club sandwich is really good as well as the soups ! Anyway Barcelona has so many wonderful restaurants to suit all tastes and budgets : you must try the following ones : Organic (vege), Mama cafe (popular fun and good), Re-Pla (fusion and great lighting), Semproniana (incredible fusion and deco), Matsuri (thai, not expensive).
This is a great value hotel for a lovely city.

35,5+ Stars for this hotel,"We took a city break from London to Barcelona 26 Dec - 28 Dec 05, and booked this hotel as part of an Expedia deal. Given the price (around USD 400 less than its 5-star competitors for two nights), I expected we'd find something terrible once we arrived. 

Instead, we were thrilled with our stay.  

PROS: 
- The front desk staff was courteous and efficient (and fluent in English). 
- Our room, a Superior king, was huge, beautifully decorated, and immaculate.  
- The multi-head power shower was a special treat for Americans in Europe (as we usually have trouble finding a good shower in even the best hotel!).  
- The breakfast buffet, at USD 24/person, was well worth the cost: it included everything from kumquats to silver dollar pancakes to scrumptious pastries and homemade breads. Champagne and strawberries were also available. Waitstaff was extremely courteous and attentive with refills of some of the best coffee I've tasted.
- Transportation is plentiful.  The Bus Turistic (a tour bus that takes you all over the city) stops right in front of the hotel, and cabs/hire cars were always waiting.  

CONS:
-If you book this hotel, ask for a city view, or an *unobstructed* water view. We were placed in a room facing the courtyard, which means you are peering into the offices of the World Trade Center.  
- The ""king"" room consisted of two double beds pushed together.   
- If you want to walk out your hotel's front door and be in the center of bars/restaurants, this is not your best choice. It is located about 10-15 min walk from touristy parts of La Rambla.  (The walk, however, is beautiful.)",5,2005,12,28
35,Nowhere near 5 stars,"Stayed for one night and that was more than enough.  The shower was cold and the hydrobath didn't work.  The breakfast from room service that was charged at 93 EUROS!!!!! was cold and had to be sent back.  There was a nightclub under our room which played music that got louder as the night went on and didn't end until after 4am.  The night staff's response was to ask us if we wanted to move rooms when I complained at 1.30am and told us not to worry it would be over by 3am.
Worst of all was the complete lack of interest when we complained to the staff.  The hotel might look impressive but the management and staff are obviously lacking the knowledge, experience and frankly the effort to make this a 5 star experience for their guests.

35,fantastic,"This was a treat for my wifes 30th birthday and WOW it did not let us down, the hotel is fantastic in all ways from the extremely attentive staff to the unbeliveable cleanliness to the cutting edge design and decour. All in all a fabulous hotel suited to anyone who enjoys a little luxury.

35,Highly recommended!!,"My girlfriend and I have just returned (yesterday actually) from a 3 night stay at the Grand Marina and have to say this is the best hotel we have ever stayed in. This was our first trip to Barcelona and the hotel is located in a perfect position for seeing all the sights and has plenty of places to eat and drink within a short walk. The staff and service was excellent and nothing was too much trouble. A perfect example of this being when I asked reception for 2 more pillows and a travel adaptor for the plug socket (because I forgot to take one!). Within 5 minutes both items had arrived at my room without any fuss whatsoever. Prior to our trip we stayed overnight at the Hilton hotel next to Stansted aiport and the difference in class was very noticable. The Hilton doesn't come close to the service we received at the Grand Marina and hotels in the UK could learn alot by seeing how they treat their guests here. One tip I would offer is prior to your arrival contact the hotel and request a room overlooking the harbour. We stayed in room 608 which had such a beautiful view you didn't want to leave the room! As for the rooms themselves, well what can I say. We were very impressed with the size of the rooms and my girlfriend became especially fond of the massage facilities on the bath! We loved every minute of our stayed in this wonderful hotel and loved Barcelona so much we are planning to return again very soon!

35,Great Hotel with Extremely Nice People,"We stayed here for 2 nights before a cruise - everyone from the front desk workers, the doormen, the waiters, maids, etc. were extremely nice and helpful - a nice way to start a vacation.

35,Great Hotel,"Stayed in this hotel for four nights while celebrating my husband's birthday. I booked a ""Celebration Package"" directly from the hotel and found it the cheapest after trawling the usual websites. This included a superior room, breakfast and Cava and chocolate strawberries on arrival. A nice touch! Stressed that we would like a nice view in 2 seperate e-mails but got no reply, so  phoned them the night before we left home. On arrival, the receptionist upgraded our room and we were delighted with our view of the port. This is a very nice hotel; the breakfast is to die for and the champagne and strawberries (no extra charge!) every morning set us up very nicely for the day!!! It has everything you would expect of a 5 star hotel (robes, toiletries, decent sized room), and the can-do attitude of the staff was far better than in some other hotels we stayed in. However, if I were to note a complaint, it would be the stained, smelly carpet on floor 4, obviously from a leak of some sort, but still unpleasant. Also, the lobby is a bit concrete and bare, giving a false impression of the high standards throughout the hotel.
The tourist bus stops just outside and the cable cars to Montjuic and Barceloneta give a fabulous view. I personally felt that the port area was the best place to stay while visiting Barcelona, much quieter than some of the more central hotels but still very near everything - Las Ramblas very close. My husband and I really enjoyed our visit to Barcelona and this hotel played a big part in this.

35,Loved the Grand Marina,"Stayed in Premier room, lovely room, plenty of space and storage, small balcony, only let down was that there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Staff were really helpful with the exception of the nightly room assistant not being able to speak a word of English and my Spanish being very poor. Roof top pool not of much use but gym facilities ok. Hotel very clean and access to buses, taxis etc very good. Tour bus stops right outside. Room service was excellent although meal ordered was a let down for the price, packet spaghetti and sauce, not very hot either. Overall would stay again for easy access to the city, but not a hotel you would stay in for atmosphere, certainly aimed at the business world although we weren't treated any differently because we weren't business.

35,Wonderful Hotel with Excellent Service,"We stayed at the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel for three nights prior to a Seadream Yacht Club cruise.  We were traveling with another couple.  We arrived at the hotel around 10 am and were able to check-in right away.  I had sent an email beforehand asking for early check-in.  We were celebrating our 25th Anniversary so we were upgraded to a two bedroom suite.  What a treat!  We had purchased the Celebration package so we had champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries two nights since there were two couples.  The breakfast buffet was excellent. The service was outstanding.  The concierge, Alexis, had helped us via email prior to our trip, and helped us even more when we arrived.  All staff we dealt with were very friendly and helpful.  The room was very nice.  Only complaint (not really complaint but something we wanted) was lack of wash cloths.  We were brought wash cloths after a phone call.  No problem.  However, we had to call for wash cloths each day.  Housekeeping was more than willing to help out but didn't make the connection to furnish our room each day with wash cloths.  Small thing.  We enjoyed the small bar a couple times, once for before dinner drinks and once for our complimentary glass of champagne.  Hotel is very convenient to Las Ramblas and the old town.  Our ship actually docked right next to the hotel so the bellman rolled our luggage to the ship's luggage check-in for us.  We didn't have to handle our luggage at all!  What a bonus!  Would definitely stay here again.

35,"Wonderful, wonderful","We just returned from a Mediterrean cruise where we ended with a three day stay at the Grand Marina..what a great way to end a great vacation.  The Grand Marina was exceptional, large spacious, luxurious room with every possible ammenity.  The bed was heaven with silky bed linen and a choice of pillows.  Our room opened to a small terrace overlooking the city and harbor.  The hotel is a 10 minute walk to the main tourist area, Las Rambles, and located right on the tourist bus line with access to the entire city.  The staff goes out of their way to make guests feel welcome.  We felt like royalty the entire time we were there.

35,Great Service-a wonderful experience,"We had a wonderful experience when we stayed at the Eurostar Grand Marina hotel  from 24 September 2005. We stayed on the weekend when the normally extremely expensive room rates of the weekday business, drop dramatically. 
I was happily surprised by the convenience of the location which was almost directly at the bottom of La Rambla,(La Rambla was good for live entertainment, but not much shopping - a bit run down actually)but there is a convenient subway station there,and the hotel is slap bang in the middle of the sleek modern Marina area. To my mind the location was very convenient but much less claustraphobic than the Gothic area where we saw many cramped over priced older hotels were located.
Despite the fact I had booked fairly last minute for Barcelona's major festival weekend (The Merce Festival) the hotel was not overcrowded!
Throughout our stay we recieved truely excellent service.I had requested by email a room with a sea veiw,and on requesting this again at checkin we were upgraded to a larger room on the top floor of the hotel with a panoramic veiw of the Marina and city!(Fortunate because a quick walk around the hotel building quickly showed us that any room facing in towards the central courtyard would have no veiw but the other hotel rooms instead of the magnificent Marina!)
Our room was on the top floor-same floor as the pool, which was surprisingly small. However I still enjoyed it, as at that time of year we had it to ourselves. Also, the veiw of the cruise ships and castle made me feel like a million dollars, as did the soak in the gym jacuzzi after.
Oh, and then I soaked in the spa bath in our room-wonderful!
The shower was not quite as good due to a slight lack of water pressure, but otherwise the bathroom was roomy and elegant with plenty of bath goodies to use.

Since I had also mentioned our stay was for our aniversary when I had booked at the hotel website,at check in we were also told that a complimentary bottle of Cava(sparkling white wine) and chocolate covered strawberries were on their way. I had not even directly requested this!
We also received vouchers for arrival free drinks at the bar- (more cava), but the bar waitress graciously swapped this for 2 very generous gin and tonics, no problems! 
Not surprisingly, by the time we set out on the town for all the festival events we were very happy!! 
Barcelona during this festival was absolutely wonderful-it had a happy family feeling and despite my fear of muggers etc we didn't see any unsavoury groups targeting tourists- but later we did hear of one person having their bag taken when they read their tourist guide. However, we had an amazing and fun time.  
My conclusions, the hotel is well located for subway(in La Rambla), tourist buses- and even cable car to hills behind the city(both outside the front door)andalso for walking around the Marina.(Taxis in Barcelona are also cheap).
 Excellent service if you book on the hotel website so you can make any requests, tell them about your special occasion and then check in early on a weekend to possibly get a room upgrade! Good Luck!",5,2005,10,10
35,"Great hotel, awful pool.","We've just got back from two nights at the Grand Marina and agree with all the other comments, its a first class hotel in a reasonable location.  We had a Junior Suite and it was great, it had a hallway, lounge, dining room, bedroom, bathroom, shower room and two toilets ~ actually you needed a compass to get your bearings for the first day!!

You won't need to read more of whats good with it, but you need to be aware that the pool is terrible, its small and cold.  The pool area is a shocker too.  Very few sunbeds ~ which are uncomfortable and we could only see three matresses for about twenty sunbeds, no umbrellas, no tables and finding a waiter was impossible.  Furthermore when we were there it was breezy and unpleasant.

The problem with the pool is compounded by the hotels location, its a good twenty minutes walk to the beach, so if you want to lay in the sun go somewhere else.  

We've also stayed at the Hotel Arts and  thought that the Grand Marina is the better of the two although the Arts pool is fractionally better and at least the beach is only 20 metres away.

So come on Grand Marina Management, sort out the pool area and you'll have a World Class Hotel.

Oh and a courtesy bottle of water and a chocolate at bed time would be most thoughtfull!!

35,Excellent hotel,"My husband, son (6) and I had a fantastic stay here in August, our room was brilliant, we had a superior on the front and the view was gorgeous. Food and drink were a bit pricey, however it was a 5 minute walk to The Ramblas we tended to go there or to Port Vell again a 5 min walk. Our son was made to feel welcome, some luxury hotels prefer children to be seen and not heard, not here the atmosphere was really nice.

The location is good, next to Port Vell with good shops and restaurants. The  Aquarium is close by and good to visit.

We would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again.

35,"Great room, bad service","We had a junior suite which was fantastic. A TV room, a dinning/lounge room, walk through wardrobe, 2 room bathroom, 2 seperate WC, bedroom and a small balcony.  Decor was very modern and comfortable. The view from the room overlooked the courtyard of the World Trade Centre.
When we first arrived we were shown the marina room which I did not think was as nice as the Junior Suite and at an extra 150euros a night for the marina suite I couldnt see the value and we took the Junior Suite.  
The marina suites are to the sides of the building so you can see the water but beware if you are on a lower floor as cruise ships berth along side the hotel and the marina suite we saw had the view obsured by a german cruise ship blaring techno music.
The hotel itself caters entirely for business clients so if you are staying at this hotel as a tourist do not expect much in the way of service.  The lobby looks like an office building lobby and the desk staff are not helpful.  
The hotel facilities are basicly non-existant.  The rooftop pool is very very small and very cold.  The deckchairs are scattered around one little section of the roof and it is not very relaxing.  We sat up there to get some sun but the pool appears to be an afterthought on the part of the hotel.  There is no service at all on the roof.  You cannot get a drink, anything to eat or even find anyone to ask.  The rest of the roof, which is a large area, is taken up by chairs and tables and an always closed cafe.  This is obviously only used for functions - again catering only for business clients.
Room service was good, the food was acceptable but not amazing.
The restaurant was never open as far as we saw, you can get something to eat in the bar area but this is just the room service menu with much less options. Do not plan to hang out in the bar for some fun, it is always empty and boring.  
So to sum up this hotel I would recommend it for anyone who wants a great room but doesnt plan on hanging around the hotel too much.  If you want a base to discover Barcelona then this hotel is good simply because of the standard of room.  It is not however a hotel I would recommend if you are looking for service or to relax at.
Good points:  great rooms, food service, location
Bad points: service, restaurant, atmosphere

35,Modern gem,"We stayed pre Seabourn cruise for only a night. Having booked an executive suite, we were upgraded to a 2 bed 2 bath suite which had great sea and City views.

The room facilities are good but, for a suite, unexceptional. We were particularly annoyed by the fact that we could not get gin or tonic from the mini bar and that it took over an hour of negotiation to obtain this from housekeeping. This was made worse by the staff's insistence that tonic water and Sprite are the same drink.

The room service was otherwise good, the location fine but for a hotel aiming to set itself apart, space in the room (which you can't really make use of as there are only 2 of you) does not make up for service which doesn't get 100%.

35,"Had a perfect stay, perfect.","Stayed just 1 evening. Booked a Junior Suite but was upgraded without even requesting upon arrival. Made specific requests in my email booking and the hotel bent over backwards to accomodate. Room was beautiful, bathroom (especially shower) fantastic. The staff were just so so friendly. Really helpful and understanding. Hotel location is perfect. Barcelona has a serious traffic problem so being just a touch out from the centre was perfect. No problem with noise from harbour, sound insulation anywas was amazing. Quite simply cannot fault hotel in any way and would definitely return next time I am in Barcelona. Another thing. I am quite a ""down to earth"" guy, but for sure one does NOT have to meet the stereotypical image of a Businessman to be treated like a lord here. All appear to be considered equal, as it should be.

35,Grand stay at the Marina,"We stayed at the Grand Marina for a week.  We had a lovely week in a Deluxe room.  I recommend the Celebration deal that includes breakfast.  We got strawberries covered with  chocolate and a bottle of Cava when we arrived. Breakfast was good.  The room was excellent, insist on a room with a view of Barcelona, otherwise you may well be facing the World Trade Center which is a block of offices.  As it is by the port there are regular visitations of ships from around the world.  It was quite good fun waking up to a new ship next door to us.  The Queen Mary 2 docked by us while we stayed.  The pool area is small and there are not enough sunbeds, so if it is a sunny day get out early (before 10am) and reserve a bed otherwise you may be disappointed.  Barcelona is beautiful.  We recommend Le Quinze Nitz restaurant just off the Ramblas on one of the squares.  We ate there 3 times in a fortnight.  It offered the best value in an expensive city and served the best food we ate.  Get in the queue before 8.30pm to get a seat in the 1st sitting otherwise you´ll have to wait 30mins to an hour for a seat.  I would recommend this hotel for a romantic stay in the city.l

35,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed at the Grand Marina pre-cruise for 1 night and loved it!  Only regret was that we couldn't stay longer.  The staff was absolutely great and the room was large and comfortable!  Our request for an upper floor room facing the city and harbor was met, chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of champagne was placed in our room in the evening during turn-down service.  The complimentary glass of cava in the bar was a nice touch and refreshing treat.  Having breakfast at the outdoor patio was enjoyable and the breakfast buffet had a lot of variety and was nicely presented.  The rooftop pool is small, but adequate with great views of the cruise ships and harbor. If there was just something to nitpick about, I guess that the storage space was minimal which could be an issue if one was staying for a week or so, and the lighting in the bathroom area was a bit dim. But overall, a fabulous hotel and a pleasant stay. Highly recommended!

35,1st Class All The Way,"My partner and I stayed at the Grand Marina the night before we left for a cruise.   We had booked the Celebration Package about 3 months out.

When we arrived at the hotel to check in, I was very impressed with the location, the staff and the over all look and feel of the hotel.

The hotel was located directly on the harbor about 5 mis from the cruise port.  We were watching the ships come in from our room.  The only bad thing is that we did not have a balcony.

The staff was over the top friendly and making sure that every need was met to our expectations.  Thier serivce level was right in line with that of the Ritz Carlton.  I have to also say that I did not see one bad looking person in that hotel.  Where do these people come from.  Just sitting in the lobby for a little people watching was the best free enjoyment that I had.

However, the most important thing that totally won me over took place at check in.  When I booked the Celebration Package it was 3 months out.  However by the time I checked in the price of the package was reduced by 50 Euro's however I was not aware of it.  When I presented my credit card to check in, the staff person told me that I am getting a credit since the price was reduced.  How many US businesses would ever do that!! 

We were very impressed and would suggest this hotel to anyone.",5,2005,08,13

The basics were definitely there - clean room, good food, friendly service, etc.  What makes this hotel spectacular is the extras... we needed to check in early and the room was ready, our waiter in the restaurant was so helpful in explaining the city and offering ideas, we got a complimentary glass of champagne in the bar and it was served like we were ordering a $100 bottle of wine.  

I will definitely stay here again and at any other hotel run by the same company.  These people know what they are doing.

Definately the side of the hotel to be on - The front although looking over the city has the cable cart immediately in front of you and to the rear you are facing onto the WOrld Trade Center Office Block!

Dont be put of by reviews that say it is noisy with the cruise ships beside you - We didnt get woken once during our 10 day stay. 

If you didnt get a bed and breakfast package dont worry as the breakfast is 30 euros per person! Just go to the rear of the hotel to the 3 or 4 restaurants/coffee shops and get a lovely spanish breakfast for no more than 5 euros per person. There is also a shop in the world trade center were you can get english/european papers every morning and cheap bottles of water! - A Beer in the hotel is 11 euros and water for a small bottle is 4 euros.

Finally the rooms are superb with large comfortable beds, jacuzzi baths, marble bathrooms and lots of room - probably the best hotel room i have stayed in. The rooftop pool is small and cold but is very refreshing. Please note the towels are all provided at the pool.

If you dont want to hang around the rooftop pool I would higly recommend the 1.5 hour cataraman trip which leaves from close to the hotel for 12 euros each. The Nou Camp is also definately worth a visit.

I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel for a room only stay.

35,Room With A View,"I stayed for one week at the Grand Marina with my husband. It was to celebrate our tenth Wedding Anniversary.

We paid for an upgrade to a Marina suite, and stayed in Room 611, which I would highly recommend. This has a corner balcony facing the city and port and enjoys a wonderful view from the balcony and window.

The employees were smart and polite and the room and hotel were in fantastic condition and spotlessly clean.

The Hotel website does not do it justice - especially the rooftop pool, which has a decent sunbathing area and good cafe and again commands great views of the port.

It was a treat and is expensive, but I'd recommend it completely - and the breakfat buffet is terrific as well!
",5,2005,08,01
35,Great hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Grand Marina for two nights after the hotel we planned to stay at cancelled our room the day before we left!  It turned out to be a blessing in disguise.  We paid a bit extra and booked a premium room and when we arrived it was like a suite - much bigger and with better facilities that most other rooms for that price in our experience -we had two separate seating areas, huge bed, big marble bathroom, separate dressing area and balcony.  Real value for money although breakfast not included.  Overall a great hotel in a lovely location by the sea - although if you are looking for a smaller ""boutique"" type hotel this is probably not for you as it is a large, business type set-up.  The staff were really nice and helpful and the rooftop pool and welcome drink of a glass of cava are nice touches.
",5,2005,07,21
35,Amazing hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for 5 days.  For some reason, we were upgraded on arrival to a junior suite which was amazing! The beds were incredibly comfortable; marble bathrooms with jacuzzi tub and spa-type shower.  Everything was very clean and service was outstanding throughout out stay.  Concierge and all hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.  The view of the city was unbelievable as well.  We would definitely stay here again if we came to Barcelona.  The only downside was that breakfast in the hotel was very expensive (30 euros each), but we found nearby cafes for a quick coffee and pastry without a problem.
",5,2005,07,17
35,Good Business Hotel,"The Grand Marina met expectations - but very high ones.  The staff was incredibly friendly - especially the doormen and valets.  All spoke impeccable English, which could be a benefit or frustration, depending on your travel philosophy.

We stayed for three nights in a regular room - it overlooked the port and the city.  Make sure you request the city side of the hotel or you end up overlooking the courtyard.  Great views of the city.  The room was nicely appointed, but could stand a refinish on the hard wood floors and an updated TV.  The bathroom was large and modern.

The hotel is a five minute walk to the La Rambla - easy springboard to anything in Barri Gotic.  

All the rooms seem to have usable balconies - if it was a bit cooler, we would have sat outside and enjoyed some wine.

The clientele definitely was more business and pseudo jet set - a lot of taxis available where you could walk.

Our only complaint which could be charming was that you are truly in the heart of the port of the cruise ships and ferries.  Occassionally, we could hear a lot of mechanical noise from the large ships.
",4,2005,07,12
35,Expensive but lush,"I took my boyfriend to the hotel for his birthday in November.
I managed to get a good deal online.
I emailed the hotel direct asking if possible for a free room upgrade (you don't get if you don't ask!!!) if available.
I received a friendly email back advising subject to availability our room would be upgraded but if they are unable they will ensure we had a room with a view and chocolate dipped strawberries with bubbly!!!
Unfortunately it was really busy that weekend so we got a room with a view with the strawberries and fizz - delicious.
The room was amazing with the relevant mod cons and a jacuzzi.
The mini bar was expensive - about £2.50 for a coke/water/mars bar!!!!
Location - at the port end of the ramblas and very quiet.
Breakfast was AMAZING - £15 each but the huge buffet means there is no way you can eat lunch.  The spread varies - cereal, juices, hams, cheeses, bacon, eggs etc, fresh fruit, pastries, even wine!!!
Staff (especially door staff) are very helpful, I found the 5 star status and attitude though did at times make me feel how julia roberts did in pretty woman!!!!!  at the end of the day I ignore this - remember if you are staying there it means you are probably earning more than them and you are paying their wages!!!!
Overall I would recommend the hotel if you want something really nice and are happy to pay the price for it

35,Superior Hotel,"My husband and I stayed here from May 12-May 14. We were sailing on a Royal Caribbean cruise on the 14th out of Barcelona so this hotel was perfect for our pre-cruise stay. I couldn't have asked for nicer hotel. The room was beautiful. We even received an upgrade as the vacation was our honeymoon. The staff could not have been more conscientious or accommodating. We had the most amazing view from our room as it looked out over the Barcelona seaport. I would highly recommend this hotel.
",5,2005,06,03
35,Great hotel for visiting Barcelona,"My fiancee and I stayed for two nights on 13th and 14th May.  The hotel is brilliantly located, the staff are very friendly and I would not stay anywhere else if I was staying in Barcelona.

Highly recommended.  

Can't speak for the food as we always ate out.  We stayed in a Premier Room - lovely room and great bathroom.  Get a sea view if you can.  We were there on Fri and Sat night and heard no noise from the bar.  Admittedly we only got back at 2am.  They stay out late in Barcelona!!

35,not so grand marina!,"my self my wife and our two friends recently enjoyed a short break in barcelona but unfortunately the hotel did not quite live up to the high expectations we had believed to experience in the grand marina.niose levels from the disco below had our friends moved on 3 occasions and ourselves once.prices at the hotel are in keeping with the hotels name exceptionally -grand 5*************

35,"Good location, small room, good service","My partner and I stayed at this lovely property for 4 nights in February.  We were given a view very quickly upon our morning check in after a long flight from the US.   Service at the front desk was very good and the bell staff was very efficient and helpful.  

Our room was rather small, but very nicely decorated with a view of the city and part of the port.  I loved watching the ships come in and out.  The bathroom was very large and pretty, although there was no shower curtain and some of the water seeped out when we showered.  The jacuzzi tub was also a great feature.  The room also had a stocked mini bar, mini safe and TV with several Spanish and English channels.  

The restaurant is located on the first floor (above the lobby) and we had breakfast once here.  Breakfast was good, but a bit pricey.  The concierge was also located on the first floor and he helped us find a movie theater that showed films in English and made dining reservations for us.  They also had two notebook computers that we could use to access the internet at no cost.

Having the Bus Turistico stop and the aerial tram stops right outside the hotel entrance was very convenient.

The World Trade Center complex, right behind the hotel also had a small convenience store, where we purchased some beverages and goodies and also an ATM nearby.

35,lovely rooms,"i have just come back from a three night stay at this 5* hotel. I booked the celebration break via  the hotels website which included breakfast. On Arrival i asked for a room overlooking the city but was told none were available but had been upgraded to a premier room. Porterage was excellent, the room was huge lovely design king size bed. Bathroom was luxury jacuzzi and hydro shower to die for. The break included cava and strawberries which the wife loved!!.
Over night on the saturday night we started to hear noise from outside around 2am, it continued until 4am There is a DISCO not connected to the hotel but the wtc complex in the basement and the noise we heard  was all of the revellors coming out. IF YOU ROOM OVERLOOKS THE BACK OF THE HOTEL BEWARE. IT WAS VERY NOISY I phoned reception in the morning spoke to the manager  who informed me that they have this problem every week .she  very kindly offered to move us to a room overlooking the front. WOW what a view
THe breakfast in the restaurant is first class the staff are attentive and the chioce of food is enormous and of a very high quality. 
The other services within the hotel are very expensive including the main bar 20 euors for a brandy!!.No ironing facilities available within you room and no in room tea coffee facilities
THe hotel is in a great location, the rooms are great and the staff are wonderful,
I would defintely return to the grand marina, but would only book a room overlooking the front. Our room was great, from seeing the other bedrooms the standard rooms are ok but a little on the small side.

The ramblas is only 5 mins walk and there is plenty of choice of restaurants near by.The guest service located on the first floor is really helpfull and john on concierge was a credit to the hotel.My advice is definetly to book here, get a premier room to include breakfast normally 30euro per person, and book last minute on the hotel website, (---)",4,2005,04,13
35,"Excellent, as expected and described","The Grand Marina is everything one would expect from a modern 5 star hotel.  Excellent rooms.  Excellent food.  Decor and furnishings of extremely high quality but perhaps a little ""minimalist"" for some tastes.  The location,  on the harbour,  is a little off the beaten tourist track but cab fares are cheap and the views from and around the hotel more than make up for the slight inconvenience of the location.  Highly recommended.

35,bring your own water!,"lovely hotel but a bit too 5* in the prices - especially the water in the mini bar. all drinks were 4euro 50 cent including water so bring your own.

very clean hotel with good service but was disappointed with the satelite tv - only 2 english speaking channels and both were the news!",4,2005,03,22
35,"Overall. An excellent hotel, great location.","Overall. An excellent hotel, great location. 

Top 5 positives
1) Location.. right at the end of La Rambla. Good access to restaurants, and attractions such as the cable car outside the main door, the port area etc. Easy to get to. Metro about 10 minute walk. City tour bus from outside the hotel. Taxis sitting waiting outside nearly all the time. Also just a little removed from the streets, so no midnight sirens etc.
2) The Rooms. We had a fabulous room, overlooking the city. It was a cut above the standard room, with a walk in dressing room, but one of the best rooms I have stayed in, with walk in shower, double doors to ensure a peaceful nights rest. The only sounds we heard were that of the cruise ships which park next door! The hotel was full and honestly my wife and I did not hear a sound from the corridors or next door. Room also had jet bath and excellent shower with marble finish.
3) Breakfast. Excellent spread of all types of food. Our breakfast was included in our package. At €30 a head for pay as you go, you might find it is worth looking at an all in package!
4) The view. Ask for a room in the front of the hotel. At the rear you look over an office block. Fabulous views of the city, cable car, port area, right the way up to some of the famous churches. We could see the Gaudi Cathedral from our room.
5) Service. It is a five star hotel, so the service you get is commencerate, and good, from room service, to door staff, to check in.

Top 3 negatives - and this is being pickey!

1) The prices. At €5 for a cup of tea in the bar you get the picture of what the rest of the prices are like!
2) The atmosphere. This is certainly a big business hotel, with many conferences on during our stay. You do not go there for the atmosphere in the bar at night, (we were the only people in it on Saturday evening at about 10.30)
3) Why do all the staff have ear pieces and microphones on their jackets? I am sure it improves the service offered, but it also gives the impression of big brother watching you and some high security facility, instead of a homely friendly atmosphere.

Overall, well worth the money, and somewhere both my wife and I would love to visit again.

35,Great Location - Expensive,"We stayed here 2 nights on our honeymoon in August 2004. 
Decided to splurge on this hotel as it was our honeymooon.

Great location next to the water and you can see Barcelona pier and La Ramblas area. 

PROS:
-Since it was our honeymoon, they gave us a bottle of champagne and chocolate strawberries complimentary.
-Had a great view of the Barcelona seaside
-Very clean
-Nice design
-Premium toiletries
-Great view from top of hotel where gym, whirpool and swimming pool are
-Food/Bar is good however a bit expensive
-Concierge desk was great, very helpful went out of their way for us
-Free internet, 2 laptops to use at concierge desk
-Very close walking distance to Barcelona Pier, La Ramblas, Columbus monument

CONS:
-Jacuzzi Aqua tub in room, only enough for one person, not as advertised in Expedia
-Room was not as large as we thought, so we were disappointed a little
-Too expensive
-Whirlpool at top of hotel was not warm, it was actually kind of cold and we asked to put up the heat and they said that was the highest
-Swimming pool is kind of small, however it has a nice view

If you get a good price for this hotel or you want to splurge go for it, but unfortunately the price you pay is for the location really, for the price we paid we could have got a lot more at other hotels.

Have fun in Barcelona!",4,2005,03,09
35,Amazing hotel,"Stayed here at end September 2004 and I have to say that it was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.  Great location about 5-10 mins walk from the Ramblas (and therefore avoiding the noise and pollution of same)

Spectacular room - spacious, clean, comfortable with an amazing view of the city. Fabulous bathroom with a huge shower and bath that both had jacuzzi jets. There was also an internal door in the room which separated the sleeping part of the room from a corridor to the outside door of the room so you didn't hear any noise from the corridor at night. 

Breakfast was great - huge selection and lots of freshly baked pastries and fresh juices. Bar snack food was expensive but good quality. 

Lovely outdoor deck on roof which has a swimming pool and jacuzzi - good view of the cruiseliners docking from here. 

After we checked in a bell boy arrived to the room with a free bottle of Cava and a few chocolate truffles which was a nice touch. The hotel arranged their own car to the airport which cost about the same (or maybe less) than a taxi. 

All in all I wasn't that taken with Barcelona as a city, but would go back there just to experience this hotel again!
",5,2005,03,09
35,Missing Barcelona,"Barcelona was exceptional, especially since just arriving from a long week of Rome, Milan and Florence.  
    
    The people were friendly, the streets were clean and safe and the hotel by the water front added a beautiful view.  I'm booking my second trip for next year.
    ",5,2005,02,09
35,Perfect for a pre or post cruise stay,"My partner and I found the Eurostars Gran Marina to be simply superb! The hotel is located at the World Trade Center which was where the dock for our cruise ship was. When we disembarked the Seven Seas Voyager our porter simply brought our luggage around the corner and the hotel was right there.  I booked this hotel upon the personal reccommendation of two friends. The hotel left nothing to be desired. The service was gracious and the room was breathtaking. We had a corner room with wraparound view of the entire harbor. The room was quite large and had an incredible bathroom with a seperate steam shower and whirlpool tub! The breakfast buffet was included in our room rate. It was an immense offering of both hot and cold items. It held us over until dinner. The Ramblas is not far from the hotel and it was a really beautiful walk around the waterfront to get there. My only complaint about the hotel was that dinner there was really expsensive. I would suggest going to the concierge and finding a restaurant off the beatan path that is not full of tourists. Otherwise, I would certainly reccommend this hotel to anyone who is planning a trip to Barcelona.",5,2005,02,03
35,"Fantastic, Modern and friendly!!","Have just returned from a 3 night break here, having got a great deal on Expedia for a twin or double room. Unfortunately - we got twin beds  but as the beds were next to each other anyway,  it wasn't really a problem.

First impressions 
Arrived at the airport and our taxi driver had no idea where we were staying and after asking various colleagues, eventually got us there. Personally, we just think he was  a bit mad and was trying to keep the meter ticking to get more euros from us - until we asked him to re-set it! 
On arrival, the doormen were really lovely and check in was friendly and efficient.

Room
The room was a great size, overlooked the front, and although we were bang in the middle facing the cable car tower, the view was still spectacular. We saw cruise ships come and go too! Room was really modern, fab bathroom with seperate walk in part of a shower/toilet/bidet and two sinks and a whirlpool bath that could even fit two of you in!  The mini bar was really expensive so just bought water from the supermarket; the beds were really comfy and if you rang housekeeping they brought you up extra pillows (of your liking) free of charge - you had a menu to choose them from!!

Hotel
Overall, a really great place to stay. The bar (1st floor) was really nice and laid back - 11 euros for a white wine and bottle of local lager so not exactly cheap but we paid more for drinks in Port Olympic!
The location is right on the marina so is about a 5-10 minute walk to the bottom of the Ramblas but we actually liked this as it was nice to walk out of the hustle and bustle (last thing at night) to the serenity of your quiet hotel room.  The Touristic Bus Line (blue line) picks up right outside the hotel (World Trade Centre stop) so that was great in getting about and would reccommend this service to anyone - 2 days is 22 euros each (pay on the  bus) and you can get on and off both the blue and red lines as many times as you like and it takes you all around Barcelona. (The guy on the information point on the 1st floor was really helpful with all this info so go and see them for advice etc)

Overall - just a really modern, luxorious hotel with friendly staff. Would definitely reccomend it if you are wanting a quiet, comfortable, relaxing hotel where you can get a good nights sleep in comfortable surroundings. Not for you though if you wanting to stay in a traditional spanish hotel, amongst the hustle and bustle, maybe then look at hotels in Pacia de Gracia as this we felt was the next best place to stay... (but still nicer than the La Ramblas area which we felt was very noisy and a bit 'rough' in parts at night)!

Great city, great hotel - just wish it had been warmer weather!! Definitely think you get the best of barcelona if the sun shines!
",5,2005,02,02
35,Deservedly worth it's five stars,"Excellent. One of the best hotels in Barcelona. We stayed in one of the suites for a night before getting on a cruise and it was undoutebly one of the nicest rooms we've ever had. There were two living rooms, one by the balcony, with a rollaway bed for our daughter and a main one with a tv, Bang and Olufsen radio and the mini bar. Then there was the double bedroom, the bathroom, with a big jacuzzi bath and Hermes toiletries and a wet room shower. Then there was the wardrobe area and an additional toilet. The decor was very tasteful with maple wood and dark blue furnishings. The club lounge was very good with internet access, a gym and very good viewpoints onto the harbour.
The breakfast was also good. We would definately recommend this hotel, especially the suites.",5,2005,01,04
35,Paper Thin Walls,"Just returned from 3 nights at this hotel over new years. The location of the hotel is great, cannot be faulted. However when you see the pictures of the hotel you think, well I did anyway, that the majority of the ""circular building"" was the hotel. In fact only the front part facing the city is the hotel the rest are office buildings ! 
The service in the hotel is second to none, they really treat you well. I went for a Premier Room at 250 Euro per night. It was a great room with a great view of the city and the bottom corner of the port. If you go for a standard room as some of the people I got talking to did, the view was into a person office. The whole back of the hotel looks into offices. There is a cable car station outside the hotel that is about 15 stories high that blocks the view of the city if you are unlucky to get a front room in the middle.
The floors in the room are wooden and look nice BUT with a wooden floor comes the noise. You can hear people walking on the floors in the adjoining rooms and upstairs which can be damn annoying. Also the walls are very thin so you can hear people talking and doing ""other"" things very clearly which can be infuriating when you're trying to have a lie in. That was disapointing for us.
The hotel is expensive for mini bar, a water was about 5 euro and a mars bar over 5 euro ! There is no iron in the room and we had to get a few shirts and blouses pressed. They charge about 10 euro a shirt but you do get them back within a few hours.....bring a travel iron !

Even with the bad points the location of the hotel and the service are very good. The bad points, over expensive mini bar and pressing services and the noise of other guests. I would not have been so generous on the 4 stars had I been in a standard room with a view of somebodies office though. I suggest that you ask as I did for a room with a view of the city/port.",4,2005,01,04
35,Lovely Hotel!,"We have just returned from a short stay in this hotel.In our opinion it certainly lives up to its five star rating. The staff were so friendly and very efficient.The food was excellent and the cleanliness second to none. The location was very convenient being just a five minute walk to Las Rambles and the marina. . Local buses,taxis and the open top tour bus stop just a few yards from the hotel. 
It was a pleasant change to stay in a modern  rather than a traditional style hotel.
We did find the room at night a little too warm due to the sunlight shining on the large windows all afternoon.Then again after returning back to the freezing maybe that is a plus point!! We will definately return here in the future without any doubt.
",5,2005,01,03
35,Loved the bath!!,"Just back from a 4 night stay in the Grand Marina and like most people have already said was of a good quality.  Unfortunately we never had the luck of some people who got upgraded to a suite but none-the-less the superior room was of a decent size and finish with nice complimentary toiletries to boot!!
One negative was the fact that they had turned the air-con off throughout the hotel due to the fact that it was winter - however with the temperature still peaking at 23 degrees during the day it did tend to get a bit stuffy in the room at times though a nice breeze could be got by going out to the balcony ( though no such promised picturesque view).
We also had the misfortune of losing our baggage but the concierge proved most helpful in tracking it down and dropping it into the room on it's arrival.
After a long days sightseeing the massage bath is just the job to ease all those aches and pains.
There was a lack of english speaking TV stations but I guess you don't go there to watch the telly.  The room cleanliness was second to none with our room getting tidied TWICE a day!

Overall a very pleasant stay.",4,2004,12,15
35,"Great Hotel, Good Location","My family of three stayed at the Eurostars Grand Marina in Aug 2004.  There are two reasons to pick this hotel.  One, its a 5 minute walk to the La Ramblas and the start point for the city bus tours.  Two,  its a modern and well designed hotel overlooking the marina.  Granted, it's a bit pricey, especially when you factor in that we drove and parking can cost you 30 Euro a night.  But we would go back to this hotel on our next visit to Barcelona.

35,Great Hotel - Wonderful Views of the City,"I booked the Eurostars Grand Marina from 3rd - 6th December for my fiance's 30th Birthday weekend.  This modern and beautifully decorated hotel is situated on the port.  It is nice and quiet (cruise ship horns excepted) and 5 minutes walk from the bottom of the Ramblas.

On arriving I was very slightly disappointed with the room, designated Superior in a 5 star hotel although it was large and pleasant enough. 

I had specifically asked for a view and a wonderful view of the city it was (although in the promotional photos of the hotel and with the benefit of a wide angled lens, the huge cable car station right in front of the hotel is absent!).  Try to stay 6th floor or above and either to the left or right of the front of the hotel.  If you stay at the back you will look onto a pleasant courtyard and World Trade Centre.

I emailed the concierce service before travelling to ask for a special touch for my fiance's birthday and we received, on arrival, a bottle of ice cold cava and chocolate covered strawberries.. yum.

Staff were great and service wonderful.  

You can even chose from 5 different types of pillow, all named after screen legends.

I had never experienced a turn down service before and this was amusing!  We would be relaxing or having a little siesta late afternoon and we would stand to one side as a a very nice lady re-made our bed and put little mats next to our beds with our slippers!

Breakfasts were marvellous. 

The bar, with piano was a good place to relax with a good Bloody Mary and nibbles.  

Overall, a great place.  In my opinion 4 1/2 stars.",4,2004,12,08
35,Highly recommended......,"Had a wonderful stay at this hotel.....the staff were very friendly and helpful, complimentary champagne and chocolate truffles were bought up to our room on the first night - had informed them in advance that it was a special occasion.  Had requested a room with a view and certainly had one - could see the entire city.  The rooms were very spacious and the bed was huge, loved the spa bath, although was a little small for two!  Was very impressed with the decor - very modern.  Short walk up the pier to Las Ramblas.  Excellent facilities.  Would definately stay here again if we could afford to - if you want to splash out whilst in Barcelona - this is the place to do it!

35,wonderful hotel,"one of the best hotels we ever stayed in.

staff were pleasant and attentive 

the decor was superb modern and plush and the superior room had huge bathroom with walk in shower and separate dressing room The bed was so comfortable it was a struggle to get up.

There was some noise from ferries but not enough to disturb our sleep and it was fun to see them come and go.

no good restaurants nearby but hotel porter always got a taxi almost immediately and they were rarely more than 5 euro

the location made it quiet and restful compared to the centre of town 

would recommend this hotel without question

35,Gorgeous- great ending to my whirlwind European trip,"Upon arriving in Barcelona after a Royal Caribbean cruise, no taxi is needed to get to the hotel- our ship’s dock was further out on the Port so I took the shuttle bus- 1.50 euro only.  Saved me about 1 hour of waiting in line for a taxi if I were to try to make my way to another hotel.  Located on the marina at the World Trade Center, the hotel is close enough to “civilization” and far enough away to be peaceful and relaxing.

The check-in was smooth and friendly, the front desk person reminded me of the end of daylight savings time, which was very helpful since I had forgotten.   She told me to visit their informative concierge on making the most of our 1 day in Barcelona, and that the front desk handles all currency exchanges, at a pretty good rate, by the way.  She also told me I could call ahead to make sure a taxi is available the next morning for my early flight- I did exactly that and everything went smoothly, including checkout.  During most hours of the day, taxis are lined up in front so calling ahead is not needed.

I booked the executive suite as we had 4 people in our party- many other Barcelona hotels cannot accommodate parties larger than 2 or 3 without getting a separate room or extra fees.  I got a great deal on Travelocity, way below rack rate since we were staying only 1 night on a weekend...I think Grand Marina caters more to business and convention travelers, which is typically during the working week.  Suite had 2 very large bedrooms with desk area & multiple closets, a living room and dining area (with mini fridge), and a gorgeous bathroom & vanity area.  All rooms were typical of some of Barcelona's ""hip"" design styles:  sliding doors for privacy, dark wood floors, modern furniture, marble bathrooms. Our view, with 2 balconies, faced the city of Barcelona and the Christopher Columbus statue at the bottom of Las Ramblas; we were on the 7th floor of 8 so the view was spectacular- we could even see La Sagrada Familia.  VERY spacious, which was great after being confined to a tiny cabin on a cruise ship.  Small details are great- lots of bathroom freebies (see the almost hidden middle drawer!), bathrobes and slippers, turndown service, automatic lights, 5 shower heads, bidet (as most European hotels have), Jacuzzi, high thread count sheets.

The 2nd floor of the hotel has their restaurant and lounges- in the same style as the rest of the hotel, it was spacious and modern.  There is a terrace with tables and fountains.  The top floor has a gym with many fitness machines, a hot tub, and a small outdoor pool (great view from the pool, which is elevated).

The hotel is a 5-minute walk from the bottom of Las Ramblas and next to Port Vell, which I think had been further developed during the 1992 Olympics, with restaurants, stores & an Imax theatre.  The short distance from the busier parts of Barcelona made all the difference- as I said, it was quiet and peaceful at night (while I know some guests at other hotels on Las Ramblas are kept up all night due to party revelers)- we had an early flight so this was perfect.  The short walk was not far from cafes (breakfast!), shops and other tourist sights.  We bought tickets for white & turquoise the Barcelona Tourism bus, which had a stop right in the front of the hotel.  It cost 16 euros each for 1 day and has stops all around the city- you can get on and off as you please, an alternative to those who are subway/bus map reading-deficient!  Very convenient.

I highly recommend this hotel- it was the perfect choice for what my needs were during my vacation.  Only cons I can think of: breakfast not included (I know some people require this in a vacation), modern style may not appeal to those looking for a classic style or boutique hotel.",5,2004,11,04
35,Better than I thought,"We were at the hotel for only two days Sep. 26th,27th. We were treated very well; the staff was  friendly and helpful. The food at the restaurant was excellent and well presented. The views from our room and the roof were spectacular.
Highly reccommended.

",5,2004,10,21
35,Top Class Hotel,"My Hubby and I stayed at the hotel 24-27th Sept for the first leg of our Honey Moon, and what a delight.  We were upgraded to a Junior Suite with Champers & Chocolates.  

Our room was cleaned daily with a  turn down service every evening.  The location was excellent with a 5 min stroll to La Ramblas. 

I would recommend this hotel to anyone, it can be pricie, but well worth it. Definately worth it's 
5 Stars.

35,Wonderful 3-night stay - 10th - 13th October 2004,"We have just returned from Grand Marina Hotel.  It was my birthday and a bottle of cava and chocolate covered stawberries were placed in our room when we arrived.  We were on the 8th floor and our room faced the town with a view of the sea either side.  Cruise ships docked alongside the hotel. The room and bathroom was amazing and we were even given a choice of pillows!  We had an excellent deal with hotels. (£136 per night per room) and Easyjet flights.  The breakfast buffet cost us 19 Euros each and was well worth it as there was everything you could wish for.  All the staff were very friendly and the waiters constantly refilled our coffee cups.  It was lovely weather and we were able to sit outside to have breakfast.  The Barcelona open-top bus tour stops in front of the hotel and we got a 2 day pass for 21 Euros each.  We were able to hop on and hop off and see a lot more of Barcelona than if we were just on foot.  The marina is right next to the hotel with some lovely fish restaurants nearby.  

We loved our break and will definitely return to the Grand Marina.
",5,2004,10,15
35,Wonderful Hotel with great service,"I cannot believe the bad reviews given to this hotel by some reviewers.  We stayed Sept 21-23, 2004 and had absolutely excellent service.  

We were greeted with complimentary Cava and chocolates for our anniversary.  The rooms were huge and comfortable, with many amenities.  We had turn-down service both nights we were there, and the breakfast buffet was excellent, even though we arrived at the end of the scheduled time.

I suggest you try this place for yourself, and I believe you will be more than satisfied.  It is right on the bus route, or 1 and 1/2 blocks away from the bottom of Las Ramblas--a pleasant distance to be sure.  

We would definately stay here again!
",4,2004,10,08
35,Great location especially for Cruise ships and great rooms,"On my last trip to Barcelona I stayed at another 5-star property, the Claris, which while a block from the busy Paseo Garcia shopping street left something to be desired in the service dept.

On arriving in Barcelona by cruise ship, I was astounded to discover that the hotel sits right next to where I disembarked so no taxi was neccesary to get there!

The check-in (in fairness, at 8:30 a.m.) was a little bit cold and distant, however the rest of my experience was exceptionally favorable. A very large room and lovely bathroom that is typical of some of Barcelona's ""hip"" design styles. This made the view over the interior (exposed) courtyard hardly noticeable.

The hotel is a 5-minute walk from the bottom of Las Ramblas and while isolated in some respects, this is a GOOD thing given the hustle and bustle of exiting most other Barcelona hotels into the crowds of many wonderful citizens and many very clever pickpockets.

I highly recommend this hotel...and must add that their high-speed complimentary internet access at the concierge desk was a very pleasant surprise given how many luxury hotels have taken to charging guests for internet access.
",4,2004,09,28
35,How could there be a bad review?,"I just don't understand the bad reviews. I have stayed all over the world in some of the finest hotels and am a fairly harsh critic. I must say we loved the Grand Marina Hotel. Our room was fabulous, large and beautiful decor (I'm an interior designer so this is always of great importance). I only wish the outlook (view) was better. The balconies overlook an interior courtyard of the complex (no water views) or city view with slight water views of the port. The location is wonderful for touring the city and I had no problems what-so-ever with any of the staff, they were always helpful and friendly . The restaurant was quite lovely and the food was good. As far as the beds, they were quite comfortable (where did the people who complained sleep...the chaise lounge?) and they offer you a 'menu' of different pillows you can call and order up (I loved the marilyne pillow, ultra soft down filled). When I return to Barcelona, the Grand Marina will be where I stay!",5,2004,09,09
35,Great Hotel,"This is a great hotel, on arrival we were upgraded without asking to a delux room with great views of a wonderful city. The service here is second to none, the welcome drinks were indeed very welcome, although mini bar is very expensive.
Rooftop bar is good for snacks and breakfast was excellent, will return to this hotel on next visit.
",5,2004,09,07
35,A quiet haven,"Hard to find a better breakfast buffet anywhere.  Oh those meats and cheeses and pastries.
We made very welcome although checked in at 9 a.m.   Rooms were available. Modern, clean, cool and comfortable.  A complimentary welcome drink is a nice touch. Rooms had every amenity you could think of.  The doormen were extremely helpful and polite.  Haven't seen attention like that in a long time.  An excellent base for a stay in Barcelona.
",5,2004,08,23
35,What a breakfast !,"Just arrived back from a 4day stay. Excellent hotel,
beautiful rooms with jacuzzi bath and the best breakfast buffet ive ever had in a hotel, you can even have moet if you like and at 20euro a bargain.

The only gripe i would have is that the pool is more of a plungepool but to be honest if your a sunworshipper youd be on the beach anyway( we found the beach area near hotel arts the best)

I would also take a bus tour as soon as your up to it to get your bearings, there are 3 tours each 2 hrs long but you can hop on/off and do as little as your like, if your into the sights a muti day ticket is best.

On a general note the olympic port is nice but very expensive, mostly fish restaurants and a few nice bars/clubs. There just doesnt seem enough hours in the day in barcelona and the easiest way to enjoy it is to adlib the whole thing.
",5,2004,08,17
35,"Superb 5 star hotel - great location, great service.","Just back from a lovely stay at this excellent 5 star hotel. Stayed 4 nights. Hotel is immaculate, staff are very professional and standards are very high.
The room we had was beautiful and everything was spotless. We asked for help reserving a table at a restaurant at very short notice by the customer services staff and they were very helpful. Their choice of restaurant was excellent - just what we wanted. At the pool bar, we asked for something which wasn't on the menu and it was no problem.
The pool is small - but there is plenty of room to lie around the pool area, and there are always clean towels at the ready.
I would return again without hesitation.
",5,2004,08,16
35,Marie celeste hotel!,"Quite easy not to talk to a soul here. It's cold , clinical, joyless.  Expect no warmth at all.Effectively its a posh office block...
But great views and a delightful breakfast. . The parking is exorbitant, but drivers dont really have a choice.
",3,2004,08,16
35,Can't understand the bad reviews,"I stayed here July 03. Maybe things have gone down hill since then, reading the bad reviews but my stay there was superb. The premier room was very spacious with amazing views of the city. The breakfast was the best I have had in a five star hotel. You can get the cable car which is in front of the hotel that takes you to the beach. It can be a bit scary if you are scared of heights but worth it for the view. We walked around the Arts hotel but found it a bit flashy.
",5,2004,07,25
35,This hotel is superb,"My wife an I decided to go to barcelona at the last minute for our 1st wedding anniversary. I rung the eurostars wanting to book in on thursday the 15th but the hotel was full on that night so we booked to stay at the eurostars from friday the 16th to the 20th. As our flight arrived on the thursday night (we flew bmi baby from manchester, who i was not impressed with as the check in staff were not very welcoming, compared to other airlines i had flown with) we checked into the ac diplomatic which has good reviews here. However for £118 excluding breakfast i found the room to be small (it was clean and quite smart) and the service virtually non existent. When we arrived no one greeted or helped us with our bags, no one smiled, and we felt unwelcome rather like an old fsahioned soviet union style hotel.

So I was looking forward to checking out and moving into the eurostars grand marina. When we arrived there no sooner had we arrived in the cab than our doors were opened and greeting with smiles, our bags were removed from the taxi and stored. The receptionist was completely efficient and helpful and we went had drinks on the terrace. At first the terrace was windy, but unbearably so and there was a nice plunging pool, deck area and bar. Again the service here was great, plenty complimentary snacks, towels, gowns provided etc and the views are great over the harbour. We could sit and watch cruise liners and all sorts of vessels. 

When we went to our room, we were amazed at the view. We had a forty-fifty foot long panaramic window that overlooked barcelona marina and city. This view in itself was a million dollar view. The room was very nice and you could lay in bed and watch the marina's activities.

The bathroom had a jacuzzi bath and a great seperate shower. Everything was provided including bath salts and other bath toiletries.

We booked a celebration package with the hotel direct. We found this to be cheaper than many internet hotel booking companies, and breakfast was included. We also had a complimentary bottle of cava on our arrival.

The breakfast was great with all you could conceivably want to eat, they even had champagne on the buffet  (moet) for those who fancied it.
Coffee was constantly tooped up and the orange juice was delicious.

We eventually decided to stay an extra night and changed our flights to stay here another night because we didnt want to go.

The staff were friendly, helpful and super efficient.

On these reviews from various people there are always varying opinions as different people have different expectations. 

Reading the couple of previous reviews i can't understand why these oppinions are so. From our findings here we were more than happy. 

We have stayed in quite a lot of hotels around the world and this one of the best i have been in. The midland in manchester uk is close to this hotel on service so those of you who have stayed there will know that it is good.

As a final note beware of bmi baby charging for excess baggage. Most airlines i use are quite lenient on this but not bmi baby. I felt that the cheap seats were being compensated for by an over zealous company policy on baggage weight, so buyer beware. I personally would rather fly with another airline next time and have a higher level of welcome, service etc.
",5,2004,07,22
35,Don't stay here if you are British!!!!,"Although the bathrooms are nice, the rooms are very average and the staff here are overtly anti-British. They made it abundantly clear (by way of deferential service and snide remarks/glances) that they preferred Spaniards over British clients. If you are not Spanish, then don't even think about staying here (unless you enjoy feeling like an unwelcome guest).
",1,2004,07,21
35,Excellent & Beautiful Hotel,"I stayed at the Grand Marina Hotel in the beginning of July and was so pleased!  The charming gentleman at the front desk greeted me in a prompt and friendly manner.  Without me asking, he upgraded my room to a gorgeous and enormous suite.  The room was fabulous!  Big comfortable bed; a large walk-in closet with a dressing area and full-length mirror; and a balcony overlooking the cruise ship harbor.  The bathroom was my favorite – it had a gorgeous glass shower and a separate hydrotherapy bathtub/Jacuzzi.  All toiletries were provided for guests including toothbrushes and toothpaste.  Bathrobes and slippers were also in the room.  In addition, upon check-in I received a coupon for two complimentary drinks at the hotel bar, and a VIP pass to the Barcelona casino.

This hotel thought of everything for their guests!  There is a safe in the room for valuables, and a wide selection of pay-per-view movies are also available.  In-room Internet connections are available for guests with laptops.  I did not bring my computer with me, but was happy to see that the television also had a keyboard and the option for Internet access at the cost of ten euro for twenty-four hours of use… which I thought was very reasonable.  The television had a clock with alarm, which was great considering the other rooms I stayed at in Barcelona did not have clocks.

Although I did not take advantage of the hotel restaurant, I did explore the roof top pool area.  The view of the city from the roof was spectacular!  I guarantee it will take your breath away.  The Grand Marina would be a great hotel for couples, as it has quite a romantic feel to it.  I was traveling alone though and still found it perfect due to its location right at the end of Las Rambles.  It was a short walk from all the great shops and restaurants of this district.  And as a bonus… my American AT&T calling cards worked from the payphones located right in front of the hotel.

Fabulous hotel – well worth every penny!

35,My First Tast of Spain was not the one we dreampt of..,"It's hard to see how the previous reviews reflect the Hotel I stayed in. A deeply diappointing experience in what is actually a seedy business hotel with little in the way of customer service, attention to detail or value for money. I travel extensively and this hotel represents little in the way of 5 star pleasures and is more representative of 5 star nightmares. The poor service (How many hotels ask you to move to lower class room once you have already been given your key?) and insulting service (How many hotels insult their guests because they return to the room at 3am?) were nothing compared to the tiny pool on the 8th floor where hurricane conditions prevail whilst you enjoy views of the cargo bays. Enjoy!
",1,2004,07,21
35,Lessons in customer service !,"DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL. I have travelled extensively in recent years and have had many enjoyable weekend breaks at various priced hotels. As a special treat me and 18 of my friends decided to do something a bit special and stay at the Grand Marina. It was the worst experience of my life. The service received from the staff was nothing short of offensive, the manager was the rudest person I have ever met in my life.
I personally will never be returning to the Grand Marina and I will make it my lifes mission to makesure nobody else does either !!!
",1,2004,07,20
35,Excellence at its best,"I went to the hotel for two nights with my partner in July. Before we left, i was in constant contact with the reservations dept as i wanted to make sure that everything was perfect.  They provided me with excellet assistance and gave me practically everything that I wanted.  On arrival, our rooms were upgraded which was a pleasant surprise.  The service was overwhelming, everytime you as much as leave your room, they tidy it up for you.  The food was great, the staff were excellent and there's nothing better you could ask for from a hotel.  It is definately worth the cost.
",5,2004,07,10
35,Excelent Hotel,"I don't know what the previous poor reviews were about. As ever before deciding which hotel to book, we consulted Tripadvisor, and as ever the recommendations were spot on. 

This is a wonderful hotel. Pricy certainly, but worth it. We stayed at the Eurostars Grand Marina for out 1st wedding anniversary. We were no sooner in the door when room service rang and introduced themselves and asked if it would be convenient to deliver some champagne and strawberries. Great start. The breakfast is perfect, the service and food are great. Guest Services were very helpful and pointed us in the right direction for everything. The staff were efficient, courteous and pleasant, even the morning after the ""Catalonian festival"" where the majority of the staff would have been out partying until 6 AM.

The rooms were huge (Not the basic rooms though, we did catch a glimpse of one of these and it looked small), with great bathrooms, a walk in wardrobe, spa bath etc. They were also quiet. We had a room overlooking the front, and had no problem with the ships docked next to us. You would have to be the lightest sleeper on earth for that to bother you.

One word of warning though, The Dinner menu is ""Creative"" to say the least. Although it was an experience, there are far better dinner menus to be had in town.

There is a small spot on the roof with an outdoor pool and sun lounges, although as we were only staying for 3 days we did not make great use of this as there is so much to see and so in Barcelona. Also the beaches are within easy reach if sunbathing is something you wish to pursue.

Overall I would recomend this hotel to anyone wishing to splash out a bit.
",5,2004,06,25
35,Wonderful hotel,"My husband and I had a fabulous time at the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel. What a great location! For our anniversary they provided a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries.  The concierge picked out the best restaurants.  My husband found the business center very helpful.  The concierge even helped us out with a problem we had with our flight.  We recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona. 
",5,2004,06,03
35,Good - but not that good!,"A good hotel, but slightly less than I would expect from a five star - in my opinion it's a good 4 star.
Although the rooms are supposed to be cleaned twice a day, ours was done only once on one of the days - no great problem, but not the standard advertised.
The bed had to be the most uncomfortable we'd ever slept in - rock hard.
If you want to drink bottled water, take in your own. The mini bar charges 4 Euros for a third of a litre - sheer extortion!
Staff very helpful - good breakfast - although sometimes the waiters disappeared, and forgot what was a simple request for tea instead of coffee. 
The hotel is also situated at the port, which might have explained a chill wind in early May. Handy though for the excellent red and blue route tourist buses - must be the best value in the city.
Overall an OK short stay, but we have stopped in better hotels.",3,2004,05,08
35,Not 5 star quality,"went on a short break with my husband and we were very dissappointed with the service or lack of. Firstly their advertised swimming pool and leisure centre are not in operation, the safe in our room did not work and the staff were not familier with what services were on offer in their hotel, which for a 5 star was a bit bizzare. We made a complaint but as there were no managers and it was not the receptionists fault personally we didn't get much satisfaction. I believe if you pay a high price for a hotel you are entitled to the service. We will not be going back there.",2,2004,05,05
35,Great Overall Experience,"If you are looking for an excellent alternative to the ""charming boutiques"" of Europe, look no further than this hotel. A combination of modern architectural style, staff service, physical age, and amenities makes this property one of the very best. We reserved the hotel through a discounted service and while the rate was still high, it was worth every penny. The room is well appointed and completely spacious, with a long entryway, a walk in closet, a bathroom that had separate shower/message tub and a partition between sinks and shower. The bathroom had some of the best quality toiletries and thick bathrobes and slippers. The wooden floor resembles the current trend of using wooden floors in new homes. Also, guests get a selection of different types of pillows, though the Rita Hayworth style is the default one placed in the rooms. You get a tremendous sense of cleanliness that you would feel from your own home. The breakfast buffet included in our rate deal was extensive serving everything from bacon and eggs to Spanish specialties such as chorizo and tapa ingredients. The entire staff spoke fluent English and was very accommodating. The only drawback was that the pool was under repair and the location is almost half a mile from the closest subway stop (Drassanes). However, the metro bus line 20 does run almost to the front door of the hotel. Also, the tourisitic (open air double decker) bus runs from the front of the hotel as well.",5,2004,04,29
35,Perfect short break,"Went with a girlfriend over Easter weekend - left the kids with husband. We got a 'premier' room on the basis of my recent birthday! 
Great views of the city, and the best bathroom you can imagine - twin sinks, jacuzzi bath, huge shower space with jets, all in marble... Room safe, dressing area, really comfy beds and lots of freebies. Would find the beds made up and towels replaced every single time we returned, whatever time of day and however many times. Lots of walking since the bottom end of La Rambla was at least half a mile away, but tour buses stop right outside. The ferries outside make a bit of noise and we thought everything was a bit overpriced but hey - we came back refreshed and ready for real life!",5,2004,04,21
35,Excellent,"The other reviews sum up this hotel very well. My wife and I have been to many top hotels around the world and this is quite simply the best one we have stayed in. And as for been expensive - this really is a case of you get what you pay for, and more!",5,2004,04,10
35,Fantastic service,Large hotel which caters more for business and corporates. however the serve provided is better than anything my wife or I have experienced- nothing short of out of this world.The room was upgraded to a superior room overlooking the harbour and marina with an large window of 50 feet in length. it was our anniversary and a bottle of champagne was sent up with chocolates compliments of the management. it was expensive however we did not regret for one moment our choice of hotel. Highly recommended as an exclusive hotel break to pamper yourselves.,5,2004,03,29
35,"Nice, new hotel.","We stayed in Barcelona for three days during our European honeymoon. The hotel is very new and is quite nice and the staff is well informed and friendly. There are advantages to staying in a new hotel as it does not exhibit the kind of wear and tear that is quite common in numerous ""luxury"" European hotels. The hotel upgraded us to a nice corner room and had a bottle of champagne on ice and chocolate covered strawberries in our room. A nice touch, which we appreciated. The only bummer, which to my surprise, was not noted in any previous reviews, is that the hotel is somewhat isolated. It is a 10-15 minute walk to any restaurants and shops. Not a huge distance, but there are many other hotel options that are located right in the thick of things, which is my preference. Plus, sometimes you just want to walk out to get a quick snack or buy a newspaper and hotels in Europe generally do not have gift shops. I would consider staying here again, and would recommend it if you don't mind the location, but would probably stay closer to all the action next time.",4,2004,03,25
35,Good Quality Hotel But Not Cheap!,"After reading many reviews of many hotels in Barcelona, my partner and I decided to choose this hotel - based entirely on this website! I wanted something special as I proposed there and this did fit the bill! 
Very helpful staff, very clean, extremely modern, spa in the room, lovely sauna, posh restaurant, free Cava on arrival. The only fault is that it is very expensive to book but once you get there, they do like to rip you off - a bottle of water was something 4 Euro's! It is not cheap! If you're walking to the Ramlas, it will take about 15 minutes but it is a nice walk! The nearest Metro is about 10 mins away. We would go back there and were happy with our choice - thank you trip advisor!!",4,2004,03,21
35,Brilliant Birthday,"My husband and I just came back from a 3 day break in Barcelona staying at the Eurostars Grand Marina. We chose the hotel after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and were not in any way disappointed. We have to echo what everyone says that the staff were superb, so helpful and friendly, they seemed to know what we wanted even before we did! Nothing was too much trouble for them to make our stay a happy one. We immediately felt at home, even though it is such a grand hotel. We loved the contemporary design of the building and furnishings. We stayed in a standard double, but there was little ""standard"" about it. A large divider between the room and the small hall gave the room a completely different feel once it was slid into place. The bathroom was beautiful, marble floor to ceiling, twin basins, hydro-massage bath and the loo and bidet situated discretely in their own annex off the main bathroom. Millions of bathroom ""freebies"" including the more unusual mouthwash, make-up remover, shaving kit, dental kit, nail file, comb. The rooms were serviced twice daily. What a luxury to have the towels changed after each shower and the sheets changed daily - I could get used to that ! Breakfast was also a revelation, all tastes were catered for from English cooked breakfast, to many kinds of cooked meats, smoked fish and cheeses, fresh fruit, pancakes, cereals, many different types of bread and rolls, freshly squeezed juices and even slabs of chocolate cake and tiny individual chocolate tartlets decorated with a strawberry! Most impressive though was that food was provided for people with special dietary requirements, eg there was rice cakes and soya milk and many different types of yoghurts. Another good facility was the concierge desk - a very good source of information about Barcelona - restaurants etc although as a 5 star hotel the recommended restaurants were all in the 50-60 euros per head bracket ! Drinks in the bar were also expensive, but then you are paying for your surroundings. All in all the best hotel we have ever stayed in and we would recommend it unreservedly for a luxury stay in Barcelona - the city of style.",5,2004,03,19
35,A touch of class,"Stayed at the Grand Marina during Feb 2004 . 25th wedding anniversary . 
Fantastic...it is modern , aimed at the business exec , could be cold but the staff are superb . Breakfasts a delight...dinner was very good but here the staff were slightly too over the top . We had a superb room over the City , could hear the generators from the cruise ships but not a problem , rather seeing them come and go was part of the fun . Easy to walk into the old part of the City but also local buses outside and a stop for the tourist bus . We have stayed in some excellent hotels , and the Marina is right up there amongst them .",5,2004,03,07
35,is there a better hotel?,"Having used the reviews on tripadvisor to select this hotel, all I can say is we are so pleased to take our turn to recommend this hotel which we do without hesitation. We enjoyed a five night break in certainly the best hotel we have ever stayed in, all the staff were wonderful as were all the facilities on offer. If you are contemplating a visit to Barcelona, make your holiday complete and stay at this hotel.",5,2004,03,03
35,Modern Luxury,"I just came back from Grand Marina Hotel in Barcelona, and to those who enjoy modern hotels, with all gadgets and comforts, this place is what you are looking for.

It is very comfortable, has good size room, great bathrooms, and it is a beautiful hotel. The only thing is that the hotel is sort of cold, meaning that it seems to be more focused for executives than for tourists seeking a romantic getaway. But I would stay there again.",5,2004,03,01
35,Fantastic hotel!,"We stayed five nights in the Grand Marina in February 2004 and found it to be the perfect base for a short break in Barcelona. We upgraded to a Junior Suite and felt the extra was worth it - the room was spacious and beautiful. The staff were always friendly and helpful and we got the impression they wanted to do all they could to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. They certainly succeeded and when we ruturn to Barcelona, it will be to this hotel!",5,2004,02,19
35,Good but not perfect,"We visited Barcelona for my wife's birthday and stayed at the Grand Marina as it had the best reviews of all the hotels in town. With all the great reviews previously posted we were expecting something a little special but in my view the hotel is only average for a five star hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the decor is certainly modern and fresh and well designed but unless you take a suite there is not enough storage space for your clothes and luggage if you are staying for more than a few days. The gym has a few bits of kit, some of which were broken and the gym airconditioning was out of order when we were there. The additional load on the ac caused by the placement of the hot spa bath in the gym area is probably to blame. The views from the hotel are great, particularly if you are a boat (ferry) spotter as I am, but don't get excited by the swimming pool, its very small. The bathrooms are nice but surprisingly don't have thermostatic controls on the showers. As it's not on a main road or in the centre of the tourist area its pleasantly quiet and importantly the beds are comfortable. You can easily walk to all the main tourist sites from the hotel. Stay there again? - probably.",3,2004,02,18
35,Wonderful!,"We stopped at the Hotel Grand Marina for a short break to celebrate my 35th birthday. We managed to get cheap flights, so decided to splash out on the 5* GL hotel... and we are so pleased that we did. The hotel's located in the port / harbour area of the city, just next to the middle cable car station. It's only a few minutes walk to Port Vell or the bottom of La Ramblas. The rooms are very modern, and every one has a whirlpool bath and there's lots of great goodies to take home with you! From start to finish, the staff at the hotel couldn't do enough for us. As it as my birthday, I asked if we could have a room overlooking the harbour / city. Not only did we get this (and the view was as wonderful as I'd hoped for!), but they also brought me up some Champagne and chocolates to the room for my birthday! The staff arranged tickets to see Barcelona FC for us, and gave us drinks vouchers for two glasses of cava to use in the bar whenever we wanted throughout our stay. We were also given a voucher for us to get into the casino for free. The leisure facilities are on the top floor / roof of the hotel. Unfortuanately the pool isn't heated, so we didn't get the chance to go in, but it's worth going up there to have a look at the wonderful views of the city.The breakfast was an additional 19 euros each, which we initially thought was steep. We decided to go on my birthday as a treat, but in the end, we went on both mornings we were there. The selection of food and drink available was incredible... they even had Moet champagne! We filled ourselves up and didn't eat again until the evening! The Hotel Grand Marina is without doubt the best hotel we've ever stayed at. If you want a bit of pampering, it's THE place to stay in Barcelona!",5,2004,02,04
35,Absolutely Amazing!!!,"It was my wife's 30th and I wanted to surprise her with something out of the ordinary. She had no idea where we were going until we got there. Prior to our arrival I had advised the hotel that it was my wife's birthday and I would like a very nice room and boy did they exceed expectation!!We pulled up in a taxi and before we could touch the door both sides or the taxi were opened by the hotel staff. They spoke perfect English and took our bags out of the car and advised us to go and check in. The 2 ladies behind the desk welcomed us to this beautiful hotel. The lobby was just amazing... anyway they proceeded to tell us because it was my wife's birthday that they had upgraded us to a suite. If I wasn't already in the good books - when we opened the door to the suite I definitely was. The view was fantastic!!!! really fantastic!!! The whole of the outside wall was window and we had a nice balcony too. We had a view right round from the Mediterranean sea, the Marina with all the yachts, Port Vell, the markets of La Rambla, way up into the mountains and the other side of the Marina where there was a couple of big cruise liners. Whilst admiring the view our bags arrived and we got a call from reception asking if our room was ok??? was it ok?? were they serious?? it was absolutely amazing!!! This place was bigger than most 1 bedroom apartments in London. The bed was enormous, the bathroom had a hydro massage bath along with a multi jet shower. A bidet too along with all sorts of fragrances dotted around. The lounge area was equipped with a bang & olluffsen stereo system, a nice tv with films and sport, very nice sofa with foot rest. Very swanky heating and lighting controls. Whilst we were still in awe of this place room service called to advise as it was a special occasion they were sending up some champagne along with truffles - again we couldn't get over how polite and courteous everybody we dealt with were. Have you ever been anywhere where the cleaning staff where complete suits? We arrived in the afternoon and it was our first time in Barcelona but we didn't want to leave the hotel, we could have happily stayed there for our entire stay. The breakfast was absolutely amazing... everything you could want was there and you just help yourself. As soon as you finish your cutlery is replaced for you to go up again... I'm a big fan of breakfast and I could hardly walk out when I left. We had dinner in the hotel once and it was like being in a high class restaurant. You never need to carry any money with you around the hotel you just need to give your room number and sign a ticket which gets added to your final bill. We had a look at the gym and it had the exact same equipment as my gym that I pay Â£55 a month for. There also was a pool on the top of the roof!! I felt my legs turning to jelly and it was a little cold so I didn't have a paddle. I can definitely see why this is the best hotel in Barcelona. You have to check this place out as I don't think I have spoken highly enough of it.",5,2004,01,27
35,Amazing Service - Beautiful Room!,"My new husband and I were taking a second honeymoon in France, and decided to visit Barcelona. We stayed at The Grand Marina for three nights in November of 2003, and couldn't have been happier!

The staff was always pleasant, the room had a wonderful balcony with views of the ocean and city. Sparkling wine was delivered to our room upon check-in, and a fruit tray was sent up each afternoon.

The room had a wonderful bed, and very comfortable furnishings.

We enjoyed room service (very good), cocktails in the hotel bar on the first floor, and a lovely dinner in their restaurant. The food and drinks were excellent!

We are looking foward to a second visit - what a first class operation!",5,2004,01,07
35,Tre moderne,"Quite hip and modern, very nice maritime theme through out the hotel. 
VERY nice workout facilities on the top floor with georgous views. 
Warm, yet sophistictated rooms. Try for the rooms on the maramagnum side, substantial views. Only downside not in a barrio where people actually live. Barcelona is it's people.",5,2003,12,30
35,lovely hotel,"12/12/03 Christmas shopping in Barcelona! What a truly lovely hotel. 
The attention to detail was just great and the staff were realy attentive to your needs. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone looking for 5*treatment. The hotel resturant was really good and the service superb. I would certainly return to this hotel.",5,2003,12,12
35,Great View!  Great Hotel!,"We stayed at this hotel for a pre-cruise in early October. We had requested a junior suite and were upgraded to a bay view suite. It was absolutely fantastic. We had windows that overlooked the water as well as windows that overlooked the city. The location couldn't be more perfect, sitting at the base of La Rambla and close to all the action. 
Definately worth its 5 star rating. We are going to be returning to Barcelona next November for a Transatlatic cruise next year and hope to convince our friends to splurge a little and the 4 of us stay at the Grand Marina.",5,2003,11,29
35,Superb hotel in fabulous location,"I selected this hotel for my trip to Barcelona having read the other Trip Advisor reviews .... and they were all absolutely right ! 
5* quality sums up this hotel - the location (5 mins to La Rambla, 5 mins to the marina), the breakfasts (free champagne!), the rooms and, particularly, the staff who recommended some fantastic, authentic spanish tapas restaurants. I also managed to book my rooms at a great rate and the hotel kindly upgraded my room as it was my birthday (although that may have been my friends but I cannot get them to admit it !) - would certainly recommend taking an upgraded room, preferably one at the front of the hotel with balcony and Japanese shower.",5,2003,11,07
35,Fantastic,"My husband and I just came back from Barcelona Oct 9th -Oct 12th. The Hotel was fantastic, the rooms were great and the staff could'nt do enough for you. We also we lucky to be able to use the rooftop pool, the views from there we great. even the pool was freezing. The breakfast in the morning was great and the waiters were very helpful. 
We would recomend anybody to stay in this hotel it was worth paying the extra money.",5,2003,10,17
35,A true pleasure!,"Marvellous - this hotel oozes class and offers a 5 star feel as soon as you enter the lobby!The staff were superb - helpful, extremely efficient and warm and friendly (a true breath of fresh air when compared with many of the other hotels of a similar rating I've stayed at across Europe).Room was superb (paid 220 Euro's per night) and views of City are excellent.The position of the Hotel is also first class as it is only 5 minutes walk from the Ramblas and 10 minutes to the best fish restauants at Palau de Mar as well as being right next to Port Vell and it's facilities. I found it's location to be relaxing and peaceful and I was very pleased we chose this place as the noise levels at the other end of the Ramblas were horrific!Keep up the good work - I'll certainly be back!",5,2003,10,09
35,Very Nice Hotel,"I stayed here in August and September 2003, and it is a very nice hotel. The decor is first rate, very modern and sleek, and the materials were very inviting. The rooms have hardwood floors and granite and marble bathrooms. The walls are paneled in attractive cherry wood.

The service was excellent, and the location is near the Ramblas, but away from some of the hustle and bustle.

I would recommend this hotel for anybody traveling to Barcelona.",5,2003,09,15
35,What a hotel!,"This is a great hotel, in a good location only 5mins walk to the Ramblas, 15mins to the beach and in close proximty to loads of bars and restaurants. The view from the 8th floor is fantanstic and we made good use of the roof top swimming pool, jacuzi and sauna! We were greated with a smile and the service was fantastic. Anything we asked for we got (inc. late checkout till 4:30pm). The decor was plush and in true 5 star surroundings. The rooms are all of a very good size with great a/c, and some include balcony, and/or seperate power shower with multi-jets! The bath tubs are all jacuzi! In general, slightly on the pricey side but if you can afford it, it's definitely worth the money. 
Try avoid ordering room service or from the bar - expect to pay 5 star prices!",5,2003,08,06
35,Fabulous Hotel,"Without a doubt,the finest hotel I've ever stayed at. Stayed in June,pre cruise for two nights. Everything about the hotel is first class,very modern in design and decor.",5,2003,07,10
35,Super New Deluxe hotel,"Located right in the heart of Barcelona. A superb new hotel and we had a super price through hotel-... - Hopefully we will be there again soon
",5,2003,01,26
35,Instead of 5 I only award 4 stars!,"The hotel is very nice, a bit luxurious, the rooms are very spacious and the beds very comfortable.
Breakfast is great and has something for everyone.
The bar in 1. Stock could use an upgrade. The bar on the terrace was unfortunately not open (early October).
The hotel is very close to the center and is very well suited for a city break. 
Reception staff could be better trained. 
When checking in, I explicitly asked for the gym opening hours. I was told from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. On the last evening I learned from other guests that it is open all the time. 
The same person also had difficulties with the bill. Since it was a business trip, I had to have the invoice issued in the name of the company. This turned out to be difficult as I had paid in advance and the bill was zero at check in. The employee was convinced that the company had paid the bill and ignored all my arguments. 
Fortunately, a member of staff (Maria) came to Help center and relaxed the situation. A correction on the invoice made it possible. 
As a 5-star hotel, I did not find the whole thing customer-oriented. I travel on business several times a year and have never experienced anything like this. 
I think if all employees learn from each other, something like this can be avoided in the future. 
I will stay there again and hope that I can award the 5 stars.",4,2024,10,11
35,Negative,"Comfortable hotel near the Rambla if you want to walk , place now dated for my taste and given the costs , poor breakfast service as proposed but really 3 stars , poor room service , poor cleaning service , really poor restaurant . I often come to Barcelona and this time I fell here because I could not find a place near the race teams visa event 2024. That's all I'll say.",3,2024,10,06
35,Attention and service,"The overall stay was perfect.
Breakfast is amazing! Excellent variety, restocking and quality! (Top-rated scrambled eggs I've ever eaten!) 
The attention of Emilia and all the staff is amazing , 5 stars !! Keen to come back! ✨",5,2024,09,23
35,Good hotel but not 5GL,"Good hotel but not 5GL. Very friendly staff, cleanliness right, but facilities and above all, breakfast, are not up to scratch.

Breakfast is 4 stars, do not replenish conveniently and scrambled eggs are ranch. 

The staff is very friendly in all departments.

The location is good in the port. 

The spacious bathroom with very large and powerful shower.",4,2024,07,24
35,Not a good price/performance ratio,"The location of the hotel is good with its proximity to the city. My room was on the 6th floor with a view of the harbor. The cruise ships are interesting to see, but the constantly running diesel engines are very annoying. On the first day there was a huge ship in front of the window, with a gong and an announcement every 30 minutes. Before departure there was loud party music that blared into the room. 
The room was bright and spacious. Unfortunately you can't open the window and it is a bit old. Definitely too expensive for 420/night. The breakfast is good. The staff very friendly! I wouldn't come back 🤷‍♀️",3,2024,06,12
35,Excellent,From the reception to Anna in the lobby all the staff are very friendly. The hotel is in an excellent location and very well connected. I recommend having something in the lobby and enjoying the terrace.,5,2024,04,26
35,We will repeat for sure!! Very good service!!!,"A hotel with a very good location, great facilities and above all the service and kindness of its staff, Anna in the lobby made us feel at home. In addition to highlighting its buffet breakfast on the first floor, we had breakfast on the terrace, a calm and welcoming atmosphere. We will return and I recommend it 100%.",5,2024,04,26
35,It could have been worse,"I stayed with my husband from 04.13.23 to 04.16.23 in a suite as it was a gift for my 60th birthday!
My husband did everything online as soon as he arrived at the reception without a minimum of elegance, they thought it best to say that he had to pay immediately with the amount and already as a business card it says a lot.
Once we arrive in the suite, the first problems begin: the bathroom sink is blocked so every now and then we switch to the shower in the tub which splashes water everywhere... completely frayed bathrobe. Television not working in the room. We point this out to the staff as it all cost us a nice €1,700. They managed to drain the sink... the only positive note was the breakfast.",1,2024,04,24
35,"An unforgettable evening: Saturday opera, exquisite dinner and first-class service.","On Saturday, March 9, we had the privilege of sharing a truly unforgettable evening as a family at the Eurostars Grand Marina hotel in Barcelona.
The night began with an opera concert in the lobby, a unique musical experience that captivated and excited us from the first moment.
Each piece of the repertoire was performed with impeccable technique and deep emotional expression, transporting us to a world of passion and beauty.
It was a true feast for the senses.
After the concert, we went to the hotel restaurant, where we had an exquisite dinner. The menu, paired to perfection, delighted our palate.
The service and attention of the hotel staff was impeccable at all times. From the reception to the restaurant, each of the workers did their best to serve us with kindness, efficiency and professionalism that made us feel very comfortable and at ease.
I would definitely recommend the experience to anyone looking to enjoy an unforgettable night.",5,2024,03,12
35,Great evening of opera and spectacular dinner.,"On Saturday, March 9, we experienced a
Unforgettable family evening at the Eurostars Grand Marina in Barcelona.
We enjoyed an exciting and wonderful live show, highly recommended for fans of opera and good music.
During the performance, we were able to taste good wines and various cocktails, along with surprising gastronomic accompaniment.
At the end of the concert, we shared an exquisite dinner in the hotel restaurant.
I highlight in every instance the careful, respectful, attentive and polite attention of all the hotel staff. Congratulations! We will definitely return.",5,2024,03,11
35,I loved itGreat Opera Experience with Dinner. I will return again with family and friends,"Great Opera experience, we went with the family. Exceptionally friendly staff. We had dinner at Aire de Mar, very cozy atmosphere.
Very fresh restaurant offering, we had dinner and enjoyed it. It is a place to remember for a lifetime. Thanks to your staff, they are exceptional",5,2024,03,10
35,Live Opera with Aperitif and Dinner,"I have the text:

The Eurostars Grand Marina presents Opera Saturdays, an exclusive proposal in which you can enjoy live opera in the hotel itself.

We completed this wonderful experience with the tasting of a snack, in this case it was Enrique Tomás ham, accompanied by a drink from their menu, and we extended it with a dinner at their restaurant, a menu that included:

-Artichokes with ham and romesco sauce.
-Steak Tartare with low temperature egg passed through a fryer.
-Hake in green sauce
-Tangerine with ice cream
-Catalan cheese board with quince and picos

Every Saturday in March and April from 8:30 p.m.

Located in the World Trade Center complex, the Eurostars Grand Marina stands out as an exclusive and avant-garde hotel with a Mediterranean essence.
The hotel exhibits works by renowned artists and presents temporary exhibitions of avant-garde art in the piano bar space, where we can enjoy a drink at the cocktail bar.

It has spectacular rooms for events with views of the port. The Aire de Mar Restaurant delights with its exquisite cuisine, which is where we had dinner.
They also have an outdoor pool open in summer, which gives us the best views of Barcelona every sunset.",5,2024,02,25

35,Unique and special,"Our stay at Grand Maria will be unforgettable due to a big difference ""they managed to make us feel unique and special"" they achieved this due to the great human capital they have and their effort, thanks to Sara, director of the hotel for her attention and dedication and to that wonderful team with What counts I cannot fail to mention Ricardo and Emilia, they won the heart of our little one and ours without a doubt, of course magnificent facilities, cleanliness, great breakfast buffet with top quality products, great service in the room, magnificent restaurant with local and top quality product great respect for the product, cooking at its point, magnificent preparations ""dry rice with lobster"" ""super creamy croquettes"" ""octopus at its point"" what to say without a doubt a great chef Carlos, we hope to return soon a hug huge from Malaga.",5,2023,12,17
35,An excellent hotel in Barcelona,"It is a hotel that offers much more than great luxury and comfort. The human team that assists you during your stay is always attentive to ensure that not a single detail is missed and during the days that you are their guest you feel ""pampered""!! On the other hand, the location is privileged and the restoration they offer is delicious!!! I recommend it 100%!!!!
",5,2023,12,16
35,A really nice stay,"After a Mediterranean cruise, we wanted to spend a few days in Barcelona. We decided on the Grand Marina Hotel because it was close to the cruise terminal. We booked for 3 nights and we experienced a beautiful hotel in a prime location, with short distances to the old town and the beach.
Tip: If you are traveling by taxi, ask about the price before you start your journey, even in Barcelona people like to cheat.

We were given a very friendly welcome at the hotel and were given a spacious room with a balcony. We booked breakfast, which was extraordinarily plentiful and delicious. Due to a technical defect, we unfortunately had to change our room after 2 nights, but this went without a problem. When we came out of the city late in the evening, our luggage had already been brought to the new room. To our surprise, the hotel management had rebooked us into a suite for the last night as an apology, and a bottle of champagne was waiting for us.

We will definitely come back, not only because of the beautiful hotel, but also because of the extraordinarily good service!

",5,2023,11,26
35,The kindness with which they have treated us,"We have been to the hotel cafeteria and although we are not guests of the hotel, they treated us phenomenally and were super friendly and kind, the treatment is a pleasure.

35,Five stars,"Strategic location, close to the Ramblas and the Gothic Quarter, excellently soundproofed and clean rooms... attentive staff... check out at 12:00... coffee and well-stocked minibar in the room... shower with shower head like in a spa!",5,2023,10,23
35,Everything exceptional!,"We loved everything. The staff is very friendly, the rooms are very spacious, the breakfast is extraordinary. We will surely return. In fact, I'm doing the review now as I'm looking for dates to return.",5,2023,09,11
35,Bad behavior,"Booked on booking for €108 (paid). A few days before arrival, booking contacted me, the hotel got the prices wrong so I would have to pay 209. Now I can't find a hotel close by and furthermore, without waiting, the booking was cancelled.",1,2023,08,15
35,Excelente para embarcarse en crucero,Un hotel muy cómodo y moderno con una ubicación excelente para embarcar o desembarcar desde los cruceros que salen en la marina. Estando cerca solo toma unos 5 minutos por taxi el llegar a la Marina. Por la noche el hotel es silencioso y muy tranquilo para poder descansar.,5,2023,07,12
35,Estancia 3 noches,"No me parece un hotel de 5 estrellas,está un poco anticuado,el primer día cenamos en el hotel y madre mía muy lentos ,nos fuimos sin postre porque pasaron 20 minutos desde que nos trajeron la carta y no apareció  nadie para poder pedir así que pagamos y nos fuimos.Nuestra habitación el colchón daba ruido y en el baño solo nos pusieron peine y gorro ,me parece que para pagar 1200 euros tres noches podían esmerarse.Segun quién haga la limpieza te recarga los cafés, agua y deja chocolatinas ,a otras se les olvida,EL ascensor muy lento y por fin el desayuno inmejorable .",3,2023,05,01
35,No merece las estrellas que dicen que tiene,"No me parece un hotel de 5 estrellas como mucho le daba tres superior. Las habitaciones están bien pero necesitan una rehabilitación están demasiado viejas. El Desayuno no es para tirar cohetes, el espacio que tienen para ello no es adecuado deberían organizarlo de otra manera ya que para el volumen de gente que hay, las personas se molestan unas a otras. En cuanto a lo que el bar cierre a las 00:00 un sábado por la noche y siendo un hotel de 5 estrellas debería estar abiero.",3,2023,04,24
35,Pulizia camere inestistente o pessima,"Siamo molto delusi dalla gestione dell'hotel molto approssimativa. Per due giorni siamo usciti alle 9:30 di mattina e rientrati alle 16:30 e la camera non era stata pulita. Il primo giorno siamo stati accusati di non aver apposto sulla maniglia della porta il cartello ""pulire la camera"". Il secondo giorno, nonostante l'avessimo messo, comunque non è stata rifatta e siamo senza teli da bagno puliti per poterci fare una doccia. Inoltre lo staff parla solo spagnolo....io parlo inglese e loro rispondono in spagnolo! Hotel 5 stelle con prezzi altissimi (es. 2 bottiglie di acqua €15) e poi non rifanno le camere???
Esperienza negativa",1,2023,04,08
35,Top!,Sehr guter Aufenthalt! Beim Einchecken mussten wir ca. 15 Minuten warten - haben dann aber ein gratis Update und eine Flasche Champagner als Entschädigung erhalten. die Zimmer sind sehr gross und sehr sauber. die Mitarbeiter sind stets freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das Morgen-Buffet ist sehr gross und lecker. Zu Fuss ist man in etwa 10-15 Minuten bei Las Ramblas. Alles in allem war es ein sehr angenehmer Aufenthalt dort.,5,2023,03,31
35,Pésima experiencia,"El hotel se ve bien por fuera, pero las habitaciones están viejas y mal cuidadas. Lo peor es el baño y el servicio de agua caliente. No hay forma de regular eñ agua de la regadera, sale hirviendo y te quema y después sale fría. Alquilamos 2 habitaciones y en las 2 pasó lo mismo. Llamamos para pedir que la arreglaran y no pudieron, dijeron que depende cuantas habitaciones se estén bañando sale así. 4 días de terror! Además hay un olor a caño por los pasillos",2,2023,01,10
35,Infinito,"In posizione straordinaria il grand hotel ricorda un transatlantico in partenza per le Americhe. Cristoforo Colombo ( la statua ) , da raggiungere a qualche centinaio di metri ce lo ricorda. Siamo lontani dalle spiagge, ma vicini alla Ramblas e quindi dal centro della città catalana. Servizio preciso e professionale, adatto anche a convention importanti. Deliziosa ed infinita Colazione internazionale.  Non posso valutare il rapporto prezzo/qualità.",5,2022,12,24
35,"Quattro stelle sì, cinque troppe","Hotel Eurostars Grand Marina è localizzato nel porto di Barcellona (Moll de Barcelona), a poche centinaia di metri dal Monumento a Cristoforo Colombo e da La Rambla. 
Struttura imponente che ricorda la figura di un transatlantico, quasi trecento camere distribuite su otto piani, presenti anche una palestra, una favolosa terrazza, che permette di godere di una vista a centottanta gradi sulla città e sul mare, e quattro sale conferenza.
La nostra camera, una deluxe con vista sul Port Vell, era spaziosa (circa trenta metri quadrati) e luminosa grazie alle grandi vetrate.
Tuttavia la pulizia, soprattutto nella vasca da bagno e nel wc, lasciava a desiderare.
Mancavano, inoltre, gli accappatoi, cosa molto strana in una struttura alberghiera a cinque stelle.
Presenti, invece, un kit per l'igiene dentale e le pantofole.
La camera non era ben insonorizzata, sentivamo le voci ed i passi di coloro che camminavano in corridoio e nella stanza a fianco.
Il letto matrimoniale era comodo, molto grande, con due cuscini per parte.
La sala dedicata alla colazione è enorme,  un po' caotica, e la scelta dei prodotti è vasta, perfetta ripartizione tra dolce e salato.
Unica nota negativa del primo pasto della giornata è la presenza di macchine per caffè e cappuccino, in certi momenti bisogna mettersi in coda per riempire la tazza.
Nel complesso un hotel molto buono, con posizione strategica, ma non da cinque stelle.",4,2022,12,18
35,Todo excelente,"Todo muy bueno. Las habitaciones son grandes, el desayuno de buena calidad y hay tanta variedad que necesitas una semana para probar de todo. La verdad es que me sorprenden las críticas. La atención era inmejorable en todo momento, y las cama muy cómodas. Descansamos de verdad. Me habría gustado tener una habitación en un piso más alto, pero la que tuvimos estuvo muy bien. Tarde o temprano, seguro que volveré. ",5,2022,11,26
35,Die Bilder ezeigen die 5 Sterne,"Das Hotel ist absolut in die Jahre gekommen, dass Reinigungpersonal fängt erst gegen 5 Uhr die bestehenden Zimmer zu putzten und wenn mann fragt ob sie später kommen können werden die aggressiv und fluchen auf spanisch!!! 

Die kommen genau um 5 uhr wenn ich zurück gekehrt bin vom Ausflug 

Hotel sehen sie bilder selbst ob dies einem 5 sterne Hotel entspricht 

Tassen werden nur per Wasser gereinigtunter dem lavabo abgspühlt und nicht ausgetauscht mit richtig gereinigten tassen

35,Sehr schönes Hotel an besonderer Lage,"Sehr schönes, hochwertiges Hotel im Hafen von Barcelona. Die Erreichbarkeit mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln ist etwas schwierig, aber es lohnt sich! Unser Zimmer war extrem ruhig, geräumig und mit sensationellen Betten ausgestattet! Das Bad hatte neben zwei getrennten Waschbecken sowohl eine Badewanne, als auch eine sehr schöne Duschkabine. Zimmerausstattung und Service waren auf sehr gutem Niveau. Das Frühstücksbuffet war umfangreich und gut. Das Personal sehr freundlich und aufmerksam. Unser Aufenthalt war leider zu kurz, wir kommen wieder!",5,2022,09,19
35,5 Sterne?,"5 Sterne? Wofür? Die Zimmer sehen lange nicht so aus wie auf den Fotos. Wir hatten anfangs ein 2-BZ mit Zustellbett mit Balkon. Naja, den Balkon braucht man nicht wirklich. Hier stehen einem keine Sitzgelegenheiten zur Verfügung. Und - ich bin nicht pingelig, aber sauber sollte ein 5-Sterne-Zimmer schon sein! Oder sehe ich das falsch? Nach 3 Tagen mussten wir dann in ein 2-BZ mit weniger qm umziehen. Mein Mann musste beruflich nach Madrid und mein Sohn und ich sind dann umgezogen. Das angeblich kostenlose Upgrade war nicht möglich, obwohl das Hotel nicht ausgebucht war. Das Zimmer hat dann den Vogel abgeschossen (s. Bilder). 

Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Da kann man nicht meckern. 

Der Teppich in den Fluren wird anscheinend nie gesaugt. 

Von der Dachterrasse hat man einen schönen Ausblick auf Barcelona und den Hafen. Der Pool ist okay. Die Poolbar ebenfalls. Aber, das habe ich in Barcelona schon um ein Vielfaches besser erlebt.

Parken ist im nahegelegenen Parkhaus (2 Minuten Fußweg) günstiger. 

Fazit: Der Preis auf der Homepage ist unschlagbar! Man sollte sich hier überlegen, worauf man Wert legt.",3,2022,08,30

Il terzo letto non aggiunto, ma un divano letto.
La piscina all'ultimo piano sottodimensionata, mentre la palestra è ben attrezzata.
La colazione un buon buffet, ma senza alcun tipo di servizio ai tavoli a parte la loro pulizia finale.

Onestamente l’hotel si trova in una posizione comoda ma in mezzo al porto, se vi danno una camera verso il porto aspettatevi di sentire i rumori dei motori delle navi perché le camere sono poco insonorizzate e vi assicuro che non è piacevole. L’idea non è male ma un sonno tranquillo proprio non c’è.
Camera abbastanza bella ma non come si presenta sul sito.  Noi abbiamo soggiorno in una camera premier con balcone (non utilizzabile perché piccolo e sporco), con due letti che formavano il letto matrimoniale e una branda per la terza persona (5 stelle L?)

Türgriff an Badezimmertür fehlt, nur Badewanne mit Handbrause.
Toilette sehr eng.
Frühstück ist ok jedoch nichts außergewöhnliches.   
Als Positives is6 zu erwähnen, dass das Personal sehr freundlich ist .
Ich würde es jedoch keinem weiterempfehlen, komme schon länger nach
Barcelona und für den Preis gibt es wesentlich bessere Hotels hier.",3,2022,05,27

35,Fin de semana con pack oferta,"Hemos pasado el fin de semana con el pack de oferta, que incluía la cena, dormir y desayuno. Ha sido fabuloso, nos han dejado escoger habitación con balcón, vistas a la ciudad, ... coincidió con Sant Jordi, y en la habitación por la tarde nos dejaron un libro, una rosa y un pastel. Todo fué genial, la cena, el desayuno no faltaba detalle y el personal amabilísimo. Lo recomendaría al 100%",5,2022,04,25
35,excelente atención del personal del Buffet del desayuno,"he estado con mi pareja en la promoción de ven a cenar y te invitamos a dormir. la experiencia ha sido fantástica y sin duda repetiremos cuando podamos, porque la cena estuvo exquisita y el concierto de opera privé fue una delicia. 
Pero cuando creiamos que ya lo habíamos visto todo nos sentamos a desayunar y fue impresionante la cantidad la calidad y el personal, un 10 gracias a Eli y a su equipo, volveré una y mil veces.",5,2022,04,23

El desayuno de hoy, extraordinario 
Todo bien cuidado, gran servicio, tanto durante la copa - ópera, la cena y el desayuno
La habitación fantástica con extraordinarias vistas.
Os propongo que hagáis otros eventos parecidos, quizás también con música en vivo cubana o clásica
Volveremos",5,2022,03,27
35,No merece 5 estrellas,"Elegimos este hotel por su calificación en Tripadvisor y nada que ver. Se supone que es una hotel 5 estrellas pero tiene varios aspectos que no cumplen con su categoría. Estuvimos alojados en la suite la 611 pues para empezar la habita tiene falta de mantenimiento y limpieza, el frontal de la bañera está suelto y es una tapa de madera despintada que da un poco de mal aspecto, la bañera de hidromasaje no funciona, el cajón del lavabo está descolgado, CUIDADO en embellecedor del suelo de la entrada al baño tiene un tornillo levantado que si lo pisas puedes hacerte mucho daño, no ponen amenities( gorro de ducha, kit de afeitado) ni un simple albornoz y eso que estás en un 5 estrellas en una suite. En la habitación no tienes carta del servicio de habitaciones y mucho menos de los servicios del hotel. En la recepción preguntamos un día donde podíamos cenar dentro del hotel y la recepcionista no tenía ni idea de que restaurante tenía disponible el hotel y menos donde quedaba. El último día de desayuno muchos huéspedes se paseaban incluso charlaban con el personal del área de desayuno sin mascarillas y nadie les decía nada( esto si depende del personal del hotel que está para que se cumplan las normas. Y ojo no es que sea o no sea defensora del uso de mascarillas pero si es una norma para los españoles pues también debe serlo para el turismo.
Como aspecto positivo la habitación tiene vistas increíbles y está muy bien ubicado. La comida del restaurante muy buena eso si.",3,2022,02,28
35,No llega a un buen 4 estrellas,"5 estrellas GL?? Increíble . Hotel muy anticuado. Suite anticuada con suelo roto( entrada de baño) , limpieza muy mejorable, sin artículos de aseo ( ni cepillo de dientes , ni gorro de ducha , ni set de afeitado ni albornoces !) . Insisto increíble para 5 estrellas GL y una suite de más de 1000€ tres noches . 
Pregunto en recepción por la noche donde puedo cenar en el hotel y me dicen que pregunte arriba que no sabe . Parece de chiste .",2,2022,02,28
35,Falta de higiene grave,"Todo iba perfecto hasta que abrimos las puertas del armario. Ahí estaban 4 pruebas de antígenos usadas de los anteriores clientes de la habitación. En los tiempos que corren me parece inaceptable esa falta de higiene en las habitaciones, me parece que se tendría que tener mas cuidado.",1,2022,01,09
35,Nicht das Geld wert!,"Leider ist das Hotel in die Jahre gekommen.
Die Balkontüre ließ sich nicht verriegeln. Auch nach Reklamation nicht. Der Schminkspiegel war locker und die Minibar warm. Dies wurde aber repariert. Leider war das Zimmer nicht sauber. Überall Staub.
Das schlechteste war aber das Essen vom Zimmerservice. Wir hatten Hähnchensticks bestellt. Diese waren roh!!! Der Zimmerservice hat das Essen wieder abgeholt und wollte sich nochmal melden. Er kam aber nicht.
Es wurde noch nichtmal storniert!
Zum Glück hat die Rezeption nach unsere Beschwerde die Kosten gestrichen.
Wir hatten ein Zimmer zur Stadt, das sollte man sich genau überlegen. Diese Zimmer sind sehr laut. Im Hafen befanden sich mehrere Fähren. Diese lassen die ganze Nacht die Schiffsdiesel laufen. Das ist auch im Zimmer laut!
Das einzig gute ist die Nähe zur Innenstadt.",1,2022,01,08
35,Grand Hotel,"Posizione straordinaria. Praticamente sul mare, ma lontano dalla spiaggia però. Ambiente elegante anche se in certi angoli della camera da rinfrescare. Servizio professionale e adatto a convention di una certa importanza. Ottima ed infinita Colazione internazionale. Delusione totale per la pausa pranzo, con pessima Paella. Non posso valutare il prezzo/qualitò.",4,2021,12,25
35,No se le pueden poner peros,"Etuvimos en el marco de un evento de mi empresa y a pesar de haber temido que fuese un coloso impersonal, ha resultado ser un buen hotel.
Las habitaciones son muy grandes y cómodas. La ducha es fantástica, tiene una columna de masajes increíbles y todo fenomenal. Por ponerle una pega, incluiría lo que es una carta de almohadas, que hoy en día es un deber y que en más de 2 ocasiones me he encontrado turistas en el hotel sin mascarilla. Pienso que o no se les ha explicado bien o bien no se les recuerda cuando se les ve. No es de buen gusto meterte en un ascensor del que acaban de bajar sin mascarilla.
El desayuno nos encantó. Muy completo y rico - el servicio muy bueno.
De la ubicación no puedo opinar porque eso siempre depende a que vienes y por que parte quieres moverte. Está cerca del Port Vell, donde se puede comer o cenar muy bien. Las vistas no son directamente al mar, al menos no desde la habitación que yo tenia, sino a un patio con un edificio de oficinas pero seguramente que las hay con vistas al puerto.",5,2021,12,10
35,Esta antiguo,"Tiene la moqueta muy sucia y, en general, requiere una rehabilitación para ponerse a tono. El sitio es espectacular y resulta decepcionante. El zumo de naranja del desayuno estaba aguado. Valoro positivamente el convenio de formación con la Universidad de Barcelona. El room service estuvo sin recoger hasta muy tarde.",3,2021,11,13
35,buena ubicacion,"lo mejor del hotel es la ubicacion. el cuarto era grande y tenia buenas vistas.
el desayuno no era de un hotel 5 estrellas. todo parecia viejo , recalentado. 
mucho mejor tomar el desayuno afuera del hotel.",3,2021,09,05
35,Caro para lo que ofrece y para la oferta que hay en Barcelona,"Creo recordar que es mi cuarta estancia en el hotel. Esta vez era una habitación premier con cama doble en piso superior. Suerte que es premier porque si no no me lo quiero ni imaginar. Cuando un hotel tiene una categoría hay que gastar dinero para mantenerla…se llama invertir. Ahora subiré unas fotos, habitación de vuelta tamaño, pero la peor en la que he estado en este hotel. Cortinas con agujeros, con manchas, parque con signos de que ha vivido lo suyo, en fin. Mañana primer día de desayuno, a ver cómo sale. Por relación calidad/precio los hay muchiiiiiiisimo mejores.",1,2021,09,02
35,Siempre volvemos,Siempre que nos hospedamos en Barcelona nos encanta este tema la verdad que los desayunos las habitaciones las vistas es que todo en general está muy muy bonito nos gusta mucho comer en este restaurante tiene unas vistas muy bonitas de tomarte una copa inclusive la terraza sientes a gusto y te sientes como en casa está muy bien,5,2021,08,22
35,Non rispecchia le aspettative di un 5 stelle,"Hotel assolutamente inadeguato per essere considerato un 5 stelle.
Di fatto la stanza e gli standard risultano essere di scarsa qualità, pulizia e condizioni della camera scadenti.
I bagni in pessime condizioni, il lavabo otturato, isolamento acustico degli infissi scadente, tant’è vero che risulta permanente e del tutto fastidioso il rumore dei motori delle navi che ormeggiano di giorno e di notte.
Per queste motivazioni questo albergo al massimo potrebbe essere considerato un 3 stelle superiori.",1,2021,08,19
35,"Ni 5 ni 4 ni 3 estrellas,","Hotel que pagas las estrellas y para mi no tiene ni 3, se basan en el turismo extranjero.

35,Ven a cenar con nosotros,"Reservamos la promoción ven a cenar con nosotros y la verdad que todo ha sido mejor de lo que me pensaba, la habitación perfecta ,la cena buena al igual que el ritmo entre platos, los camareros muy amables y dando muy buen servicio,el desayuno perfecto todo el personal amable y dispuesto.Seguridad covid también muy bien.La ubicación perfecta para dar un paseo , todo muy muy bien, muchas gracias por todo y a todos , buen trabajo y simpatía de Cristina en recepción con mi reserva y felicitar a Oscar por su amabilidad y buen hacer en el servicio de cena y desayuno, sin desmerecer a nadie que todos todos muy bien.",5,2021,06,24
35,Decepcionante,"Contraté la oferta de ven a cenar y te invitamos a dormir pague 170 € por una suite con vistas al mar se supone que es un hotel de 5 estrellas llegué a las 4 de la tarde para poder disfrutar del hotel de las vistas al mar de la terraza y poder relajarme mi sorpresa es que la terraza está cerrada sin dar ninguna explicación simplemente que está cerrada sin más .
vuelvo a la habitación que me han asignado y no me van las tarjetas de entrada estan

Descodificadas bajo a recepción y me indican que tengo que esperar en el pasillo de la habitación que venga el técnico de 15 a 20 minutos esperando que viniera más otros 15 o 20 minutos mientras que arreglan la puerta .
una vez dentro de la habitación me doy cuenta que hay mucho ruido de viento ya que en las ventanas no están bien cerradas ni hay un buen cerramiento con lo cual me espera una noche de mucho ruido.( recuerdo que es un hotel de 5 estrellas )pido cambio de habitación y me dicen que si me mandan a la otra punta del hotel y me dan una habitación similar habitación bastante antigua en la nevera faltan baldas pero de momento va bien .
la cena muy correcta es un menú preparado el camarero que nos asignan encantador( las bebidas no están incluidas botella de vino blanco básica 26 € )cuando llame para hacer la reserva indique que era el cumpleaños de mi pareja y me dijeron que tendría una botella de cava y un pastelito en la habitación eso es de agradecer qué era un detalle por parte de ellos lo malo es que ese detalle lo tuve que reclamar a las 23 porque brillaba por su ausencia.
Buffet de la mañana correcto típico buffet.

Resumen no vale la pena .
El estrés que pase de estar cambiando de habitación y de estar reclamando un hotel de esta categoría tiene que avanzar sé a todas esas pequeñas cosas como comprobar que las puertas funcionan bien ruidos en la habitación mal cerramiento de ventanas y pequeños detalles así como informar de los servicios que ofrecen y dar la opción al cliente si se quiere alojar o no.",2,2021,05,10
35,Scadente,"Per essere un 5 stelle GL è alquanto deludente... Citare i fiori finti ovunque è forse sufficiente.
Servizio buono.
Camere comode e ampie, ben rifinite, eleganti. 
Per scegliere:, c'è di meglio a Barcellona. ",3,2021,05,09
35,Excelente estancia,"El hotel está decorado con buen gusto, las habitaciones son amplias, limpias y estupendas, a destacar la cama, que es muy cómoda. Las vistas magníficas y el restaurante un lujo, aunque un poco caro.

Por poner una pega, la insonorización es prácticamente nula, por lo que escucharás tanto las fiestas en la habitación de al lado como las noches de dar rienda suelta a la pasión.",4,2021,05,07
35,Experiencia NEFASTA para ser 5*,"Cogimos la promo de ven a cenar y te invitamos a dormir y en general tenía las expectativas muy altas siendo un hotel de 5*. Y fue una decepción constante. Primero que se escuchaba TODO de la habitación contínua...(que se marcaron las 50 sombras de Grey a las 2 de la mañana hasta las 5 y luego después de desayunar). Segundo, encontré un pelo en el plato de la cena y nadie pidió disculpas por ello ni se me recompensó por ello y tercero que a la mañana siguiente al quejarme en recepción la directora de alojamiento me invitó a regresar para repetir la.experiencia y llevo 3 semanas esperando a que me conteste los mails o me devuelva parcialmente la.estancia nefasta que pasamos.
He estado en hoteles de 3* en las que no se ha escuchado un alma estando el hotel completo. Y en este que se supone que son 5* te esperas calidad...y ni eso!",1,2021,04,27
35,Ven a cenar y te invitamos a dormir! Exeperiencia recomendable!,"Cogímos la oferta ven a cenar y te invitamos a dormir y ha sido una grata sorpresa, trato exquisito, cena genial! La habitación con buenas visitas y muy agradable la estancia en ella. Experiencia muy recomendable. Dar las gracias a todo el equipo de Eurostars por cuidar y ofrecer un servicio estupendo.
Animo a todos aquello que quieran desconectar y cambiar de aires en tiempos de pandemia a visitar este hotel. ",5,2021,04,11

La atención en la recepción excelente, destacando 
la amabilidad y la profesionalidad de Nicolás, que estuvo muy atento y no se le escapó ningun detalle a comentarnos.

También agradecer la atención y el buen servicio de Rana en el bar de la primera planta y de Elisabeth por la mañana durante el desayuno.

¡Volveremos!",5,2021,03,11
35,Estancia muy cómoda,"Cogimos la oferta de quedarnos a cenar y te regalaban la estancia nocturna.  La verdad es que estuvimos muy a gusto en la City Suite. Una habitación muy grande con gran cama, saloncito y un baño muy completo con separación de WC que se agradece. Los amenities muy justitos para ser un  hotel de esa categoría.  Tuvieron el detalle de subir a la habitación un trozo de tarta por cumplir años. Las vistas son a la ciudad y son bonitas sobre todo de noche. El balcón muy pequeño.  Todo muy limpio.

La cena un poco decepcionante puesto que algunos platos son recalentados y demasiado ruido en el Hall mientras cenábamos. Precios de los vinos multiplicados x 4. Lo mejor viene después de la cena, que puedes sentarte a tomarte una copa y disfrutar de música en directo. 

El desayuno bastante completo y variado. Aunque el zumo de naranja no es natural. 

Cumplen con las medidas Covid.",4,2021,03,09
35,"Pensaba que era un 5 etrellas ""Gran Lujo....""","Pasé una noche en este hotel y tengo sentimientos encontrados. Me acogía una pack  romántico que ofrecían,  2 personas con media pensión (cena) y salida retardada (hasta las 18h). Aunque la oferta no esta mal no cubrió mis expectativas, la oferta ofrecía una alojamiento en un hotel de 5 estrellas GL y ciertamente el hotel lo es, pero la realidad es que nuestro alojamiento, cena y estancia en general,  fue el mismo de un  4 estrellas sencillo. La habitación doble superior aunque amplia y cómoda no superaba a otras habitaciones de un hotel de 4 estrella, noté a faltar amenities de calidad solo había jabón y gorro de ducha ni tan siquiera cepillo de dientes, por no hablar de las zapatillas y el alborno inexistentes,  típico de los 5 estrella. No es que yo necesitara todo eso pero repito que ellos vendieron la oferta como una estancia de lujo en un 5 estrellas,  el servicio de bar en la habitación era una sencilla nevera completamente vacía, la bañera tipo chorros de agua estaba deshabilitada y la temperatura del agua fluctuaba constantemente...simplemente una bañera sencilla, justa de espacio para dos.
Aunque nos dijeron que la mayoría de  habitaciones tenían balcón, la nuestra tampoco la tenia (tenia ventana que además considero peligrosa ya que al abrirla no hay barandilla y es muy baja (a la altura de las rodillas).... un resbalón y puedes caer al vacío), por no decir que una pequeña actualización en nuestra habitación no estaría mal, Suelo rayado y desgastado, mampara de ducha marcada de cal. La cena a modo de degustación de 4 platos, estaba bien... pero tampoco la calidad de un 5 estrellas y sin opciones de variación,. El desayuno tipo buffet si que me convenció bastante, pero lo equiparo otra vez a un 4 estrellas.
Nosotros cogimos la oferta para tener un finde en pareja diferente, pero coincidimos con unas 200 parejas más (cenas y desayunos por la masificación por turnos... esto hizo que la estancia me recordara más a una oferta de un hotel de costa de Salou o Lloret, nada de intimidad en el comedor, nada de conversaciones tranquilas en las zonas comunes,  solo un motón de parejas esperando para ser sentados en un comedor y para ser atendidos en la cena.
Si que destaco la buena predisposición del personal y la atención recibida, pero claro con tanta gente tampoco se podían dedicar mucho a los clientes y servían la cena (menú cerrado, sin opciones de cambios, para todos igual) como si estuviéramos en un convite de boda...
Cierto que pagué un precio de oferta en un 5 estrellas, pero el precio lo pusieron ellos, así que me convenzo pensando que es una época difícil donde todos nos hemos tenido que reinventar, si eso sirve para dar oxigeno al hotel en esta época, bienvenida sea la oferta aunque a mi me quedara un poco descafeinada. El Hotel es bonito eso sí y pese a todo yo disfrute de la estancia, pero por lo menos la estancia que tuvimos nosotros fue la de un 4 estrellas como mucho... e incluso ""justito"" Recomiendo el hotel pero no la oferta.",3,2021,03,08
35,Buen fin de semana,"Estuvimos mi esposa y yo en la habitacion 614 amplia bien cuidada y limpia con execentes vistas aunque encontramos en falta suministro en el mini bar albornoces zapatillas y cafetera/tetera quizas para abaratar costes o por medidas covid 19.Nuestranestacia fue un pack "" ven a cenar y te regalamos la estancia "" la cena de degustacion estuvo francamente bien cuatro platos de calidad bien condimentados y con una correcta presentacion con una cadencia de servicio muy dinamica con esperado servicio del personal. El desayuno buffet correcto en calidad y cantidad con medidas anti Covid 19 muy acertadas tales como pinzas personales para cojer el producto distancia entre mesas y turno de asistencia. El hotel es correcto aunque adolece de la falta de piscina cubierta para uso los meses de falta de calor. Buena ubicacion y a resaltar el buen hacer del personal tanto de recepcion como de restauracion con adecuada preparacion y una muy buena actitud . Una muy buena estancia con muy correta relacion servicio/precio si no fuera por los detallitos negativos citados hubieramos dado la maxima puntuacion. Volveremos sin duda alguna muy buena y acertada promocion.",4,2021,03,07
35,Jajajajjajaja,"No se por donde empezar, ni cinco estrellas ni gran lujo, habitaciones descuidadas y muy deterioradas, fuimos con la oferta de la cena y la comida e slo único que se salvo, por que el comedor era de bodarrio d elos 80 con centros florares inmensos con luces cambiando de color horroroso en fin lo dicho una decepción 5 estrellas gran cutre",1,2021,02,21
35,Iniciativa hotelera,"Les cuento pero si tuviera que poner un título, aparte del que ya he puesto, seria ""Fantástico"" en todos los sentidos. Pero quiero hablar de la excelente opción del ""Ven a cenar y a dormir"". Uno piensa que la cena será para pasar, cualquier cosa sin importancia, pero NO, nos dieron un primero de crema de calçots perfecta, suave sabor a cebolla tierna, después un canelón de pularda exquisito, y un bacalao en su perfecto punto de coccion, que , la verdad, nos dejo sorprendidos. Todo ello, unido a una habitación cómoda, elegante y amplia , con un baño completo, agua con mucha presión y una estancia estupenda. Relación calidad precio de excepción. El desayuno encontré un poco masificado, demasiada gente pidiendo lo mismo en el buffet. Alguien ha pensado que ésta es la manera de tener reservas contínuas para el hotel en un momento tan difícil como el actual. 
Puntos negativos, desde la hermosa vista sobre la ciudad , el Maremagnum i el Port Vell, llegó a media tarde un barco de carga, un ""canguro"" procedente de las islas Baleares. Empezó a hacer un ruido de motores tremendo que aún duraba por la noche, vimos que no podríamos dormir y en recepción nos ofrecieron cambio de habitación, así lo hicimos y ningún problema. Rogaría a la dirección del hotel tomará nota del tema.  Alabar la magnífica atención de todo el personal, desde el camarero del desayuno que nos llevó personalmente el café a la mesa hasta la recepción y el trámite de la reserva.  Otra cosa sobre la cena, los entrantes de quesos eran nímios, un poco ridículo el hecho de compartir esa cantidad en tiempos de pandémia. Los tiempos de espera entre platos un poco largos... Habían en esta página tan malas críticas de la cena que pensamos lo peor, la verdad,  que fue todo lo contrario¡¡¡¡¡¡ Ya les he explicado a mi familia lo bien que lo pasamos y ya han hecho su reserva....",5,2021,01,25
35,Fantástico y el trato del personal sobresaliente!!!,Aprovechamos la promocion de cena con alojamiento. Las habitaciones tienen una vista espectacular y son muy cómodas. La cena estuvo a nivel con un entrante un delicioso primer plato de setas y un segundo plato también muy correcto. El desayuna espectacular pero lo más destacable fue la amabilidad de todo el personal ya sea en recepción que durante las comidas. El trato al cliente de 5*. La relación calidad-precio de esta oferta inmejorable.,4,2020,12,29
35,Espectacular,"Un hotel de esta categoría han cumplido a las espectativas. La habitación muy amplia, el bañ espectacular. Pedimos estar en pisos superiores y des de la octava planta las vistas sobra la ciudad y el mar son increibles.

35,"Estilo clásico, estancias muy grandes, muy tranquilo","Todo en este hotel es grande: el hall, las habitaciones, los salones, los comedores... Estilo clásico, quizás algún mueble se ve un poco antiguo pero están todos muy cuidados y con muy buen mantenimiento. La suite tenía 2 baños, 2 televisiones, salón con mesa y 4 sillas y vestidor. Cama extra-grande. El menú de la media pensión de buena calidad. Solo nos extrañó no encontrar platos calientes en el desayuno. Parece que el hotel está lejos de la ciudad pero después te das cuenta de que llegas al Paralelo o Las Ramblas en menos de 10 minutos.",4,2020,12,16
35,Pack cena+habitación ,"Desastre !! Nos fuimos después del entrante
Llegamos atención en recepción y habitación correcta. 
Cena, pues no cenamos! Nos sirven entrantes y bebida de un menú que es cerrado para todos los clientes del pack .
Al cabo de una hora de haber servido el entrante , se acercó camarera del hotel a retirar los platos del entrante(sin traer el segundo !!!) y a nuestra pegunta de que si el servicio iba a seguir así toda la cena , nos respondió que si!!!. Nuestra reacción  fue levantarnos e irnos a recepción .....Dijimos que dado el servicio no teníamos más remedio que irnos . 
Después de varias llamadas el recepcionista nos dijo que lo entendía y que nos abonarían el importe del pack (aun no lo han retornado a pesar de las llamadas y mails posteriores de responsables del hotel) 
Que pena que ocurran este tipo de cosas .",1,2020,12,12
35,LASTIMOSO,"Es la cuarta vez que visito este hotel y las dos ultimas con la oferta de cena por 120 euros, ya ven mi título LASTIMOSO, si llega a un tres estrellas es lo justo, desde su inauguración sobre el año 2000 no han hecho ningún mantenimiento salvo lo que debe ser de vida o muerte, ( muebles deteriorados, rincones sospechosos, la terraza de pena como si nadie la pisara en mucho tiempo ni se había barrido en tiempo, el jimnasio cerrado por su conveniencia yo acabo de ir a otro hotel de Paradores y estaba todo abierto, como piscina interior, jimnasio, sauna etc. pero así menos faena en limpiar sino no se entiende pues la ley Covid 19 es para todos) la cena muy buena pero ya pueden antes ir a merendar pues los platos enormes y el contenido ridiculo y de verguenza simples tapitas, eso si solo sentarte el sablazo de la bebida ( copa de dos dedos de vino ”7 eurosss”) increíble. El desayuno con recortes inadmisibles(les recuerdo que estuve a primeros de Noviembre con la misma oferta) solo había dos embutidos chorizo y fuet eso si repartidos en seis bandejas, soloooooo dos clases de yégurt, dos clases de pan de molde y panecillos, terminaros alguna bolleria a las 10 h. y ya no pudieron reponerla pues nos digeron que se habia acabado parte de los dulces y solo sacaron magdalenas, a primeros de mes había salmón, jamón serrano, ahora ya no según ellos el público comarcal que ahora va no tienen tirada por el salmón ni el jamón , que desfachatez ...incluso hubo una camarera muy simpática que me animó a que hiciera la queja pues sentía vergüenza ajena... el personal muy amable eso si faltaría más. Bueno todo una serie de despropósitos que hace que se estén cargando este hote con mucha apariencia exterior pero vacío de contenido, para los que lo conocimos tan solo un año anterior es para llorar, ahhh el chef de cocina si es el que decide los desayunos vale más que vaya a un albergue y que no diga que ha trabajado en un 5 estrellas porque su reputación...

Lo único malo,los precios del bar un poco caro.",5,2020,12,02
35,Hotel con peros...,"Hemos pasado una noche en este establecimiento al cual yo no le doy más de 4 estrellas, aunque si tenemos en cuenta sus habitaciones frente al mar, podemos otorgarle una categoría de 4 superior. La habitación que nos dieron era amplia y frente al mar, PERO al cerrar la puerta que daba al recibidor el pomo se cayó pues está despegado, la puerta corredera del baño puedes intentar cerrarla PERO como necesita mantenimiento está atrancada y  posiblemente con dos personas podrás cerrarla, el colchón es estupendo y las almohadas PERO creo que necesita una actualización del mobiliario...
En la primera planta,  se encuentra un bar muy correcto con servicio discutible...y pianista estupendo, también una terraza que alberga un bar de copas. En la misma planta se halla el comedor con servicio muy amable a diferencia del bar, francamente simpáticos y profesionales. Cenamos aunque escuetamente muy correcto.
Desayuno agradable PERO con tostadoras que no funcionan y es literal, no funcionan. Aunque yo haría algunos cambios por ejemplo en, yogures, zona dulce, en general creo que el desayuno era muy correcto. 
La pregunta es sencilla, repetiría?, Si a precio de promoción,  No a precio habitual. 
Mi nota, un 7 sobre 10.
Destaco las habitaciones frente al mar pero es importante que te den una de las que cierre el baño, por ejemplo.",3,2020,11,22
35,Gato por liebre,"Nos alojamos en este hotel, con una promoción que tienen
``cena en nuestro hotel y te invitamos a dormir´´
Al llegar había una cola hasta la calle, tienen una absorvencia de clientela sobredimensionada, mas que un hotel parecía un Albergue.
Para ser un 5 estrellas faltaban muchos detalles en la habitación, no había gel, ni crema corporal ,ni colonia, ni gorro de baño..el agua caliente venia y se iba, el desague goteaba,,
la habitación no tenia mini bar, eso si, una cafetera sin cafés ni agua..
La sabana encimera tenia un agujero,provocado por algun cigarrillo,no es de recibo encontrarte algo asi en un 5 estrellas!!!
LLega el momento de cenar,,aquello parecía un comedor social, unas colas impresionantes para entrar, cuando llegaba tu turno te pedían nombre y numero de habitación y te apoyaban tras una pared hasta que fuésemos unos cuantos y poder pasar al comedor,pareciamos borregos,nuestra cena era a las 10,30,empezabamos a cenar a las 11.30 y acababamos cerca la 1.00,y no por que nosotros queriamos,si no por su propia logistica,alli teniamos que ir todos a una,hasta que no estuviera el comedor lleno no pasaba el camarero,eso si, la bebida solo sentarte ya pasaban a ver que querias,( claro hasta que llegue la cena ya te la habras acabado y luego venga pide otra consumicion y pagala a precio de oro )
En la promocion indica copa de bienvenida,alli no habia nadie para atender el cava y los mismo clientes se iban sirviendo a su gusto,nosotros por prudencia no lo hicimos y al entrar al restaurante pregunte si entraba la bebida en el menu,suerte que lo pregunte por que la respuesta fue que no,no nos querian ni incluir la consumicion que nos tocaba ya que alegaban que ya habiamos consumido cava al entrar, le dijimos que no habiamos consumido nada y al final nos dejaron pedir una consumicion,no entra el agua,menos mal que pregunte, si no te la meten cobrando precios muy elevados.
El menu que ofrecen mas basico no puede ser y sus cantidades irrisorias,nos quedamos con hambre,unos platos muy grandes con cantidades ridiculas,la butifara eran 3 o 4 trocitos no mas grandes que la falange de un dedo,estabamos por llamar a algún repartidor de comida.
hasta que todo el mundo no acababa el plato no volvian a pasar ofreciendote el segundo,y asi sucesivamente,era como estar en unas colonias,estabamos sentados junto a una puerta que daba al exterior,un cable por el suelo impedia su cierre,lo que provocaba aire y frio durante toda la cena,a mi no me gusta la butifarra y me ofrecieron o escalibada o hummus,que clase de cambio es ese? donde esta la proteina?,desde luego que no se acerca ni mucho menos a un hotel 5 estrellas,2 horas y media para cenar y salir con hambre y con una calidad de cena baja baja.
Subimos a la terraza a pasear, totalmente a oscuras que estaba, casi me caigo por que apenas se veia nada,daba la sensacion de una azotea abandonada,el gimnasio tampoco se podia utilizar..
al dia siguiente el desayuno, su variedad y calidad aqui si era buena,aunque es indignante que a las 10,00 en punto justo la hora de entrada del segundo turno ya no quedara zumo de naranja,nunca me he encontrado esto,y vuelta a lo mismo con la cantidad de personas que habian alli,tuvieron que habilitar otra zona de cafeteria para poder sentar a la gente,eso si claro,cada vez que te levantaras a coger algo del buffette tenias que pasearte por un pasillo ya que no estaba accesible.
Preguntamos a que hora podiamos salir de la habitacion y nos dijeron que a las 12,00 pero si queriamos quedarnos un poquito mas no habia problema,pues bien llegamos a la habitacion a las 11,58 y ya no podiamos entrar,habian bloqueado nuestra puerta,de nuevo tuvimos que bajar a recepcion para que nos la desbloquearan y poder coger las maletas que estaban dentro.
Muy sres mios,se pueden hacer promociones para captar clientela pero no dar gato por liebre,desde luego que se os va de las manos,tanta masificacion de gente hace que no podais ofrecer un servicio como se merece un hotel de esta categoria,y aunque el precio sea mas bajo de lo normal,sus servicios tambien lo son,asi que nos hemos sentido engañados y nada nada conformes ni gratos en su hotel.
Un saludo.,",1,2020,11,09
35,Normal. Para mi no es de 5*,"El hotel en lineas generales no está mal. Yo diría que normal... y también que he estado en hoteles de 4* bastante mejor que este. Pero también es cierto, que habrá que ver todos los servicios que pueda tener el hotel y que cuando me alojé, no estuvieran activos por el Covid.
El hotel está en la zona del puerto de Barcelona. A mi no me pareció una zona demasiado buena, todo sea dicho. No es una zona que invite a salir y pasear. Cerca de la zona del Raval, es mejor acercarse al centro en taxi. Mucho más recomendable.
Las habitaciones necesitan algo de remodelación. O de mantenimiento...
Baño amplio, aunque al igual que que la habitación, se necesita un mantenimiento más exhaustivo. He estado en otros hoteles de Eurostars, de 5*... y este deja mucho qu edesear cuando los comparas.
Un buen desayuno, también todo sea dicho. Amplio y aunque a priori los alimentos calientes no están disponibles en el bufet, cualquier cosa que se quiera solicitar te lo traen.",3,2020,10,31
35,No es de 5 estrellas,"Hemos estado en hoteles de 3 o 4 estrellas mucho mejores que este.No es gran lujo ni por asomo.
Piscina cutrilla con terraza sin encanto salvo las vistas.
Sin spa, sauna cerrada por Covid.
Habitación muy sencilla, pocas amenities y sin cafetera, sin minibar y sin ningún detalle...solo vistas maravillosas
Cena y desayunos buenos pero una copa de vino a 7€ mientras la botella en el super vale 5,5€ :(
Desilusión total! Si buscas sentirte como una princesa...este NO es tu hotel!
Salvado por el maravilloso servicio de camareros y por las vistas",3,2020,10,24
35,Lusso,"Location molto bella vicino a qualsiasi cosa si voglia fare, taxi sotto l albergo h24
Camere molto belle ma può migliorare
Servizio ottimo alla reception anche impiegati che parlavano italiano 
Colazione mai vista e fatta più buona in vita mia con un banchetto da cerimonie
Ristorante in terrazza da paura bellissimo e buonissimo
Piscina un po piccola per la struttura
Prezzi ovviamente da 5 stelle lusso sono belli alti ma ci vale.",5,2020,09,12
35,Hotel muy recomendable!,"La habitación tenía unas vistas increíbles del puerto y Montjuic. 5* en la calidad de los materiales, etc de las habitaciones pero necesita un poco de mantenimiento.

35,Super anche in un periodo così difficile,"Abbiamo soggiornato per poter essere molto vicini al molo della nave per la Sardegna. L'hotel è veramente una bella struttura moderna. 
Ci hanno gentilmente concesso un upgrade gratuito alla vista mare.
Camera ampia, bagno con bidet (passione italiana). Molte amenità tra cui caffè con cialda.

35,Servicio de Excelencia ,"Llegamos de un viaje por Egipto y decidimos quedarnos un día en Barcelona para descansar ya que al día siguiente tomábamos el vuelo a Mallorca . La atención por parte del personal de recepción magnífica . Enviamos un mail para cambiar habitación doble a triple y contestaron sin problemas . La habitación muy cómoda , limpia , no tuve suerte de tener buenas vistas esta vez como me gustan pero para un día no estuvo mal . Muy céntrico , caminando a 5 min de Ramblas . Si vas a tomar un Crucero la terminal está justo al lado . 
El desayuno Buffet muy muy completo y el servicio de los chicos ejemplar , muy atentos . 
A los pocos minutos de llegar a la habitación , tocaron a la puerta , preguntan  por mi nombre y nos traen una botella de cava con copas  y unas fresas recubiertas de chocolate , además de una carta en la cual nos daban la Bienvenida al hotel , un detallazo , el chico Mario Daza un 10.
Vamos que lo recomiendo al 💯 %.

35,"Keine 5 Sterne wert - enttäuschender Service, desinteressiertes Personal","Wir hatten über das Valentins-Wochenende das ""Romantic Paket"" gebucht. Darin wurde ein Upgrade zum Deluxe Zimmer mit Stadt Aussicht und Balkon, sowie Erdbeeren mit Schokolade, Flasche Sekt, Begrüssungsgetränk und ein Late check-out versprochen. Bei der Ankunft hatten wir ein Zimmer ohne Stadt Aussicht/ohne Balkon, Erdbeeren mit Schokolade waren gerade mal 4 Stücke für 2 Personen und das Begrüssungsgetränk bekamen wir auch nicht, abgesehen von zwei kleinen Wasserflaschen im Zimmer. Für das Late check-out hätten wir extra bezahlen müssen als wir das in Anspruch nehmen wollten, was wir als frech empfunden haben, da auf der Homepage anderes beschrieben war. Der Sekt war widerlich. Als wir am nächsten Morgen unser gewünschtes Zimmer mit Balkonaussicht haben wollten, wurde es erst auf den Abend versprochen. Die Balkonaussicht war dann sehr schön, allerdings funktionierte die Dusche nicht. Beim duschen wechselte es ständig automatisch von warmes auf kaltes Wasser, was ziemlich mühsam für uns war! Als wir das an der Rezeption meldeten, kam sofort der technische Hauswart und kontrollierte es. Er konnte aber nichts tun und das Hotelpersonal hat sich auch überhaupt nicht mehr bemüht etwas für uns zu tun... 
Der Eingangsbereich vom Hotel war ziemlich kühl und ernüchternd eingerichtet und es roch jeden Tag nach Männerparfum im ganzen Eingangsbereich bis zum Lift. 
Ansonsten ist das Hotel schön am Hafen gelegen und großzügig angelegt. Die Zimmer sind ebenfalls sehr groß und sauber und das Frühstück reichhaltig und lecker.
Wir würden das Hotel aber wegen dem enttäuschenden Service und dem desinteressierten Personal (vor allem beim Frühstücksbuffet, wurde man von niemandem beachtet oder freundlich begrüsst) nicht weiter empfehlen.",2,2020,02,26
35,Lamentablemente estado de mantenimiento,"Un hotel de 5 estrellas a la vanguardia de la ciudad catalana no se puede permitir en los baños de la suite la imagen de chapuza que dan las bañeras , y que remito en fotografía . Esto no es calidad en una cadena hotelera . La dirección debe además de atender extraordinariamente bien a los clientes , preocuparse de los detalles .",2,2020,02,06
35,""" OTTIMO 5 STELLE""","Ottimo 5 stelle , proprio sul porto della Città Vecchia, e nonostante questo non ho sentito mai rumori ... camera spaziosissima, pulita al 100% . Servito da taxi che ti aspettano a 2 metri. La colazione molto cara ma accanto ci sono due bar ottimi perché si trova al centro del World Trade Center. L’ultimo piano ha una vista mozzafiato davvero, personale gentilissimo, al mio arrivo un ragazzo mi ha sceso i bagagli dall'auto e ha pensato lui a parcheggiarla, non mi hanno fatto alcun problema lasciare la camera un ora dopo, quando ho riferito che il lavandino non tirava in maniera adeguata, il ragazzo della reception non mi ha fatto pagare il parcheggio dell'auto di due notti e le tasse di soggiorno... stiamo parlando di quasi 80€ !!!! Rapporto qualità prezzo ECCEZIONALE.Lo consiglio !!",4,2020,01,16

Una sola nota positiva : la colazione , davvero ottima .

35,"Super Frühstück, zentrale Lage, schöne Zimmer","Die Lage des Hotels ist super, sehr Nahe an den Ramblas und an den Hop on Hop off Bushaltestellen. Das Personal war sehr aufmerksam und freundlich. Wir hatten ein sehr schön und modern ausgestattetes Familienzimmer mit Balkon und wunderbaren blick auf dieStadt. Das Frühstück war unglaublich vielfältig und sehr lecker. das Frühstück ist absolut empfehlenswert. Zimmerservice war perfekt und sehr ordentlich. Verstehe manche Kommentare nicht, die sagen das Hotel sei abgewohnt. Sehr gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis - wir müssen betonen, dass wir Anfang Dezember dort waren.",4,2019,12,30
35,Buena situación para embarcar en un crucero,"Tiene una situación excelente si vas a embarcar en algún crucero, a 5 minutos de la terminal en taxi. Personal de recepción muy amable. Camas cómodas y habitaciones amplias, limpieza también muy bien, y tienes desde una máquina de café hasta plancha, también te ponen de cortesía unas botellitas de agua mineral.
Totalmente recomendable",5,2019,11,18
35,Excelente Hotel,"Llegamos en tren a Barcelona (17/10), desde Logroño, a fin de pasar unos 3 días antes de embarcar en un crucero.
Lamentablemente Barcelona estaba convulsionada por manifestaciones.
Tuvimos que permanecer, casi 3 días en el hotel sin poder salir, debido a las revueltas callejeras.
Afortunadamente, hay un pequeño mall en las afueras pero pegado al hotel, en donde hay restaurant, farmacia, etc.

Por otro lado, la molestia de no poder salir a la ciudad, se vió recompensada por la excelente y comoda estructura del hotel. Habitaciones, comedor, bar, etc. de primera.
El personal muy amable y educado.
Tuvimos la suerte que nuestro crucero atracó al lado del hotel y nuestras maletas las bajó un valet en un carrito y a la salida a menos de 30 mts. las embarcó en el navío.

Una lástima de estadía (si no hubiera sido por las excelentes comodidades del hotel)
ya que o más cercano que me pude acercar a la Catedral de la Sagrada Familia, fué con un lente de 300 mm (Foto que incluyo)",5,2019,11,11
35,No está a la altura de un 5 estrellas,"No se respetan los momentos de relax. A las 15.30 aún no habían hecho la habitación, así que pedí que fueran a hacerla una hora más tarde porque quería descansar. Pero media hora después, a las 16h, vinieron dos personas (un chico y una chica) a revisar el minibar. Me pareció una gran falta de respeto y, sobre todo, una gran disturbación. 
Además, no sé hasta qué punto estaba limpia la habitación. El día que llegué, nada más entrar me encontré las tarjetas empolvadas de un anterior huésped sobre la mesa. Y el retrete no tenía ninguna cinta que indicará que estaba desinfectado. Lo único que me podía indicar que esa habitación estaba limpia eran las zapatillas empaquetadas que estaban sobre la bañera.
Se escuchan bastante ruidos en la habitación, tanto del exterior como del interior de los pasillos. Y sería de agradecer una mejor atención por parte del personal, les falta simpatía y amabilidad.
Más allá de eso, las habitaciones son espaciosas, aunque la rendija del baño hace muchísimo ruido, y el desayuno es muy completo.",2,2019,11,07
35,Gutes hotel,"Lage des Hotels super. Personal sehr freundlich. Ich hatte ein Zimmer mit Balkon mit Sicht zur Stadt. Ausstattung der Zimmer sehr gut. Verstehe einige Kommentare nicht, dass Hotel sei abgewohnt. Frühstück etwas teuer aber sehr gutes Buffet ",4,2019,10,31
35,Angenehme Lage,"Die riesige Hotelanlage liegt besuchsgünstig unweit von Hafen und Ramblas, scheint aber nunmehr in die Jahre zu kommen. Abnutzungserscheinungen des Mobiliars, Massenabfertigung beim Frühstück und schwindende Freundlichkeit des Personals sind mit einer 5 Sterne GL Bewertung auf Dauer nicht in Einklang zu bringen.",4,2019,10,11
35,Magnífica habitación,"Nos alojamos la familia en dos habitaciones: una doble normal y otra doble con cama supletoria. La doble era una buena habitación conforme a la categoría del hotel aunque con vistas a una especie de plaza interior. La sorpresa fue la habitación de mis hijos. Realmente no era una doble con cama supletoria, sino dos habitaciones dobles completas que compartían un saloncito amplio con magníficas vistas de la ciudad y ﻿el puerto. El desayuno muy bueno aunque algo calurosa la sala.
Elegimos este hotel por la proximidad a la terminal de cruceros. A pesar de ser ﻿el más cercano, es preciso ir en taxi pues hay que dar una larga vuelta y atravesar un puente.",4,2019,10,08
35,"Super Frühstück, Service in Ordnung, aber keine 5 Sterne wert!","Aufgrund der positiven Bewertungen im Internet und der schönen Bilder freuten wir uns riesig auf unseren Aufenthalt (4 Nächte), Frühstück inklusive. Bei unserer Ankunft würden wir freundlich empfangen, allerdings gab es gleich zu Beginn Schwierigkeiten wegen unseres Doppelzimmers. In unserer Buchung haben wir „Doppelzimmer Deluxe mit Balkon“ gewählt, unmissverständlich beschrieben. An der Rezeption wies man uns dann ein kleines, dunkles Zimmer OHNE Balkon zu. Als wir das Zimmer reklamierten, erklärte uns das Personal, dass es aktuell kein Zimmer mit Balkon gibt - wir könnten erst am darauffolgenden Tag umziehen. Der Angestellte hat sich auf „“Tricks of the Internet“ berufen. Auf der Website wäre die Bedingung der Verfügbarkeit ausdrücklich erwähnt worden. Das Doppelzimmer Deluxe hebt sich jedoch preislich erheblich von den anderen Zimmern ab. Am Folgetag (aber erst nachmittags) bekamen wir dann ein Zimmer im 7. Stock mit tollem Ausblick über die Stadt. Das Badezimmer war nicht optimal gereinigt, trotz täglichem Zimmerservice. Auf dem Frühstücksbuffet waren die Joghurts teilweise abgelaufen, es wurde sich aber mehrfach entschuldigt.
Das Buffet an sich war super, alles, was das Herz begehrt. Von Rührei über Brot, Brötchen, Kuchen, frischem Obst, Gemüse, Torten, Müsli etc. hatten wir die freie Auswahl! Das Frühstück ist daher absolut zu empfehlen!",3,2019,10,03
35,Ottima soluzione,"Ottimo hotel, ubicato in posizione comoda al centro ma nello stesso tempo fuori dai rumori della città. Con le finestre chiuse anche i rumori delle navi da crociera, non si sentono minimamente. Colazione molto ben assortita e di qualità, anche con spazio all'aperto. Abbiamo anche provato la cena gourmet, che dire, semplicemente fantastica. Super consigliata!! Terrazza con lettini e piccola piscina super comoda. L'unica nota, il personale del ricevimento un pò troppo rigido per i miei gusti, con qualche sorriso e attenzione in più avrei dato 5 pallini.",4,2019,10,03
35,Super soggiorno!,"Ottimo hotel, proprio sul porto della Città Vecchia, e nonostante questo non ho sentito mai rumori ... camera spaziosissima, pulita al 100% e visto che sono allergica neanche un po’ di polvere!!!!

35,Ideal für Kreuzfahrer,"Wie der Name schon sagt liegt dieses Hotel am Hafen, ca. 20 Minuten mit dem Taxi vom Flughafen entfernt.
Zimmer war um 17.00 Uhr noch nicht fertig, der Empfang war  unfreundlich, aber immerhin gab es einen Getränke Gutschein um die Wartezeit zu verkürzen.
Mein Zimmer war in den Innenhof hinaus und daher total ruhig.
Frühstück wirklich sehr gut, frisches Obst und alles was das Herz begehrt. Das Hotel ist durch seine Größe sehr unpersönlich.
Dachterrasse mit Mini Pool und Blick zu den Kreuzfahrtschiffen, sehr heiß da es wenig Schirme gibt. Oben gibt es drinks und snacks, das Personal war allerdings überfordert.",5,2019,09,09
35,Stadt Hotel,"Das Hotel hat eine gute Lage am Hafen, ein bisschen abseits vom Stadtrummel. Das Personal ist sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Die Zimmer bieten einen guten Komfort, sind aber schon in die Jahre gekommen. Eine kleine Renovation würde sicher helfen, um den 5 Sterne Status zu halten. Wir hätten 4 Sterne vergeben, da auch das SPA Angebot sehr beschränkt ist. Das Frühstück ist okay, aber mit 27 Euro sicher an der oberen Grenze. Da die Hafenanlage die ganze Nacht beleuchtet ist, wären Verdunkelungs-Vorhänge von Vorteil.",4,2019,09,03
35,HOTEL 4 STELLE RUMOROSO,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel 4 notti a fine agosto prenotando con booking, camera 726 al settimo piano.
Camera molto rumorosa: ascensore appena fuori dalla stanza e sopra di noi terrazza bar, si sentono tutti i rumori. All'arrivo ore 16.00 ci hanno detto che la camera non era ancora pronta (check-in ore 15), si sono scusati offrendoci una consumazione di benvenuto, saliamo in palestra devo dire molto attrezzata ma anche lì la sauna fuori servizio (non prevista una spa in un hotel 5 stelle). Non ritengo che il prezzo pagato sia adeguato a quanto offerto, in considerazione che una coppia di amici, nello stesso periodo, hanno ottenuto un trattamento migliore prenotando direttamente in hotel.
Unica nota di merito la posizione.",3,2019,09,01
35,Decepcionante,"Buenos Días :
Estuve alojada un fin de semana en este hotel cinco estrellas GL con mi pareja. Una de la tardes estaba en la habitación con unas vistas increíbles del puerto, plaza de Colon , y bueno toda la ciudad , cuando el cielo se oscureció y comenzó una tormenta con aparato eléctrico tremenda. Empecé a oír como una especie de catarata dentro de la habitación , se estaba inundando!!!! A través de los grandes ventanales , cerrados por supuesto . Llame a recepción pues el suelo de madera se estaba encharcando y comenzamos a temer por los cristales que pudieran estallar. El ruido ensordecedor y no nos cogieron el teléfono . Bajamos a recepción saltando entre el agua que estaba en el suelo como pudimos y les pedimos que subieran a limpiar, no lo hicieron !!!!! . Nos omitieron por completo. A la salida del hotel pedimos hablar con un responsable. Después de media hora apareció una señorita que nos dijo que nos compensaría con el 20% de la tarifa. A día de hoy no ha habido respuesta . Esto es un 5 estrellas ??? Este es un personal que responde ?? Este hotel tiene unos responsables que asuman la calidad del servicio ? Este hotel es un fraude eso es lo que es. Tengo fotos y vídeo de lo que sucedió y es una auténtica vergüenza .",1,2019,08,14

35,Buon hotel 4 stelle ...non 5 n'è tanto meno GL,"Abbiamo pernottato per 5 notti in questo hotel, stanza 211 al secondo piano,  molto spaziosa con mini soggiorno divano e TV digitale,  ampio anche il bagno con vano doccia separato dal lavabo e vasca, biancheria e pulizia buona. Colazione internazionale buona ma non da 5 stelle GL. 
Insomma tutto buono ma non da livello 5 stelle GL (Las Arenas Valencia - Hotel Alfonso XIII Siviglia - Grand Hotel Miramar Malaga) questi giusto per fare un paragone.
Dove questo hotel perde molti punti è dovuto al fatto che pur avendo prenotato direttamente con la struttura una camera con carta di credito a garanzia ci hanno addebitato tutto l'intero soggiorno 5 giorni prima del nostro arrivo. 
Viaggiamo nelle migliori strutture alberghiere da 40 anni e non ci è mai capitato nulla del genere.",3,2019,08,02

Pedí expresamente por teléfono que tuviera un detalle con el ese día. Pero no ocurrió así. No hicieron  NADA. 
Otra de mis quejas es la escasez de toallas en el baño y la falta de albornoces. Un hotel de esta categoría debería tenerlos. 
Y por último como celiaca decir que que el desayuno no había más que tres productos sin gluten. Señores ,cada vez somos mas los celiacos y su desayuno no es precisamente el más indicado para nosotros! Me imaginaba ya desde casa la situación y llevé mis propios cereales. Una lástima de trato.

Hatten am Anfang die Sache mit den Verbindungszimmern nicht hinbekommen (da gab es dann einen Satz Grimms Märchen), das dann aber am Folgetag toll überkompensiert. Alles gut also, klare Empfehlung. Man muss sagen, dass wir halt auch spät angekommen waren und das Hotelpickepackevoll. Kann dann passieren... ist halt so.",4,2019,03,06
35,5 stelle solo per lo spazio delle camere,"Non capisco come sono state assegnate 5 stelle a questa struttura!!!
Soddisfatto solo per lo spazio ampio delle camere il resto tutto da ridire:
- Rumore H24 dei motori delle navi ormeggiate proprio sotto l’albergo!

- ascensori equivalenti a Bus turistici, pieni!solo per scendere e salire in camera ci vogliono di media 10 minuti! Introvabili le scale di servizio per anticipare i tempi

- camere mai ripulite in orari decenti su 3 giorni la camera due volte è stata pulita alle 15:30 /16:00 e una volta alle 18:00 !

Wir haben eine Suite im obersten Stockwerk bewohnt, und diese bietet wirklich eine spektakuläre Aussicht auf den Hafen sowie die Stadt. Besondere Erwähnung findet die Dachterrasse, welche abends zum verweilen bei einem angenehmen Cocktail einlädt. Wer besonders Lärm oder Geräuschempfindlich ist, sollte bedenken, dass Schiffe spät abends sowie früh morgens einlaufen und auslaufen, was für eine gewisse Geräuschkulisse sorgt. Um einen fünf Sterne Standard zu halten, wäre es angebracht, das Interieur des Hotels etwas zeitgemäßer und moderner zu gestalten.

35,"Zentrumsnahes, wertiges Hafenhotel","In meinen Beiträgen auf Tripadvisor teile ich grundsätzlich erfreuliche und positive Erfahrungen für andere Reisende. Zahlreiche Beurteilungen zum Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel waren kritisch und ernüchternd und dies entspricht nicht meiner Erfahrung. 
Das Hotel würde in anderen Städten als gehobenes 4-Sterne Haus positioniert. Die Zimmer sind qualitativ wertig materialisiert und zeitlos eingerichtet, geräumig und hell. Das Badezimmer bietet viel Platz und die begehbare Ankleide ist auch in dieser Hotelkategorie kein Standard. Nach der Zimmerreinigung wurde die Qualität der einwandfrei ausgeführten Arbeit durch einen leitenden Mitarbeiter überprüft. 
Das Frühstück ist sehr reichhaltig, die servierten Produkte sind frisch zubereitet und die gebotene Qualität stimmt. Die Mitarbeiter sind aufmerksam, freundlich und zuvorkommend; die zentrumsnahe Lage bietet kurze Wege zu Sehenswürdigkeiten und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten.",4,2019,01,14

Tiene unos árboles azules de decoración que son horribles. 
La habitación es linda y espaciosa, las toallas no son blancas si no que de tanto uso están amarillas/grises. 
Por el precio, no me volvería a quedar en este hotel, no se merece las 5 estrellas. ",2,2018,10,21
35,Noche de bodas,"Nos alojamos en la suite para pasar nuestra noche de bodas y fue una experiencia única. La habitación es una maravilla, el personal muy atento y agradable, y las vistas totalmente increíbles. 
El desayuno buffet es de otro nivel, y es que hay de todo y de muy buena calidad. Sin duda, una muy buena experiencia que repetiríamos sin dudar",5,2018,10,12
35,Viel Schein - wenig sein,"Leider gibt es diesmal keine gute Bewertung. Die Gründe dafür sind: Einerseits sehr laut - nicht nur der Hafenlärm (das weiß man ja schon vorher beim Buchen) aber auch sehr lauter Partylärm. Mangelhafte Aufklärung über den Preis des Frühstücks (aus - beim Einchecken 18 Euro pro Person - wurden dann 27 Euro) - dauerndes Anklopfen oder Anrufen trotz ""bitte nicht stören""-Schildes - Verschwinden und versuchtes Berechnen von Minibar-Produkten (hat sich da das Personal bedient oder versucht man da Umsatz zu generieren?) haben uns veranlasst eine derart negative Bewertung zu verfassen.",2,2018,10,12
35,Buen hotel en general,"Hola amigos, acabamos de regresar de nuestras vacaciones y queríamos recomendaros este hotel, situado en el puerto de Barcelona. A pocos minutos a pie de las Ramblas y muy cerca de la parada de los autobuses lanzadera que por 3€ te dejan en tu crucero. 
Al llegar al hotel la recepción estaba repleta de gente pero en pocos minutos nos atendieron ya que había 5 personas tras el mostrador. Nuestra habitación no estaba lista, así que decidimoa subir a la piscina  y comer algo rápido. Un acierto. El bar de la piscina sirve aperitivos y snacks muy originales y sabrosos. Ya eran casi las cuatro y al no llamarnos para la habitación decidimos bajar a recepción. Nuestra habitación todavía no estaba lista pero nos ofrecieron una habitación superior por el mismo precio, disculpándose por el inconveniente.
La habitación era amplia, con vistas a la ciudad. Muy limpia y con un baño enorme. 
Al día siguiente, disfrutamos de un desayuno bufet extraordinario, de los mejores que he visto. 
Si le tengo que poner un pero al hotel es la insonorización de las habitaciones. El hotel está situado junto a la terminal de ferrys y se oye el ruido de los motores día y noche. En nuestro caso no nos afectó porque ambos tenemos el sueño profundo, pero creo que es una cosa que deberían mejorar.",4,2018,10,08
35,BELLISSIMA VISTA,Impareggiabile la vista sul porto; la nostra camera era ampia e molto confortevole; Sky bar all’ottavo piano con Barcellona ai tuoi piedi; check-in e chech-out veloci e precisi. Peccato per la piscina che fondamentalmente è grande come un grande idromassaggio...,4,2018,09,23
35,Espectacular,"Reservamos la suite para nuestra noche de bodas y todo fue muy bien. La atención del personal excelente. Aparcacoches, recepcionistas, camareros... La habitación con todos los lujos y comodidades. Buenas dimensiones, cama cómoda y grande, y baño enorme con jacuzzi y ducha. Una terraza magnífica con vistas a toda la ciudad. El desayuno sublime. A la altura de la categoría del hotel con un surtido muy extenso. El bar-cocktelería muy bien acondicionado con buenas vistas a la ciudad. Todo perfecto.",5,2018,09,14
35,Ziemlich schöne Zimmer - Service leider überfordert,"Ich bin regelmässig im Grand Marina Eurostars, denn es ist im Grossen und Ganzen ein sehr schönes Hotel. Die Zimmer sind sets einwandfrei und die Aussicht ist rechts wie liinks( Stadt oder See) gleichermassen gut. Die Preise sind lieder die Qualität nicht wert - aber das könnte man noch schlucken. Was leider seit Jahren der Fall ist, dass man die schlechtesten Leute die am meisten überfordert sind an die Rezeption stellt. Das Einchecken dauert nicht unter 20 Minuten und wenn 2 Leute vor Ihnen sind, dauert das ganze  Prozedere gerne  mal 1 Stunde. Das hat sich in den letzten 15 Mal  wo ich dort war nicht geändert. Die Antwort ist jedesmal das Gleiche: Wir haben zur Zeit sehr viele Gäste. Frühstück ist mit 27 € pro Person gesalzen - aber trotzdem gut und vielfältig (wenn der schlechte Service beim Kaffeebringen nicht wäre) - daher empfehle ich sich den Kaffee an der Maschine  selbst zu holen",3,2018,09,10
35,"Nice View, that's all","Mit 5* leider völlig überbewertet und überteuert. Lage am Hafen ist allerdings nett. Service in Ordnung, Zimmer schon ziemlich abgewohnt. Balkon im Superior-Zimmer ist eher ein unmöbelierter Austritt. Zum Rauchen reicht's  aber.",3,2018,09,02
35,Sin grandes lujos ,"Para ser un 5 estrellas gran lujo se echan en falta esos detalles que lo distingan de un 4 estrellas. El ruido de los barcos del puerto de cruceros se escucha mucho y hace que retumbe la habitación por el sonido que es como un zumbido constante, al menos en la segunda planta. La piscina de la azotea es minúscula y con 4 personas dentro ya se llena. Nos pilló la huelga de taxis y la parada de metro Mas próxima está lejos. Tuvimos que caminar mucho. No dispone de parking propio es concertado con el del puerto. El café y el zumo del desayuno deja mucho que desear, yo valoro más un buen café que el hecho de que haya brocoli para desayunar. Los amenities son los mínimos y tienes que pedir el resto a recepción según pone en una tarjeta por tema de ahorro ecológico. No hay albornoz en la habitación pero si zapatillas. En nuestra habitación se olvidaron de dejar el cartel de no molestar y se lo pedí a una camarera de pisos que andaba preparando las habitaciones. Estuve anteriormente en un 5 estrellas y te subían el equipaje a la habitación y aquí lo tuvimos que subir nosotros. Son pequeños detalles que no me esperaba en un 5 estrellas gran lujo. Yo no volvería sinceramente escogería otro hotel para mi próxima estancia en Barcelona. ",3,2018,08,12
35,Nella norma per un 5 stelle. ,Hotel   che rispecchia le aspettative. Camere un po' datate ma spaziose. Buon servizio. Bagno dotato di accappatoi  e di parecchi asciugamani e vari kit  Ristorante  un po' troppo caro per il cibo proposto. ,4,2018,08,06
35,Estancia estupenda,"Estuvimos de vacaciones en Barcelona y escogimos éste hotel por estar cerca del centro y al mismo tiempo alejado del bullicio. La llegada fue maravillosa, el personal fue muy amable. En el check in nos ofrecieron una copa de cava mientras esperábamos, en especial agradecer a Alba la recepcionista que nos toco a nosotros, se notaba que disfrutaba haciendo su trabajo, fue muy atenta y servicial. Al subir a la habitación la primera impresión fue muy buena, teníamos vistas a la ciudad y un balcón. La cama era muy cómoda y la habitación espaciosa. El desayuno es muy variado y puedes encontrar muchas opciones si eres celiaco. El personal de desayunos parecía un poco perdido, no sé si eran nuevos pero se notaba falta de experiencia. Aun así nos llevamos muy buena impresión del hotel. Volveremos",5,2018,07,30
35,Precios del planeta saturno!!,"En la cafeteria The corner del hotel los precios son desorbitados, me parece increible pagar 10 euros por un cafe con hielo y por un poleo menta.  A 5 euritos cada cosa. Un poco de sentido común.  Esto en mi pueblo se llama atraco. Un poleo menta 5 euros que no deja de ser un poquito de agua manchada....",1,2018,07,14
35,Top,Davvero bellissimo struttura di livello ristorante cell hotel buono ma un Po caro ultimo piano vasca jacuzzi bellissima più piscina fuori con vista bellissima sul mare. posto strategico a 2 passi dal centro e a 1 passo da maremagnum. Ve lo consiglio x essere un 5 stelle e stare al centro non è costosissimo,5,2018,07,14
35,Muy prolijo,"Tienen un excelente servicio al pasajero. Un exquisito y abundante desayuno. Un acceso privilegiado a la zona de cruceros de Barcelona. La limpieza me pareció una parte muy importante. 
Desde la recepción hasta la limpieza son todos muy amables. ",5,2018,07,13
35,Hermoso Hotel,"El hotel precioso, la habitación mágica y el servicio un 100. El único detalle fue que una habitación estaba en construcción y hacían ruido. Me encanto la carta de Almohadas para dormir y la vista al puerto de Barcelona!",5,2018,06,24
35,Muy buena opción,"Un hotel con muy buenas instalaciones, excelente personal y restorán. Está muy bien ubicado, cerca de la plaza de Colón a minutos caminando desde la plaza de Cataluña y Paseo de Gracias. Precio razonable para la calidad del hotel.",5,2018,06,17
35,Leider keine 5 Sterne,"Ich war geschäftlich 2 Tage in diesem Hotel. Die Lage ist schön und man kann schnell nach Barcelona mit dem Taxi reinfahren.
Die Services aber auch die Zimmer entsprechen leider nicht dem was typischerweise unter einem solchen Service versteht.
Lange Wartezeit beim Einchecken, kein Zimmer verfügbar bei Anreise am nachmittag. Zimmer eher schon in die Jahre gekommen. (Farbe blättert an den Möbeln ab, Fön geht nicht, Türgriffe lose). 
Frühstück finde ich angemessen aber nicht übermäßig luxuriös.
Dachterasse bitte einen super Blick nach Barcelona.
Für den Preis von über 200€/Nacht finde ich, gibt es bessere Hotel (4*) in Barcelona.",3,2018,06,14
35,Schöne Lage - schlechtes Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis,Nette und zentrale Lage zu den Ramblas direkt am Pier - mal was anderes als an der Avenida Diagonale. Der 3fach höhere Preis gegenüber den Businesshotels ist damit allerdings nicht zu rechtfertigen. Und die Buffets waren enttäuschend. ,3,2018,06,13
35,non all'altezza delle aspettative,"La location non è comoda, l'albergo è un palazzone e il servizio non è all'altezza delle 5 stelle.
La stanza è adeguata ma mi è stata data una chiave non adatta alla serratura della stanza assegnatami e quando ho chiamato la reception mi hanno cortesemente risposto di attendere al piano che avrebbero inviato qualcuno, dopo 20 minuti ero ancora lì, chiamo di nuovo e mi viene detto che la persona era in arrivo e che il ritardo era dovuto al fatto che tutti gli ascensori erano occupati... attendo ancora un pò poi scendo io considerato che era ormai quasi l'una di notte.. ascensori liberi giù in reception c'erano due impiegati.. alle mie rimostranze si scusano e mi comunicano che un collaboratore era stato inviato su e che avrebbero provveduto a bloccarlo.
una volta su in camera mi preparo per la notte e dopo circa 10 minuti mi accorgo che qualcuno stava cercando di aprire la porta della stanza.. solo circa 40 minuti dopo la mia prima telefonata!!",3,2018,06,08
35,Gut gelegen und nettes Personal,"Die Deluxe Zimmer im 8 Stock mit Sicht über die Stadt sind super ! Ich habe den Aufenthalt sehr genossen. Das Zimmer hatte allen Komfort den man erwartet und das Personal vom Frontdesk bis zum Zimmermädchen sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Super Frühstück gebucht für € 18,00 ein prima Preis / Leistungsverhältnis ! Leider war es etwas kühl für die Jahreszeit aber die Dachterrasse mit Pool und Bar ist auch klasse !
Mir hat es sehr gefallen und komme wieder !",5,2018,05,22
35,Ottimo,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel per 4 notti. Ottima la posizione, esattamente nel porto di barcellona con vista su navi da crociera. 5 minuti a piedi dall’inizio della Rambla. Colazione super ottima, vastissima varietà di prodotti dolci e salati anche per le persone intolleranti al glutine.
Camera spaziosa e pulita.
Personale molto disponibile e gentile ",5,2018,05,14
35,Ottima soluzione ,"Abbiamo passato 4 notti in hotel. Ottima l’accoglienza alla reception con tempi di attesa minimi. Camera bella spaziosa pulita e con vista sull’interno, nulla di che ma non ci si poteva aspettare cose diverse. Cena in hotel con piccola scelta di piatti ma molto buoni. Colazione con buffet molto vario sia di piatti caldi che freddi. Particolarità una macchina per fare i pancake sul momento. Unica piccolissima nota negativa sulla colazione era finita la nutella al primo giorno e non è mai stata ripristinata neanche con prodotti simili.
Lo consiglio anche come posizione, vicino alla fermata della metro e al centro.
",5,2018,05,04
35,"Super Aussicht, sehr gutes Frühstück","Rezeption freundlich, kompetent und hilfreich, sehr schönes geräumiges Zimmer mit unglaublicher Aussicht auf Barcelona. Vom eigentlichen Zentrum leider etwas entfernt. Ausgezeichnetes Frühstück, läßt keine Wünsche offen.",4,2018,04,16
35,5 Sterne Disaster,"5 Sterne sind hier nicht wirklich angebracht. Um eines vorwegzunehmen, das Personal ist ( teilweise) bemüht aber unter einer völlig chaotischen Hotelleitung leider völlig überfordert. Von einem Hotel dieser Art würde man sich punkto Service und Umgangsformen anderes erwarten. Hier regiert das Chaos und man muss sich um vieles selbst kümmern wenn man nicht auf der Strecke bleiben will. Dieses Megagebäude verfügt über zuwenige und schlecht gewartete Aufzüge. Man bucht doch kein derartiges Hotel um dann wie in einer Sardinenbüchse mit anderen Gästen im Lift zu stecken.
Größtes Defizit: Balkone mit nicht versperrbaren Türen. Balkone, die vom Dach aus durchaus für Einbrecher errecichbar sind. Man wird Ihnen dann erklären, dies sei zu Ihrer eigenen Sicherheit, da man sich ja am Balkon selbst aussperren könne. Was aber beim Montieren einer ordentlichen Türe mit ordentlichen Schnallen und einem ordentlichen Mechanisums eigentlich nicht möglich ist. 
Die Art und Weise wie einem dieses Manko dann von der obersten Managerin persönlich erklärt wird, führt eigentlich nur mehr dazu, dass man am liebsten gleich wieder auschecken würde.
Sehr willkommen fühlt man sich ja ohnehin nicht. 
Die vom Hotel angebotene Autovermietung ist ebenfalls mit Vorsicht zu genießen. Achten Sie bitte auf korrekte Vertragunterzeichnung und verlangen Sie gleich am ersten Tag die komplette Rechnung, da dies ohnehin mindestens drei Tage dauern wird. Ich erhielt meine Rechnung am letzten Tag, kurz bevor ich mein Taxi zum Flughafen bestieg. Ich musste viermal darum ansuchen.
Außerdem wurden wir von niemandem darüber informiert, dass man den Schlüssel nach dem Parken des Wagens vor dem Hotel an der Rezeption abgeben muss und dafür einen Zettel erhält auf dem auch gleich die Gebühr fürs Einparken verrechnet wird. Nämlich Eu 27,50. Ob einmalig zu bezahlen, pro Tag oder pro Einparken weiss ich leider noch nicht, das Personal des Hotels weiss es leider auch nicht 100prozentig, ich warte noch auf eine Kreditkartenabrechnung, dann weiss ich es.
Man klopfte eines nachmittags einfach an unsere Zimmertüre, mit den Worten ""I need your car keys now."" Keine ""Sorry to interrupt you"" oder irgendeine Begründung warum. Erst nach mehrmaligen Fragen wurde uns sie Praktik des Schlüsselabgebens erläutert.
EU 27,50 ist die magische Summe, mit der hier scheinbar alles verrechnet wird. Frühstück pro Person kostet 27,50. Das Buffet ist reichhaltig, die Organisation eher nicht. Langes Anstehen bis man einen Tisch zugewiesen bekommt, lange Schlangen am Buffet. 
Die Frühstückskellner sind sehr bemüht, einem Kaffee zu bringen, jedoch ist dies inmitten der Überzahl an Gästen kein leichtes Unterfangen und auch nicht notwendig, da man ohnehin selbst Kaffee holen kann.
So herrscht also Chaos, Lärm und unglaubliches Gewusel im Frühstückssaal, der mehr einer Abflughalle gleicht. Entspannungsfaktor null.
Haben nach ein paarmal auf das Hotelfrühstück verzichtet. Obwohl tolles Angebot an warmen Speisen und Obst fanden wir 27,50 dann doch auch etwas ungerechtfertigt.
Allgemeine Sauberkeit im Hotel und im Zimmer eher mäßig. 
Ausstattung entsprach keinesfalls fünf Sternen. Kleiner Fernseher, viel zu wenig Stauraum für Kleidung, Steckdosen ALLE am Boden, keine einzige Steckdose in Tisch oder sonsteiner bequemen Höhe. Eine Sreckdose sogar kaputt. 
Mysteriöserer Weise konnte mein Partner auf seiner Bettseite das Licht nicht abdrehen....also mal wieder runter auf den Boden und von Hand abstecken. 
Sorry, aber das ist echt nicht 5 Sterne.
Für die tägliche und nächtliche Lärmbelästigung durch Kreuzfahrtsschiffe kann das Hotel nichts, man könnte es aber in der Beschreibung mal dezent erwähnen. Von der Dieselabgasbelastung der Dampfer red ich jetzt gar nicht....
Auch interessant war der Brunnen im Innenhof. Wir dachten anfangs am Morgen, dass irgendein Frachter beladen wird oder sonstige Wartungsarbeiten vonstatten gingen, es stellte sich jedoch heraus, dass der Brunnen diese skurrile Lärmkulisse verursachte. 
Das Wasser schoß mit großem Krach wie aus pneumatischen Düsen ca. 10 Meter in die Höhe um dann prasselnd am Granitboden zu landen.
Ich weiss nicht recht, welche Art von Ambiente dies kreieren soll.
Bitte auch zu beachten, dass im besagten Innenhof ein Café ist, welches spätnachts noch gern von laut sprechenden Gästen frequentiert wird.
Es gibt sicher schlimmeres, aber alles in allem würden wir dieses Hotel nicht mehr buchen. Die Lage ist zwar gut, das ist aber auch schon alles.",2,2018,04,07
35,"sehr gute Lage, im Hafen, am Anfang der Ramblas","Dieses Hotel hat mich vor allem wegen der Lage überzeugt. Es liegt im Hafen von Barcelona (Anbau vom World Trade Center), ca. 10 Minuten zu Fuss zum Columbus Denkmal und Anfang der Ramblas, ca. 10 Minuten zum Port Vell mit seinen Läden und Restaurants, Oceonarium, Shopping Center etc, ca. 30 Minuten zu Fuss zum Stadtstrand Barcelonita. Eine Haltestelle des Hop-on/off Buses ist vor der Türe.
Das Hotel ist etwas älter, eher teuer, hat eine wunderschöne Dachterrasse, von der aus man den ganzen Hafen und die Stadt überblicken kann. (vor allem am Morgen und Abend empfehlenswert).
Das Frühstück ist sehr umfangreich, aber teuer = EUR 25.- pro Person.",4,2018,04,06
35,tre notti perfette,"Letti comodissimi, vista mozzafiato, pulizia super e posizione molto comoda.
Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel dal 29 marzo al 1 aprile.
Ho letto di varie recensioni in cui chiedono il letto matrimoniale invece hanno avuto per tutta la vacanza due letti.
Noi all'arrivo ci hanno fatto scegliere la tipologia di letto.. ci hanno dato quello chiesto..e non c'è stato alcun problema.
Sottolineo che in questo periodo in Spagna è alta stagione.
Ci torneremo!",5,2018,04,03
35,Familientauglich ,"Wir haben schon sehr viele Hotels bewohnt und auch diverse mit conecting door benötigt, da wir dies, wenn wir mit den Kindern reisen als sehr wichtig finden.
Hier hat man zwei Zimmer nebeneinander die durch eine vorgesetzte Flügeltür dann zu einer großen Familiensuite werden. Wirklich sehr geräumig und gut. Bequeme Betten und alles sauber. Gut gefüllte Minibar und Fernseher mit deutschen Programmen. 
Kostenloses Hotel ""Handy"" mit dem man telefonieren kann und das als Stadführer genutzt werden kann. 

Der Empfang war sehr freundlich und wir bekamen ohne Mehrpreis um 10 Uhr einen early Check in!

Die Qualität der Speisen ist sehr gut und auch die Cocktails an der Bar mit Fachverstand gemixt.

Nur freundliches Personal. 

Von hier aus kann man perfekt die Stadt erkunden. Bus Station direkt am Hotel. 

Nicht 5 aber 4,5 Sterne.",4,2018,03,25
35,CASI GL,"Un hotel referencia en Barcelona, espectacular, con amplias habitaciones y buen servicio. Un magnífico 5 estrellas. Lo que no es muy comprensible es el GL, categoría que debe incluir un extra de confort o calidad
Se echa de menos el conserje a la llegada, o personal que te recoja el equipaje y eso son pequeños detalles que no justifican la sobrevaloración.
Muy buena ubicación anejo al World Trade Center  y muy tranquilo a pesar de su tamaño.
El desayuno sin ser excepcional, ofrece muy buenas opciones.
Lo dicho, un magnífico 5 estrellas

Questa volta ho alloggiato in una junior suite e l'esperienza è stata magnifica. Letto king skize comodissimo, due bagni, salotto, corridoio e spogliatoio. Praticamente un appartamento. Lo consiglierò sempre..ache per la posizione totimale in cui si trova, location strategica da cui si possono iniziare tante belle camminate sia verso il mare che verso l'interno della città.",5,2018,03,05

35,Bellissimo hotel .. posizione comoda ,"Hotel a 2 passi dalla rambla ... via con spazio pedonale centrale ... negozi di souvenirs , magliette barcellona calcio piu ristorantini sia per colazione che per pranzo e cena. Metro vicina .. mezzora e siete al camp nou o alla sagrada familia .. 15 minuti a piedi e siete alla cattedrale. 
Hotel con stanze molto grandi , pulite .. con vista su città e navi passeggeri in partenza ",5,2018,01,01
35,"Oh je, abgerockt und überteuert","Tja, das ist das Dilemma mit schönen Internet Bildern und 5 Sterne ohne Bezug zum Istzustand des Hotels.
Ausstattung geben natürlich die Bewertung her, aber der Zustand des Deluxe Zimmers, das wir gebucht haben, war voll daneben. Man muss sich das bei dem Preis 3mal überlegen. Lage für einen Kurzbesuch in Barcelona ist aber gut. Frühstück für 27€ kann man sich sparen, da geht man gegenüber ins Einkaufszentrum..... Zimmer im 2. Stock mittig auf jeden Fall ablehnen. Von unten schallt der Piano Mann und von vorne Brummen die ablegenden Fähren besonders durch die undichte Schiebetür zum schmutzigen Balkon. 
Empfang war sehr nett, aber total distanziert wie in einem großen Business Hotel halt. 
Im Zimmer hängen die Vorhänge halb runter, der Fernseher ist lieblos durch‘s Zimmer verkabelt, Glasflächen schmutzig, die an sich schönen Wandverkleidungen sind lose, das Parkett hebt sich, ein Waschbecken läuft nicht ab (der gesamte Verschluss wurde entfernt und das Siphon einfach zugedrückt), an der Decke sieht man Wasserschäden, die Hotel-Schlappen werden nach den ersten Tag entfernt (auch die unbenutzten), schimmelige Fügen sind ja leider fast normal, usw.. Leider überhaupt keine Empfehlung: Finger weg. Es sei denn, das Hotel entschließt sich zu einer Renovierung. ",1,2017,12,30
35,Excelente elección!,"Espectacular hotel, con unas vistas impresionantes de la ciudad y la bahía, los cuartos, asi como los baños son amplios, lujosos y cómodos, muy luminosos, las instalaciones son de primera y la atención del personal es inmejorable, adicionalmente la ubicación es excelente, a unos cuantos pasos de La Rambla y de las paradas de los autobuses turísticos.",5,2017,12,24
35,Buona posizione,"Le camere sono alle e spaziose con balcone. L'hotel è nuovo,pur essendo a due passi dalle Ramblas. Ci sono certo begli hotel sicuramente più caratteristici, ma sicuramente non con gli standard di camera di questo.",5,2017,12,03
35,Meravilloso ,"Suelo utilizar la cadena EUROSTARS porque en todas las España tiene los hoteles 5 esterellas gran luyo ( 5 ***** GL) mas BARATO de lo estado y el servicio es al 100% de gran lujo, las ubicaciones siempre muy enteresantes para el trabajo y los estilos de los hoteles siempre al TOP.

Esta vez he hido en EUROSTARS GRAN MARINA en Barcelona y :

1) tenebo una suite: meravillosa la distribucion: 1 salon con office e comedor, 1 segundo salon para TV e sofas, un quarto para los mobles y guardar las cosas, un pequeño cuarto de baño y un gran baño en suite con idromassaje, gran ducha y inodoro separado.

( tambien los habitaciones estan MUY GRANDES y muy chulas)

Unica cosa que me permito evidenziar es la no buena illuminacion: mando mal colocado y dificil cerrar/empujar las luz
( ahora hay todo domotico y SIEMPRE un mando general porque las personas estan nuevos y no conozcon todos...)
Despues esta luz era muy muy fuerte y no romantica ( con color por ejemplo) o con regolation de intensidad.
He mirado que hay muchos luz iGuzzini en el hotel: esta es la prima empresa mondial para la illuminacion de lujo:
La luz CAMBIA la habitacion y la ATMOSFERA!!!

Muchisima gracias a ARIANNA, la receptionst manager de noche, persona MUY amable y competente y al meravilloso servicio de CONCIERGE que en esto meravilloso lo hay, a MARTA de el despacho de reservas y a todos!

EUROSTARS: mejor estructuras qualidad/precios.

35,sehr gut mit Abstichen,"das Hotel liegt sehr zentral am Hafen. Leider nicht durchdacht - warum setzt man die Büros mit Sicht aufs Meer und das Hotel in die zweite Reihe.

Die Zimmer sind geräumig und gut. Allerdings auch hier wieder nicht durchdacht. Keine Steckdosen auf Höhe des Schreibtischs oder am Wasserkocher.

Das Buffet ist umfänglich und sehr gut.

35,Hotel GL muy bien ubicado,"Aunque tuve que esperar un poco en recepción debo decir que mi experiencia en este hotel ha sido muy favorable. El servicio excelente igual que el desayuno. Las habitaciones muy limpias. Me gustaría mayor variedad de almohadas, también se notaban algunos muebles algo desgastados por el uso.",5,2017,10,02
35,Soddisfatto,"Ho trovato questo hotel innanzi tutto molto pulito, personale efficiente e professionale,buona accoglienza,camere spaziose ben arredate e frigobar ben fornito a prezzi modesti. Silenzioso nonostante si trovi su uno dei moli principali. Piscina si,forse un po piccola ma signori: siamo a Barcellona,per fare il bagno c è il mare! Quindi per me irrilevante.
Ottima la colazione ben fornita con prodotti anche senza glutine. Pranzo e cena non li ho provati.
Un buon hotel imsomma dove potrete trovare confort e qualità .",5,2017,09,30
35,Decepcionante,"Cuando reservas en un hotel 5 estrellas Gran Lujo esperas encontrar una experiencia única, y la verdad es que este hotel dista mucho de otros de la misma categoría.
Nada más llegar tuvimos que esperar más de 20 minutos en el checkin debido a que la chica de recepción no conocía bien el programa. Por otro lado, la habitación no estaba lista a las 15:00, hora a la que debería estar ya disponible. Nos dieron otra con ""vistas al mar"", eso sí, para ver el mar tenías que sacar la cabeza por la ventana y al fondo, en la esquina, podías imaginar que estaría el mar.
Al llegar a la habitación no funcionaba el aire acondicionado, y tuvo que venir de mantenimiento a arreglarlo. El desayuno que teníamos incluido solo servía para el buffet, ni hablar de subir a la habitación con el pago de un suplemento (como en el 99% de los hoteles), había que pagar de nuevo 33 euros por cabeza y perdías el del buffet.
Para terminar, el hotel no tiene parking privado, es el parking público de Moll de Barcelona. Así que si tienes un coche gama alta, sabed que estará en un parking público.
Lo dicho. Decepcionante.",2,2017,09,29
35,Ottima location,"Albergo posizionato alla fine di uno dei due moli alla fine della Rambla. Molto moderno con ampio parcheggio. Camere belle , ampie con vista mare e molto pulite.

Sale riunioni efficienti ed adatte allo scopo.",4,2017,09,17
35,"Per chi e' con l'auto propria non c'e' discussione, il migliore.","Ripeto quanto gia' recensito in altre occasioni, per chi viaggia con la propria auto e' il migliore albergo di Barcellona. Puoi metterla nel loro garage o davanti all'entrata, custodita 24/24. Se poi devi prendere un traghetto per Genova il molo d'imbarco e' a due km. Leggo di ""camera piccola""....beh, non so, quelle che prendiamo noi sono di 55 mq. con balcone vista mare e citta'. La colazione se vuoi prenderla la paghi a parte ma e' come un pranzo. Non la consiglio a chi e' abituato solo al cappuccino e cornetto. Nella reception lavorano normalmente almeno sei persone per cui anche in momenti di forte afflusso i tempi di attesa sono minimi. Per qualsiasi necessita' basta chiedere. WiFi perfetto dappertutto. Un altro atout di questo albergo e' la sua posizione: fuori dal caos del centro che pure raggiungi a piedi in dieci minuti. Dal balcone e' sempre suggestivo vedere i traghetti in arrivo o partenza che collegano le Baleari e le Canarie. Se da fastidio il rumore basta chiudere i finestroni dai tripli vetri. Letto, cuscini e lenzuola super cosi come la stanza bagno con vasca e la stanza doccia, wc. AC a regolazione individuale. L'area piscina all'aperto all'ottavo piano e' rilassante e ti permette di godere di vedute eccezionali a 360 gradi su mare e citta'. Hai la fila di taxi in prossimita' dell'entrata cosi come la fermata dei bus-tour e quelli cittadini. Un suggerimento e' quello di aggiungere oltre alle bustine di te' e caffe' anche quelle di tisane e camomilla. Comunque ci starebbe una Nespresso. I prezzi sono adeguati alla categoria comunque riservando tramite il loro sito Internet si hanno dei bei vantaggi.",5,2017,09,09
35,La perfezione,"Abbiamo alloggiato per sei giorni in questo hotel situato nel Trade Center di Barcellona. Tutto favoloso: dall'accoglienza con champagne e spremuta di arancia, alla stanza spaziosa e curatissima, con balcone. Molto bella la piscina sul tetto, con i lettini ed i teli di spugna messi a disposizione degli ospiti. Ristorante e lounge bar di livello. Colazione a buffet estremamente completa e varia, con proposte per celiaci e disponibilità massima dello staff. Complimenti.",5,2017,09,01

I primi problemi ci sono stati già in fase di prenotazione, assolutamente poco chiara. Molto male anche durante il soggiorno. I problemi non sono stati risolti e il personale di front desktop non mi ha mai fatto parlare con un responsabile. Dopo il soggiorno ho scritto una mail di lamentele, cui non c'è stato alcun riscontro. Servizio clienti pessimo. Tutto molto male, anzi malissimo!",1,2017,08,20
35,Imposible descansar,"Ruido por pasillos y habitaciones, niños corriendo por el pasillo, un desastre de experiencia, por el precio de la habitación deberían estar más limpias y con instalaciones más modernas, no repetiré . Largas  colas en recepción para el check-in",1,2017,08,04
35,Sencillamente genial!!,"Llegamos cansados de un duro día de negocios, reuniones y demás, y nos encontramos con un gran grupo de personas haciendo el check-in, lo que nos supuso esperar unos 20 minutos.

Nuestra sorpresa fue al hacer nuestro check-in. La recepcionista nos pidió mil disculpas, y nos alojó en una suite, en lugar de nuestra habitación básica que habíamos reservado.

Increíbles instalaciones. Prácticamente estábamos en un apartamento, a precio de dormitorio.

La cama, una fantástica king size, que para nuestro duro día de trabajo, era lo que necesitábamos para descansar bien. 

Trato excelente de todo el personal. Se ocuparon durante toda la estancia de nuestro coche.

Sin dudar, repetiría la experiencia.",5,2017,08,03
35,Magnifica Atencion,"Encantadora estancia en el Hotel. Llegada con una atencion exquisita y un trato muy agradable. Los chicos de recepcion muy amables y encantadores los botones. Agradable ubicacion, aunque no tuvimos vistas, mas que a un edificio algo parecido al hotel, pero andando, en pocos minutos, llegas a Ramblas y centro de Barcelona. Agradable cafeteria y magnifico desayuno. En general, una estupenda estancia y encantados con Judith, jonathan y Marius. Volveremos.",5,2017,07,31
35,Pésima experiencia. ,"Pésima. Tenemos billete para irnos en el barco, y pocas opciones para ir a comer por los alrededores. Mal servicio, la comida fria, a pesar de tardar 20' en servirte. Precio desorbitado. Las alitas de pollo...sin palabras. Cómo se puede tener la vergüenza de cobrar semejante precio por 6 alitas de pollo que a parte todo era piel, pollos famélicos, ni huesos... Y qué hay de las patatas bravas?? 6 medias patatas que no te llegan ni al paladar. Los calamares..,seguramente fritos desde por la mañana, y ni siquiera han sido capaces de pasarlos por el microondas...,señores, si tardan 20' en servirlos, y me van a cobrar 17€.., por lo menos un calentón en el micro para semejar que acaban de freirlos, que les acabo de decir que voy a perder el barco y aún no se dignan ni siquiera a ello. 
Obviamente, no lo recomiendo en absoluto, pérdida de tiempo y dinero, y lo peor... te vas con hambre. ",1,2017,07,17
35,Insoportable,Estoy en este hotel en estos escribiendo a las 7 de la mañana porque a partir de las 6:30 un ruido insoportable de la zona de los barcos de al lado me ha despertado y desde entonces no sólo no he podido dormir sino que incluso poniendo música con los aurículares colocados se aprecia retumbar la habitación lo que es muy estresante. Tenía pensado levantarme a las 9 h. No vengan por favor ni aunque tuviera el precio de un hostal de mala muerte. Es increíble que en un hotel de cinco estrellas y que pone GL ocurran cosas así.,1,2017,07,16
35,Correcto,Habitaciones relativamente amplias aunque se echaba de menos algún complemento para ser un GL tales como albornoz y mayor amplitud de amenities. Mejorable el mantenimiento de los baños. Servicio atento y eficaz.,4,2017,07,14
35,Una bonita noche,"Pasamos sólo una noche en este hotel. La habitación muy confortable con buenas vistas. El servicio atento.
No cenamos en el restaurant, sólo hicimos allí el desayuno que fue muy completo, estilo buffet, con infusiones, frutas, zumos, panes, bollería.
En otra ocasión fuimos a una fiesta en la terraza y también estuvo muy bien. Con un catering excelente y muy buen ambiente.
Está bien ubicado, cerca de trasporte público si tienes que moverte por la ciudad y al lado de un centro de negocios.
Recomendable.",4,2017,06,27
35,Photoshop! ,"Die Bilder in der Beschreibung trüben!
Pool auf der Terrasse für Maximal 3-4 Personen! 

Frühstück: ich empfehle nur Cornflakes! 
Gut und das Obst.. 😏

Zimmer wurde am ersten Tag erst um 16 Uhr gereinigt nach dem wir das Personal aufmerksam gemacht haben.. bzw. die Hausdame! 

In den Fluren riecht es sehr unangenehm 
Teppich schaut sehr ungereinigt aus.. 
Schade sowas.. definitiv kein 5 Sterne Hotel.. bzw. Garnicht verdient! 

Das einzige positive am Hotel ist das Personal an der Rezeption sehr hilfsbereit.. 

Lage sehr zentral.. 

3 Sterne Hotel 
",2,2017,06,24
35,Ottima posizione,"Sicuramente il prezzo abbastanza elevato Delle camere è in parte dovuto alla posizione e ai numerosi servizi che offre che ho trovato ottimi (dal parcheggio alla palestra). Forse da rimodernare in termini di interni perché sono un po' vecchiotti. 
Ho trovato esageratamente cara la colazione... 27 euro... Una follia.",3,2017,06,24
35,Par de días ,"El hotel está muy Bien ubicado, la habitación standar es muy cómoda, aunque yo no lo clasificaría de lujo, es un buen hotel, con instalaciones modernas y bien conservadas, no es nuevo. El desayuno si es q tomas la opción de tenerlo incluido es una barra de buffet con suficientes opciones. ",4,2017,06,23
35,Terraza,"Fuimos a la terraza para un concierto de jazz.  El hotel está perdido en el muelle y es de difícil acceso. La terraza es enorme pero esta poco explotada, tiene poca decoración por lo que resulta fría e insulsa. Mojito 14 euros! !!!:o!!! Deberían pagarte por ir allí",3,2017,06,18
35,Mejorando .... muy satisfecho ,"Estuve hospedado en este hotel durante años hasta que me canse de pagar por un servicio regular en un supuesto 5 estrellas .
Después de 1 año durmiendo en otras cadenas esta semana volví , y he de decir que el servicio en general ha mejorado bastante .
La habitación impecable , ni una mota de polvo , muy diferente a hace 12 meses donde la suciedad reinaba en cada esquina z
El personal está vez fue muy amable , muy atentos y siempre dispuestos a sacarnos una sonrisa .
Mejorable ? ... lo de siempre de eurostars el mantenimiento de sus instalaciones , ya algo viejas , y conseguido ? Los estándares de calidad y de limpieza de un 5 estrellas estuvieron a la altura .
Repetiré y será de nuevo mi hotel destino .
",5,2017,06,11
35,"Impersonal, frío. Solo correcto.","La ubicación es muy buena: ramblas a un paso, barrio gótico a diez minutos andando y muy bien comunicado con bicicletas de alquiler y parada de taxi en la puerta. 

La piscina, en la planta superior, tiene vistas inmejorables del puerto y de la ciudad.

El precio fue alto, pero toda la ciudad estaba en la misma situación al coincidir nuestro viaje con el MotoGP. Habría que ver la oferta en un fin de semana normal para valorar correctamente este apartado.

En la parte negativa, el personal se encuentra habituado a un tipo de turismo tan impersonal como fugaz. Alguno de los individuos de la terraza nocturna alcanza la categoría de ineducado y ofensivo con el cliente. El meritorio esfuerzo de las recepcionistas no puede compensar las carencias del resto del staff.

Por lo demás, decoración fría, hotel impersonal y comodidades justas, lejos de las cinco estrellas GL que promete.

Si a pesar de todo piensas en alojarte en el Gran Marina, no olvides llevar crema hidratante corporal. Ni está ni te la ponen a pesar de pedirla. ",3,2017,06,11
35,Es para negocios ,"Las habitaciones están muy bien. El desayuno es lo mejor del hotel por lejos. El servicio es
Relativamente
Bueno. La ubicación es
Buena si vas x
Trabajo y
No tanto si vas x turismo. La pileta es directamente
Impresentable. Un cuadrado de tres por tres en la terraza al cual obviamente nadie se le anima. Me dio la sensación de ser un hotel de negocios y no de vacaciones. Cero flexibilidad para extender el check out  solamente dos horas. ",4,2017,06,11
35,19€ Gintonic????,En la mesa de la terraza no tenían la carta y confiamos por que el sitio no es demasiado especial... Y la sorpresa fue la cuenta... 19euros el gintonic de Bombay y 4 euros la Coca-Cola. No se corresponde con el tipo de hotel. ,1,2017,06,10
35,Kein 5 Stern Hotel!,"Lage des Hotels am Hafen, nahe einer hop-on/hop-off Bushaltestelle ist ideal. Gebuchte Luxus Suite war gross, recht modern, aber etwas abgenutzt. WC war nicht sauber.... Tischset am Frühstückstisch hatte Flecken. Für die Bestellung und Lieferung eines Mojitos und eines Biers, am späteren Nachmittag, mussten wir 25 Minuten Warten. Gewünschter Weisswein aus der Weinkarte (nur rund 5-6) war nicht vorhanden. Ambiente, Service und Sauberkeit sind bei weitem keine 5 Sterne wert. ",3,2017,06,05
35,Ganz nett und gut gelegen. ,"Wir waren übers Wochenende in Barcelona und hatten das Hotel auf Grund der Lage und der Fotos auf booking.com gebucht. Es ist ein großes sauberes, modernes gut gelegenes Hotel in Barcelona.

Zu Bemängelnd gIbt es nichts, außer dass das Hotel keine Seele hat. Der Empfang ist korrekt, aber nicht herzlich. Großhotel halt. Der Service in der Bar war ok, etwas langsam. Die Zimmer waren sauber, die Klimaanlage funktionierte. Unser Blick war in den Innenhof. Nicht toll, aber auch nicht schlimm. Bei der Buchung hatten wir die Befürchtung, wir würden abends gar nicht mehr von der Rooftop Bar wegkommen. Die Befürchtung ist allerdings unbegründet, da die Dachterasse, wie auch der Pool, in einem tollen Winkel fotografiert wurden. Der Pool ist wesentlich kleiner, und die Bar war an dem Abend als wir da waren, nicht geöffnet.

Die Lage ist sehr zentral und alles in allem würden wir wahrscheinlich sogar wieder dort absteigen. Warum keine 5 Sterne?
Weil mir die herzlichkeit und der professionelle Service fehlten. Allerdings klagen auf hohem Niveau. ",4,2017,06,05
35,5 Stern??? 5 Stern etwas anders...,Deutlich kein 5 Stern Hotel.. fehlen viele Sachen und mängelhaft. Im Zimmer wenig schampo oder andre Mittel. Keine genügende Bade tuch keine Bademantel. Und was lustiges ist Swimmingpool so klein aber sehr klein nur für paar Goldfische. Frühstück sehr gut und sowie Personal. ,1,2017,05,28
35,"Zentral gelegen, aber trotzdem ruhig","Meine Frau und ich haben den Jahreswechsel 2016/2017 für vier Tage in diesem Hotel verbracht. Die Lage des Hotel war dabei für uns ausschlaggebend. Das Hotel liegt fußläufig zu ""Las Ramblas"" und trotzdem ruhig mitten im Hafen von Barcelona. Die Altstadt ist zu Fuß sehr gut erreichbar. Der umliegende Hafen bildet ein maritimes Flair. Direkt neben dem Hotel legen die großen Fähren an. Die ausgewiesenen 5 Sterne erreicht das Hotel nach unserem Eindruck nicht ganz. Trotzdem ist das Hotel sehr gut und der Service ist sehr zuvorkommend. Zu dem Hotel gehört eine Tiefgarage. Um das Parken unseres Mietwagens kümmerte sich das Hotelpersonal - sehr praktisch. Wir haben nur Frühstück in dem Hotel gebucht. Der Frühstücksraum war leider etwas klein, so dass sich hier morgens eine Schlange von Wartenden bildete; man wurde vom Personal zum Tisch begleitet. Das Frühstück selbst war ok aber nicht überwältigend. Zu Sylvester haben wir die vom Hotel angebotene Feier gebucht. Es wurde ein netter Abend. 

Insgesamt können wir das Hotel für einen Barcelona-Trip sehr empfehlen.",4,2017,05,21
35,Barcelona ,"Tolles Hotel, die Zimmer schon etwas abgenutzt aber sehr sauber. Das Personal spricht kaum Deutsch noch nicht einmal an der Rezeption.  Man kann das Hotel aber empfehlen weil es sehr zentral gelegen ist. 

",5,2017,05,13
35,Buen hotel,"Pasé alrededor de una semana en este hotel. El servicio fue bueno y eficiente y está cerca de la zona de entretenimiento. Aunque es un hotel de estándares altos, no es un hotel de lujo. La Wi-Fi estuvo bien todo el tiempo, al igual que el desayuno. Nada que decir en contra, aparte del precio. ",4,2017,04,23
35,"Instalaciones buenas, desayuno increíble, atención mejorable, NO ES UN GRAN LUJO!!!!!","Este hotel está ubicado en el moll de Barcelona (donde aparcan todos los ferrys de balearía y transmediterranea, y los cruceros de lujo). 

Las vistas desde el hotel son estupendas, desde la habitación veíamos el mar y la ciudad. Además, desde la terraza de arriba también se pueden apreciar unas vistas estupendas a la ciudad de Barcelona.

El desayuno excelente, muy variado, muy completo, y de muy buena calidad.

Estuvimos alojados en Semana Santa y la piscina exterior no estaba abierta, algo que me pareció muy irrespetuoso teniendo en cuenta que era Semana Santa y que hacía 25 grados en Barcelona.

La atención de los empleados del hotel es buena, pero no se corresponde a un hotel de gran lujo, ya que te tratan muy bien, pero como si fuera un 4 estrellas normal, sin ninguna atención especial ni personalizada.

Nada más salir del Moll de Barcelona hay varios buses con dirección Plaza España, y si andas hasta la estatua de Colón (5-10min) hay varios autobuses que conectan con El Centro de la ciudad. 

Se puede caminar hasta el Maremagnum (centro comercial, 15 min aproximadamente) y hasta la Barcelonesa (35 min aproximadamente).

El wifi funciona de pena, es bastante inútil.",4,2017,04,23
35,No es un cinco estrellas gran lujo,"No es un cinco estrellas gran lujo como indica su página web, es un cinco estrellas justito. Es un hotel impersonal, moderno, con habitaciones y baños amplios. El lobby es frío y desmerece un poco el resto del hotel. Está en el puerto  cerca del centro comercial maremagnum y a unos 15 minutos caminando del barrio del Born. Wifi gratis. Desayuno de buena calidad y completo. El bar es agradable y su cocina buena. Por su ubicación, hotel ideal para cruceristas.",3,2017,04,19
35,Schönes Hotel mit kleine Schwächen ,War mit meine Frau dort.Zentral am Hafen gelegen.Zimmer ein bisschen in die Jahre gekommen aber immer noch sehr schön.Super Frühstück das keine wünschen offen lässt.Personal sehr aufmerksam mit gute Englisch Kenntnisse Pool auf dem Dach ist sehr klein und war noch nicht geöffnet während unser Aufenthalt.Werde gerne wiederkommen ,4,2017,04,10
35,Hotel bellissimo ,Hotel bellissimo e molto centrale. Forse per quanto costa dovrebbero includere la colazione! Personale gentile e disponibile.... stanze bellissime! C'è solo la sauna sarebbe il top con una SPA completa,4,2017,03,31
35,hotel de 5 estrellas con servicio regular,"la habitación era superior,y era una pasada. Pero no tenia albornoz, y los amenities, tuve que pedir crema corporal a la recepción y me dijeron que no había. ( como íbamos en grupo, me lo dio un compañero de mi grupo). al día siguiente le pedí a la camarera de piso y sí había...vaya....  
la recepcion, muy moderna pero muy fría. cada vez que entraba alguien, te quedabas helado. De hecho, el viernes 24 llovió mucho y tuvieron que poner toallas en el suelo. Menuda imagen. 
el desayuno de 5 estrellas, con jamon iberico y zumo natural. Pero la tortilla había que pedirla, no había show cooking. 
el colmo: tienen un bar con una terraza exterior, en dos partes. pues en la mas alejada, nos sentamos y me tuve que levantar a pedir la bebida, me comentaron que en esa zona NO servían. Entonces, para que la tienen? un hotel de 5 estrellas?
por eso digo que el hotel bien, pero el servicio en general, regular. la ubicación muy buena, es lo que gana. no repetiría.",3,2017,03,30
35,Normal,"La insuficiencia del servicio radica en la mala atención de los camareros, creo que un hotel tan grande y con tan Buenas instalaciones no debe escatimar en contratar profesionales de la hostelería, ya que si el servicio hubiera sido bueno, otra puntuación les pondría. ",2,2017,03,29
35,"Muy bueno hotel, excelente ubicación...habitación muy ruidosa","La ubicación es muy buena. a un paso de la rambla, del maremagnum y del puerto. esto último para mi es perfecto porque se puede salir a correr mirando el mar en una zona muy linda.
Los cuartos estaban muy cómodos, el desayuno excelente y la atención impecable.
El único problema es que la primera noche no pude dormir nada porque se escuchaba todo lo del cuarto del costado aún cuando no hacían excesivo ruido. Debo decir que una vez que lo comunique al persona, inmediatamente me cambiaron de habitación.",4,2017,03,24
35,A la altura de la categoria que tiene.,"El hotel está situado en una de las dársenas del puerto, muy cerca de la estetua de colon. Detrás está el world trade center, es muy cómodo para convenciones. La habitación era amplia y luminosa, con una pequeña terraza. La cama comoda, y baño grande y limpio. En la recepción son muy amables y atentos. El hotel tiene un restaurante formal, a la hora de la comida con un buffet bastante bueno. Tiene también un piano bar donde se puede comer de forma informal, excesivamente caro para la calidad de los p,atos que sirven.",4,2017,03,13
35,Ne manca una di Stella,Hotel moderno che però mostra alcuni segni di invecchiamento e non tutto è come dovrebbe essere in un Hotel a cinque stelle. La colazione offre una scelta vastissima in grado veramente di accontentare tutti. Buona anche la qualità del bar. La struttura è proprio sul porto nel terminal commerciale e la vista sulle grandi navi non è delle migliori; d'altro canto però si è a 5 minuti a piedi da La Rambla. Il personale è cortese e disponibile ma nell'insieme è un hotel impersonale senza un proprio stile. ,4,2017,03,13
35,Schön aber für ein 5-Stern Hotel einfach kein Luxus-Ambiente,"Bei den Zimmerpreisen (für eine Grandsuite musste zeitweise 1800 Euro für eine Nacht hingeblättert werden) war ich doch sehr enttäuscht. Dies fing bereits in der Rezeption an, absolut kein Ambiente, es herrschte Durchzug und die Rezeptionistin sprach nur schlecht englisch (war aber sehr freundlich). Die Grandsuite war dann wohl geräumig aber extrem schlecht eingeteilt. Der Balkon ist ein einziges Schattenloch, die Aussicht auf Barcelona jedoch fantastisch. Im Bad steckte der Abflussmechanismus fest, was eigentlich bei der Vorreinigung hätte bemerkt werden müssen. Zudem hatte es überall kleine Staubflächen, wo einfach schon lange nicht mehr geputzt worden ist. Diese Kategorie Zimmer muss für diesen Preis einfach PERFEKT sein.",3,2017,03,06
35,Geht als 5 Sterne Hotel gerade noch durch.,Das Hotel genügt den Anforderungen. Große Zimmer mit kleinen Erhaltungsmängeln. Gutes Frühstück. Großzügige Zimmer. Die Preise sind angemessen. Das Personal ist auf allen Positionen ok. Nette Hausbar.,5,2017,02,25

La limpieza es regular, sobre todo en las áreas comunes. Pocas amenities en la habitación y de baja calidad. Wifi gratis en todo el hotel, funciona muy bien. El servicio de mucamas es malo. No cambiaron el papel higiénico que se terminó, no limpiaban demasiado bien y el domingo hicieron la habitación a las 15.30 hs.",4,2017,02,20
35,Un bel casermone ,"Situato in ottima posizione a due passi da Barceloneta è un albergone immenso vicinissimo ma non fronte mare. Camere grandi abbastanza belle e ben tenute , bagno bello. Reception un po' impersonale ( come del resto tutta la struttura ) come del resto tutta la struttura. Colazione a buffet , ricca ma in un ampio salone piuttosto asettico ed in stile grandi alberghi delle note catene. Cinque stelle ben lontano dalla mia concezione ; insomma...ci si sta anche bene ma il fascino di Barcellona non lo si avverte proprio e poi sei nel porto vicino ai traghetti....( e alla biglietteria).",3,2017,02,20

35,5 estrellas maravilloso,"Estuvo en este hotel con mi pareja a la vuelta de un crucero por el Mediterráneo que habíamos realizado. Primero que nada nos dejaron ingresar a la habitación siendo casi las 11 de la mañana, algo que para nosotros fue un regalo hermoso, aparte de eso nos hicieron una mejora de la habitación reservada y nos dieron una junior suite. Una habitación majestuosa, con dos baños, dormitorio, vestidor y un living comedor y su respectivo balcón. El hotel es nuevo y esta muy bien decorado. Cerca del puerto y a unas tres cuadras de la rambla de Barcelona. El desayuno es excelente y con todas las opciones dulces y saladas que puedas imaginar. Para finalizar al retirarnos nos dejaron quedarnos una hora mas del horario del check out. Una especial mención para Tomas de la recepción por su cordial atención a todos los requerimientos.

Sin duda lo mejor es el personal, te facilitan y agradan la estancia siendo muy atentos y amables.

35,Sehr enttäuschende Übernachtung - das kannte ich ganz anders!,"Ich war beruflich vor einigen Jahren mehrmals in diesem Hotel und fand es in Bezug auf Service und vor allem Frühstück außergewöhnlich. Auch die Lage verspricht mitten drin und dann doch andererseits in der Nacht genügend weit weg zu sein.
Als Familie waren wir bis auf den Service bei Fahrzeugannahme und der netten Bedienung an der Bar durchweg enttäuscht!
Trotz monatelanger Vorbuchung einer Family-Suite direkt im Hotel war ein langwieriger Check-In mit initial falscher Rechnung zum Gegenzeichnen zu passieren. Unwirsch wurde die Frage nach Upgrade und Late-Check-out abgehandelt – hiermit wirbt das Hotel aber doch bei Direktbuchung!
Im Familienzimmer fehlte dann das Bett für unsere Tochter und der Page musste überzeugt werden dies Selber an den Service weiterzuleiten.
Das Frühstück ist atmosphärisch ein völliges Desaster, die Warmspeisen waren kalt, der Rest z.T. lieblos aufgetürmt und der Service ist nicht existent bzw. extrem genervt und unprofessionell.
Wir holten uns wie andere Gäste den Kaffee und den Saft am Automaten bzw. Stehtisch im Bereich des dreckigen abgeräumten Geschirrs selber. Als dann die Bedienung mein benutztes und Eigelbes Messer vom Teller nahm um es ungeniert wieder neben den neueingedeckten Teller zu legen, konnte meine Gattin nicht mehr ruhig bleiben.
Uneinsichtigkeit und offenkundiger Ärger schlug Ihr entgegen – als „Strafe“ wurde das Geschirr im Umfeld auffällig laut abgeräumt!
Es konnte dann doch morgens noch ein Late-Check-Out für 13.00 Uhr vereinbart werden; dennoch standen wir um 12.30 Uhr vor verschlossenen Zimmertüren und ich durfte mich erneut und mit gewissem Zeitdruck an der Rezeption anstellen. Am Ende also viermal in der Warteschlange vor der Reception bei ganzen 19 Stunden Aufenthalt…..
Wir hatten uns für ca. € 450,- incl. Frühstück und Parkplatz / Nacht doch nur auf einen professionell geführtes Hotel mit gutem Frühstück gefreut .
Ich hatte dabei sogar in Betracht gezogen, dass die Dieselmotoren eines Kreuzfahrtsfahrschiffes die Nachtruhe mit geöffnetem Fenster gefährden können – so kam es dann leider auch am frühen Morgen.",2,2016,11,09
35," MAGNÍFICO!","Como siempre la cadena Eurostars no deja indiferente, somos clientes habituales del Eurostars Madrid Tower y sin dudarlo en nuestra visita a Barcelona optamos por el Eurostars Grand Marina.
Ubicación preciosa, en pleno puerto de Barcelona con muchos lugares  de ocio alrededor y unas vistas magníficas, el hotel tiene una terraza con piscina en la última planta que tiene unas vistas maravillosas del puerto y de la capital.
Sin duda seguiremos repitiendo con Eurostars!",5,2016,11,02
35,Un perfecto maridaje de tapas y vinos acompañados de música de piano en vivo,"El Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel de Barcelona ofrece en su lobby bar el 'pop up' gastronómico La Vendimia. Puedes elegir la tapa que más te apetezca con su maridaje de vino, mientras disfrutas de un ambiente muy tranquilo y de música de piano en vivo. Degusta tapas como 'Ceviche de berberechos', 'Ventresca de bonito con pimientos asados y perlage de anchoa' con un vino perfecto para la ocasión. Sólo hasta el 20 de noviembre.",5,2016,11,01
35,Einfach lächerlich! Niemals hat dieses Hotel 5 Sterne!!!!!,"Wir sind total enttäuscht. Der Wirpool auf unserem Zimmer war defekt. Unser Zimmer dreckig: Gardinen fleckig, Schimmel in der Badewanne, Klimaanlage machte laute quietschende Geräsche und zu guter letzt gab es am vorletzten Abend noch einen technischen defekt, wir konnten das Licht nicht mehr ausschalten. Ich rief bei der Rezeption an und es fühlte sich niemand verantwortlich. Nach 2 Stunden habe ich dann die Glühbirnen rausgedreht! Dieses Hotel besuchen wir nie wieder! Es gibt keine Sauna, keinen Indoorpool, der Pool auf dem Dacht in komplett vergammelt und hätte dringend einige Reparaturen nötig!",1,2016,10,23
35,Zwei Übernachtungen im Hotel,Es soll ein 5 Sterne Hotel sein. Das sind höchstens 4 Sterne. Das Frühstück ist eine Katastrophe für angeblich 5 Sterne. Die Stühle wackeln! Das Personal schläft. Die Zimmer sind ebenfalls max 4 Sterne. Das Arts ist um Welten besser. Nie mehr werde ich hier absteigen....Das Arts war leider voll....,1,2016,10,19
35,Buena estancia,"Estuve alojada una noche en la suite para darle una sorpresa a mi pareja por su cumpleaños, el trato del personal es correcto, el hotel está muy grande, la zona del bar me gustó mucho, los sábados tienen música en directo, las habitaciones son muy espaciosas, el desayuno no lo probé por lo que no puedo deciros nada, lo único que no me gustó es que me hicieron una autorización de la tarjeta y me cobraron la noche entera y el dinero no me lo devolvieron hasta que no pasaron 10 días, y claro cuando no te lo esperas fastidia. Por lo demás bien.",4,2016,10,18
35,Gutes Erstklasshotel an zentraler Lage,"Nüchternes Erstklasshotel an zentraler Lage am Hafen. Modern, sehr sauber. Grosszügige Zimmer - mit Aussicht auf die Stadt oder in den Innenhof (WTC gegenüberliegend). Personal freundlich, zuvorkommend (Bellboys!), z.T. aber auch etwas reserviert und unmotiviert (Service, Reception).
Auf Kundenreklamationen wird professionell reagiert. Einziger Makel: Die in Aussicht gestellten Extras bei Direktbuchung im Hotel (Upgrade, late Checkout, etc.) sucht man dann vergeblich. Frühstücksbuffet umfangreich und von guter Qualität.
Hinweis: Direkt vor dem Hotel legen jeweils von ca 17-22 Uhr zwei Fähren an. Bei offenem Fenster kann der Lärm störend sein - die Schiffe sind aber auch eine Attraktion.",4,2016,10,15
35,Acogedor,"Las vistas formidables. Buen servicio. La habitacion increible pero me quedo con el cuarto de baño. Grande y super acogedor. Tiene todo lo que se necesita. Como pero, a veces, se tarda mucho tiempo en coger taxi. Todo el resto genial",4,2016,10,15
35,Sólo el precio es cinco estrellas,"Hemos pagado un dineral por una habitación con vistas a un barco horrible, el mantenimiento del hotel deja mucho que desear, sobretodo en un cinco estrellas. Por el precio que pagas debería estar todo absolutamente perfecto",1,2016,10,15
35,Kein Hotel zum verlieben,"Lage auf einer Mole im Hafen. Zimmer sauber, schönes Bad. Frühstück gut, aber sehr grosses Restaurant, wenn gut besucht etwas unbequem. Kleines Speiserestaurant hinter der Bar, kleine Speisekarte, gute Weine. Taxistand vor dem Hotel.",3,2016,10,13
35,"Acorde al precio, desayuno espectacular","Hotel de 5 estrellas situado en a 5 min de las Ramblas, habitaciones grandes y limpias con todo cuidado al detalle, sin grandes vista eso si, servicio atento, en nuestra estancia tuvieron un problema de tuberías con goteras en el hall que solucionaron rápidamente. El desayuno espectacular, calidad y variedad, un lujo. No ofrecieron una copa al llegar en el lounge, espacio muy agradable y la copa muy rica. ",4,2016,10,11
35,Grand luxe?,"No se donde ven el gran lujo! Habitaciones sin vistas al mar. Nos han obligado a pagar la habitacion sin entrar antes y tuviendo que esperar hasta las 4 de la tarde (el pago lo hicimos a la 1). Poca informacion a la llegada. Relacion calidad precio excesiva, pagando para tener de vista un enorme ferry. La cama no és Nada del otro mundo... ",1,2016,10,09
35,Sempre al Top!,"Non sarete mai stanchi di soggiornare in questo fantastico hotel. Situato all'interno del complesso ""World Trade Center"", si gode di una vista spettacolare, sia sulla città che sulla zona portuale. Al primo piano, per un costo di €25 a persona, offrono una colazione a buffet con ogni tipo di bontà. Per chi lo desidera, si può anche fruire della colazione in camera. Degne di nota la cortesia e professionalità del personale. Lo consiglio vivamente.",5,2016,10,03
35,Gut gelegen aber viel zu teuer ,"Nettes Hotel mit spektakulärer Lage und tollem Blick - ich hatte zumindest in einem Blick über die ganze Stadt. 
Das Frühstück ist ok aber nichts besonderes wenn man ein großes Hotelfrühstück erwartet. 
In der Summe gibt es nicht wirklich etwas zu bemängeln, wenn das Hotel die Hälfte kosten würde. Tut es aber leider nicht. Da man das aber wiederum vorher weiß gibt es 4 Sterne ",4,2016,09,29
35,"Correcto, pero no es un 5* GL","Conseguimos habitación a muy buen precio y pasamos un fin de semana. La ubicación es bastante mala, en medio de un puerto del que salen barcos constantemente (ruidos, olor a fuel...) y a como mínimo 10 min de cualquier rastro de transporte, ocio o restauración. Las habitaciones contiguas están separadas por una puertecita que hace que tu intimidad se vea enormemente comprometida y que oigas (y te oigan) todo lo que pase en tus compañeros al lado. La piscina muy básica y pobre. Personal atento aunque el trato demasiado correcto, te dan bastante poca información. Buffet de desayuno de muy alta calidad y terraza Black Marina excelente. Por la mitad (o la tercera parte) del precio que cuesta alojarte aquí encuentras cosas similares o incluso mejores. Decepcionante",3,2016,09,19
35,Excelente Hotel a 5 minutos de Ramblas.,"Agradable experiencia cuando fuimos al Consulado a nacionalizar a nuestra hija. Lo encontramos -por ser invierno- a un precio correcto. Vistas muy buenas al Puerto y a los Cruceros que entran y salen. Recientemente estuvimos con unos amigos en verano y descubrimos las instalaciones que estaban cerradas en invierno. Cerca hay un centro comercial para pasar el rato y la calle de Ramblas y el monumento a Colón puedes verlo desde la terraza. Recomendable por su situación, arquitectura y lujo.",5,2016,09,18
35,4 Sterne wären gerecht,"Das Hotel direkt am Hafen gelegen ist gleichzeitig Anlegestelle für Fähren und Kreuzfahrschiffe. Diese belästigen Tag und Nacht durch Motorengeräusche und Abgase . Auf dem Dach , wo sich auch der einzige winzige Pool befindet hält man den Dieselgestank kaum aus. Es gibt auch keine Sonnenschirme an den Liegen, so dass es unmöglich ist dort zu verweilen. Die Zimmer sind sehr geräumig und bieten sowohl im Schlafraum als auch im Bad ausreichend Platz. Das Frühstücksbüffet hat keinen 5 Sterne Standard. Keine Abwechslung bei den Speisen und keine frisch zubereiteten Eierspeisen . ",4,2016,09,12
35,Absolut Überteuert und keine 5 Sterne,"Wir hatten zunächst 5 Tage lang ein Deluxe-zimmer mit Balkon zum Innenhof. Aufgrund von Krankheit mussten wir um eine Nach verlängern und hatten dann ein Zimmer zur Straße. 
Die Zimmer sind an sich total schön, gemütlich und sauber. Das erste Zimmer hatte nur ein Badewanne, das zweite Badewanne und Dusche. Außerdem besaß das erste Zimmer einen sehr lange Gang und ein kleines Ankleidezimmer, während das zweite dafür ein kleines Wohnzimmer besaß. 

Kritikpunkte:
+ das gesamte Hotel ist sehr sauber
+ auf Wunsch haben wir ein Zimmer mit Balkon und großem Bett bekommen
+ das Schlafzimmer besitzt eine extra Tür, so dass kaum Geräusche vom Gang ins Zimmer gelangen
+ relativ großer Fitnessraum mit frischen Handtüchern und Wasser
+ Handtücher für die Liegen direkt am Pool
+ die Belüftung/Klimaanlage ist sehr gut und relativ leise
+ Willkommensgetränk in der Bar

- das Frühstücksbüffet ist absolut überteuert. Es gibt keine Station an der einem Eierspeisen frisch zubereitet werden. Mir als Vegetarierin fehle eine größere Auswahl an fleischlosen Gerichten wie Antipasti und Vollkornbrot. Kräuter kennt man in der Küche wohl gar nicht. Das gekochte Gemüse in den Warmhaltebehältern war total zerkocht. Einzig bei den Süßspeisen gab es eine große Auswahl. Der Service auf der Terrasse war freundlich und aufmerksam, während dies auf den Innenraum absolut nicht zutrifft. Hier musste man sich meist die Getränke selbst besorgen. 
- draußen gab es leider nicht viele Schattenplätze beim Frühstück und im Innenraum sind die Tusche sehr nah aneinander gestellt, so dass es dort bei vielen Gästen sehr ungemütlich wird.
- die Klimaanlage im Fitnessraum funktionierte nicht oder war sehr hoch eingestellt, so dass es viel zu heiß dort war im Sport zu machen. Auch ein Mitarbeiter bestätigte dass es zu warm sei, doch wurde nichts geändert.
- die Preise am Pool sind unverschämt hoch. Ein Kaffee mit Eiswürfeln im Plastikglas kostete 6€ (in der Stadt kostet das selbe 1,5-2,5€) 
- es gibt keine Sonnenschirme bei den Sonnenliegen
- je nach Wind kann man teils kaum noch atmen am Pool durch die riesigen Kreuzfahrtschiffe direkt vorm Hotel. Welche auch bis Mitternacht durchgehend ein lautes Brummen von sich geben. 
- die Dusche war in beiden Zimmern sehr dunkel und die Ecken waren leicht verschimmelt. 
- im ersten Zimmer gab es noch nicht einmal ein Bügeleisen und die Körperpflegeartikel im Bad bestanden nur aus Shampoo, Duschgel und Seife. 
- auf dem Balkon gibt es keine Möbel
- jeder konnte im Hotel ein und ausgehen und auf alle Etage gelangen 
- die Lage des Hotels scheint zwar auf dem ersten Blick sehr zentral zu sein, doch befindet sich der nächste Supermarkt und die Metro Ca 1 km entfernt, der Strand 2,5 km",3,2016,09,11
35,Upgrade gratuito e camera super ,"Ottimo hotel, molto apprezzato grazie anche ad un upgrade gratuito che ci ha fatto godere una stanza (si fa per dire perché era più un appartamento) magnifica. Pulizia perfetta, accessori in camera super. Personale molto gentile. Posizione calmissima e senza rumori, a due passi dalla Rambla. Da ritornarci.",5,2016,09,10
35,In Ordnung,"Das Zimmer war in Ordnung und sauber. 
Ziemlich dunkler Gang und Zimmer!

35,Al di sotto delle aspettative,"Arrivati in mattinata effettuiamo il ceck in e lasciamo i bagagli in attesa della camera (disponibile dopo le 15) in bella vista con tanti altri..... Bagno disponibile al primo piano oltre il bar..... I bagagli ce lì siamo portati in stanza noi.... camera accogliente e pulita
Il lavandino è però otturato , lo facciamo presente ma il problema viene risolto solo dopo l'ennesimo sollecito (due giorni dopo).  Bar sulla terrazza:. Dopo 25 minuti d'attesa.... Abbiamo rinunciato!!
Piscina piccolissima ma trovata inaccessibile due volte

Nel contesto non male ma per essere un cinque stelle dovrebbero cambiare alcune cose",3,2016,09,07
35,Vacanza Bimby 2016,"Sono stata in questo albergo per un viaggio con le mie colleghe .... Meraviglioso ....camere curatissime, servizio dell'hotel eccellente, colazione ricca e per tutti i gusti e una splendida piscina all'ottavo piano!!!",5,2016,09,04
35,Ci tornerei volentieri,"Passai un soggiorno di 15 giorni in questo splendido hotel. Meritate le 5 stelle. Servizio clienti, pulizia, servizio in camera. Offre un piccolo spazio per allenarsi e una piccola piscina all'aperto. L'hotel si trova esattamente sulla punta del porto e per andare nel centro della Barceloneta ci voglio 10/15 minuti a piedi. Ma ci si può spostare semplicemente in taxi poiché sono sempre presenti davanti all'hotel e costano veramente poco.",5,2016,09,03
35,Struttura di buon livello,"Siamo stati qualche giorno in questo hotel.
Sicuramente l'albergo è di alto livello (prezzi compresi!) ma ha anche qualche lacuna soprattutto nel livello di preparazione del personale (ricevimento concierge lounge bar ecc.)
La colazione presa in camera era veramente limitata soprattutto in relazione al prezzo. Abbiamo provveduto ad integrarla in maniera autonoma:-)
In compenso la stanza era molto bella, elegante e spaziosa e dotata di terrazza.
La posizione è sicuramente ottima vicino a tutte le attrazioni della zona del porto e anche alla Rambla.
Sicuramente la prossima volta che torneremo a Barcellona terremo in considerazione il Grand Marina

35,EXCELENTE HOTEL EN TODOS LOS ASPECTOS. REPETIREMOS!!!,"Nos alojamos en este hotel del 19 al 21 de agosto de 2016. Teníamos reservadas una habitación doble y una triple. Ambas excelentes tanto en tamaño como en comodidades. La primera noche, después de todo un día paseando por la ciudad, en la habitación triple había un olor muy desagradable(como si estuviera atascada). Bajamos a recepción a decirlo y a los dos minutos la chica del servicio de limpieza ya estaba arriba para echar ambientador a ver si podía solucionarse así. No fue el caso, y cuando lo volvimos a decir en recepción nos comentaron que estaban al 100% y era imposible cambiarnos de habitación hasta el día siguiente, teniendo que dormir toda la noche con la ventana abierta, soportando un calor bochornoso. Les pedí la hoja de reclamaciones, que me entregaron sin ninguna pega. A la mañana siguiente, cuando entregué la reclamación ya lo sabían los superiores y nos ofrecieron cambiar las dos habitaciones, pero no lo creímos necesario ya que la que estaba afectada sólo era la triple. Cuando volvimos esa tarde al hotel, el recepcionista nos entregó la llave de nuestra nueva habitación y nos comunicó que era la suite presidencial. Es la mejor habitación del hotel, con unos 90 metros y una terraza enorme con unas vistas del puerto y la ciudad excelentes. El trato en todo momento fue exquisito, por lo cual, decidimos no presentar la reclamación. Sin ninguna duda, repetiremos en este hotel y lo recomendaremos a todo aquel que viaje a Barcelona.",5,2016,08,24
35,c'è di meglio,"posizione abbastanza comoda!
nota MOLTO NEGATIVA IL PREZZO !!!

35,Un bellissimo hotel a Barcellona,"L'hotel ""Eurostars Grand Marina"" è veramente un bellissimo luogo per alloggiare se si è in soggiorno a Barcellona. Personalmente ho avuto modo di dormirci per qualche notte avendo trovato una stanza a prezzo molto scontato (premetto di aver dormito in una della camere meno lussuose). La vista non era delle migliori in quanto si vedeva il porto commerciale che - come si immagina - è spesso affollato, anche al mattino. Tuttavia la camera si è rivelata molto bella e all'altezza della situazione generale dell'hotel, con tutti i servizi possibili e immaginabili (inclusa una magica vasca idromassaggio!). In poche parole: sicuramente un ottimo hotel in cui alloggiare!

P.S.: appena arrivati ci hanno offerto un delizioso aperitivo di benvenuto!",4,2016,08,23

35,Non andateci e' terribile,"Salve, ho allogiato in questo hotel per 5 notti eravamo una coppia arrivati in camera ci siamo accorti che c'era un letto doppio e non matrimoniale come ci aspettavamo abbiamo chiesto in reception di poterlo modificare e ci hanno detto che l'ho avrebbero fatto invece alla fine non hanno fatto nulla per unirli abbiamo dormito 5 notti separatamente! L'indomani dopo una lunga giornata ritorniamo in hotel per riposare ed all 18.00 la camera non era stata ancora pulita siamo dovuti rimanere ad aspettare stanchi morti nella holl, ci hanno rimpiazzato l'acqua del frigobar con ben due bottigliette già aperte veramente orribile! La nostra camera era con vista si affacciava sul porto,bruttissima esperienza hanno attraccato in cinque giorni tre navi notte e giorno con i motori accesi non siamo riusciti a chiudere occhio, la piscina piccolissima per il numero di camere, pochi lettini non siamo riusciti a trovarne uno libero in tutta la vacanza, l'hotel ha un pessimo servizio taxi la sera,forse perché sono impegnati ad affittare e parcheggiare le proprie auto, alle 22.00  abbiamo aspettato 40 minuti prima di avere un taxi,la cassaforte della camera si bloccava continuamente dovendo chiamere sempre il tizio che veniva a sboccarla,ultima beffa abbiamo chiesto una spiaggia dove andare al ragazzo di colore che sta fuori al l'accoglienza la mattina  lui ridendo sotto i baffi ci ha mandato nella spiaggia dei nudisti  brutta esperienza per la mia fidanzata dopo mezz'ora abbiamo dovuto riprendere il taxi e tornare indietro giornata rovinata! Unica nota positiva i ragazzi della colazione e bar erano molto bravi. Abbiamo girato molti hotel a 5 stelle ma questo non ne merita nemmeno 3. ",1,2016,08,18
35,Habitación Suite excelente,"Nos dieron no sé porque la suite presidencial a muy buen precio y era magnífica, pero como siempre algunos defectos.  Jacuzzi no funciona el grifo de agua fria, grifo de bide roto.  Me hicieron una preautorización de tarjeta y luego el cobro de la estancia y todavia estoy esperando que me devuelvan el dinero de la tarjeta.  El trato excelente y el hotel fabuloso.  Yo recomendaria ofrezcan leche sin lactosa para los intolerantes.",4,2016,08,16
35,"Sentado, pensando, bebiendo","Alguna vez he escrito que las cosas más importantes de un hotel son el wifi, los enchufes en las mesillas y el piano-bar. (""Ñiñiñi lo importante es descansar bien"", calla soso, no me extraña que tu mujer te dejara por el monitor de pilates).

En este caso quiero incidir especialmente en el piano-bar. Yo llegaba de un viaje muy muy largo y estaba para poca mandanga. Apenas hice el check-in, dejé caer la maleta en la habitación, cogí mis papeles y me arrastré al bar del Marina.

Allí descubrí cómo de repente se paraba el tiempo, el camarero me traía un Spritz y unas almejas en hielo picado y yo ya no quería estar en ningún otro sitio nunca más. 

Del resto apenas me acuerdo. Creo que tomé un par de cócteles más (quizás cuatro) y que probé varios platos. Al día siguiente desperté fresco y feliz. Sin saber qué es lo que tenía que hacer, pero feliz.

Als ich am Nachmittag wieder kam habe ich die Karte erhalten, das Gepäck war im Zimmer und das Zimmer war der Hammer. Fühlte mich wie ein VIP hier.

Habe echt coole Tage gehabt obwohl ich alleine hier war. Kann das Hotel empfehlen.",4,2016,08,07
35,Barcelona ,"
El hotel está bien, pero nada del otro mundo. 
Tal vez se lo recomienda más para viaje de negocios y no tanto de turismo ya que se encuentra más alejado y es más difícil el tema transporte para llegar a la zona turística. El desayuno es muy completo y las habitaciones son súper cómodas y espaciosas.
 el restaurant no es bueno. Demora muchísimo y no vale la pena.

35,Buen hotel pero no lo recomiendo para turisml,"El hotel en sí es bueno. El personal es amable. Las habitaciones son amplias y buen decoradas. El desayuno es muy bueno, tiene mucha variedad. La vista del último piso es increíble, no se la pierdan.
La ubicación no es mala (queda en la zona del puerto) pero para mi gusto, no es cómodo para visitar Barcelona.Al rededor del hotel no hay negocios ni lugares para comer. Hay que caminar mínimo 7 min para llegar a la rambla del mar. Yo elegiría un hotel que este más en el centro.
Intentamos almorzar en el hotel antes de partir al aeropuerto pero tuvimos que cancelar el pedido por lo mucho que se demoraba (más de 30 min en traer 5 platos de fideos).",4,2016,08,06

35,Hotel de negocios ,"Es un hotel más bien corporativo no de turismo , está ubicado en el puerto ,en el world trade center, rodeado de oficinas .no tiene playa, y caminar hasta la rambla o la prolongación de la rambla aunque parece cercano se hace largo y pesado si estás decidido a conocer Barcelona a pie. La piscina está ubicada en un 8vo piso y es muy chica con vista al puerto. Las habitaciones son cómodas y el servicio es bueno. Si vienes a conocer o pasear por Barcelona no es la mejor opción.",3,2016,08,04
35,Vistas únicas,"Hotel de Lujo, pero más por sus vistas que por sus instalaciones. Par mi gusto ""muy frío"", lago desangelado. Pero la amabilidad del personal y las vistas compensan todo.

35,Perfecto para coger un crucero...,"Hotel grande con habitación muy espaciosa, cama cómoda, baño amplio, recibidor y hasta una terraza.

Ubicado en el propio puerto de cruceros, en el Word Trade Center, y al lado del Maremagnum, se me antoja con una ubicación ideal para disfrutar de la ciudad.

La Rambla y el centro están muy cerca.

La conexión wifi es buena y gratuita.

Tienen una recepción amplia y con una atención excelente.

Delante del hotel puedes dejar el coche un rato sin mayor problema y tienes taxi al lado.

Tiene una terraza donde puedes cenar de tapas a un precio razonable y un restaurante bastante más caro.

Con una buena oferta puede salir incluso más barato que un tres o cuatro estrellas.  Reservar a través de su web y después de valorar la estancia recibirás descuentos directos para próximas estancias.",5,2016,07,17

El desayuno es muy bueno, con multitud de productos, todos ellos de una calidad excepcional.
Personal muy amable y profesional.
Wifi gratuito y muy potente.
Parking de pago, 30 euros diarios.

35,Excelente hotel para viaje de negocios,"Muy moderno, con buena vista y cómodas instalaciones. El personal amabilísimo y atento. Pero su ubicación distaba mucho de lo que yo buscaba, dado que siempre viajo en pareja y en plan de pasear por las ciudades que quiero conocer. En este caso debí caminar bajo el sol de julio medio km. para llegar a la calle y otro tanto para volver al hotel. No es mi idea de buena ubicación.

Un gran acierto! Por cierto el servicio de coctelería es espectacular!",5,2016,07,12
35,Restauración pésima,"No he estado alojado en este hotel y mi opinión nada tiene que ver con las instalaciones. Lamentablemente lo que sí hice fue cenar. Se trataba de un banquete para 200 personas aproximadamente y la experiencia ha sido horrible. El salón no se corresponde con un 5* GL, ni mucho menos, recordaba la arquitectura y los salones sobrios y de mal  gusto de la antigua unión soviética. En cuanto a la comida lo mejor que puedo hacer para preservar mi salud física y mental es olvidarla y sentirme muy feliz pensando que jamás pondré mis pies en ese lugar. El servicio de comedor lento, torpe y muy poco profesional. El comentario más odio entre los asistentes era que nunca volverían.",1,2016,07,02

35,Mi aspettavo sinceramente di più,"Vacanza veloce familiare a Barcellona, ho prenotato questo albergo che mi sembrava ben ubicato e con camere di livello, in verità dal vivo non è così confortevole come sembra, anche l'ubicazione non è il massimo nel complesso comunque non male, colazione eccellente, stanze grandi ma non particolarmente gradevoli, nel  complesso discreta struttura.",3,2016,06,04
35,Un'albergo stellare,Siamo stati io e mio marito ad mese del matrimonio in una suite che ancora ricordo come un sogno ....grande 80mq....stupenda...con doccia e vasca idro da sogno...colazione internazionale per tutti i gusti e staff davvero accogliente e professionale...stupendo....spero di ritornaci per l'anniversario del mio matrimonio da sogno ❤️❤️❤️❤️,5,2016,06,04
35,Kurzer Urlaub aber wahnsinns Hotel,"Meine Frau und ich suchten ein tolles Hotel in Barcelona und haben das Grand Marina gebucht. Das Hotel ist sehr sauber und das Personal sehr zuvorkommend. Die Lage ist Top. Wir hatten das superior Zimmer gebucht und hatten nen hammer Ausblick in Richtung Hafen und die Stadt Barcelona. 
Zu Fuß ist die Innenstadt in paar Minuten zu erreichen. Die Taxifahrer stehen vor dem Hotel und können bei Bedarf herbeigerufen werden. Der Pool ist sehr sauber und die Gäste waren bei unserem Aufenthalt angenehm. Die Lautstärke der Schiffe bekommt man kaum mit. Ab und zu brummt mal ein Kreuzfahrtschiff aber das stört nicht. Das Personal des Hotels spricht perfekt englisch und hilft bei Problemen unverzüglich. Hatten nur ein kleines Problem mit dem Safe im Zimmer, jedoch wurde das in 5 Minuten behoben. 
Das berühmte Aquarium und der Strand ist direkt in der Nachbarschaft. Wir waren sehr begeistert und können diese negativen Bewertungen nicht verstehen. Werden defitnitv wieder das Grand Marina Hotel buchen. ",5,2016,06,03
35,verlängertes Pfingstwochenende,"Super Hotel in super Lage, schlicht ein Traum da morgens aufzuwachen und in Richtung Barcelona zu schauen. Wenn man Glück hat, liegt auch noch ein Kreuzfahrer direkt am Hotel. Besonders gut ist das Frühstücks-buffet, da bleibt kein Wunsch unerfüllt, das ist sonst so gar nicht die Domäne der Region....
Auf dem Dach ein toller Pool, mit Bar, natürlich kalt im Mai aber richtig gut. Wahnsinnsblick auf den Kreuzfahrtkai, unbezahlbar für die echte Fans.
Ansonsten ist das unbezahlbar auch irgendwie unbezahlbar, 400 Ocken pro Nacht, aber Pfingsten, was solls, einziges Manko, Du brauchst 20 Minuten, bis das Wasser in der Dusche warm wird....
Wenn das irgendwie geht, sende ich da noch ein paar Fotos hinterher, komme ich aber jetzt nicht ran, Apple und Microsoft sind ja bekanntlich nicht die Traum-Symbiose",4,2016,05,30
35,"Bello, strategico, 5 stelle .....","Doverosa la richiesta dei piani alti (sono 8) e la vista mare.
Reception esagerata, spaziosa con receptionists gentili e multilingue.
wifi perfettibile, ma c'è e gratis.
Camere ampie e spaziose. Balconcino fruibile. Un po' al risparmio le luci...anche in bagno. Bidet presente! Forse la classificazione di 5stelle GL è eccessiva, asciugamani croustillant...no accappatoi..amenities risicate...Comunque consigliato per la posizione. Camere silenziose.
Palestra pequena e SPA ....Chiusa( sab e dom?)con prezzi stellari.
Colazione internazionale con ampia scelta e varietà dolce e salato. Camerieri giovani , agili e molto disponibili.",4,2016,05,23
35,Desayunos impresionantes!,"Reservamos 2 días en una habitación superior con vistas al puerto. Cada día veíamos 1 o 2 barcos que llegaban nuevos. Estábamos rodeados de mar literalmente. 

La habitación limpia. Camas impresionantes y baño con hidromasaje.

Lo mejor los desayunos. Jamón ibérico, zumos, variedad de bollería, fruta. Y buena atención. Estupendo.

2 días con desayuno 450€ con un 25% de descuento. Es un 5 estrellas recuerda. 

Volveremos.

35,Una estancia increible,"Desde el primer segundo, la antencion fue exquisita. El personal de puerta me ayudo con las maletas, y el personal de recepcion, muy sonriente, fueron muy amables. Avise que venia a trabajar, y pasaria bastante tiempo en la habitacion, por lo tanto agradecia una habitacion con vistas. El equipo de Eurostars fue tan amable que me ofrecieron una habitacion increible con vistas panoramicas de Barcelona para mis 5 noches en el hotel. La habitacion era amplia y la cama muy comoda, aunque lo mejor era despertarse con los primeros rayos de sol y ver Barcelona amanecer. 

Soy original de Barcelona, pero mi estancia en Eurostars fue memorable y muy especial, ya que no habia visto la ciudad nunca desde ese angulo. Desde luego puedo decir que tengo nuevo hotel favorito en la ciudad, y nueva habitacion preferida, la 615 :)

Lo unico que puedo decir negativo es la calidad de los amenities en el bano. Que sean bolsitas de plastico que tengas que abrir no me parece a la altura de este hotel, aunque sinceramente no es algo que me preocupe mucho... 

Sin duda, volvere!",5,2016,05,13
35,"Ottimo hotel, anche se un po' caro","Il primo impatto con l'hotel non è stato fantastico, infatti l'insegna e la hall risultano spartane e poco attraenti. 
La camera però molto confortevole, bella e pulita con servizi di buona qualità, rapidi cortesi. Posizione ottima, vista splendida. 
Ristorazione non all'altezza (vedi recensioni su Aire de mar)",4,2016,05,05
35,Posizione strategica e ottimo servizio,"Ho soggiornato qui a metà dicembre con la mia famiglia. L'hotel è situato in posizione strategica, vicino al monumento di Cristoforo Colombo.
La struttura è nuova e pulita e ci sono parecchi servizi, tra cui palestra, sauna e piscina. 
Il personale della reception è stato molto professionale e gentile. Infine, ho trovato i prezzi molto buoni per la qualità offerta.
Consiglio vivamente questo hotel, difficile trovare di meglio in zona!",5,2016,04,13

35,Fuera del bullicio de la ciudad pero dentro de las maravillas de Barcelona,"Es un hotel que está ubicado en una de las penínsulas o orillas del mar, casi frente al ladeo las ramblas que se puede ir a pie, también a un costado del centro comercial maremagnum
La cercanía hacia el centro lo hace atractivo, sino, el taxi es una gran opción, estos siempre disponibles y aún precio razonable
Sobre el hotel las habitaciones de buen tamaño y muy cómodas
La atención excelente de todo el personal, desde la entrada a la salida

35,Todo un 10,"Era el regalo sorpresa para mi marido por su cumpleaños y la verdad es que al principio daba un poco de miedo ya que al llegar vimos dos autocares enormes y un montón de personas que estaban en reunión de empresa pero al llegar nos atendieron en seguida. Las habitaciones geniales, acogedoras y correctas. Es verdad que los amenitis son escasos pero cuando vas a un hotel sueles llevar tu cepillo de dientes y demas enseres de higiene personal. Las vistas espectaculares. Cuando llegas te ofrecen una copa de bienvenida y cuando llegas al bar restaurante el ambiente es genial música en directo de piano y amabilidad , el cóctel muy bueno. La verdad es que dimos una vuelta por todo el hotel y nos pareció todo muy cuidado y con encanto. Solo estuvimos una noche y cenamos y desayunamos fuera. Pero por ubicación y trato seguro que volvemos y esta vez intentaremos poder disfrutar de todo lo que el hotel nos pueda brindar. Solo puedo decir que de momento nos encantó.  Como única contra decir que pagamos un parquing para que el coche estuviera mas reguardado y se quedo aparcado en la calle delante de la puerta, creo que si es asi podría ser algo mas barato....",5,2016,02,06
35,Buen hotel en muy buen sitio,"El hotel es un 5 estrella, muy bien situado muy cerca de las Ramblas de Barcelona. Tiene muy cerca toda la zona deportiva y el Maremagnum. con todas las tiendas que comporta. el desayuno es bueno y bastante variado. La comida es algo más normal.
El servicio es muy bueno y están muy atento para lo que necesitas. Le falta para mi gusto un Spa y la piscine es muy pequeña",4,2016,01,30

35,MOLTO BELLO MA NON 5 STELLE!,"Location straordinaria, sul mare, a pochi passi dalle principali attrattive (Colon, Ramblas, Barceloneta) e a pochi passi dalla fermata del bus turistico che fa il giro della città. Hotel di livello ma non un vero e proprio 5 stelle.Personale di reception giovane e disponibile. 
Camera ampia con vista mare e vista sulla Città. Pulizia degli spazi comuni non eccellente, hall semplice.",4,2016,01,24
35,Top Hotel aber Preis Leistung?,"Wir haben einige Nächte im Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel verbracht und haben das großzügige Zimmer mit seiner schweren Einrichtung genossen. 

Ein besonderes Highlight dieses Hotels sind die Mitarbeiter, deren Service wir gerne mit 6 von 5 Sternen bewerten würden. Aufmerksam, zuvorkommend und zu mehr als 100% auf den Gast fokussiert! Einmalig! 

Das Hotel selber hat leider einige Defizite. (Zumindest aus unserer Sicht) 
Die schwere Ausstattung trägt maßgeblich zu einer recht gedrückten Atmosphäre bei. Die absolut phänomenale Dachterrasse mit einem unvergesslichen Ausblick auf Barcelona wird leider stark vernachlässigt. Der Kiosk passt nicht zum vornehmen Ambiente des Hauses. 

Das Hotel selber steht auf einem Kai direkt im Meer. 
Leider verleiht der davor gesetzte Bürokomplex den Außenanlagen eher einen Hinterhofcharakter und versperrt zu 100% die Sicht aufs Meer. 

Unser Fazit
Top Hotel in Top Lage mit den falschen Nachbarn.  - 1 Stern
Top Service der alleine das Preis / Leistungsverhältnis nicht rettet. - 1 Stern 

Für eine Geschäftsveranstaltung gerne, aber nicht noch mal für Urlaub. ",3,2016,01,19
35,Tolles Personal und großzügige Zimmer,"Das Eurostars-Hotel ist vom Preis her recht fair für ein 5-Sterne-Hotel in Barcelona. Es liegt direkt im Hafen, allerdings leicht abseits bei den Reiseschiffen. Man muß also immer ein bisschen laufen bis man an der Straße ist Man sieht zwar von den Zimmern aus das Meer, aber leider zur Innestadtseite hin. Dafür hat man einen schönen Blick auf die Stadt.
Die Zimmer sind schön groß und gut ausgestattet, allerdings war es teilweise ein bisschen laut. Die Nachbar konnte man die ganze Zeit hören. Das Personal war sehr freundlich. Das Hotel ist recht neumodisch, allerdings fehlt diesem ein bisschen Charme. Das Fitnesstudio ist schön groß und mit guten Geräten und Sauna ausgestattet.
Der Pool war im Winter leider nicht geöffnet. Das Restaurant bzw. Frühstück habe ich nicht besucht; hierzu kann ich wenig sagen. Vom Preis-/Leistungs-Verhältnis war es völlig zufriedenstellend.",4,2016,01,14
35,Hotel perfecto,Calidad precio inmmejorable. El personal muy atento. La habitacion muy acogedora con vistas a la ciudad. Y una ubicacion de lujo....el sitio perfecto para un fin de semana en Barcelona sin necesidad de coche.,2,2016,01,05
35,Capodanno last second,"Albergo di classe ma più vicino ad un 4* che ad un 5*S, alcune finiture della camera lasciavano a desiderare (vedi tavolino della TV e la TV stessa), i prodotti da bagno erano limitati nel numero e nella varieta'.",3,2016,01,04
35,UN HOTEL QUE TIENE CATEGORIA DE GRAN LUJO MERECIDAMENTE,"Situado cerca de la Plaza Colón es un perfecto ejemplo de lo que debería ser un establecimiento de máxima categoría. El trato es exquisito por parte de su personal, aunque algunos de ellos tenían dificultad en hablar español correctamente. Espacios amplísimos, trato esmerado, limpieza extrema, detalles elegantes y una habitación de ensueño. Disfrutamos de una Junior Suite en la séptima planta y es una experiencia maravillosa. Unas vistas impresionantes de la ciudad y el puerto, un baño precioso, una sala de estar cómoda y una habitación amplísima que te hace respirar lujo en todo momento. El desayuno era muy bueno, aunque nos sorprendió que los zumos ofrecidos no fueran naturales. Si tenemos que buscar algo negativo nos encontramos en que el proceso de entrada en el hotel fue muy lento. Las personas que estaban en recepción no eran suficientes para que nadie tuviera que esperar, a pesar de su profesionalidad y su maravilloso trato. Entendemos que un establecimiento catalogado como Gran Lujo, que también cobra tarifas en consonancia con la categoría, no puede permitirse hacer esperar de pie a sus clientes recién llegados durante diez o quince minutos para atenderles. Otro factor que mencionaría como negativo es que, a pesar de que parece que está pegado a Las Ramblas, el paseo que te lleva hasta la entrada del hotel es largo, sobre todo si vas con maletas. Tardas casi un cuarto de hora andando desde el final de Las Ramblas hasta la entrada del hotel.",5,2016,01,04
35,Buen hotel para alojarse,"He estado un par de semanas por motivos de trabajo y ha sido una buena opción.
Lo mejor de todo el desayuno. Bueno y muy variado.
Por lo demás cumple con lo que puedes esperar de un hotel de esa categoría y precio, a saber, habitaciones espaciosas, baño limpio, nuevo y completo, etc.",4,2015,12,31
35,Genial,"Un buen hotel a un fantástico precio. El servicio y la atención perfectas. La habitación simplemente genial. Si vuelvo a tener que alojarme en Barcelona volveré. El botones llamado Dimitri muy atento en todo momento.

Un piccolo wellness con terrazza a vista sulla città. Personale gentilissimo ed attento. Colazione ricchissima, in compagnia del presidente Rajoy.",5,2015,12,19
35,GRAN LUJO A PRECIO MUY COMPETITIVO,"Le regalé a mi mujer un fin de semana en este hotel para celebrar nuestro 25 aniversario de casados. Desde el minuto uno cuidaron hasta el último detalle. Nos dieron una habitación con vistas a la ciudad en la 6ª planta, mucho mejor que la en un principio había cogido. Solicité la cena gourmet en el restaurante del hotel y tuvimos una agradable sorpresa. Hay un restaurante muy pequeño y minimalista. La cena fue de degustación y estuvo a la altura del hotel. Las instalaciones son de lujo. Todo muy bien cuidado y con muchos detalles. El personal muy atento y amable. Te recogen el coche y te lo aparcan. Las recepcionista muy profesionales y simpáticas. El botones encantador...Les pedí a la dirección si me podían traer un ramo de flores y no hubo ningún inconveniente...El desayuno de lujo. En definitiva un hotel 10.-",5,2015,12,15
35,Spitzen Empfang,"Der Einfachheit halber fuhren wir einfach direkt vor den Hoteleingang, wo ein freundlicher Empfangschef sich um unser Auto kümmerte, ein Page brachte das Gepäck aufs Zimmer und wir konnten auch noch auswählen, ob wir ein Zimmer in den ruhigen Innenhof oder auf den - ab und an, wenn gerade ein Fährschiff an der Anlegestelle ist, eher lärmigen - Hafen und Stadt. Wir wählten das Zimmer mit Blick auf Stadt und Hafen und bereuen diese Entscheidung nicht. Der Blick ist wunderschön. Auch das Zimmer lies keine Wünsche offen und das Badezimmer mit Whirlpool und Duschkabine erst recht nicht. Bei einem nächsten Besuch in Barcelona werden wir wieder in diesem Hotel übernachten. Auf das Frühstück für 27.50 Euros allerdings werden wir zukünftig verzichten.

35,non un vero 5S,"le aspettative quando si pernotta in un hotel 5S in Europa devono essere altissime.
la location è ottima, sul porto turistico e ""nel"" mare.
I servizi di concierge sono nella norma - camere con una livello di manutenzione non buona (pezzi che si staccano, muffa attorno alla doccia, necessaire del bagno da tre stelle, no accappatoio, no cuffie)
La colazione è molto buona ma la sala ha capienza limitata e si assistono a vere e proprie resse, non quindi una atmosfera lounge da grande albergo di lusso.
il servizio alle camere è improvvisato nei comportamenti (alle 14 si sono presentati per riassettare la camera, invitati a ripassare due ore dopo hanno bussato tre volte nella mezz'ora seguente per vedere se la camera era accessibile....)
No piscina coperta.
Le tariffe sono interessanti ma, appunto, adeguate al servizio non 5S lusso
nel complesso direi negativo",2,2015,12,11
35,Demasiado caro para lo que es,"Esperábamos mucho más de un hotel 5 estrellas! Pagamos una barbaridad por 3 noches en temporada baja para lo que nos encontramos. No es que estuviera mal pero no es merecedor de 5 estrellas, ni mucho menos. Muy decepcionante... :(

La ubicación y el servicio bien pero el hall está para reformar y hay detalles de la habitación que también (pomo puerta suelto, mango ducha suelto, pocos amenities...). El primer día se les olvidó hacernos la habitación y tuvimos que esperar media hora en el bar tomando un café de precio desorbitado!",3,2015,12,06
35,EL RESTAURANTE UN HORROR Y CARÍSIMO,"El hotel en si estupendo, de bueno a muy bueno, nuevo, limpio. Terraza preciosa en la azotea. Muy céntrico, 200/300m de la Rambla, estatua de Colón, junto a la estación del  ferry de las islas baleares al CC del Muelle.
El restaurante pésimo. Mandamos a hacer más el cordero y la papas porque estaban crudos y las papas no las cocinaron más y la pierna aún tengo dudas.
Mi rape estaba seco y chicloso lo que nunca se me hubiera ocurrido en un rape.
Un desastre de cena y bastante cara. HORRIBLE!!!",4,2015,12,05
35,Viaje de relax en pareja,El hotel era de lujo una habitación amplia y limpia el servicio del hotel muy atento no se les pasaba detalle en la entrada del hotel muy atentos y el recibimiento de lujo comimos en el restaurante y comimos muy bien la verdad que me gusto mucho la estancia alli,5,2015,11,30
35,Excelente  hotel en sitio inmejorable,"El hotel esta en elpaseo marítimo  de puerto de Barcelona, rodeado de barcos y cruceros.

Hay una tetera  con tes,copas de vino,abridor,minibar completo, zapatillas  y lo que nos ha encantado que habían bombones en habitacion  y botellas de agua de bienvenida. 
La única inconveniencia  es que faltaban albornoces  y amenities de baño como pasta y cepillo dental (un hotel de 5* requiere esto). Desayuno muy muy completo. Sin duda volvería",5,2015,11,29
35,Muy buen trato,"Al hacer el check in nos hicieron un up grade a una habitación tipo suite con unas vistas preciosas.

35,"Bello , funzionale , ideale per affari","Parliamo di un albergo sicuramente molto ben organizzato . Posizione decisamente perfetta. Anche se un po defilata sei a pochi passi dal centro turistico della città, quale Barcelloneta oppure le ramblas. I locali o la città notturna della città e' un tantino distante. Se dovessi venire a Barcellona per vacanza sicuramente non verrei in questo albergo.non perché è brutto semplicemente non è il mio genere. Poi ripeto sei lì ma non sei lì non so se mi seguite. Servizio ottimo . Unica cosa secondo me è il cibo. Non è male assolutamente ma non da 5 star Extra Lusso. Bene in definitiva de venite per lavorare perfetto.",4,2015,11,02
35,NO ME GUSTO,"El hotel esta bien en general , esta bien todo pero falla justo la recepcion del cliente . Es imposible que un hotel de 5 estrellas cobre por adelantado a un cliente que reserva y deja su tarjeta de credito y ademas deja el coche en el establecimiento durante su estancia . Tambien deja todos sus datos como es natural . Que tiene que dejar un cliente en un hotel para pagar la cuenta en la salida .... no se , aparentemente en este hotel o cadena no se fian de uno dejando todos los datos posibles . Evidentemente pague por adelantado todo y les deje el coche en deposito , sin que ellos me pagaran nada por adelantado .
Pues bien quien no se fia no es de fiar y naturalmente no volvere al hotel.",3,2015,10,26

Perfecto, ellos se equivocan y soy yo el que tiene que ponerse a ""trabajar"".

Impresentable.",1,2015,09,28
35,Habitaciones mejorables,"Pasé mi aniversario de boda en el hotel y todo fue muy bien. El personal es muy atento y el servicio es excelente. Lo único que mejoraría son las habitaciones. EL diseño es anticuado, el cuarto de baño es oscuro y cuando te duchas sale toda el agua hacia fuera. Se convierte en una piscina. Los colchones podrían ser mas cómodos. A la TV se le tendría que actualizar la lista de canales ya que hay muchos que no se ven debido a la resintonización del TDT.

El desayuno es muy completo aunque para mi gusto le falta mas oferta en tema calientes salados. Un detalle bonito es que mientras desayunas hay música en directo.

Las vistas desde la terraza son muy bonitas y se pueden disfrutar mientras te tomas un coctel.",3,2015,09,21
35,Atencio y Amabilidad,"Destacar la amabilidad de todos los componentes del Hotel. Buenas habitaciones. Terraza en 8º piso para cenar con unas vistas maravillosas. Se halla en el puerto, para ir al centro hay que caminar un poquito.",4,2015,09,15
35,Tolle Lage und Top-Qualität ,"Auf der Durchreise von Mallorca her kommend (Fähre legt direkt vor dem Hotel an) übernachteten wir in diesem wahrlich erstklassigen Haus. Bereits der Empfang liess hohe Erwartungen aufkommen; wir waren mit dem Motorrad unterwegs und wurden herzlich willkommen geheissen. Dass wir unsere Maschinen auf dem VIP-Parkplatz (24h-Bewachung) abstellen durften war sehr überraschend. Check in sehr professionell und schnell. Dann ab in die ausserordentlich schönen Standardzimmer mit Blick auf den Hafen. Die Zimmer bieten in dieser angemessenen Preisklasse jede erdenkliche Ausstattung.
Will man die City von Barcelona besuchen gibts wohl keinen besseren Ausgangspunkt resp. Übernachtungsort. Vieles liegt in Gehdistanz und wenn man zurück ins Hotel kommt, empfängt einem die ruhige und ""isolierte"" Lage am Hafen. Für die An- resp. Weiterreise mit dem Schiff, Bus, Metro, Flugzeug oder eben mit dem privaten Fahrzeug liegt das Haus ideal! 
Frühstücken im Innenhof unter freiem Himmel war dann noch der krönende Abschluss. Herzliche Verabschiedung des Personals - wir kommen wieder!",5,2015,08,31

Seria de agradecer alguna variedad mas en cervezas (sólo tenían 4 tipos).

35,È' SEMPRE IL MIGLIORE,"Da anni quando veniamo a Barcellona soggiorniamo sempre in questo albergo. Quest'anno abbiamo constatato con piacere che la ricezione Wi Fi era perfetta anche in balcone. Per chi arriva con l'auto dal traghetto o lo deve prendere non esiste nessun altro albergo migliore di questo. Il garage o il parcheggio sono custoditi 24/24. La Rambla e il MareMagnum sono raggiungibili con una breve passeggiata. Le spiagge della Barceloneta 6.50 euro di taxi. Ci siamo fermati tre notti poi dopo 15 giorni in Costa Blanca avevamo il traghetto alle 23. Siamo arrivati alle 15 al Gr Marina e li abbiamo lasciato l'auto al custode e dopo una visita e una cena in centro alle 21 l'abbiamo ripresa per andare all'imbarco. Essendo clienti nessun pagamento ( naturalmente abbiamo dato la mancia). Per il resto valgono le mie recensioni precedenti. Unica nota: in camera c'è' il bollitore per te' e caffè', sarebbe bello avere una Nespresso.",5,2015,06,10
35,Fantastico,"Sono stato un weekend a Barcellona ; albergo straordinario in posizione perfetta (molto vicino alla rambla e alla spiaggia) , con tutto ciò che si possa desiderare a portata di mano.

35,Muy lindo ,"Hermoso hotel, buen tamaño de habitaciones y baño. Unas vistas espectaculares al puerto y al Mediterráneo. Buena atención en general, salvo el bar del piso 1. Y aparte de no atender bien, los precios totalmente desproporcionados. Y lo digo comparando con precios de bares de hoteles hasta mejores. El precio del chivas 18 mas caro que un buen Macallan. Debe ser un error. Le advertí a quien me atendió y me contesto que eso estaba. Len y que el no podía hacer nada. Una lastima. Ya que el hotel es hermoso y su ubicación y vistas privilegiadas. Muy buenas camas y cómodas. ",5,2015,05,20

Camera splendida molto spaziosa, pulita, con terrazza con vista sul porto. Personale molto gentile. Consiglio questo hotel, si trova in zona molto comoda per raggiungere in non più di 5 minuti a piedi La Rambla. ",5,2015,03,04
35,Excelencia en el trato. GRAN HOTEL,"En una ciudad grande y cosmopolita como BARCELONA encontrar un muy buen hotel es algo relativamente sencillo. Pero encontrar un hotel que, además de contar con todos los servicios que demande el viajero más exigente, cuente con un trato excelente y exquisito del personal, es algo que se convierte en muy complicado.
Pues bien, en el GRAND MARINA, confluyen (de sobra) ambas premisas.
El Hotel GRAN MARINA, como buen hotel de su categoría, cuenta con todo lo que el más exigente viajero puede solicitar. Destaco la extrema amabilidad del equipo humano, desde el portero de la puerta, pasando por el personal de recepción y haciendo mención especial del personal de hostelería. Todos forman parte de un equipo rigurosamente conjuntado para convertir tu estancia en algo placentero.
No comprendo las críticas que he leido sobre la carencia de cierto tipo de servicios como el ""room service"". Esto es absolutamente falso. 
La recepción en el salón amenizado con un piano, hacen del comienzo de la estancia algo prometedor.
Las habitaciones se encuentran equipadas con todos los detalles que se pueden pedir: bombones de cortesía, zapatillas, albornoz, todo tipo de amenities de aseo......
El desayuno es variado con productos frescos de calidad.
La ubicación es buenísia al lado de la afamada RAMBLA y muy bien comunicado. Perfecto para los viajeros que van de crucero al estar en pleno PORT VELL, al lado de la terminal de CRUCEROS.
En fin, un hotel a tener en cuenta para los viajes a Barcelona.
MUY RECOMENDABLE.",5,2015,03,01
35,"Bell'albergo, moderno e pulito","L'albergo è situato nel porto vicino all'acquario, alla stazione intermedia della teleferica. Bella struttura, molto grande; camere pulite e moderne, personale simpatico ed efficiente. Non è il mio tipo di albergo perché è molto poco spagnolo ed abbastanza anonimo ma perfetto per riunioni di lavoro. Non raccomando di pranzare o cenare in quanto la cucina è inutilmente ricercata ed internazionale, consiglio di andare in uno dei numerosi ristoranti nelle vicinanze. Ottima la colazione!",4,2015,02,26
35,Excelente elección en Barcelona,"Muy buen hotel. Las instalaciones de lujo. Hotel moderno, con una vista inmejorable.

35,Tolles Hotel in super Ausgangslage direkt am Hafen,"mein Aufenthalt ist schon eine eile her - aber ich empfand das Hotel als perfekten Ausgangspunkt für meinen Städtetrip in Barcelona

zu Fuß kann man direkt die Shopping Meile Barcelonas erkunden.

Das Hotel selber ist ausgezeichnet  - ich hatte damals allerdings wesentlich mehr bezahlt und daher ein Punkt Abzug

Top Lage , man konnte einige Fähren beim ablegen direkt vom Hotel beobachten und die Zimmer gefielen!",4,2015,02,03
35,"Schönes, grosszügiges Hotel mit Blick auf den Hafen","Dies war unser 2. Aufenthalt in diesem Hotel. Leider hatten wir diesmal nicht die Zeit für Unternehmungen, da es sich um einen reinen Geschäftstrip handelte. Die Zimmer sind sehr grosszügig gestaltet, das Frühstück ist sehr gut allesderings aus recht teuer.
Einzigster Schönheitsfehler. Wir mussten morgens um 5.00 Uhr mit dem Taxi zum Flughafen. Wir bestellten einen Wake-Up-Call für 4.30 und ein Taxi für 5.00 Uhr. Der Wake-Up-Call kam um 5.00. Gott sei Dank hatten wir unsere Handys noch gestellt sonst hätte uns die Zeit zum Flieger wohl nicht gereicht.",4,2015,01,26

35,Grand Hotel,Un excelente hotel amplio con todos los servicios de un hotel de 5 estrellas a precio de 3 estrellas. Perfecta Ubicación sino te gusta estar en medio de todo. Puedes caminar a las ramblas 5 minutos. Buenas camas y buen servicio. Todos en recepción son muy amables e intentan ayudar. Los Catalanes te van a decir que es lejos porque viven muy apretados pero es un excelente hotel.,5,2015,01,16
35,Espectacular,"Nos alojamos en una suite, el trato del hotel enpezando con los aparca coches es increíble (me gustaría que el hotel hiciera extensa esta opinión a ellos) gente educada y siempre con una sonrisa, servicios excelentes, la habitación estaba reformada, muy amplia, siempre es un placer ir a su hotel.",5,2015,01,13

Family Suite besteht aus zwei City Suite mit zwei Schlafzimmer, zwei Badzimmer, ein Wohnzimmer und ein Esszimmer. Sehr bequeme Betten, Obwohl am Hafen, sehr gut schallisoliert so dass man die Schiffe nicht hört. Das Frühstückbuffet lässt keine Wünsche offen, extrem vielfältig, mit zusätzlichen Tischservice.

Muy cerca además del monumento de Cristóbal Colón y donde inician Las Ramblas",5,2014,12,17
35,"estrellas a ""apuntalar""","Acabamos de desayunar en su buffet: variedad discreta de productos (alguna bollería no artesana), buena atención joven pero hemos pasado frío (salón demasiado alto y acristalado). Nuestros amigos han estado hospedados 2 noches, ella se ha quejado de varios temas: baño con sólo champú (no gel), ducha con graduación brusca de temperatura, frío en la habitación y hall del hotel. 
Nos ha gustado la exposición de fotografías sobre la ""Barcelona comercial"" con los finallistas del concurso online.
Lo mejor: el joven guardacoches de la entrada que nos ha sabido tratar muy bien.",3,2014,12,08
35,Am Hafen,"Dieses Hotel hat eine ideale Lage, um entweder die Altstadt ,nahe der Ramblas zu erkunden. Man ist aber auch in wenigen Gehminuten im Ausgehviertel Born oder Barceloneta. Für weitere Wege sind entweder die Metro Station gleichen Namens, oder die immer vorm Hotel stehenden Taxis zu empfehlen. Die Zimmer sind unterteilt in Wohn- und Schlafbereich und dadurch sehr großzügig. Von allen hat man eine schöne Sicht über den Hafen bzw. die Stadt. 
Die Rezeption und der Service sind dem Standard eine fünf Sterne Hotels entsprechend. Effektiv, schnell und diskret. Allerdings ist der Drang zum ""Tipp"" "" manchmal etwas störend.
Wenn man aber ,wie wir, gute Konditionen über die Hotelbuchungsseite erhält ist das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis unschlagbar gut.",4,2014,12,01
35,Tolles Hotel und erst der Ausblick!,"Das Hotel liegt direkt im/am Hafen und damit sehr zentral. Es bietet einen hervorragenden Ausgangspunkt für alle Unternehmungen! Der Service ist über die Maßen hilfsbereit und freundlich. Die Zimmer sind sehr groß und sehr sauber. Besonders hervorzuheben sind hier sicherlich das sehr große Badezimmer und die Möglichkeit sich morgens einen Kaffee zu kochen. Der Ausblick ist phänomenal- entweder auf die Stadt und/oder den Hafen. Ich persönlich liebe es, wenn große Fährschiffe direkt vor meiner Nase vorbeifahren. Das Preis- Leistungsverhältnis geht für ein Haus dieser Klasse auch völlig in Ordnung - allein das Frühstück haben wir nicht probiert, da hat tatsächlich der Preis abgeschreckt und es gibt in der Stadt ganz in der Nähe mannigfaltige Möglichkeiten. Zu erwähnen sind noch die schöne Bar, die zum Verweilen einlädt und die Dachterrasse mit Schwimmbad und einem traumhaften Rundumblick. Für mich die erste Wahl für Barcelona und damit eine ganz klare Buchungsempfehlung!",5,2014,11,23
35,Muy buena opcion,Aunque la localización puede no ser la mejor para muchos tiene accesos muy faciles de ubicar para cualquier punto principal se la ciudad.  La recepcion te da una gran atencion y te hace sentir muy bienvenido! Tomenlo en cuenta!!  ,5,2014,11,17
35,Empfehlung,"Das Hotel ist sehr gut gelegen, wenige Minuten zu Fuß zur Rambla. Ansonsten stehen immer Taxis unmittelbar vor dem Hotel.

Der Empfang und Service war sehr nett und aufmerksam, alles zur vollen Zufriedenheit.

Das Zimmer war sehr groß und sauber. Ganz gut war, dass im Zimmer Kaffee gekocht werden kann! Hervorheben möchte ich noch das Badezimmer, welches ebenfalls sehr groß und geräumig war! Das WC und die sehr große Dusche sind vom übrigen Bad getrennt. 

Dazu steht ein schöner Fitnessraum zur Verfügung. 

Alles in Allem eine Empfehlung! ",5,2014,11,17
35,La mia sistemazione preferita.,Quando vado a Barcellona scelgo sempre questo Hotel. Mi ci trovo benissimo sia per le camere con un bagno grande e la doccia enorme che per la gentilezza del personale. Piscina panoramica e posizione perfetta per arrivare anche a piedi sulle Ramblas. Buona la colazione. Mi sento come a casa.,5,2014,11,16
35,Excelente ubicación,"Nos hospedamos en este bonito hotel confiando en una buena vista de las habitaciones. La mayoría de las mismas de hecho dan al interior del palacio y no se ve el mar y eso es una lastima, ya que el hotel está casi en el medio del mar... La atención al cliente se podría mejorar, por suerte un chico de la recepción nos propuso la opción de descubrir Barcelona con un servicio del hotel que llaman vesping, fue una experiencia inolvidable y disfrutamos muchísimo de la ciudad.",5,2014,11,06
35,Bel Hotel in zona porto.,"Bel hotel situato nel porto della città ma a soli 5 min dalla statua di Colomno e dalle Ramblas. Purtroppo la vista è bella ma ci sono anche le navi che partono di notte e tengono i motori accesi fio alla partenza.. e si sentono. Bella hall..piscina minuscola e non certo accogliente. Bella sala fitness..prezzi delle bevande notevoli anche se notevole il servizio e la qualità.
Peccato che la stanza non fosse particolarmente pulita come ci si aspetterebbe da un hotel di questo genere.",4,2014,11,06
35,Buena vista al mar y salida del puerto,"Una buena ubicación para ver las salidas de regatas.
Hotel ubicado al final de las Ramblas, un tanto dentro del mar, hay que caminar 250 metros hasta el monumento a Colón,  pero con una vista desde la terraza sobre el puerto y sus barcos que te sumerge en la actividad de los cruceros turísticos que atracan a su vera, cada vez en mayor cantidad, hotel moderno y con todas las comodidades. Una de las noches en Barcelona deberías pasarla en este hotel o bien otro cercano a la zona",4,2014,10,31
35,Urbanes Sea-Feeling,"Der besondere USP des Eurostars Grand Marina ist sicher seine Lage, direkt am Zentrum  von Barcelona und doch (fast) mitten im Meer.  
Wer urbanes Feeling schätzt - und davon hat Barcelona wirklich viel und die enge vieler Hotels in innerstädtischen Lagen vermeiden möchte der hat mit dem Eurostars ein gute Wahl -auch wenn das Hotel von außen sehr wenig Flair hat (hat den Charakter einer Beton - Torte)
Hotel - Innen: guter 4-Stern Standard. Zimmer und Infrastruktur sauber und sehr großzügig (für spanische Verhältnisse). Sehr gute Betten.
Service - dem Standard entsprechend professionell. Auch ein sehr günstiger Flughafentransfer mit der Hoteleigenen Limo wird angeboten.
Frühstück - nimmst man am Besten in der nahen Altstadt ein - ist besser und günstiger.
Sehr schöner - wenn auch nicht übermäßiger großer Pool auf der Dachterrasse. Herrlicher Blick vom Pool über die Stadt. 
Summary: Preis - Leistungsverhältnis sehr gut - vor allem wenn z.B. 3/4 Nächte zum Preis von 2/3 Nächten angeboten werden.",4,2014,10,27
35,excelente ubicación mala atención,"Debia tomar un crucero y em hospede una noche allí, debí esperar 2 horas para que me dieran la habitación , y aunque la persona de recepción se porto muy mal , el manager de turno soluciono el problema y fue muy atento. El hotel se encuentra muy bien ubicado , cerca al muelle de cruceros y a la mayoría de las atracciones de barcelona. Caminando pude irse hasta las ramblas y restaurantes cercanos. Las habitaciones son cómodas y el hotel es moderno y limpio",4,2014,10,17
35,Buen hotel,"El hotel está muy bien. Las habitaciones son amplias, bien diseñadas y con mucho confort. El desayuno completo, bueno y variado. De poner alguna pega sería la mala calidad del wifi (es gratuito) y la falta de algunas ""ammenities"" como peine y acondicionador aparte (no dentro del mismo champú).
El servicio atento y excepcional. Si tienes posibilidad pide habitación con terraza.",4,2014,10,15
35,Buon Hotel - 5 stelle esagerate,"Prenotato con Booking con ottimo rapporto di qualità prezzo. Siamo andati in coppia ad Agosto dall'8 al 13. Pulitissimo. Posizione più che buona ma tenere in considerazione che, anche se è vero che è alla fine della rambla principale, c'è una grande piazza davanti da attraversare a piedi prima di arrivare alla prima fermata della metro e se ci sono 37 gradi sono problemi. E' vicina alla rambla del mar dove oltre ad esserci il solito via vai, c'è anche una sorta di centro commerciale dove si può anche mangiare con poco (attenzione...le tapas devono essere tante per riempire lo stomaco...). L'hotel - cinque stelle per me esagerate - è ""nel"" porto da dove partono i traghetti per le Baleari. Capita di vedere ragazzi giovanissimi svaccati in attesa del loro traghetto nei dintorni. L'hotel non è tutta la costruzione circolare che vedete nelle foto ma solo una parte di esso. La reception è sicuramente d'impatto e c'è personale che parla italiano (non che ci sia difficoltà con gli spagnoli...). In cima c'è una piscina. Frequentato da molti Arabi. Unico inconveniente risolto l'addebito di consumazioni di vodka.",3,2014,10,14
35,Solide Leistung,"Wir haben das Grand Marina gebucht, weil es an einem teuren Messewochenende ein gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis versprach.
Gute Lage, schöne Zimmer, WLAN inklusive. Kompetenter Zimmerservice und bestes Gym.

Allerdings ist die Lobby super hell, ungemütlich und auf ca 15 Grad runtergekühlt. Die Bar war an einem Freitag Abend leer und mit ca 200 qm absolut überdimensioniert. Das Frühstück für 27,50 Euro haben wir uns erspart, das gibt es überall besser.

Wir kommen wieder!",4,2014,10,13
35,Charmes und ohne Flair,"Das Hotel am Hafen ist ein markanter Bau und durch seine Lage eindrucksvoll. Tolle Aussicht auf die Stadt von einigen Zimmern und der Bar am Dach. Die Zimmer gut, die Betten perfekt. Trotzdem fehlt für ein Hotel dieser Kategorie der Charme und das Flair. Obwohl zentral gelegen muss man doch mindestens 20 Minuten gehen um in der Stadt zu sein.

35,Excelente!,"El hotel es muy lindo! La atención del personal es excelente, todos son muy amables y alegres siempre dispuestos a ayudar y hacer tu estancia espectacular! La vista es increíble ya que puedes ver la ciudad de Barcelona y disfrutar de la Marina. Ideal para viajeros que vayan a tomar un crucero ya que esta justo en el puerto de embarque. Muy buena ubicación aunque las caminatas son largas, se encuentra a pocas cuadras de las famosas Ramblas y al salir del hotel pasa el touristbus! La terraza junto a la alberca es muy bonita y tranquila. Por las noches hay música lounge y bar y podrán disfrutar de la ciudad iluminada, los cruceros que llegan o se van, es bellísima!!!",5,2014,09,29
35,"Gute Lage, aber...","Wir waren 4 Tage in der Grand Marina Suite und leider kann ich die Suite nicht weiterempfehlen. 
Der größte Kritikpunkt ist, dass die Fenster nicht schalldicht sind. Da man viele Fenster und eine nicht schließbare Balkontür hat, hört man natürlich das Wummern der lauten Motoren der Fähren und Kreuzfahrtschiffe. Steht der Wind dann auch noch schlecht, bekommt man die ganzen Abgase der Schiffe ab. Zu unserem Glück legten die Fähren um Mitternacht wieder ab...
Weitere Kritikpunkte sind:
- keine Espressomachine (in welcher Suite in einem 5 Sterne Hotel gibt es denn das noch?)
- kühler Empfang von der Rezeption

Positiv waren:
+ Lage
+ Concierge
+ Dachterrasse",3,2014,09,27

35,Standard da sogno.,"Terza volta per me in questo fantastico hotel situato sul porto di Barcellona. Una zona stupenda, a pochi minuti a piedi delle ""ramblas"". Alto standard, le camere sono una favola. Arredi moderni con grande cura dei dettagli. Al momento della prenotazione cercate di prendere le stanze che si affacciano direttamente sul porto. Dalla terrazza, situata all'ultimo piano si gode di una vista da sogno su Barcellona. La colazione? Da togliere il fiato.",4,2014,09,21
35,Super Lage und Frühstück,"Wir hatten ein schönes und sauberes Zweibett-Zimmer mit Meerblick. Das Frühstücksangebot war sehr gut und umfangreich. Zudem waren die Kellner sehr angenehm und umsichtig. Die Nähe zu den Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und dem Hafen ist wirklich top. Zum Strand haben wir jedoch ein Taxi genommen, da es bei den heißen Temperaturen zu Fuß schon eine weite Strecke ist. Der WLAN-Empfang war wirklich prima.
Leider war die Mitarbeiterin (wohl eher eine Praktikantin) beim Check-Out sehr unfreundlich.",4,2014,09,13
35,Gutes 5* Hotel in perfekter Lage,"Gutes Hotel mit sauberem Zimmer, leider hatten wir den Blick in den Innenhof, der aber auch ok war. Die Dachterasse ist besonders abends sehr zu empfehlen-man hat einen super Ausblick über ganz Barcelona! Cocktails allerdings auch hochpreisig.. Aufgrund der Lage ist alles super zu erreichen (Hafen, Ramblas, Hop on-Hop off Busse)!",4,2014,09,09
35,Excelente hotel,"No es la primera vez que he estado en este hotel. Y la verdad como siempre nunca defrauda en cuanto atención al cliente, tranquilidad y buen descanso.
El servicio es excelente. La habitación que había contratado muy buena, era una suite marina y la verdad es que muy acogedora y limpia.
Recomendable.",5,2014,09,01
35,Decepcionante!,"Los días 12 y 13 de agosto tuvimos a la familia del Sr. Mohamed Seeba alojados en su hotel, el Sr. Seeba iba acompañado de su mujer y dos hijas , una de ellas celebraba su cumpleaños y el chofer del Sr. Seeba entregó en recepción una tarta y dos regalos para dichas niñas, estas debían de entregarse esa noche en las habitaciones respectivas pues era fundamental por porte de nuestros clientes de Hong Kong hacerles llegar este detalle.
Lo sorprendente es que en recepción se olvidaran de llevar acabo esta sencilla tarea , y no solo eso, sino que al intentar recuperar dichos regalos estos estén aún hoy día 28 de agosto extraviados sin recibir ni explicaciones ni compensaciones por parte de su empresa.

Att. Viajes China-España.",1,2014,08,28
35,No me fue muy bien,"El hotel en general es bueno, yo no tuve una buena experiencia, tiene problemas con la limpieza de las habitaciones, por lo menos eso me paso a mi, había mucho olor a cigarrillo.
Les hace falta un poco de servicios al clientes / turistas .",3,2014,08,14
35,Gutes Hotel,"Das Hotel liegt direkt am Hafen, wo die grossen Passagier-Schiffe ankommen. Wir konnten von unserem Zimmer direkt in die Kabinen schauen. Leider war es im April 2013 regnerisch und wir konnten uns zu Fuss nur am ersten Tag bewegen. 
Das Hotel bietet alles, was das Herz bewegt. Zimmer sind toll, Frühstückbuffet sehr gross und für jeden etwas.",5,2014,08,04

Fila di taxi davanti l'albergo cosi come la fermata dei bus-giro citta'. La Rambla del mar, Maremagnum, Port Vell e Barceloneta raggiungibili a piedi in pochi minuti. Ragazze della Reception disponibili e operazioni in modo celere. All'ottavo piano bar e piscina piu' che sufficienti. Qualita'/prezzo ottimo, salvo frigo-bar e parrucchiere. Ristorante non provato. Praticissimo per prendere il traghetto per Genova. Terza volta che pernottiamo qui, sara' sempre il nostro albergo quando veniamo a Barcellona. Connessione WiFi perfetta in camera e atrio, incerta in salotto e balcone.",5,2014,07,21
35,Mi salvación!!,"Después de la peor experiencia por haber reservado en un lugar que al ir lo a conocer era un hostal no un hotel boutique, tuve la suerte de que me recomendaran este lugar, si bien es relativamente costoso, vale cada centavo! Es un lugar limpio, céntrico, con estilo, el personal de recepción es muy amable. Es un excelente lugar para pasar días agradables en Barcelona. Lo único malo desde mi punto de vista es que la piscina estaba fría, fuera de eso fue un gran lugar!  ",5,2014,07,12
35,2 giornia barcellona,"Ottima location, stand da 5 stelle, posizione ottima per le ramblas senza la confusione della fitta, a parte i traghetti ma per il resto ottimo albergo.
Personale gentilissimo colazione superba, prezzi nella norma di un 5 stelle, vista sulla fitta.
Sono stati due giorni all'insegna della gastronomia, quindi solo turismo gastronomico.
Unica pecca lo sciopero dei taxi che ha mandato in crisi tutto lo staff dell'albergo, incredibile per un 5 stelle, non avevano transfert privati per l'aeroporto.
Costruzione da alloggio business, pulitissima ma molto impersonale struttura gelida corridoi molto bui, ottimo per viaggio di lavoro, ma tutto sommato anche per il turismo.",4,2014,07,04
35,No era una habitación: ¡Era un piso!,"Al reservar (era una sorpresa para mi novia porque vimos un musical en el Paralel) elegí una opción de upgrade gratuito y a parte un paquete VIP.

Mi sorpresa (nuestra) llegó al ver que no era una habitación sino 3 estancias con puertas correderas, sí, d epelícula.

Al entrar el baño dividido en dos, y las puertas de espejo :D
Luego una habitación con una cama gigante (pega: eran dos camas gigantes sin unir, que hacían que fuera muy grande pero podrían estar unidas con cubrecamas o bajeras)

Y luego un salón con un ventanal brutal con vistas a la ciudad. ¿algo más?

Al llegar nos invitaron a una copa, el restaurante tiene techos altos y había un piano, estábamos solos y de pronto.... suena la música había llegado el pianista y se puso a tocar. Muy fetén, la verdad.

Otra peguita es que a la hora del checkin avisamos de hacer el checkout a las 14 y nos dijeron que sin problemas, pero a las13, cuando estábamos preparándonos para la ducha y recoger nos llamaron para decir que noas habíamos pasado con la hora, ... es decir, que no apuntaron bien lo del checkout. Pero por lo demás muy bien, los muchachos del restaurante muy amables...

De lujo.",5,2014,06,23
35,Comodo e moderno,"Ottimo hotel nel porto di Barcellona, che a volte puó essere un pò rumoroso in estate per via dei traghetti che arrivano e partono.
La cortesia lascia un pò a desiderare, dovuto saldare prima della partenza e per un 5 stelle non é il massimo e penso sia l'unico hotel di Barcellona dove si paga per lasciare l'auto parcheggiata fuori...
Piscina sul tetto molto piccola, anche se il panorama che si gode é fantastico.",4,2014,06,14
35,"Moderno, comodo","El hotel tiene unas habitaciones muy grandes, modernas y muy comodas, La ubicacion no es excelente pero es muy buena, en un lugar muy tranquilo (excepto cuando llega algun crucero). El desayuno es EXCELENTE, lo unico que hay que destacar entre las cosas malas es que la piscina es muy chica, no es al aire libre y esta siempre repleta.",4,2014,06,11
35,Davvero incantevole,Tutto bello tutto pulito e sopratutto molto cortesi il personale . Se ritorno a barcellona sicuramente torno al eurostar grand marina . Posto centralissimo vista mare . Hotel economico per un 5 stelle .top,5,2014,06,05
35,Hotel OK e posizione super,"Lo scorso Aprile ho passato una vacanza favolosa con mia moglie a Barcelona. Abbiamo scelto questo hotel per la posizione stupenda infatti dalla camera si vede tutta la città di Barcellona e si arriva molto presto alla rambla.
E' un Hotel per persone che vanno per lavoro e affari, ma ottimo anche per turisti.
L' Accoglienza è stata eccellente, il personale alla reception è gentilissimo e molto disponibile. Abbiamo avuto una stanza molto spaziosa, elegante, pulitissima e confortevole.
L'Hotel ha una palestra molto atrezzata, la piscina invece è piccola.
La colazione è cara, ma ottima e abbondante. Davanti all'Hotel ci sono fermate di  bus turistici , e taxi.
In sintesi lo consiglio sia per la posizione che per la comodità.",5,2014,05,13
35,Eccellente struttura,"Enorme! L'hotel, le stanze, i bagni, la cabina armadio....penso una delle stanza più grandi in cui ho mai soggiornato...davvero bello. Servizio di alto livello.
Posizione comoda, sul porto ma vicinissimo alla rambla...almeno mentre si dorme si è lontani dal caos di quella via!",5,2014,05,04
35,Gran Marina? Ok ragazzi avanti tutta,"Ho passato 3 notti a cavallo di Pasqua in questo stupendo hotel (all'ultimo piano) con la mia ragazza.
Posizione ottima alla fine della Rambla e di fianco alla Rambla Marittima (Mare Nostrum)...affacciato sul porto dove partono i traghetti x Ibiza...fermata della metro e rent biciclette nelle vicinanze.
Camere/letti/bagni super spaziosi e puliti...personale cortese e reattivo.
Ottima soluzione ed ottimo servizio.",5,2014,04,25
35,Hotel moderno,Situato nella zona del porto proprio sul mare;  comodo  per girare la città e vicino la rambla. Vicino alla rambla del mar dove c'è un centro commerciale dove poter anche mangiare.Stanze ampie e con ogni confort. Splendida terrazza all'ultimo piano e annessa palestra. Personale cordiale,4,2014,04,25

35,excelente fin de semana romántico!,"Estuvimos un fin de semana celebrando un aniversario de pareja y la elección del Grand Marina Hotel fue perfecta. Manuelle, el equipo de recepción y todo el personal tuvieron un trato exquisito con nosotros y nos proporcionaron un aniversario inolvidable! Las vistas que disfrutamos desde la habitación fueron únicas y pudimos disfrutar de atardecer y un amanecer increíbles. Y el desayuno por la mañana completísimo y cuidado al detalle.",5,2014,04,07
35,niemals 5 Stern wohl eher 3 Stern,"sehr schlechtes Hotel niemals 5 Sterne, schmutzige Zimmer (Schmutz wurde 5 Tage von der einen Ecke in die andere geschoben) das Zimmer stank nach kaltem Zigarettenrauch (lüften half da nicht) obwohl wir reklamierten wurde nichts unternommen. Der Safe funktionierte die halbe Zeit nicht! Ruhig ist es auf gar keinen Fall die Kreuzfahrtschiffe hört man sehr gut! Frühstück ist ok, es ist aber nicht nötig am Wochenende das Frühstück mit Flamenco Musik zu begleiten, dass man sein eigenes Wort nicht mehr versteht. Wir machen öfters Städte Reisen immer in 4-5 Sterne Hotel aber so etwas haben wir noch nie erlebt.",1,2014,03,23
35,Sehr gut!,"Ich darf meinem Vorredner widersprechen! Bei den losen Bodenplatten auf dem Balkon und dem Pool,mag er Recht haben. Empfang, Morgenessen, Zimmergrösse , Bett usw. Sind durchaus 5 Sterne wert. Wir sind sehr zufrieden! Meer ist jedoch nic",5,2014,03,09
35,Menos por más.,"De vez en cuando te apetece darte un capricho e ir a uno de los hoteles de lujos de tu ciudad.

Pero el lujo en este hotel es testimonial por grandeza, a lo pirámides egipcias. Luego se observan detalles de poco mantenimiento (muebles algo tocados), de poca limpieza (injustificable que en un hotel así las ventanas de la habitación estén sucias.

A los clientes no VIP, se nos nota, nos tratan diferente. Acaso pagamos menos?

Mala experiencia.",2,2014,03,06
35,Un hotel excelente,"La verdad es que en este hotel hay un trato excelente por parte de los trabajadores. Cuidan mucho a los clientes. Las habitaciones son espaciosas y muy limpias. 
El desayuno es muy variado y con una diversidad de opciones para elegir.",5,2014,03,02
35,ATENCION PERFECTA,"Va acorde a las estrellas que tiene, una atencion esmerada, una muy buena situación junto a la plaza de Colon y muy cerca de Las Ramblas, lo malo es que están de obras y hace feo al hotel.

El sueño es muy bueno, se descansa bastante bien y no hay ruidos que no te dejen dormir.

Un cinco estrellas del que no tengo nada más que aportar ni en lo malo ni en lo bueno, es correcto.",4,2014,03,01
35,Absteige der übelsten Art,"Schäbigste Absteige in der ich je war. 5 Sterne nur in Abzocke

Ich frage mich, welches Interesse Menschen haben, dieses Hotel positiv zu bewerten.
Wir sind im Jahr 1-2 mal in 5 Sternhotel zu einen Wochenendtrip. Sowas haben wir noch nie erlebt.
Grundsätzlich: Das Hotel ist nur ein sehr kleiner Bereich des World Trade Center mit Blickrichtung Stadt. Wo hier der Meerblick vom Zimmer herkommen soll ist mir schleierhaft.

Gebucht war Twin-Bett…. we kindly inform you that in order to guarantee 100% a sea view, we will recommend you to reserve our Grand Marina Suite.
Angekommen mussten wir kurz warten auf jemand der Englisch spricht. Von Deutsch nicht zu reden.
Obwohl bei der Buchung deutlich beschrieben dass die Bezahlung nach dem Aufenthalt zu leisten ist, sollte dies sofort bei der Ankunft geschehen.

Alarmiert wollte ich erst den „Best Rom“ im Hotel sehen.

Sowas habe ich noch nie !!! erlebt. Ein abgewrackter Raum. Die dunklen Böden aus Billig-Laminat zerkratzt, zerschrammt, teilweise Furnier herausgerissen. Geplatzte Fugen.
Zerkratzte Holzwände und Schränke.

Ein sehr lautes Wummern war zu hören. Das entpuppte sich als Schiffsmotor  was vor dem Fenster lag.
Twinn-Bett ?? Natürlich nicht. Kleines franz. Bett.

Es stank nach Abwasser.

Wir haben diese Zimmer abgelehnt.

So wurde ein anderes Zimmer gezeigt. Blick in den Hof. Böden zerkratzt, Fugen im Bad gerissen…
Ein anderes Zimmer war angeblich nicht frei obwohl in dieser Absteige wenige Leute waren.

Aber wenigstens eine vernünftige Bettengröße.

Hier stellten wir in der ersten Nacht fest, dass keine Heizung ging. Nach 3 Anrufen in denen nichts geschah die Mitteilung, musste immer im Hotel-PC ein Reset gemacht werden, dann ging sie wieder 10 Minuten. Nur Nachts hat das halt niemand gemacht.

Dann gab es ein neues Zimmer. Einen kleinen Raum mit direktem Blick auf die gegenüber liegende Haus-Wand der W.T.C.

Selbstverständlich die Böden zerkratzt, ebenso die Einrichtung.
Fliesen im Bad verschoben, Ablauf zerbrochen……
Die Dusche war ein Monstrum von Regendusche mit Seitendüsen, denen es leider an Wasserdruck gefehlt hat.
Eine kleine Handdusche war unten angebracht. Natürlich ohne Gestänge.
Das WC sehr eng.

Jedoch löste sich hier die Frage, warum das Personal im Speisesaal mit zerknitterten Blusen und Hemden herumläuft. In diesem Zimmer stand ein großes BÜGELBRETT!!!!! findet vermutlich keiner mehr.

Letztendlich war die zugesagte Suite mit traumhaftem Ausblick trotz mehrerer Bestätigung nicht verfügbar.

Noch erwähnenswert, in keinem Zimmer waren die Fenster abschließbar!!  Man konnte sie von außen öffnen ! Zimmer 3 –das mit Hauswandblick-Griff abgebrochen. Fotos folgen!

Brauchen die verkratzte kaputte Böden, mit riesen Schlitzen, verkratzte Wackeltische mit abgeschlagenen Kanten im Restaurant? Dann sind sie hier richtig!!

Sowas habe ich noch nie gesehen.

Aber der absolute Knaller war dazu das Frühstück. Das Personal in Knitterhemdchen war sehr bemüht.
Aber die kalten Rühreier, lederartigen Spiegeleier, Baconscheiben  mit erstaunlicher Zähigkeit, die mit dem Messer nicht zum schneiden waren, passten zum Gesamtbild.

Hat man bei Bäckern in der Stadt leckere Brotsorten gesehen, gab es hier nicht einmal Baquett.
Zur allgemeinen Stimmung  dann noch die Krankenhausabpackung für Marmelade, Butter…..
Dazu passt dann der Preis der zwischen 40 – 50.-€ für 2 Personen liegt. Frühstück !!!
Apropos Preise. Die Hotelbar passend zum Rest . Sie können gerne für einen kleinen Drink 15.-€ ausgeben oder ein Gläschen ! Cognac 72.-€
Die Preise der Minibar sind auch erstaunlich.
Kleines Wasser 4,50 €
0,2 Champagner 44.-€
Minifläschchen Wodka/Gin 9,50€
Kleinstmineralwasser 4,50€……..Liste liegt vor.

Kurzum, wir empfanden das freundliche Lächeln des Personals letztendlich, dass man uns ausgelacht hat.

Wir fühlen und ständig Belogen.
Keine Reservierungszusagen eingehalten.
Die Zimmer alle belegt obwohl das Internet anderes zeigt.
Der Champagner- empfang war billiger CAVA.
Jedem!!! im Hotel war die defekte Heizung bekannt.(Wird nach und nach ausgetauscht)
Keine Entschuldigung für den Zwangsumzug.
Die Informationen über Geschehen in der Stadt waren falsch.
Empfohlene Lokale stellten sich als Nepp heraus.  Man wollte uns gleich in ein Taxi dorthin verfrachten.
Dazu gibt es einen Schwarzen mit Zylinder (wers mag) der die Taxis her anpfeift..
Die Taxikosten beliefen sich zu unserem Ziel auf 18.-€,der gleiche Weg zurück 7.-€ Warum??. Machen sie sich selbst ihre Gedanken.
Nach dem 2. Mal sind wir zur Straße gelaufen und haben dort ein Taxi genommen.

Der Pool ist ein Witz und war nicht in Betrieb, mit Wellness hat das nichts zu tun.  5 Sterne  Lachnummer.

Spannend die wackelnden Bodenplatten. Ein eigenartiges Gefühl.

Letztendlich habe ich die Penner beneidet die auf den Bänken vor dem Hotel nächtigen.

Ein kleiner Tipp zum Schluss
Wenn sie aus der Cathedrale kommen ist rechts ein Eckkaffee. Morgens Gebäck, lecker Brote… was dann zu Mittag langsam in Tapas übergeht. Für den Preis des Frühstücks im Hotel können sie hier eine ganze Woche schlemmen. Cappuccino 2,20 €. Tee in Kanne 1,60 €.

Gegenüber das Hotel Colon. Schauen sie sichs mal an. Mitten im Geschehen!!

Nicht versäumen, vor der Cathedrale Sonntags ab ca.11.30 Uhr Tanz (Sardana).!!!!!

Zu guter Letzt, ein Mail von meinem Sohn kam angeblich nicht an. Auch nicht bei Wiederholung der Sendung. Erst auf massive Reklamation hat man gnädigerweise nachgesehen. 4 Seiten ausdrucken 14.-€

35,Wunderschönes Hotel ruhig gelegen am Yachthafen und doch zentral,"Bereits zum 2. Mal verbrachten wir ein verlängertes Wochenende in dem wunderschönen, ruhigen Hotel, das direkt am Meer liegt und nur ca. 10 Minuten zu Fuß von der berühmten Rambla entfernt. Vom Hotel aus hat man eine großartige Aussicht auf den Yachthafen, die Altstadt und die Kreuzfahrtschiffe, die z. T. hier ihren Anlegeplatz haben.
Wir hatten ein modern eingerichtetes Zimmer in der 7. Etage, sehr groß, sehr gepflegt und sauber, mit einem super Badezimmer mit Badewanne und seperater Dusche. 
Wir hatten den Aufenthalt direkt auf der Webseite des Hotels gebucht und dadurch war das Frühstück inbegriffen. Es erwartete uns ein super Frühstücksbuffet, das keine Wünsche offen ließ. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend.
Am Tag, bis in die Nacht können Sie auf der wunderschönen Außenterrasse köstliche Cocktails und kleine Speisen genießen. Ein idealer Abschluss nach einem herrlichen Abend.
Ein Hotel das ich nicht nur wegen der günstigen Lage sehr empfehlen kann.",5,2014,01,31
35,Un lujo,"El hotel es un verdadero lujo, nuestra habitación estaba en la planta 7 con una impresionante vista a la ciudad y el puerto deportivo, con un gran balcón,
la cama excelente y con un menú de almohadas muy variado, el baño completísimo, la situación es inmejorable, en pleno puerto y a pocos metros de las ramblas y el barrio Gótico, para repetir.",5,2014,01,27
35,Ottimo per business,"Se state cercando un hotel di alto livello, ben posizionato, per un viaggio di lavoro questa è una buona scelta.
Le camere sono molto grandi e la struttura moderna e dagli spazi molto grandi.
Di certo non troverete l'atmosfera caratteristica di un boutique hotel, ma se cercate la comodità è il posto giusto.",4,2014,01,22
35,Céntrico y recomendable,"Aunque la reserva era de una habitación doble estándar, nos dieron una habitación superior situada en la planta 8 y con estupendas vistas a la ciudad y al puerto. Todo un detalle. La habitación muy amplia, la cama muy cómoda, y el baño enorme. La bañera con Jacuzzi y otra ducha separada con columna de hidromasaje. El personal muy amable. A cinco minutos andando de las ramblas, la situación es muy buena. 
Como única pega, el precio excesivo del aparcamiento que era exterior y de casi 30 euros diarios. A tener en cuenta.",5,2014,01,21
35,Mi aspettavo di più,"Sono stato in questo albergo per lavoro, lo standard è buono ma mi aspettavo qualcosa di più, le camere sono un po' vecchie e un albergo di questo livello non può avere un bagno con solo la vasca senza possibilità di farsi una doccia. Buona la colazione al mattino, gentilissimo il personale. La posizione è strategica essendo propio davanti alle ramblas, però se ti affacci dalla camera vedi le navi mercantili che tolgono un po' di poesia",3,2014,01,18
35,Grandhotel am Hafen - ruhig und doch in 5 Min. Fußminuten: Las Ramblas,"Schon der Empfang im Hotel war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend, das Personal insgesamt aufmerksam und zuvorkommend.
Die Zimmer sind mehr als geräumig, es fehlt an nichts. Der Schlafkomfort war toll: riesige Betten mit großartigen Matrazen. Das Bad mit Whirlwanne und separater Dusche (Regenschauer und weitere Einstellungen) und Doppelwaschbecken war auch perfekt.
Wir haben uns rundum wohlgefühlt: im Zimmer, auf dem Balkon, in der Hotelbar etc.
Die Dachterrasse lädt übrigens auch im Winter zu einem Besuch ein (der Pool wird im Winter nicht betrieben) denn man hat einen tollen Blick auf die Stadt!
Die Hotellage ist super, wenn man nicht gerne mitten im Trubel wohnen möchte, es sind lediglich 5 Fußminuten bis zum Las Ramblas und der Marina Port Vell. Man kann gut mit offenem Fenster schlafen und wird allenfalls von den Möwen geweckt. Ein perfekter Kurzurlaub!",5,2014,01,15
35,Da consigliare,"Sono stato in questa struttura con la mia famiglia,dal 30/12 al3/1,sinceramente prima di arrivare ero molto preoccupato da alcune recensioni negative,anche xché' ho prenotato la camera con booking via internet,invece devo dire che al nostro arrivo siamo rimasti entusiasti della struttura,delle camere,della colazione molto abbondante e della veduta straordinaria che potevamo ammirare dalla nostra camera.si magari non rispecchia del tutto un 5 stelle g.l.,ma un 4 stelle abbondanti ,sicuramente.oltre tutto la struttura si trova a 3 min. dalla rambla,cuore pulsante di barcellona.
Se dovessi consigliarlo ad un amico lo farei di certo.",5,2014,01,04
35,Camere stupende,"Ho soggiornato più volte a questo hotel. Ottimo per la posizione, a pochi passi da inizio a rambla, poi comodo per parcheggio auto, poi vicino ai ristorantini del porto.
Ma soprattutto ha carme stupende e grandi e pulitissime e modernamente arredate... Una favola!",5,2013,12,27
35,Dal mare vedere Barcellona,"Siamo stati tre notti per visitare la città, splendida, per cui abbiamo scelto questo hotel per la posizione. In fondo ad un molo dalle finestre della camera vedi Barcellona. Ottima accoglienza, ci ha dato una stanza molto buona. Unica pecca la colazione troppo cara per quello il mio giudizio non è eccellente. Fermata bus turistici , ottimo servizio alta frequenza, fronte albergo.",4,2013,12,25
35,Caminando al puerto.,"La ubicacion del hotel respecto al puerto es perfecta! Podes caminar hasta el barco. Para ir a otro lugar esta alejado. Las habitaciones y el baño son enormes y muy lindos. El gimnasio y la pileta descubierta pequeños pero con linda vista. El desayuno no lo se porque no estaba incluido. El servicio de wifi no era muy ""veloz"". Muy recomendable para las noches de pre y post crucero.",4,2013,12,17
35,Beste Matratze an der ich je horchen durfte ...,"meine Freundin und ich haben noch nie so gut geschlafen wie im tollen Doppelbett im Grand Marina in Barcelona. Die Matratze ist ein Traum!
Dazu kommt das das Grand Marina das wohl beste Frühstücksbuffet von ganz Barcelona hat!
Wir hatten eine City Suite, diese wäre geräumig mit einem Manko, ein großer runder Tisch mit 4 Stühlen, statt einer Couch … aber alles andere war perfekt.",5,2013,12,15
35,"Un po' defilato, ma vicino al centro","Un grande albergo internazionale, con tutti i comfort che ci si aspetta. Insomma, forse 5 stelle non gliele avrei date: ma quattro se le merita tutte. Sul mare, ai piedi delle Ramblas, abbastanza vicino per raggiungerle a piedi e abbastanza lontano per essere fuori dal caos.",3,2013,12,15
35,No es un 5 estrellas para nada,"Hemos estado una noche en el hotel, puedo aseguraros que es la imagen más lujosa que he tenido durante toda la estancia fue tan solo al llegar, un desplegable de coches de lujo aparcados en la puerta del hotel. Una vez dentro, nada de lujo, un hotel correcto, nada más. La moqueta del pasillo a las habitaciones llena de manchas. ( planta 4), la habitación: el suelo de madera desencajado y levantado, las dimensiones suficientes pero insuficientes para un hotel 5 estrellas, debo decir que la cama era muy comoda, el baño correcto, la tv minuscula. La otra sorpresa poco grata ha sido al hacer el check out, una factura de más de 30 euros por tener el coche aparcado al aire libre durante la noche( sin haber avisado antes) ni del coste ni del lugar del aparcamiento. Ningun detalle en la habitación. Lo mejor la amabilidad del personal. Quizas sea muy dura pero este no es un hotel 5 estrellas, de 4 quizas si.",2,2013,12,08
35,Lujo,"Habitaciones amplias limpias con todas la comodidades,
El personal correctisimo, siempre sonriente y cordial
hubicacion centrica al lado del puerto y la rambla
solo mejorar la senal de wifi y sera todo perfecto
muy buen hotel",4,2013,12,07
35,Muy buen hotel con mala cobertura wifi,"El hotel es perfecto en lo que se refiere a las habitaciones, el desayuno y la ammenities. La situación es muy buena pero es muy malo si se quiere trabajar. Aunque la cobertura wifi está incluida en el precio, ésta es muy mala habiendo momentos en que deja de haber durante bastante tiempo. Harían falta una mayor cantidad de enchufes, a la vista, para poder conectar tanto el portátil como el móvil.",3,2013,11,17
35,davvero bello!,indubbiamente il tempo favorevole ha contribuito a farmi apprezzare particolarmente questo hotel: domenica pomeriggio 30 gradi! tutto perfetto! colazione in un locale soleggiato e ben esposto al primo piano. location panoramica.,5,2013,10,31
35,In realtà un 4 stelle scarsino...,"Una settimana x lavoro, camere grandi con stile un po' retro, ma nulla a che vedere con un 5 stelle gran lusso, nemmeno gli assomiglia. Prima notte sono finito in una camera dove l'odore di chiuso e polvere la faceva da padrona, ma quando ho iniziato a sentire il pianoforte come se fosse ai piedi del letto e sentivo un tizio che dalla stanza accanto russava come se fosse nel mio letto sono sceso in reception ed ho chiesto di cambiare camera. Hotel pieno se ne è riparlato il giorno dopo. Camera al 6 piano... Entro, vado per aprire il guardaroba e mi rimane la maniglia in mano, presa di corrente in bagno scassata e idromassaggio con muffa nera... L'ho fatto partire e l'acqua si è colorata di scuro... Le foto parlano da sole. Se fosse un 3 stelle da 50 euro soprassederei, ma onestamente fregiarsi di 5 stelle gran lusso e' fuori luogo. Palestra technogym naturalmente gli attrezzi sono un po' scassati... Forse 10 anni fa era davvero stellato, ora decisamente avrebbe bisogno di un bel restauro.",2,2013,10,18
35,Uno schifo di Internet,"Semplicemente, appena c'è un po' di richiesta, Internet non funziona. Da evitare, se capita anche di dover lavorare o semplicemente aver bisogno di consultare la rete durante il soggiorno. Se poi si è ancora fermi all'era della televisione, si può anche farsi incantare dai marmi nel bagno e dai groom all'ingresso. Ma se serve Internet questo è un indirizzo da dimenticare. Il mio voto è zero assoluto.",1,2013,10,15
35,Soggiorno Barcellona,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo albergo 3 notti. Diciamo che non rispecchia un nostro 5 stelle, le camere sono spaziose e pulite e la colazione è molto ben curata e ben fornita. L'entrata dell'albergo è molto spaziosa e allo stesso tempo vuota. La posizione non è centralissima. Il personale sia alla reception che in sala si è dimostrato gentile e sempre disponibile. Nel complesso il giudizio è buono.",4,2013,10,07
35,Eccellente,"Struttura hotel eccellente accurato nei dettagli sia nelle camere che nella hall, receptionist cortesi sopratutto la sig.rina Laura receptionist serale, molto ma molto gentile, la colazione internazionale buonissima, siamo stati benissimo sicuramente da ripetere grazie a tutto lo staff dell'Hotel Eurostar Monumental in via concell de cent 498, vicino sagrada famiglia, saluto tutti loro per la loro cortesia per il nostro soggiorno a Barcellona... Raffaella e Francesco Nuzzo.",5,2013,10,01
35,qualità e cortesia,"Posizione tranquilla pur essendo praticamente nel porto, da rivedere sicuramente l'ingresso spoglio ed insignificante, certamente la struttura non aiuta....Pur non essendo un gran 5 stelle
devo dire che il personale sopperisce alle mancanze dell'hotel  con cortesia e professionalità.
Le camere di buon livello unico neo la doccia buia , l'architetto poteva inserire un faretto nel soffitto . Sicuramente da consigliare",4,2013,09,25
35,Camera con vista porto,"Abbiamo passato due notti in questo hotel sul porto di Barcellona. Appena arrivati attorno alle 01.00 siamo stati accolti con gentilezza e professionalità e ci è stato offerto un drink presso il lounge bar con divanetti bianchi fra alberi di limone e luci scenografiche. Grazie al profumo dei fiori, la notte stellata e l'atmosfera tranquilla io e la mia ragazza ci siamo davvero rilassati dopo un viaggio abbastanza stressante causa ritardi aerei. Hotel con belle camere moderne e pulite vista porto (é stata un'esperienza fuori dal comune avere i traghetti e le navi da crociera appena adiacenti). Buona posizione a 5 min dalla Rambla de Mar e dalla Colonna di Colombo. All'8 piano c'è una bellissima terrazza che offre una veduta spettacolare su tutta la città. Prezzi da 5 stelle proporzionati al tipo di servizio offerto. Altra esperienza fuori dal comune è stato il trasferimento in aeroporto con Mercedes classe C e chauffeur dell'hotel a tariffa fissa (29€)... Hotel consigliatissimo!!! ",4,2013,09,16
35,Un hotel magnífico,"Buenas tardes. Quisiera dar mi opinión sobre el hotel Gran Marina de Barcelona. La verdad es que es un excelente hotel, muy bien situado, a cinco minutos de la Ramblas. La ubicación perfecta. 
El trato del personal es maravilloso. Todas las personas que trabajan allí te hacen sentir muy bien y con un trato maravilloso. Valoro muy positivamente el trato recibido. 
Un hotel muy limpio, ideal para descansar y para relajarse. 
El desayuno con un buffet con una gran variedad de platos a escoger. Y el personal tiene mucha atención al cliente.",5,2013,09,05
35,Ottimo,"La posizione è ottima, nel senso che si trova a due passi dal centro. Lo consiglierei agli amanti degli ambienti portuali, in quanto vi troverete senza mezzi termini all'interno del porto. Vedrete i traghetti fare le manovre davanti alle vostre camere. Ottimo il servizio in camera, preciso e puntuale. Servono piatti freddi e caldi tutto il gioro, a tutte le ore. La colazione è il momento migliore. Vastissima scelta tra dolce e salato. Solitamente non è compresa nel prezzo della camera. Infatti, addebitano euro 25,00 a persona. Forse un pò alto, ma comunque lo merita. La stanza offriva un balcone con vista sulla città e la funivia. Come anche parte del porto. Pulita e silenziosa. Arredi moderni. In nostra assenza il personale passava più volte per rassettare. Se siete in auto avrete la possibilità di lasciarla davanti all'ingresso. Ma attenzione che è a pagamento, ovvero euro 25,00.

Pregi: posizione, cordialità, servizio in camera, parcheggio, colazione.

Difetti:

 - sala colazione rumorosissima (un andirivieni continuo di camerieri che corrono come pazzi);

- forte presenza di turisti del medio oriente (Qatar, Emirati Arabi, Arabia) e russi. Questi ultimi poco piacevoli alla vista.

- la piscina sita sulla terrazza all'ultimo piano è troppo piccola.

Ad ogni modo, ci tornerei.",5,2013,09,05

35,Posizione unica,"Abbiamo soggornato all'Eurostars Gran Marina per tre notti. L'albergo ha una posizione incredibile: ala termine di uno dei moli del porto. Tanto che lo si confonde, arrivando, con uno dei terminal. In tre minuti a piedi sei alla Rambla e quindi in centro città. Da qui non servono taxi, metro o altro. Basta passeggiare! Albergo pulito ma non con servizi da 5 stelle italiani. Camera spaziosa, bagno pure. Piscina inesistente.... Una pozza all'ultimo piano! Palestra ok. Insomma: se lo usi per dormire, per la colazione scendi sotto , gira a destra o sinistra e trovi 4 bar....., è perfetto. Dovessi tornare a Barcellona tornerei qui.",4,2013,08,24

35,Decisamente non buono,"Ho soggiornato nei giorni scorsi in questo hotel , pensando di trovare la stessa organizzazione ed efficienza che normalmente trovo al Rey Juan Carlos I , dove abitualmente soggiorno a Barcellona.
Purtroppo , ora lo devo dire , il Rey Juan Carlos I  era al completo e ho ripiegato su questa struttura che pareva presentasse caratteristiche similari .
Come inizio , appena arrivati alla reception siamo stati accolti da un puzza di fogna incredibile , che gli addetti con sufficienza hanno addebitato al Porto , ma fuori la puzza non si sentiva .
La camera che ci è stata upgradata come da condizioni di prenotazione e che quindi doveva essere per lo meno di qualità superiore , era un lungo corridoio , con armadio walk-in e bagno senza doccia , ed un ambiente in fondo al corridoio dove c'era il letto . Mi chiedo come siano le camere di più basso livello .
Il personale della piscina si è dimostrato maleducato , quando ho protestato per non voler firmare un voucher senza indicazione del prezzo della spesa che mi andavano ad addebitare .
Sicuramente non scegliererò più questo hotel , che tra l'altro è anche più caro dell'altro",2,2013,07,15
35,Top Lage,"Wir hatten ein ruhiges Zimmer zum Innenhof,leider klemmte die Schiebetür zum Badezimmer
und wurde auch nicht gerichtet.Der bewusst gebuchte Pool wurde gerade umgebaut und dient bei seiner Größe wohl auch sonst nur zu Dekozwecken.Das Personal an der Rezeption war sehr unpersönlich. Das Hotel sticht durch seine Lage und das sehr gute Frühstück heraus,diese Punkte berechtigen aber weder den Preis noch die 5 Sterne",3,2013,07,03
35,Un gran hotel dentro del mar con una gran restauración,"He tenido la suerte de poder ir a un festejo en la planta 8 del hotel, la terraza, el recinto es muy cómodo y con unas vista inmejorables, pero lo que mas me ha sorprendido ha sido la restauración, gran calidad de géneros mucha imaginación en los platos.",4,2013,06,28

Para ser un 5* GL, le faltan toda clase de atenciones en el baño ( albornoces, body milk, peine, esponja, en fin mil articulos que no cuestan apenas nada y agradeces, pero por no poner no te ponen ni cepillo de dientes!!! hasta los de 3* te lo regalan!!

35,Un buon albergo,"Siamo stati in questo albergo per 4 gg. Ci è stato consigliato dalla nostra agenzia di viaggio. L' albergo e' nella zona del porto. Dista circa 10 min a piedi dalla fermata della metro Drassanes. Praticamente attaccato alla statua di Colombo. La nostra camera aveva la vista sulla città. Era molto spaziosa: c' era una cabina armadio, un bagno molto grande con vasca idromassaggio e doccia veramente grande. Nonostante fossimo in tre in camera era spaziosa. Nonostante la vicinanza con il porto non siamo stati disturbati dal rumore di navi e traghetti, che oltretutto è' anche bello vedere arrivare in porto. Colazione fantastica: frutta fresca, brioches, succhi, spremuta, uova in tutte le salse, affettati. In genere noi facevamo una bella colazione e pranzo leggero. L' albergo all' ottavo piano e' dotato di una palestra con jacuzzi. Da provare. C'è anche il solarium con piscina. La vista da lassù e' davvero fantastica. Il personale lo abbiamo trovato cordiale e gentile. Insomma se dovessimo tornare a Barcellona torneremmo in questo albergo. Dopo una giornata in giro per la città a noi ha fatto piacere trovare un ambiente confortevole dove poterci rilassare. Consigliato.",4,2013,06,15
35,Modernes Hotel in genialer Lage,"Das moderene Hotel besticht durch die hervorragende Lage in Barcelona. Vorne Blick auf die Statue Christoph Columbus und nach hinten Blick aufs Meer und die Kreuzfahrtschiffe die einfahren. Bei den Zimmern nach hinten mindestens den 5. Stock buchen, da sie ansonsten auf ein Bürogebäude blicken. nach vorne ist ab dem 3. Stock zu empfehlen. Der Personal ist sehr freundlich. Die Zimmer modern und angenehm groß. Die Zimmer werden eher spät gereinigt. Der Pool am Dach ist eher klein, aber die Liegen ausreichend und von guter Qualität. Die Nebenkosten sind sehr übertrieben. Frühstück (mit lauter Livemusik) um 27,5 und abends an der bar ein Bier (0,33 und eher warm) 7 Euro. In den Ramblas iost mach nach wenigen Minuten genau so wie beim Hafen. Der Hopp on hopp off Bus bleibt direkt vor dem Hotel stehen! In Summe 5 schöne Tage in diesem Hotel",5,2013,06,14
35,"Super Hotel, leider der Preis und die Gäste ein wenig übertrieben..","Barcelona ist eine Reise wert. So bezogen wir das teure 5 Sternehotel für 5 Nächte. Die Zimmer sind sauber, aber leider kommt die Reinigung erst am Abend, so gegen 17.00 Uhr. Die Hotelbar ist sehr teuer. Der Pool ist klein, nicht beheizt und mit Wellness hat das nichts zu tun. Mit 5 Sterne hat das nicht viel zutun so wie in anderen Ländern. Das Personal war sehr freundlich, nur leider kann man im Infocenter zum Online-Buchen der Flüge niemanden finden. Das Frühstück ist gewaltig und die Speisen sind sehr frisch. Die Lage ist perfekt für eine Städtereise, man findet alles auf engsten Raum. Erwähnenswert ist sicher die Kulisse und der Hafen. Die Taxis sind sehr billig in Barcelona",4,2013,06,03
35,Vista splendida ottima posizione,"Situato dentro il bel palazzo a forma di nave del World Trade Center, l'hotel mantiene ciò che promette: ottimi arredi, camere grandi e spaziose, ambiente silenzioso e ovattato, personale di grande professionalità. La posizione è defilata e centrale al contempo e la vista è splendida, affacciata direttamente sul mare con lo sfondo della collina del Tibidabo.Il pullmann per il tour della città ferma di fronte all'hotel e per chi non volesse fruire del ristorante interno può recarsi al vicino centro commerciale Mare Magnum in cui si trovano diversi bar e ristoranti. Avendovi soggiornato nel periodo invernale non ho visitato il solarium.",4,2013,06,03
35,"Buen hotel, buena ubicación","Tiene una gran ubicación en el puerto de Barcelona, a 5 min andando de la plaza de Colón, de las Ramblas y del Maremagnum. Es muy tranquilo, ya que esta rodeado del puerto, a diferencia de hospedarse en el centro de la ciudad, con el follón que eso implica.
Grandes habitaciones de lujo , acorde con sus 5 estrellas. Baños completos. Quizá deberían mejorar el servicio de bar y restaurante. Tienen mucho personal en cocina y camareros y las cosas no salen ni a tiros. 
Es un hotel perfecto para coger un crucero en el puerto.",4,2013,05,31
35,5 Sterne Preise,"Nach der Kreuzfahrt buchte ich dieses Hotel, damit wir nicht noch durch die halbe Stadt fahren mussten. Ich habe frühzeitig ein Romantik-Arrangement (Sekt mit Schoko-Erdbeeren auf dem Zimmer) gebucht. Leider waren die Zimmer um 15:00 nicht bezugsbereit. Das Rezeptions-Personal war sehr genervt und man hies uns nicht willkommen. Als Entschädigung wurde 1 Bon für 2 Cava überreicht (was sowieso im Arrangement inkludiert war). Nach weiteren 45 Minuten haben wir betr. dem Zimmerbezug nachgefragt - da klappte es endlich und wir erhielten ein Upgrade. Diese City Suite lag direkt neben dem Anlegesteg (auch für Fähren) - somit war an einen ruhigen Schlaf nicht zu denken.
Nach dem Abendessen warteten wir 15 Minuten auf eine Bedienung an der Bar (die Preise sind teurer als im 5* in der Schweiz!) - schlussendlich genossen wir einen Drink aus der Minibar in der Suite (schön und grosszügig eingerichtet). Der Frühstücksbereich war um 09:30 überfüllt und man musste auf einen freien Tisch warten. Die Qualität der Speisen war gut und abwechslungsreich. Der Check-Out schlussendlich wieder sehr unfreundlich.
Leider war auch der Poolbereich noch nicht offen (im vorher besuchten Hotel war dieser geöffnet) und der Spa-Bereich besteht aus einem Jacuzzi (sehr heisses Wasser) und einer kalten Sauna (nicht in Betrieb). Der Fitnessbereich war gross und modern eingerichtet.",3,2013,05,22
35,Comodo e pratico,"Posizione ottimale per prendere il traghetto, vicino alla Rambla, al Port Vell. Camere molto spaziose dotate di tutto. Balcone con splendida vista. Posteggio o garage custoditi. Taxi e bus turistici con fermata all'albergo. Colazione 25 euro ma e' come un pranzo. Anche se di categoria superiore albergo molto informale, non opprimente. Prezzi bibite frigobar alti. Rimane e sara' sempre il nostro albergo quando andiamo a Barcellona.",5,2013,05,14
35,Buon rapporto qualità prezzo ma un po' asettico,"Prenotato direttamente dal sito dell'hotel (che ha le offerte piu' convenienti e la possibilità di upgrade secondo disponibilità) ci hanno dato una camera, molto spaziosa, con una ottima vista sulla città. Guardando la posizione dell'hotel mi viene da dire che la vista sulla città sia quella preferibile in quanto la vista mare sarebbe solo parziale (tra l'hotel e il mare c'è il world trade center che è l'estensione dello stesso edificio)  e piu' che altro si vedrebbero le grandi navi da crociera che attraccano a fianco dell'hotel.

Inizialmente ero un po' perplesso sulla posizione, un po' decentrata rispetto agli altri hotel, in realtà è equidistante dai pricinpali punti di interesse (barceloneta, rambla, montjuic..) e a 800m dalla fermata della metropolitana inizio rambla, distanze facilmente percorribili a piedi (anche sotto la pioggia..).
Per qualcuno che vede Barcellona per la prima volta direi che la posizione è ottima e sicuramente permette di evitare scelte sbagliate.

L'hotel è molto bello e moderno, ambienti ampi, confortevoli e personale molto disponibile e gentile.
La pisicina sul terrazzo è piuttosto piccola e la sauna praticamente insesistente.

La colazione è veramente abbondante e ottima ma, almeno per quelli come me che sono abiutati a caffè e poco altro, decisamente troppo cara (15€ pp se prenotata insieme al soggiorno). Purtroppo non ci sono bar o simili nelle immediate vicinanze che possono costiture una alternativa.

L'hotel in generale è un po' asettico, come quasi tutti quelli di tipo ""business"" piu' indicati per meeting o eventi (difatti ogni giorno ce n'era uno..) che per lo svago, ma questa non è necessariamente una nota negativa, in quanto molto soggettiva.

L'unica nota negativa per me è stata il rumore delle navi che sostano a fianco dell'hotel. Pur avendo la camera al 6 piano ed insonorizzata si sentiva comunque un fastidioso brusio continuo dovuto al rumore dei motori delle navi in sosta. Fortunatamente non di notte ma piu' o meno dalle 8 alle 22 (almeno durante i giorni lavorativi). Uno dei motivi principali per cui ho scelto questo hotel (oltre al prezzo inferiore rispetto a quelli ubicati nelle posizioni piu' centrali) era evitare il casino della rambla e per questo motivo sono rimasto parzialmente deluso.

Se poi sia da considerare un hotel di 4 o 5 stelle non saprei, sicuramente in Italia gli hotel 5 stelle sono piu' caratteristici e offrono piu' comfort al cliente ma c'è da dire che sono nettamente piu' cari. Probabilmente per i nostri standard sarebbe piu' un 4s ma questa rimane comunque una considerazione fine a se stessa, alla fine quello che conta, almeno per me, è il rapporto qualità / prezzo e, in questo caso, non ho nulla da eccepire.

Considerati quanto sopra, se mai dovessi tornare a Barcellona probabilmente proverei un altro hotel, magari in una posizione diversa, adesso che mi sono reso conto di come è disposta la città e delle varie zone.",4,2013,05,12
35,Hotel cinco estrellas Gran Lujo ! Immejorable!,"Hotel cinco estrellas Gran Lujo ! Immejorable!

El hotel está acorde con la categoría que ostenta , en todos los terrenos , tanto el servicio , la atención personalizada , los servicios del hotel , las habitaciones,  las comidas , el emplazamiento ... Reboja Lujo allá donde mires . Sitio perfecto para una ocasión especial  (no oso arrepentiréis)",5,2013,04,26
35,Top Lage mit sicht auf den Pasagierschiffhafen,"Top Lage
Sehr freundlicher Empfang.Besonders schöne Zimmer mit Meerblick und Pasagierhafen.
Reichhaltiges Frühstücksbuffet.
Alle wichtigen Punkte Shopping, Restaurants und Altstadt in wenigen Minuten zu Fuss erreichbar.Nur zu empfehlen.",5,2013,04,11
35,Immer wieder!,"Das Hotel liegt im Hafen, und trotzdem nur einige hundert Meter vom Beginn der Rambla und dem Port Veill entfernt. Alles wäre bestens gewesen, hätte man uns bei einer Zimmerreservierung über sechs Tage  ein besser gelegenes Zimmer als Nummer 210 im zweiten Stockwerk zugewiesen, auch wenn das Zimmer über eine Agentur gebucht wurde. So mussten wir uns mit dem Blick auf das Dach eines Terminals begnügen. Reisende sollten ein Zimmer ab Stockwerk 5 verlangen. Ansonsten ist am Hôtel nichts auszusetzen: freundliches Personal, grosse saubere Zimmer, excellentes Frühstücksbuffet, Taxis und Busse voir demHaus ......",4,2013,04,06
35,Hotel mitten im Hafen,"...mit tollem Blick auf die Stadt und die Fähren! Natürlich hört man die Schiffe auch, die praktisch direkt neben dem Hotel liegen, aber die meisten legen um 23 Uhr ab. Wir hatten zudem eine City-Suite (auf der Website des Hotels mit 35% Rabatt) gebucht, bei diesen ist der Schlafzimmerteil hinter dem Wohnzimmer und dadurch auch ruhiger. Allerdings sind die Zimmer recht hellhörig. Alles in allem waren wir sehr zufrieden! Zimmer und Bad waren sehr geräumig, die Klimaanlage (Heizung) effizient, die Dusche phantastisch, das Frühstücksbuffet phänomenal und das Personal sehr freundlich.",4,2013,03,15
35,il top. un sogno,"Lussuoso hotel in posizione privilegiata sul mare ma comodo anche al centro. Tutti i servizi disponibili (non ho provato i ristoranti) sono al massimo. Gli ambienti sono modernissimi e molto confortevoli oltre che affascinanti per chi apprezza questo tipo di design. Slendido l'esterno con solarium e piscina ed ogni confort immaginabile. Il prezzo, certo non basso, è comunque ultracompetitivo se raffriontato con altre proposte nostrane di pari (sulla carta) categoria.",5,2013,03,15
35,Muy buen Hotel,"Hotel muy completo con excelentes equiparaciones, un muy buen restaurante, excelente servicio de cocktelería y un muy buen gimnasio con servicio de spa y sauna ubicado en la última planta. además el hotel te da la posibilidad de visitar una parte muy bonita de la ciudad como es la zona marítima. El personal derl hotel esta muy enfocado al cliente, con gran atención al detalle.",5,2013,03,10
35,cordialità dello staff insuperabile,"Merita una segnalazione di merito la cordialità di tutto lo staff di questo bellissimo hotel.
La posizione è ottima, mare e centro città raggiungibili con una camminata.
La vista è deliziosa, e il risveglio è accompagnato da un'ottima colazione.",5,2013,03,09
35,ottimo qualità prezzo...molto buono,sono stato 2 notti in questo hotel e sono rimasto particolarmente colpito dalla qualita che esprime per il prezzo che mi hanno offerto.posizione praticamente dentro il porto di barcellona dove si possono ammirare le navi ammiraglie..unico neo le strombazzate delle navi..camere: molto grandi...confortevoli..nuove..funzionali..pulitissime..servizio davvero buono.devo dire una vera sorpresa.meglio di molti 5 stelle italiani...che meriterebbero solo 3 stelle.,4,2013,03,03
35,molto buono,"Trovata un ottima offerta con upgrade in suite. Vista eccellente. Camera spaziosa e dotata di ogni comfort. Buona la colazione in camera. Personale nelle media. Facile l' accesso, anche a piedi, alle principali attrazioni della città. Nulla dunque da eccepire, se non per la mancanza di una spa, ad eccezione di una minuscola piscina esterna.Ci ritornerò senz' altro.",4,2013,02,25
35,Cinque stelle piene,"Grande hotel, servizio in camera numero1, qualità del cibo numero 1, ottima posizione, camere spaziose, buono il ristorante, la colazione ancge in camera e' favolosa; certo un po' caro, ma meno di tanti 5 stelle di nome e non di fatto.....poi se trovi l'offerta giusta.....",5,2013,01,26
35,Buon rapporto qualità - prezzo,"Esternamente l'hotel si presenta come una grande nave ed è situato sul molo nel Word Trade Center. Le stanze sono spaziose e i letti sono comodi; nel bagno c'è vasca idromassaggio e c'è la possibilità di fare anche la doccia. La nostra stanza aveva una stupenda vista sulla città, molto suggestiva soprattutto di notte. Il personale è cordiale. All'ottavo piano c'è una piscina panoramica utilizzabile solo in estate, c'è la palestra e la spa. Nel complesso sia le stanze che le parti comuni dell'hotel sono ben tenute e pulite. La wifi è gratuita, basta chiedere la password. L'Hotel è a qualche minuto a piedi dalla Rambla.",4,2013,01,20
35,No es 5* (y menos GL),"El hotel no está mal ... un poco alejado, pero eso ya lo sabíamos.

Lo que está fatal es el servicio. Estoy ahora mismo en la habitación trabajando, y estoy muerto de frío. Llamamos esta mañana a recepción y nadie ha hecho nada. Internet pésimo.

Tener que bajar a recepción de un hotel de teóricamente 5* porque tienes frío en la habitación (aunque el termostato esté a tope, a ¡¡32ºC!!) ... no es normal.",1,2013,01,03
35,efficiente,"Sicuramente un albergo bello, grandi stanze ed ampi bagni, purtoppo la nostra camera aveva la vista sul cortile interno e quindi non vedevamo la città o il mare e  si poteva  essere in una qualsiasi città. Per il resto niente da dire tutto giusto, reception impeccabile, buona pulizia, colazione ottima e anche con musica dal vivo. Un grande albergo secondo criteri di modernità ma forse anonimo e sicuramente senza il calore di Barcellona.",3,2012,12,30
35,Vivere in una favola,"Sono stata al Gran Marina per festeggiare l'anniversario di matrimonio e fin dall'arrivo in hotel è iniziata la mia favola.
Il check in era previsto dopo le 15 ma già alle 8.30 del mattino la nostra stanza era disponibile, senza alcun supplemento.
Abbiamo scelto una premier da 42 mq, bagno in marmo con doccia e vasca idromassaggio, un sogno.
La colazione poteva tranquillamente sostituire un pranzo, servita dalle 8 alle 10, aveva davvero l'imbarazzo della scelta, dolce, salato, frutta, yogurt...
Unico neo forse la reception, personale gentilissimo, ma in un ambiente un po' freddo e anonimo, ma per tutto il resto, davvero ineccepibile!",4,2012,11,27
35,MUY BIEN!!!,"El fin de semana pasado hemos estado en este hotel. Todo super bien!!!
Encontramos una super oferta y no dudamos en reservar. Nos ahorramos más de la mitad del precio real. Vale la pena aprobechar estas oportunidades!!!!
La habitaciones son super amplias, la nuestra tendria unos 40 m2. No le faltaba ningún detalle.
El baño con ducha y bañera de hidromasaje. 
El desayuno impresionante. Había de todo y más!!! Todo rico y de calidad.
Nosotros fuimos en pareja, pero no hay ningún problema a viajar en familia.
Esperamos volver!!!!",5,2012,11,19
35,hemos quedado muy decepcionados de este hotel,"Es una verguenza,nos olvidamos una camisa en la habitacion llamamos 30miutos despues de marcharnos del hotel y la camisa habia desaparecido,falta de respecto y consideracion,el jefe de recepcion ni nos ha vuelto a llamar para darnos novedades oh un gesto comercial.......
Bueno lo dicho este hotel es muy bonito pero los empleados no valen para nada o sea ser si quereis llegar de vuelta a casa con todasvuestras prendas no vayas ha este hotel......",1,2012,11,12
35,5 estrellas Gran Luxe?,"En realidad, me hospede en este hotel porque vivo a media fuera de barcelona y por trabajo debíamos comenzar muy pronto, acabar muy tarde y descansar muy poco. Todo es correcto, pero debo decir que el grifo perdía agua y la presión de la ducha no era adecuada. No lo recomendaría para turistas en el sentido de que no esta en el centro propiamente dicho, pero si se dispone de tiempo está a unos 15-18 min caminando de plaza catalunya. 
El desayuno 10/10
Cordialidad 10/10",3,2012,10,28
35,Pessimo,"Cinque stelle neanche per idea. Letti e cuscini duri e scomodi, asciugamani che hanno visto tempi migliori, articoli da bagno pochi e incompleti, nessun servizio di riassetto camera, addirittura ho dovuto fare io il letto per mia figlia. Personale scortese, cibo pessimo e carissimo. Ci sto soggiornando purtroppo.",1,2012,10,27
35,Espectacular,"acabamos de salir de este maravilloso hotel ,por ubicacion y calidad lo recomiendo ampliamente el desayuno espectacular las habitaciones modernas e impecables el personal siempre dispuesto a ayudar. el onternet incluido ",5,2012,10,16
35,hotel 5 estrellas de ciudad.,"Estuvimos en el hotel eurostars grand marina, en febrero para san valentin.Hotel muy bien situado en el puerto de barcelona, con preciosas vistas sobre la ciudad.Recepción muy agradable, no típica de hoteles de 5 estrellas que es mas seca, pero siempre correctísima.Habitaciones amplias con todo tipo de detalles digna de un hotel de su categoría, posiblemente lo de gran lujo le viene un poco grande, pero las 5 estrellas no se lo discute nadie.En verano tiene una piscina en la ultima planta con unas vistas espectaculares.El desayuno muy correcto con todo tipo de productos de mucha calidad.La cena de san valentin sencillamente espectacular con maridaje de vinos y cavas, y el servicio digno de hotel de su categoria.Parking en el hotel, pero se puede aparcar delante de la puerta,unos 15 coches, sin ningun problema.Lo mejor la situación, a 2 minutos andando de las ramblas de barcelona.Resumiendo muy buen hotel totalmente recomendable y al que pienso volver en el proximo san valentin, sino puedo antes.",5,2012,10,15
35,Muy bonito!,"A dir poco fantastico questo hotel!
camere spaziose e rifinite molto bene. Lo spazio comune all'esterno è molto accogliente e con una stile moderno. Immancabilmente la vista dalle camere è rivolta verso il mare, così si possono vedere le navi da crociera che attraccano al porto! Hotel posizionato in centro, facilmente raggiungibile da qualsiasi parte di Barcellona!
L'unica pecca è la piscina all'ultimo piano scoperta..... mooolto piccola!
Staff cordialissimo, come si addice ad un hotel a 5 stelle!",5,2012,10,03
35,Ottimo 5 stelle ad un prezzo abbordabile,"Un 5 stelle con camere spaziose, dotate praticamente di ogni comfort ed ad un prezzo accessibile (si riescono spesso a trovare camere intorno ai 200eu a notte o anche meno). Camere silenziose, vista ottima soprattutto se si ha una stanza con vista sul mare o su Barcellona. Secondo me le uniche da evitare sono le camere con vista sul cortile interno (ma non ci sono stato, la nostra era una camera sul mare)
Anche la posizione e' piuttosto buona proprio sul porto, a 5 minuti a piedi dalla Rambla o dal MareMagnum. Per quanto riguarda la posizione c'e' pero' da dire che l'ingresso della metro non e' proprio vicinissimo, quindi spesso e' piu' facile usare il taxi anche se piu' costoso.
Colazione ottima, addondante e con prodotti di prima qualita': la consiglio.
Degni di nota e completamente gratuiti: wifi in camera veloce ed affidabile, cassetta di sicurezza sufficientemente grande per contenere anche il notebook, dotazione bagno completa veramente di tutto (accapatoi, kit x radersi, saponi, pettini, creme, ...)
Punto negativo la piscina : di dimensioni assolutamente non adeguate, veramente piccola.",5,2012,09,29
35,Jornada de Trabajo,"El día de la Mercé, fiesta de Barcelona ciudad, la FECARECAT, celebra una comida donde, anualmente, reúne a cuantas casas regionales de Barcelona y provincia se quieren adherir. 
Este año, se ha celebrado en uno de los salones de este hotel, donde hemos podido disfrutar de unas instalaciones muy correctas y un trato agradable.",4,2012,09,27
35,hotel genial,"es un hotel espectacular, unos coteles muy buenos. Las habitaciones soy espaciosas. El viaje lo hicimos mi marido y yo.nos gusto mucho, es cierto que habia un boda, y mulitud de gente. el desayuno muy variado",5,2012,09,27
35,"Estupendas vistas sobre el puerto de Barcelona, pero no es un 5* GL ni de lejos","Me he alojado durante tres noches con mi pareja en este hotel urbano situado en el puerto de Barcelona, muy cerca de las Ramblas y de muchas atracciones turísticas de la capital.

Por lo que vi, es un hotel muy orientado al turismo de negocios, pues se encuentra en el World Trade Center de Barcelona. Además de que el establecimiento en si ya se ve que tiene una orientación claramente al cliente de negocios.

El edificio del hotel es destacable, en forma de barco. Su exterior sin duda culmina por el puerto y puede pasar por un gran hotel. Pero su interior deja mucho que desear. 
Tiene fallos incomprensibles en un hotel de 5* GL. Para empezar, no hay ningún botones en la entrada del hotel para que te recoja las maletas y te las lleve a la habitación. 
El hall del hotel es muy moderno pero sencillo, básico. Lo peor es el servicio y la atención al cliente por parte del personal del Grand Marina.

Lo único que destaca el hotel y sin duda es de 5* GL son sus espléndidas vistas sobre el puerto de Barcelona y sus habitaciones, que yo creo que si que merecen el galardón de las 5* GL.
Nosotros nos alojamos en una habitación Deluxe, algo superiores de las más sencillas del hotel.
La decoración y la limpieza son excelentes. Tiene una amplitud más que considerable y ofrece un balcón con vistas al puerto. Sin duda un marco incomparable. Lo que falla de la habitación quizás el baño, lo encontré muy sencillo para su categoría además de pequeño. Solamente tiene una pica para lavarse las manos en vez de dos y los artículos de baño son algo escasos y pobres.
Pero bueno, solamente por las vistas y el dormitorio merece las 5* GL (en cuánto al conjunto de la habitación, no del hotel).

Pero exceptuando las magníficas habitaciones y vistas del hotel, todo lo demás hace del Eurostars Grand Marina un establecimiento de gama media.
Para empezar una piscina que ofrecía un suelo resbaladizo y una vez en la piscina nos encontramos suciedad que había ocasionado sin querer un cliente extranjero. Tardaron horas en limpiarlo y eso que la zona de piscina estaba bastante vigilada.

Pero lo que encuentro peor del hotel es el servicio en general que le dan al cliente y su horrorosa restauración:
Dispone de un lobby bar completamente cerrado que a simple vista es muy elegante pero el servicio que prestan en dicho bar es espantoso. Dan música en vivo y los cócteles son soberbios, pero los camareros no dan a basto. Además de que no sirven un cóctel como en un hotel de 5* GL. Te lo hacen de forma muy rápida para poder atender así al siguiente cliente con menos tiempo de espera. 
En cuánto al restaurante... bastante sencillo también. Los desayunos muy sencillitos, más propios de un cuatro estrellas que de un 5* GL. También fuimos a cenar por la noche y lo mismo, deja muchísimo que desear. Además de que en cualquier servicio del hotel se puede apreciar claramente la poca profesionalidad del personal y la grave falta de personal.

Sin duda, es un hotel excelente en cuánto a habitaciones y vistas sobre el puerto, pero el servicio que ofrece es de un establecimiento de una categoría muy inferior a la de 5* Gran Lujo.

Aunque alomejor volvería a alojarme en el Grand Marina puesto que tiene unas habitaciones magníficas y alomejor dándole otra oportunidad el personal brinda un servicio como dios manda y las instalaciones del hotel mejoran.",4,2012,09,21
35,genial,"la ubicación del Hotel perfecta, para poder disfrutar de las vistas de la ciudad, el puerto y la llegada de cruceros. la estancia fue genial con una habitación amplia, solamente tiene un lunar negro, tendrian que cambiar algún mueble que ya esta deteriorado, el personal muy amable y profesional, también se puede disfrutar de buena comida, del desayuna destacar una gran variedad de productos, solamente el zumo de naranja natural se agoto pronto y no se repuso, al preguntar, la respuesta fue ""lo siento"" esto no puede ocurrir en un hotel de esta categoria, pero la estancia fue genial, volvere",4,2012,09,17
35,"modernes, großes Hotel mit ausgezeichneter Lage","Dieses Hotel ist speziell aufgrund der guten Lage am Hafen zu empfehlen. Man kann hier sozusagen schon beim Hotel maritimes Flair inhalieren und deswegen haben wir dieses Hotel diversen innerstädtischen Hotels vorgezogen. Die Ramblas, das gotische Viertel und die Gaudi-Sehenswürdigkeiten auf der Shoppingmeile Passeig de Gracia sind aber trotzdem problemlos zu Fuß errichbar, auf den Montjuic führt die unmittelbar vor dem Hotel ""haltende"" Seilbahn und diverse ""Hop on, hop off-Busse"" halten direkt vorm Hotel. Große Zimmer, die Möblierung war allerdings kein Highlight. Gutes Frühstück! Auf der 8.Etage gibt es eine schöne Aussichtsterrasse, Fitnesstudio mit Whirlpool und kleinen Pool mit Liegen. Aufgrund der Nähe zum Cruise-Terminal (sehr kurze Taxifahrt) für Kreuzfahrer sehr interessant!",4,2012,09,01
35,Mi aspettavo di più..,"Bellissimo hotel situato in un'ottima posizione soprattutto se si visita Barcellona d'estate. È sul mare e a due passi dal Maremagnum; inoltre col taxi si raggiungono immediatamente Passo de Gracia e la Rambla. Il personale è cortese e disponibile. Le camere sono ampie, confortevoli e balconate. L'unica delusione è stata la piscina...davvero piccola!",4,2012,08,31
35,Schönes Hotel-Gute Lage !,"Ein schönes Hotel in zentraler Lage.Die Preise sind überhöht-auch in der Minibar.Bier 6.-Euro-Cola-Dose 5.50.- usw.weit weg von der Realität.Barcelona zählt ja längst nicht mehr zu den billigen Destinationen.Die Zeiten der Peseten sind ja längst vorbei.Der Ausblick auf hunderte Büros rundum war auch nicht gerade berauschend und der Balkon hatte weder Tisch noch Sessel.Einfach leer! Wer steht schon gerne auf dem Balkon? Ich jedenfalls nicht..fiel aber,ob des Bürohausausblicks nicht sehr ins Gewicht.Personal freundlich und korrekt,aber man merkt keine Herzlichkeit.Verlange ich aber auch nicht.Personal in der Bar recht freundlich.zu den allerschnellsten würde ich sie aber nicht zählen,trotz des enormen Ansturms von 6 Gästen.Sauberkeit im Zimmer jedoch hervorragend und überdurchschnittlich.Badzimmer wirklich 5 Sterne reif..ja sogar darüber..von Kamm bis Shampoo,Zahnbürste..einfach alles da...genug Platz und peinlichst saube rgeputzt.Die Möbel haben ihre besten Tage längst hinter sich und passen teilweise nicht zusammen(Zimmer 424)..sind stark abgenutzt..fällt auf,war aber nicht so wichtig,,weil der Wohlfühlfaktor ja großteils gepasst hat.Das Bett ist hervorragend und man schläft wie ein Baby..zusätzliche Decken und Polster sogar vorhanden...und wirklich ein herrliches Schlafgefühl nach einem anstrengenden Tag in der pulsierenden Stadt.Kann das Hotel empfehlen,obwohl es preislich für das Gebotene doch etwas überhöht erscheint..",4,2012,08,22
35,"Un buen hotel en Barcelona, ubicado Cerca del movimiento pero con una vista genial","Este hotel en el puerto de Barcelona, sobre los embarcaderos de barcos de pasajeros. Desde lo lejos se observa que el mismo hotel tiene perfil de barco y parece atracado en el puerto.
La atención es muy buena en la recepción, al igual que la limpieza general. El desayuno excelente, abundante, variado y muy cuidado.
Tal vez lo mas flojo del hotel es el restaurante y el servicio de wifi.
La pileta no es grande, pero el solarium tiene una hermosa vista a todo el puerto desde el 8vo piso.
El hotel esta a 2 cuadras del bus turistico y a 5 de la estatua de Colon, donde comienzan las ramblas.",4,2012,08,20
35,Gutes Hotel - Lage direkt am Hafen,"Das Hotel befindet sich direkt am Hafen. Es werden laufend größere Schiffe abgefertigt. Die Lärmbelastung hielt sich jedoch in Grenzen.
Eine U-Bahn Station ist in der Nähe (ca. 10 Minuten). Der Touristen-Bus hält direkt vor dem Hotel (Stadt-Rundfahrt).
Der Service des Personals lässt etwas zu wünschen übrig. Man muss etwas länger auf Speisen und Getränke warten. Hier ist sicher noch Potenzial nach oben vorhanden. Alles in Allem kann ich dieses Hotel weiter empfehlen.",4,2012,08,19
35,Increible,"Tuve la suerte de encontrar una oferta romántica en internet a muy bajo coste comparada con el servicio, tengo que decir que de esto hace 3 años pero es que quede alucinada. Cuando cogí la oferta no me dieron a elegir habitación con lo que me esperaba la mas sencilla, y por el contrario el recepcionista me dijo: os voy a dar una habitación bonita. Y no fue bonita, fue impresionante, con una terraza enorme en la octava planta y vistas al mar y toda bcn. Un lujo! El único fallo es el precio del parking que son 25 euros x dia, pero bueno, que la gente que suele ir a ese hotel dudo que les vaya de 25 euros, a mi desde luego si... Pero fue un sueño!",5,2012,08,13
35,Assolutamente SI !!!!!!,"Che bella esperienza in questa srtuttura!!!!! Hotel spettacolare come edificio... una vera e propria idea di nave attraccata su uno splendido bacino mediterraneo e di fronte la bellezza infinita di Barcellona. Cosa dire se non 10 e lode su tutto !!! Personale disponibilissinmo e ultra gentile, camere da sogno, vista panoramica, comfort e pulizia ottima e colazione ricchissima a tal punto da confondersi con un pranzo e una cena... e poi l'accompagnamento musicale dal vivo mentre si fa colazione non ha paragoni! Insomma stra consigliato e di sicuro saremo presto di nuovo loro ospiti !!!!!!!! Complimenti davvero sinceri :-)",5,2012,08,09
35,ottimo,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo Hotel 6 giorni nel mese di Maggio. E' situato in una zona strategica di Barcellona, accanto al porto dove partono i traghetti anche per le baleari,a un passo dal Mare Magnum, abbastanza vicini al centro e a Barcelloneta.Per un 5 stelle i prezzi sono abbordabili, e la nostra suite era davvero notevole: Salottino con tv, camera da letto con tv, bagno con doppio lavabo,doccia e vasca idromassaggio. balcone con splendido affaccio sulla città. Ottima la varietà e la qualità della colazione e personale sempre cortese. Costi proibitivi per tutto cio' che non fosse compreso nel prezzo.",5,2012,08,07

35,Schönes Hotel und gut gelegen für Ausflüge,"War mit meinem Sohn für ein paar Tage in diesem Hotel. 
Das Hotel liegt super gut. Da wir im Hochsommer dort waren, waren wir natürlich sehr froh um die Klimaanlage und auch dass man abends wegen der Brise vom Meer her die Fenster offen lassen konnte. Schöne Zimmer und Bad. Minibar aber definitiv zu teuer sowie auch Frühstürck mit 27 Euro. Um das Hotel rum gibt es jedoch diverse Bars wo man gut frühstücken kann und auch einen kleinen Supermarkt. 
Enttäuscht und auch etwas genervt war ich ob der unprofessionellen und anonymen Art der Angestellen an der Rezeption. Unterkühlt und genervt ob den Touristen, so kam es mir vor. 
Trotz allem super schönes Hotel. Würde sofort wieder hingehen.",4,2012,07,16
35,Fronte del port,"Ho letto le recensioni prima di prenotare e devo dire che le critiche sono un po' severe. La hall e' un po' disadorna ma grande, la nostra camera, una suite prenotata su booking ci e' costata 325 euro contro la cifra improponibile di un agenzia, stanza numero 522, 50 mq, due salotti due bagni di cui uno suddiviso in tre zone: vasca e doccia, sanitari, lavabi. Comoda cabina guardaroba con addirittura seduta per calzare le scarpe, poi un letto davvero comodo. Ma ancora meglio la piazza pedonale sotto l' albergo dove a contornare giochi d'acqua delle fontane troverete una banca, un'agenzia di viaggi, cinque ristoranti o tavole calde, farmacia e altri esercizi commerciali. I taxi aspettano sotto l' hotel e la teleferica e' a 10 passi! Barcellona l'ho vissuta almeno due volte l'anno negli ultimi 10, ma devo dire che questa e' la soluzione più confortevole di sempre.
Ps: il personale io l'ho trovato gentilissimo e attento alle esigenze in particolare di mio figlio di 2 anni",5,2012,07,05
35,stupendo,"nella bellissima cornice del porto di barcellona, tra la funivia del Montjuic e il MareMagnum si trova il grand marina. a due passi dal monumento a Colombo e la rambla. camere perfettamente pulite ed ampie. comfort e vista da 5 stelle! consigliatissimo.",5,2012,06,09
35,lisca,"Als Single Reisende war ich sehr befriedigt, ein so gutes Zimmer zu erhalten. Ich hatte eine tolle Aussicht auf den Hafen, Barcelona und den Montjuic.Das Bett war sehr gut und das Badezimmer fast luxuriös. Das Hotel ist nur 5 Minuten von las Ramblas entfernt und eine Menge Restaurants sind in der Nähe. Die Mitarbeiter waren nett und hilfreich. Mangels Hunger 
am Morgen kann ich das Frühstück nicht  beurteilen. Den Spa habe ich auch nicht gebraucht.
Wenn die Fenster geschlossen sind hört man auch kaum Lärm vom Hafen. Als Alleinreisende 
ist der Preis etwas hoch.",5,2012,05,27
35,5 stelle...meno,"Praticamente all'interno del Porto, in prossimità degli imbarchi delle navi, con tutti gli inconvenienti annessi che dal sito non si deducono minimamente. Dalle camere ""superiori"" con balconcino si gode una bella vista sulla città. Arredamento elegante e non banale, con Jacuzzi in bagno . Set accessori scarsino per essere un cinque stelle.
Colazione abbondante, con vastissima scelta: decisamente il pezzo forte! Peccato la scarsa elesticità della caposala, non molto friendly! Alla richiesta di un caffè 10 minuti prima dell'apertura della sala, motivata dalla partenza molto presto, non abbiamo ricevuto risposte molto carine e all'altezza delle 5 stelle! Se aggiungiamo che avevamo pagato l'intera colazione...  
Sul resto del personale nulla da dire, molto cortesi e sorridenti!
Tariffe da 5 stelle...",4,2012,05,01
35,Una piacevole sorpresa,"Un ottimo e vero 5 stelle mi soprende con un servizio accurato, puntuale e soprattutto cordialissimo!Inoltre abbordabile come e più di un mediocre 4 stelle , come  ce ne sono tanti a BArcellona, specialmente in un periodo di fiere internazionali, gare sportive, eventi, etc.Inappuntabile pulizia delle grandi camere, ricchezza delle dotazioni degli ampi bagni , vista mare o vista Montjuic e centro città spettacolari, soprattutto al tramonto, da cartolina nonostante si sia nel cuore della metropoli, completezza dei servizi proposti, ottima sala cardio e pesi all'ultimo piano con vista a 180* e piccola piscina estiva all'aperto, ma con grande vasca idromasssaggio, sempre ben curata e con larghissimo orario di fruizione, ottimo e veloce collegamento WIFI , raffinato bistrò /bar con pianista dal vivo ed atmosfera soft/rilassante ( dove ho cenato svariate volte con grande soddisfazione) anche questo abbordabiliossimo, se non proprio economico ( ma quale ristorante degno di questo nome lo sarebbe in zona turistica o centrale a Barcellona??), e con forse il miglior servizio quanto a professionalità di tutta Barcellona.
Di certo tornerò al Grand Marina in occasione del mio prossimo soggiorno a Barcelona, e questa volta non solo per lavoro...( solo a 5-10 minuti dal BArrio Gotico e poco di più dalle CAse di Gaudì , da Plaza Catalunya, etc...)

Lo consiglio senza riserve e COMPLIMENTI Grand Marina!!!",5,2012,04,14
35,BUEN HOTEL,"Considero hotel de 5*. La habitación que me dieron daba a la ciudad y a Montjuic por tanto tenia buenas vistas, dicha habitación era de tamaño normal en consonancia con su categoria y tenia una pequeña terraza con vistas.
El personal de recepción muy agradable y eficaz",4,2012,04,08
35,Ottimo hotel di alta categoria ma dall'atmosfera familiare,"Ero un po' prevenuta su questo hotel per la fredda eleganza della sua facciata e la posizione a ridosso del World Trade Center, invece ho dovuto ricredermi! Tutto lo staff è molto gentile e disponibile, le camere sono grandi e non troppo asettiche con un bel bagno dotato di una piacevolissima vasca idromassaggio...unico neo: non avevo la vista mare!",5,2012,03,28
35,Un buen hotel con un desayuno excelente,"Casi todas las habitaciones tienen buenas vistas y el personal del hotel es muy agradable. Además, si eres fan de los desayunos de hotel en el Eurostars Grand Marina disfrutarás muchísimo, ya que ofrecen un bufet muy variado (dulce, salado, caliente, frío...) y una pequeña carta que no está mal. 
Las habitaciones son espaciosas y están bien acondicionadas.",4,2012,03,27
35,Excelente,"Hotel con una situación extraordinaria, igual que las vistas de la habitación que nos han dado, hacia el Montjuic y el puerto. Atención exquisita por parte del personal de recepción, que se han ofrecido a darnos cualquier tipo de información sobre la ciudad o cualquier cosa que podamos necesitar. Un sobresaliente para ellos.
Sólo hemos estado una noche para ir a ver una ópera al Liceu, pero nos hemos quedado con ganas de más. Por cierto, al Liceu hemos ido dando un agradable paseo por Las Ramblas, ya que el hotel está muy cerca.
La limpieza, habitación, zonas comunes, wifi gratis en las habitaciones, completo minibar, etc., también con una alto nivel de excelencia. Hemos estado muy a gusto y repetiremos en este hotel.
Por decir algo que podrían mejorar, sería el cambiar los colchones por unos un poco más duros y sin muelles (aunque esto es cuestión de gustos), y, a poder ser, hacer un tratamiento para mejorar la calidad del agua corriente. De todos es sabido la mala calidad del agua de Barcelona, muy dura y con fuerte olor a cloro. Esto, por decir algo que se pueda mejorar, pero en general todo muy bien.
Excelente hotel.",5,2012,03,20
35,Buen hotel en muy buena ubicación,"Hemos utilizado este hotel en un par de ocasiones por su excelente ubicación y buena relación calidad-precio. Servicio muy atento, y habitaciones espaciosas con detalles de hotel de su categoría. Servicio de restaurante excelente, tanto para los desayunos tipo buffet, como para comidas o cenas. Excelente para viajes en familia a un paso del Maremagnum y centro de Barcelona.",4,2012,03,18
35,soggiorno fantastico!!!!,"volevo semplicemente raccomandare questo complesso per il suo staff.
mi ricordo di Manuele giú al ricevimento non so se responsabile o no peró si prese cura di noi dal momento del check in. Stanza deluxe vista mare, fragole e champagne, ci accompagnó alla stanza personalmente e ci raccomandó due buoni restauranti.

L'hotel non rimane propio nel centro peró per pochi giorni va bene.",4,2012,02,29
35,Stupendo hotel camere panoramiche a pochi passi dalla Rambla,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel 2 notti a Febbraio 2012 in due camere standard, ottime camere panoramicissime ( una sul lato vista mare, l'altra con vista su tutta la città di Barcellona e sulla rambla del mare ).

Camere molto ampie e ottimamente rifinite, con vetrate lungo tutta la parete. Letto particolarmente comodo e anche cuscino, con possibilità di scegliere quello più adatto alle proprie esigenze.

Splendido anche il bagno, con vasca idromassaggio e doccia con idromassaggio anch'essa.
Inoltre all'arrivo in camera troverete un kit completo di tutto quello che serve per il bagno, accappatoio compreso.

La posizione è ottima, a poche centinaia di metri a piedi dalla rambla e quindi dal centro, proprio di fronte al centro commerciale mare magnum.
Inoltre fuori dall'hotel partono i bus per la città e stazionano sempre i taxi.

Wi-fi gratuito in camera perfettamente funzionante.

In hotel abbiamo provato solamente la colazione, servita in un'ampia sala al primo piano, che propone due tavolate ricchissime di qualsiasi tipologia di cibo, dal dolce al salato. Attenzione perchè la colazione è un po' costosa se la vostra camera non la include già nel prezzo della notte.

Molto fornito ma troppo caro il minibar ( 5 euro per 30cl di acqua.... ).

All'ultimo piano dell'hotel terrazza panoramica a 360gradi sulla città con piscina, vuota in questo periodo, e palestra interna con grande vasca idromassaggio, dove non abbiamo mai trovato nessuno in questi giorni di permanenza, quindi perfettamente sfruttabile.

Personale reception gentile e disponibile, parla solo inglese e spagnolo.

Il prezzo: ovviamente non è economico, essendo un 5 stelle, ma ci si può andare, sul web si trovano buone offerte, l'offerta migliore, quella da noi prenotata, era presente proprio sul sito ufficiale dell'hotel, più bassa di tutte quelle degli altri siti di booking.",5,2012,02,28
35,Buen hotel para convenciones,"Un buen hotel, si además tienes  el lugar de reuniones en el edificio de al lado pues situación inmejorable. Bien situado  para ir andando por la rambla y barrio gótico.",4,2012,02,10

peor hotel de 5 estrellas que he estado,las camas de muelles antiguas!!!!...pedimos un cambio y nos dijeron que eran
todas iguales!..la peor cama donde he dormido nunca.",3,2012,01,21
35,Unico,"Ho scelto questo hotel , per un soggiorno di 5 notti con mia moglie, perchè assai poco più caro dei molti altri visitati nel web, ma straordinariamente superiore nella qualità e nella posizione. Ho prenotato una camera doppia di medio prezzo, ma al notro arrivo, alla richiesta di una camera vista mare, ci è stata data allo stesso prezzo una camera superiore con vetrate vista mare e città. La posizione centrale, la pulizia, i servizi e la qualità di arredi e finiture mi fanno consigliare questo hotel a chiunque desideri visitare Barcellona. Non so riferire sui servizi di colazione e pranzo perchè riguardo la gastronomia abbiamo preferito avventurarci nelle vie della città. Da provare!",5,2011,12,16
35,MEGA,"Wir waren für ein Wochenende im Eurostars Grand Marina gebucht durch www.travel.ch. Via Schweiz war ein Updgrade nicht möglich. Kaum angekommen konnten wir ein Upgrade in eine fantastische Suite buchen der Preis (100 Euro pro Nacht) war für uns okay. Wir kamen sehr spät an konnten um 23.30 noch essen bestellen, also 24 Stunden Service. Das Zimmer ist sehr schön und wir hatten Aussicht auf ganz Barcelona, einfach Hammer! Frühstücksbuffet bietet eine riesige Auswahl für jedermann, es hat einfach alles und falls man Sonderwünsche hat, kann man dies auch bestellen. Das Hotel liegt 5 Minuten zu Fuss von der Ramblas entfernt. Vom Flughafen sind es 20 Minuten Taxi fahrt. Ein bezauberndes Hotel! Personal spricht auch andere Sprachen wie Italienisch und Englisch.",5,2011,12,12
35,"Sólo 1 noche, pero nos encantó","Sólo estuvimos 1 noche, al siguiente día partíamos de crucero. La ubicación es excelente, nuestra habitación con vista al mar, a pasos de Las Ramblas, caminable.  la habitación no incluía el desayuno y no comimos allá, por lo tanto no puedo referirme a ese punto.

La decoración muy sobria, elegante, la habitación cómoda. Muy recomendable, el personal muy amable.",4,2011,11,20
35,ottimo soggiorno,"sono stato con mia moglie al GH Marina lo scosrso marzo. Hotel davvero eccellente nel servizio e nella qualità degli arredamenti. il personale è molto cordiale e disponibile. Le camere spaziose, di buon gusto senza cadere nel pacchiano. A due passi dalla metropolitana e dalla rambla. In venti minuti, percorrendo il porto, si arriva alla Barceloneta. Venti minuti di taxi dall'aeroporto ma durante il giorno è più comodo utilizzare i mezzi pubblici che a Barcellona funzionano benissimo. PS: non lasciatevi spaventare dalla categoria, costa meno di quello che pensate e per un soggiorno breve ne vale la pena.",5,2011,11,14
35,Sehr schöne Lage,"Wir waren Anfang November dort, der Empfang war sehr herzlich und freundlich. Entschieden haben wir uns für dieses Hotel wegen der günstigen Lage: gleich am Hafen, jede Menge Restaurants in der Nähe (der alte Hafen mit seinen Fischrestaurants!), die Autobus-Haltestellen direkt vor dem Haus, in wenigen Gehminuten auf der Rambla und somit gleich mitten in der Stadt, mitten im Geschehen. Die Zimmer sind äußerst großzügig, fast verschwenderisch, angelegt, geräumiges Badezimmer (Doppelwaschbecken, Badewanne und Dusche), begehbare Garderobe (die ist für einen längeren Aufenthalt vielleicht etwas zu klein bemessen, aber für einen Wochenend-Trip ausreichend), heller, freundlicher Wohn- und Schlafbereich. Balkon hatten wir zwar, aber zu benützen war er eigentlich nicht - keine Sitzmöbel vorhanden, brauchten wir aber auch nicht, die Schiebetüren ließen sich weit genug öffnen um frische Luft zu schnuppern, wir lieben nun einmal Hotels, wo man Fenster und Türen öffnen kann! Die Tapas im Restaurant haben wir leider nicht probiert (zu wenig Zeit!), einmal hatten wir Abendessen am Zimmer, war sehr sehr gut. Herrliche Aussicht von der Dachterrasse (Pool ist auch vorhanden, war allerdings nicht mehr in Betrieb, war ja auch schon zu kühl im November), Fitnessbereich lt. Angaben meines Mannes zufriedenstellend. Wir würden dieses Hotel jederzeit wieder buchen - auch die Anreise vom Flughafen ist ein Grund dafür, man fährt kaum 15 Minuten.",5,2011,11,10
35,Ottimo soggiorno!,"L'hotel è situato nel bel mezzo del porto di Barcellona, si accede passando in auto attraverso un molo. La struttura, di recente costruzione, è ottimamente funzionale e molto moderna. Le camere deliziosamente arredate e piacevoli da vivere. 
La posizione è molto vantaggiosa, a due passi dalla Rambla.
Il prezzo del soggiorno è comunque un po' caro a mio avviso.",5,2011,11,05
35,"exzellente lage, freundliches personal: jederzeit wieder!!","Wir waren im Oktober in Barcelona (Familienreise) und haben wir uns für das Grand marina, wegen der günstigen Lage in der Nähe vom Hafen, mitten in der Stadt und gleichzeitig ruhig, entschieden und es keineswegs bereut. Habe gelesen dass manche es laut fanden, kann ich Gott sei Dank nicht zustimmen. Man hört kaum was von den Schiffen oder vom Verkehr. 
Die Zimmer waren gut ausgestattet, sehr sauber, die Betten gut (die Matratzen evtl. für manche etwas hart), das Badezimmer super groß, die Sicht / Meeresblick vom feinsten traumhaft....
Der Frühstücksbüffet war im 1. Stock, der Service gut, die Auswahl gut. Das Restaurant haben wir nicht besucht.
Das Minibar extremmmmmm teuer!!
Das einzige etwas nervige war das Einchecken, an der Reception haben wir ohne ersichtlichen Grund länger gebruacht. Das Aucchecken war in 30 Sekunden erledigt.

Alles in allem: jederzeit wieder!!!",5,2011,10,20
35,in posizione strategica,"L'hotel è in una posizione tattica, vicinissimo alla rambla e sulla linea della metro che porta a visitare le attrazioni principali. Purtroppo la manutenzioneè scarsa, le maniglie delle finestre ti restano in mano, ad un certo punto lo sciacquone non andava più, dopo un po' ha ripreso magicamente a funzionare. Però, dopo una giornata passata a camminare, tornare in albergo e farsi un bagno caldo con l'idromassaggio non è affatto male! Il letto enorme e comodissimo, la stanza è grande e c'è una porta-divisorio che permette di non sentire i rumori provenienti dai corridoi. La colazione non era inclusa, quindi la facevamo sulla rambla!",4,2011,10,14
35,Unser Trip nach Barcelona,"Sehr schönes Zimmer mit Meerblick oder noch besser upgrade auf Junior-Suite (verlangen). Hochwertige Einrichtung. Schwache Klimaanlage. Dadurch Zimmertemperatur teilweise nur noch knapp erträglich 25 Grad und mehr). Sehr freundliches, hilfsbereites Personal. Konversation in Deutsch nicht möglich.",4,2011,10,14
35,"Wunderbares Hotel, der Pool auf dem Dach ist unschlagbar","Dieses Hotel hat mich vom Angebot von Einrichtung und Dienstleistungen beeindruckt. Vom Pool auf dem Dach hat man tolle Sicht über den Hafen und die Stadt. Dort befindet sich auch ein geräumiger und moderner Fitnessraum sowie eine Snackbar. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist riesig und gediegen, die Tische drinnen oder draussen sind weiss gedeckt. Im ganzen Hotel gibt es gratis WLAN und im 1.Stock beim Restaurant hat es 2 Laptops mit Drucker zur freien Benutzung. 
Die Zimmer sind geräumig und teils mit spektakulärer Aussicht über den Hafen & Stadt.",5,2011,09,08
35,"Tutto ok, tranne i prezzi!","Camera grande e pulita con un letto ENORME, bagno molto bello con doccia e vasca idromassaggio, posizione comoda per raggiungere la Rambla (5 minuti a piedi). Terrazza con bella vista sulla città, la piscina è molto piccola ma sufficiente per rinfrescarsi. Bella palestra. La colazione è buona e abbondante, ma conviene solo se si trova un'offerta con colazione inclusa, altrimenti costa 24,00 Euro... In alternativa ci sono dei bar appena sotto l'hotel in cui si puo' prendere cappuccino e cornetto. Limitatevi però a dormire soltanto e non lasciatevi tentare dal minibar: acqua da 33 cl: 4 euro; lattina 6 euro, mars 5 euro! Per non parlare del bar in terrazza (caffè 4 euro) e del servizio in camera (hamburger 17 euro!!!!)",4,2011,09,03
35,Hotel fantastico!,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo Hotel scegliendo la formula  "" Celebration break ""  praticamente B&B con diritto ad una camera di lusso doppia vista mare,fragole e champagne all'arrivo e prima colazione a buffet inclusa ad un prezzo di molto inferiore ad un equivalente 5 stelle italiano. Altre formule sono in realtà meno vantaggiose. Fantastica la colazione con cibi diversi dai soliti buffet. Molto curato il servizio con controllo costante e riassortimento rapido degli alimenti previsti. Gentilezza e cortesia ovunque in particolare vi sono due receptionist che parlano italiano che ti aiutano costantemente. Unico neo l'assenza di canali italiani visibili in camera giustificato da un temporaneo guasto. L'hotel si trova alla fine della Rambla ed un pò distante dai luoghi d'interesse ma a chi piace camminare si raggiunge in 15 minuti il centro della città. Magnifica vista sul porto . Lo consigliamo e ci ritorneremo!",5,2011,09,03
35,STRUTTURA DI PREGIO MA GESTIONE NON ALL'ALTEZZA,"La pulizia e la struttura nell'insieme mi hanno colpito positivamente anche questo anno. Le camere spaziose da non credere sono eccezionali e l'ultimo piano offre una vista spettacolare. Purtroppo non posso parlare nello stesso modo per il personale che non è più all'altezza di un hotel 5 stelle gran lusso. Prima di tutto è diminuito facendo si che in piscina e nella sala relax non vi sia alcun controllo (bambini si tuffano come all'acquafun in una piscina veramente piccola, incuranti degli altri ospiti, niente meno  nella vasca idromassaggio dove troviamo torsi di mela mangiati sul bordo dove la gente entra nonostante i numerosi divieti che nessuno tiene in considerazione).Peggio di tutto una ragazzina messa al desk  mi deride dicendo che mi sia inventata che un suo collega mi aveva concordato un late check out gratis per conciliare il fatto che nonostante l'abbia richiesto una miriade di volte prima dell'arrivo la stanza non era ad un piano alto. Praticamente asserisce che sia una cosa impossibile ridendo sotto i baffi per il mio inglese e alla fine accetta la cosa trattandoci come pezzenti (uno paga 220 euro al giorno solo per dormire e poi ha bisogno di inventare storie per non pagare 50 euro di late check out).Nel momento del confronto con la persona che mi aveva concordato questa agevolazione fa finta di parlare al telefono...prendendo nuovamente in giro e decido di non continuare per non essere etichettata con i soliti clichè degli italiani...ma se lo meritava. Insomma non ritengo sia giusto fare questioni sul costo della colazione o del bar perchè se si va in un hotel di questo livello si deve tenere conto che tutti i servizi hanno un costo più elevato dello standard...ma questo vale anche per quello che uno sia aspetta, l'albergo deve garantire un servizio al top a coloro che decidono di spendere più della media per avere il massimo e in questo caso il personale gioca un ruolo fondamentale insieme ai cioccolatini della buonanotte e a tutte quelle accortezze che si hanno verso i propri ospiti... . A me invece è parso che questa proporzione questo anno sia giocata a nostro sfavore. Unica chicca positiva in più dell'anno scorso il servizio meteo che lasciato in apposito cartellino sul cuscino ti informa sul tempo del giorno seguente permettendo di organizzare meglio la giornata.",3,2011,09,01
35,Colazione furto a mano armata,Costo della colazione come una cena ! Assurdo ; piscina minuscola e frigo bar da furto mai visti prezzi del genere. Wifi poco funzionante e staccata l'ultimo giorno prima del check-out anche se avevano detto che sarebbe rimasta. Io non lo consiglierei affatto. Penso che un hotel così dovrebbe trattare meglio i propri clienti.,1,2011,08,27
35,Gli extra un furto!,"Le camere sono grandi e luminose, la posizione e' ottima. Ma la colazione a 25 euro a persona al giorno e' troppo cara cosi come le bibite dal frigo bar, una bottiglietta di perrier da 33 ml costa 4,5 euro un po' troppo. La piscina e' un mq, poccolissima!",3,2011,08,24
35,bellissimo,"hotel spettacolare con servizio impeccabile. camere grandi (e noi avevamo soltanto la doppia superior) e bagno enorme con vasca idromassaggio e doccia. se proprio si vuole trovare una pecca, il bagno non aveva aspiratore. colazione ottima e abbondante! con ampia scelta tra pesce,formaggi,carne,uova e bevande",5,2011,08,13
35,"Muy buen hotel, pero falta ambiente, hospitalidad.","Nos alojamos a mitad de junio, mi señora y nuestra hija de 20 meses. Lo primero, y de agradecer,  nos dieron una habitación superior a la reservada y lo segundo nos hicieron pagar la habitación antes de sacar las maletas del coche. Ojo, hotel de 5* Gl, las maletas las saqué yo del coche y como no se fían de uno, el dinero por delante.
La sensación que te queda en recepción es de personal muy frío que sólo hace su trabajo, parecen robots.
La habitación espectacular, enorme, limpia, buenas vistas y baño y ducha de película.
Otra, los niños a partir de 2 años pagan, cuando pudieron y sin venir a cuento que mi hija que tiempo tiene. Creo que ya me han insultado bastante.
El parking, por dejarlo al exterior sin un mal tejadillo que lo proteja de las inclemencias del tiempo, 25 euros. 
El buffet, cualquier hotel de 4 estrellas de cadena española, es igual o similar. No justifica el precio.
Por causas ajenas a nuestra voluntad, debimos permanecer en Barcelona unas horas más con lo que contratamos a partir de las 12:00 horas una habitación estandar. Habitación normalita, con vistas a un patio, nada del otro mundo y no compensa el precio.
En resumen, si solo buscas buena habitación y darte un capricho, adelante, si buscas además un poco de trato agradable y sentirte a gusto, hay otros muchos que lo consiguen sin tanta estrella.",4,2011,08,06
35,Molto comodo,"Ubicazione eccezionale per visitare la città e per prendere il traghetto. Camera molto ampia (50 m) dal cui balcone si ha una vista spettacolare sul porto e la città. Colazione perfetta. La macchina custodita 24h. Personale disponibile. Fermata bus scoperti per il giro della città davanti all'hotel. Tv con un solo canale Rai, prezzi frigo bar alti. Nella ns camera, la 504, la connessione a Internet non sempre funzionava. Non e' un albergo di charme ma ha tutto quel che serve. La posizione e il parcheggio o garage ne fanno sicuramente un motivo in più  per cui sara'  sempre il nostro albergo di Barcellona.",4,2011,07,19

35,"Ottima qualità prezzo, ma che rigidezza del servizio....","La Camera ampia e spaziosa, un'enomre vetrata che dava sullo skyline della città. L'hotel si trova al porto vicino al maestoso WBarcellona ma, decisamente, più a buon mercato e non distantissimo dalla Rambla raggiungibile a piedi in soli 8 minuti!! La pulizia delle camere è perfetta, sopra lo standard europeo, colazione completa, era inclusa nel prezzo, ma per noi italiani forse anche troppo abbondante... WIFI perfetto in sala ristorante ma il segnale in camera si abbassava notevolmente, Room service ok, ma abbiamo, purtroppo trovato un eccessiva rigidità nel personale forse non all'altezza di un hotel a 5stelleGL!! Tutto, anche la richiesta più banale come di una mela da acquistare al banco del bar/ristorante doveva passare attraverso il room service che costituisce il filtro esclusivo della ristorazione... il ristorante è povero nel menù ed il personale adibito non è particolarmente accogliente, per non dire scortese... solo questo fa scendere di due pallini il nostro giudizio!

En cuanto al desayuno no compensa en el hotel, ya que  a la trasera hay una plaza con  múltiples bares donde se puede desayunar contundente por menos de 15 euros la pareja. 
Hasta aqui todo bien, pero el problema del hotel es el ruido. Imposible dormir antes de las 12 de la noche. A cada lado esta la salida de un ferry y el ruido es  atronador. Por otra parte los remolcadores  se pasan el día con el motor en marcha y eso es ruido",2,2011,05,29

Infatti la pulizia, la cortesia del personale e la bellezza degli arredi, rendono l'Eurostars davvero unico, ancor di più se si pensa che si trova nel Word Trade Center di Bacellona e quindi sotto la funivia che porta al Montjuic.

Unangenehm war die Kälte im Zimmer. ich habe keinen regler gefunden. Kollegen berichteten, sie hätte die Heizung in ihrem Zimmer unproblematisch heraufdrehen können, andere sagten, trotz Höherdrehens sei es kalt geblieben. ""Coole Eleganz"" also, auch die Einrichtung. dass es abgewohnt sei, was manche Einträge sagen, kann ich nicht bestätigen.
Sehr gutes Frühstücksbuffet. Personal etwas hölzern und unpersönlich, was aber an unserer großen Gruppe gelegen haben mag.",3,2011,01,27
35,bello ma non perfetto,"Tutto perfetto, eccetto per quanto segue:
- la mia suite (stanza da bagno doppia, camera da letto, salottino, terrazza) nel salottino non aveva un divano ma solo un tavolo di cristallo con 4 sedie...questa 'e la pecca piu' grossa, perchè alla fine la stanza rimane inutilizzata!
- l'aria condizionata non è perfettamente silenziosa
- l'isolamento della porta-finestra sul terrazzino non è un gran che
- la colazione costa 24euro+iva on top al prezzo della camera",4,2010,11,29
35,Gute Lage mit einigen Makeln,"Das Hotel liegt direkt am bzw. besser im Meer und ganz in der Nähe der berühmten ""La Rambla""; d.h. in Zentrumsnähe. Allerdings war bei der Ankunft das Gepäck in ein falsches Zimmer geliefert worden, so dass erst noch eine intensive Suche notwendig war, um es wieder zu finden. Die Zimmer sind sehr gut eingerichtet mit einem großen Bad (Badewanne + separate große Dusche); doch sie sind sehr hellhörig, so dass der TV-Genuss des Nachbars deutlich zu hören war. Das Frühstück ist exzellent (!!!): sehr große Auswahl und ständig frischer Nachschub. Wer in der Bar bzw. dem Restaurant etwas essen möchte, sollte viel Zeit mitbringen.",4,2010,11,08
35,Ausgangspunkt für einen unvergesslichen Trip,"Luxuriöses Hotel am Hafen (für Kreuzfahrtschiffe) unweit der Ramblas. Direkt vor dem Hotel ist jeweils eine Haltestelle der beiden Busunternehmen, die Hop-On/Hop-Off Stadtrundfahrten durchführen, was sehr empfehlenswert ist.
Wir hatten im Rahmen einer Sonderaktion eine Marina Suite gebucht, die schlichtweg der Hammer war (rießengroß, super Ausblick, toll eingerichtet).
Das Frühstück war sehr reichhaltig und frisch.
Das Personal sehr freundlich und professionell.
Ganz klare Empfehlung!",5,2010,10,12
35,"albergo perfetto, ristorante meraviglioso","L'albergo è bellissimo: sul mare, in una zona tranquilla, il centro si raggiunge a piedi abbastanza agevolmente (per noi che viaggiavamo con una bambina di due anni è stato utile il passeggino) . 
Il ristorante dell'albergo è davvero divino.
Ogni tanto per il fine settimana si trovano tariffe interessanti, altrimenti è un po' costoso.",4,2010,10,03
35,Modernes Hotel für Städteurlaub,"Zentrale Lage direkt am Hafen, eher Business- als Familienhotel, Service außergewöhnlich gut, mehrere Rezeptionisten deutschsprachig, sehr aufmerksam und hilfsbereit. Zimmer modern und geräumig, Frühstück extra (etwas teuer), Ramblas und Viertel Gotic sowie die Strandpromenade in Laufnähe. Empfehlenswert: Stadtrundfahrt Hop-on-Hop-Off zur ersten Orientierung",4,2010,10,01
35,Topspot am Hafen,"Modernes 5 star Hotel am Hafen in unmittelbarer Nähe zum Zentrum (rambla)
Kompetentes Service auch das business center ist ok
Besuchte das Haus als Organisator eines Kongresses mit 300 Teilnehmern - gute Kongressinfrastruktur
Schöne Zimmer mit teilweise toller Aussicht auf den Hafen oder die Altstadt
In 20 min vom Flughafen erreichbar - Taxikosten € 15
Hotelrestaurant ok aber die Tapasbars und Restaurants der Umgebung können mehr.",5,2010,09,15
35,viel fußweg sehr unpersönlich und anonym,"wir waren im august im hotel. der fussweg vom unteren rand der ramblas dorthin ist nicht zu unterschätzen, man läuft mindestes 10-15 min. die meisten gäste nutzen jedoch taxis. vor dem hotel gibt es eine bushaltestelle mit einer linie. das hotel befindet sich an den anlegestellen für die kreuzfahrtschiffe, man kann an- und abfahrt beobachten vom pool oder der terrasse aus. 
beim einchecken fanden wir äußerst höfliches und nettes personal, dicker pluspunkt. das zimmer war sehr groß, das bett auch, das bad riesig und mit netten hygieneartikeln in einer geschenkbox ausgestattet. an der seite gab es eine kofferablage. die wand daneben war durch das kofferabstellen sehr verschmutzt, hätte gereinigt werden können.
am frühen nachmittag sind wir an den pool gegangen, dieser war übervoll, miniklein und wir mussten fast um die letzte liege kämpfen. insgesamt wirkte der poolbereich nicht sehr einladend und eher lieblos platziert. 
die aussicht auf die stadt abends wie am tag ist natürlich fantastisch.
insgesamt würde ich nicht nochmal in das hotel gehen, es ist viel zu groß, viel zu anonym und wenn überhaupt nur für tagungen oder kongresse zu empfehlen.
es fehlt die liebe zum detail und das besondere etwas.",3,2010,09,08
35,BELLISSIMO MA CON QUALCHE RISERVA....ATTENTI ALLA SVEGLIA!!,"Ho soggiornato con il mio ragazzo presso questo hotel per 6 notti nella settimana centrale di agosto. A livello strutturale non vi è alcuna considerazione negativa, infatti sia i luoghi comuni che le camere giustificano ampiamente la categoria altissima di questo albergo. Le camere in particolar modo sono enormi (noi eravamo in una city suite ma anche le camere standard offrono spazi molto ampi), arredate con raffinatezza e assoltamente consone per soddisfare tutte le esigenze, il set di cortesia fornito poi è da mille e una notte. Inoltre cosa molto importante sono strutturate in modo da proteggere il sonno degli ospitti e vi assicuro che non si sente minimamente il rumore delle navi che arrivano e partono proprio sotto le finestre. Il personale è estremamente cortese, il minimo problema è risolto in un batter d'occhio(mettete però in conto che bisognerà elargire qualche mancia qua e là...).Ora veniamo alle note dolenti ovvero la posizione , non credete alle immagini che propongono su internet l'edificio che si vede nelle immagini , una specie di arena è destinato all'hotel solo per metà e si tratta della metà che da sulla città non sul mare, quindi nessuna camera è frontemare al massimo è vista mare laterale!!!non è troppo distante dal centro nè dal maremagnum (20 minuti a piedi e sarete sia in metro che nel centro commerciale)ma se di giorno sotto il sole è ancora ammissibile fare una passeggiata al posto di fermarsi in uno dei punti di ristoro posizionati sotto l'albergo(niente di particolare...)la sera quando fa più piacere gironzolare un pò ci si imbatte in parecchi barboni e clochard che stazionano al di fuori dell'hotel senza che nessuno dica niente, la spiaggia è a 2 fermate di metro. La piscina sul tetto e oltremodo minuscola, serve solo per rinfrescarsi non certamente per nuotare e inoltre il numero di lettini a disposizione degli ospiti e ridicolo anche perchè il solarium è enorme e vi sarebbe possibilità di farci stare tantissime persone in più. La mattina ci dovevamo svegliare all'alba per prenderne 2 e la cosa ridicola e che gli altri erano occupati da persone inesistenti che posavano gli asciugamani e poi tornavano a occuparli solo dopo 5 /6 ore. Questa penso sia la cosa più negativa , in un albergo 5 stelle dovermi svegliare alle 8 e correre a occupare lo sdraio mi sembra assurdo!!!Inoltre la vasca idromassaggio sempre sul solarium oltre a essere piccola è stata occupata incessantemente dalle stesse persone per tutto il mio soggiorno senza che nessuno nonostante il divieto di sostare per più di 10 minuti prendesse il minimo provvediemento.Nonostante tutto prendere il sole in cima a questo edificio con la vista offerta e la tranquillità degli ospiti (vige silenzio, nessuna baraonda di famiglie chiassose o bambini pestiferi)ripaga abbondantemente dello stress da sveglia!! I costi ovviamente sono elevati : colazione 25 € a persona ogni mattina, 2 caffè e 1 acqua da 33 cl al bar della piscina ben 11€, ma questo è assolutamente coerente con la qualità e il prestigio dell'albergo. Il panorama è superbo e posso affermare che se dovessi tornare a Barcellona in inverno (senza dover usufruire della piscina) tornerei sicuramente in questo hotel.",4,2010,08,31
35,5 Stelle Lusso... niente da aggiungere,"Un 5 stelle nella media dei 5 stelle, posizione fantastica (a 500m dalle Ramblas), con parcheggio Valet, viste mozzafiato dalle camere (sull'intero porto di Barcelona). Camere enormi con corridoio, pre-ingresso, stanza da letto. Il centro benessere sito all'ultimo piano gode di una vista fantastica, non è troppo grande ma funzionale. Possiede una terrazza che domina tutta la città di Barcelona dal mare. La colazione è superba, il personale davvero gentile e premuroso (un must per i 5*****). Ha sempre delle offerte molto interessanti per essere un 5 stelle, un modo intelligente di attrarre clienti e offrire il massimo della qualità e dei servizi. Consigliatissimo!",5,2010,08,30
35,Ottimo Hotel,"Ottima Posizione sul mare. Bella la piccola piscina e la jacuzzi con la palestra sulla terrazza dell'hotel con vista su porto di Barcellona.
La cucina internazionale è varia e buona. 
Le camere sono grandi ben curate e con un arredamento discreto tipico delle grandi catene.
A 15 minuti di cammino si può raggiungere la Rambla oppure passeggiare in riva al mare.
Un hotel molto bello e rilassante.",4,2010,08,20
35,lusso sfrenato,"Hotel 5 stelle GL , non ci si può aspettare che un lusso sfrenato,  camere stupende  molto grandi, la struttura dell'hotel ricorda molto uno stadio, immenso,  e la posizione è molto buona, vicino al centro. Costi naturalmente elevati, ma la qualità si paga...",5,2010,03,30
35,bastante buen hotel de cuidad,"la ubicacion es fantastica,solo que tienes un poco de ruido de los barcos.fui por negocios y keria un sitio para relajarme y la habitacion es lo mas importante para mi.la encontre de muy buena calidad,grande espacioso y todo de buena calidad.recuerden,es mas un hotel para gente de negocios y no para disfrutar de ello con tu familia.todo los servicios muy cordial y con respecto.los precios son bastante caro(yo estuve en un doble superior)
puedes buscar un buen precio por otros companias en el internet.
volvere otra vez seguro.",5,2010,03,27
35,Bueno,Merece la pena.Gran hotel para relajarse dentro del fantastico puerto de Barcelona,4,2010,01,07
35,Lujo y Amplitud en el centro de BCN,"El Hotel en general muy bonito. Atención buena, y buen servicio de habitaciones. Las habitaciones son bastante grandes, y suelen tener ducha y bañera hidromasaje, a parte de vestidor. La piscina, aunque pequeña, es agradable, con vistas al puerto de BCN. Tiene tambien una zona SPA al lado de la piscina, que está muy bien para relajarse.",5,2009,12,14
35,Un bell'hotel,"Siamo stati due notti al Grand Marina Eurostars di Barcellona.
La location: posto all'interno del World Trade Center, l'hotel è su un bel molo, accanto alla Rambla del Mar dove si trovano un centro commerciale, il cinema IMax, ed un paio di ristoranti un po' ""turistici""...ma sicuramente è pieno di vita.
Certo ci sono altri hotel piu' centrali, direttamente sulla Rambla o  nella città vecchia, ma il Grand Marina ha la virtu' di essere in una zona decisamente meno rumorosa.
Unico neo, a proposito di rumore, sono le stanze non particolarmente ""insonorizzate"": si sentono i rumori delle altre stanze e le chiacchiere nei corridoi..ma, salvo avere dei vicini particolarmente rumorosi, nulla che dia davvero disturbo. Certo non è come avere sotto la finestra il caos delle vie del centro!
Le camere sono arredate elegantemente, i bagni sono molto belli e c'è l'idromassaggio anche nella camera standard, TV schermo piatto ed un armadio ben attrezzato, incluso asse e ferro da stiro!
I letti sono comodissimi, i cuscini perfetti con la possibilità di richiederne di specifici per cervicale o altre esigenze.
Noi avevamo prenotato la camera non inclusiva della stanza, e la colazione ci è costata 50 euro...un po' cara, ma il buffet, per chi ama mangiare parecchio a colazione, era notevole e curatissimo.
Il servizio di reception è efficiente, non c'è che dire.
Insomma: un paio di notti all'Eurostars non ci hanno delusi affatto ed hanno reso confortevoli i nostri momenti di relax!",4,2009,11,16
35,Inmejorable,"Es uno de los hoteles que mas me gusta en el mundo,por eso celebré mi boda alli y fue inmejorable, el servicio bueno, muy profesional y Diana que me ayudo a organizar, fantastica.Te mando un besote x si lees esto,no cambies nunca neni !!
Volvere una y otra vez siempre que pueda.
Es un edificio con mucha amplitud, respetan mucho los espacios,
las vistas son envidiables, perfectas para disfrutar del lienzo de la ciudad, sobretodo al amanecer.",5,2009,10,01
35,Fantastico Hotel,"Camera deluxe spaziosa e pulita. Bagno in marmo molto bello con vasca idromassaggio e doppio lavandino, ampia doccia antiscivolo. Nel Save ci sta anche il notebook. Buffet colazione (a pagamento: 25 euro per persona), ma sempre nel WTC ci sono dei bar dove vanno i collaboratori degli uffici e partecipanti dei seminari con buoni croissons. Al bar al primo piano servono buoni drinks. Allo staff posso solo dire COMPLIMENTS! Inoltre questo hotel è davvero in una posizione fantastica, 3 min. dalla Rambla, 5 min. dal Maremagnum, 20 min. da Barcelonetta, invece per una passeggiata fino al port olimpic ci vuole 45 min. Sul tetto c'è una piccola piscina, ma sufficiente e un bar - ideale per una pausa tra una gita e l'altra. Per la qualità del hotel però mi aspetto la connessione Wi-Fi gratis e in camera.",5,2009,09,26
35,bellissimo albergo posizione super,"Un vero 5 stele le camere bellissime il bagno anchè, albergo sembra nuovissimo, la posizione ottima a 2 minuti dalla Rambla davvero un ottimo albergo. La piscina sopra il tetto un po' picolla ma comunnque l'albergo bellissimo. Sicuramente se torno a Barcellona tornerò in questo a",5,2009,07,30
35,Un verdadero 5 estrellas,Hotel muy elegante y con 5 estrellas verdaderas. El desayuno es increible,5,2009,06,07
35,Servicio deficiente,"No es la primera vez que me alojaba en este hotel, siempre por asunto de negocios. Éste es un hotel que, por su ubicación, resulta muy cómodo, nada más. 

El hotel en sí se puede decir que no es lo que uno se espera de un hotel de categoría 5 estrellas GL; la decoración deja mucho que desear; el personal no se diferencia del de un 3 o 4 estrellas; y el restaurante es realmente mediocre, una muestra más de que la restauración en los hoteles no merece la pena.

La verdad es que siempre había estado pocas horas en este hotel durante mis estancias, pero en esta última he podido ""disfrutar"" durante más tiempo de sus instalaciones y me he convencido que este 5 estrellas GL solo tiene la categoria en su ubicación privilegiada.",1,2008,10,27
35,ottimo hotel,"Ho passato una settimana in questo hotel per motivi di lavoro. Un hotel stupendo con un servizio impeccabile. Anche a livello di struttura congressuale, nulla da dire efficienti e delle sale riunioni stupende  tutte affacciate sul mare. Le camere sempre pulite e spaziose, con un servizio in camera puntualissimo... Nulla da dire, tranne per l'aria condizionata che nelle parti comuni dell'hotel era eccessiva e ha creato qualche problemino di salute ad alcune persone del gruppo... Per il resto lo consiglio vivamente anche per la sua posizione a 10 min. dalle ramblas e direttamente sul mare, vicino al centro commerciale maremagnum, dove si trovano negozi e ristoranti, servizio taxi di fronte all'hotel e anche servizio pullman turistici.....",5,2008,09,15
35,Vergonzoso,"Bueno simplemente decir que este ha sido uno de los peores hoteles en los que estado. A pesar de la buena predisposición de los empleados, la estancia general ha sido desastrosa.

Este es un hotel de reciente creación a pesar de ello las instalaciones son deficientes. La ducha estaba atascada y comenzaron a salir bolas de pelo de ella (asqueoroso). Dimos parte de ello y a la mañana siguiente todo seguía igual. La relación calidad precio de sus servicios no es buena, el restaurante es mediocre para un hotel 5 estrellas G.L. 

Podría contar un montón de detalles, como el ruido proveniente de los cruceros que no nos dejó dormir durante parte de la noche, y la increible perpotencia del ""subdirector"", un señor pelirrojo que ante nuestras quejas no hizo más que ignorarnos y tratarnos despectivamente.

La verdad es que no conociamos esta cadena hotelera. Lo que si es claro es que nunca más confiaremos en ella, por lo menos en este hotel.",2,2008,07,20
35,"Fin de año, cena de Gala en el mar","Despues de mucho años he decidido y como regalo a mi pareja volver a Barcelona, al Hotel Grand Marina.
Desde la entrada al Hotel, con el acompañamiento del Recepcionista a la habitación hasta la salida, el personal ha sido cercano y profesional en todo momento. Pero el momento álgido ha sido la cena de gala de fin de año, el montaje de musica, iluminación y la tematica de la noche, daba la sensación de haber zarpado a altamar, con por lo menos 9 cantantes de opera amenizando la noche, hasta los camareros vestían de marineros!!! Todos sirviendo al ritmo de la musica.
La habitación en excelente estado y perfectamente limpia cumpe con la expectativa de 5 estrellas GL. 
Muchas gracias por una estancia maravillosa.
Punto negativo: En Barcelona parece que no hay Taxis",5,2008,01,01
35,Excelente Hotel el Grand Marina,"Yo me fui de viaje a españa, barcelona mas precisamente, con mi pareja por el mes de febrero y la verdad ke la pasamos bárbaro.
Nos hospedamos en un hotel de esta importante cadena hotelera llamada eurostars.
El hotel se llamaba Grand Marina, ke esta ubicado en el edificio oeste del moll de barcelona y la verdad ke fue el mejor trato ke recibimos de todos los hoteles en los ke nos hospedamos anteriormente. Ademas las instalaciones son impresionantes y muy confortables... a veces no nos daban ganas de salir del hotel de lo bueno ke estaba =P

Y en cuanto a ciudad, realmente nos encanto barcelona y si volvemos, nos volveremos a alojar en ese hotel.
",5,2007,05,09
35,muy satisfecha,"Estoy de acuerdo en que es caro, pero toda barcelona es cara si lo que quieres es estar bien.
Yo personalmente quede contentisima con el hotel, especialmente el personal, super atentos, viajaba con mi marido y mi hijo de 2 años, y os puedo decir que nunca hicieron ningun feo por el niño. Use todos los dias el servicio de habitaciones y eran muy corretos y rapidos.

Todo el mundo en general fue maravilloso, tambien esta muy bien ubicado para conocer la ciudad, justo enfrente para el autobus turistico, ahi taxi siempre, y es ideal para pasear viendo el mar.
Personalmente, lo mejor de nuestras vacaciones el hotel, el resto de barcelona tendria que mejorar.
",5,2006,11,26
35,Ein absolutes Spitzenhotel!,"Das Hotel ist ein absoluter Traum. 
Trotz dem ersten Schreck darüber, dass das Hotel von aussen doch recht klotzig aussieht, waren wir vom Hotel selbst und der Lage im Hafen absolut begeistert. Die Einrichtung der Zimmer war sehr geschmackvoll - im ganzen Hotel hat man den EIndruck, man wäre auf einem Kreuzfahrtschiff unterwegs. Dunkle, edle Hölzer und schöne Materialien. Wir hatten ein riesiges Zimmer, mit sehr großem Bad mit Whirlwanne und extra Dusche. Genial!
Sehr nettes, freundliches und zuvorkommendes Personal.
Man kann gut zu Fuß in die Altstadt und auch zum Strand laufen und wir haben nicht einmal Taxi oder U-Bahn genutzt (ausser Taxi zum Flughafen). 
Barcelona ist eine tolle Stadt und wenn wir wieder hinfahren, werden wir ganz sicher wieder das ""Grand Marina Eurostars"" buchen. Der Preis und die 5 Sterne sind absolut berechtigt. Den Mitarbeitern von der Reception noch ein großes Dankeschön für das Upgrade in das super Zimmer mit Balkon und Blick auf die Altstadt und den Hafen!!
