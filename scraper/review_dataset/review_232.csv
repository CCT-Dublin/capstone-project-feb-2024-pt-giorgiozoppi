232,Nice Downtown Location,"We had such a lovely stay there at Wynn's Hotel! From the moment we walked in, to our check out! Staff were super friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed our breakfast each morning and were happy with the variety offered. Rooms was very comfortable and the hotel location was awesome! 

We enjoyed visiting in the onsite pub each evening and meeting some locals! Bar tender was awesome and super friendly!",5,2024,10,17
232,"Old fashioned hotel, superb breakfast.","Lovely old fashioned hotel, nicely decorated and very clean.  Superb breakfast options, including plated full Irish, eggs Benedict, in addition to scones, fruit, cereal, yogurt etc.  
We asked for a room on the top floor and it was quiet.    Thick walls, so we could not hear other guests.   We asked for a fan, which was quickly produced, and glad we did because the room was on the warm side even in October.  
A few issues - internet was not particularly strong and it dropped frequently.   There was no tv reception in any of the hotel the week we stayed.   Staff was helpful and friendly as the Irish people are.",4,2024,10,17
232,Wynns Hotel: A Must-Visit in Dublin,"I recently stayed in Wynns Hotel and will certainly be returning again soon. The staff at Wynns were consistently accommodating and attentive, ensuring I had a positive and enjoyable experience in Dublin. The rooms are spotless and beautifully decorated. Will definitely be recommending to my friends and colleagues when they come to visit Dublin.",5,2024,10,05
232,"Great location, phenomenal breakfast","The location was great; the LUAS tram was right outside and took you all over. The room was comfortable and breakfast was amazing. The coffee, too, was so smooth. We found out it was Robert Roberts coffee. Front desk staff was super helpful. There was quite a bit of street noise since they put us in the front of the building.",5,2024,09,21
232,overpriced for minimal services,"no parking did not get value for money at all.
nearby car parks shut at 9pm sunday and cost me 42 euros for 1 day
paid for breakfast but did not get it as the dining room is small and was full when i was there on a monday morning. i had to grab breakfast in spar next door. For business guests who have 9am appointments etc having to wait for breakfast room to empty is unacceptable. strangers are forced to share breakfast tables because of this dining room constraint. i paid 200 euros for 1 night and feel it was a rip off, given the hotel limitations.
Room was beautiful and spotless.",1,2024,09,15
232,No very happy,"I always loved this hotel as my late father was a regular visitor and i would often meet with him there but the previous visit and the latest visit was not good as a vegetarian i asked at the carvery what did they have for vegetarians or vegans and i was informed VEGETABLES, i stated that that was not very good and i asked for the Manager and i was informed 'there he is' i could not see him as he was hidden behind the counter, i then paid for 2 Turkey meals  €38.00 and 3 portions of vegetables which cost €10.50 i stated that was expensive and the response from the cashier was 'i dont make the prices'
I sat down and again asked for the Manager who came over and i stated that it was dreadful that thete was no provisions for Vegetarians and Vegans in a hotel in the middle of Dublin he said there was salad or pasta , i stated that i was not offered that at the counter and it was too late now as i did not want to waste the veg i had and the same thing happened on the previous visit, i asked what was the name if the General Manager which he supplied but no apology from anyone re same 
The menu could easily be adapted to look after all tastes and improve customer care",2,2024,09,14
232,Fascinating Hotel,"Historical building with all the modern comfort you need. The staff was amazing and the location perfect. Great breakfast and even the coffee was good.
It is not the most quiet hotel given the location, but being open 24/7 and greeted by the sweet night porter makes up for that. We will be back.",5,2024,09,08
232,My new go to hotel in Dublin!,"You know that feeling when you open your room door for the first time with trepidation and are very pleasantly surprised? That's what I got at Wynn's. 

I was a little apprehensive as some of the more old style, traditional hotels can look lovely in photographs but be in dire need of an update in reality. My room was compact but spotlessly clean, finished beautifully and it genuinely looked like nobody else had ever used the bathroom before me; the grout was sparkling, the tiles and glass looked fresh from the box and there was absolutely none of the damp/mould/water marks that you so often encounter in hotel bathrooms. 

The tea and coffee facilities in the room were well stocked and again, spotlessly clean. The pillows and duvet were real hotel quality and I had a very comfortable night's sleep. 

The only two minor critiques of the room are things that cannot be helped - the view and the location of plug sockets. These did not bother me in the slightest but they were the only slight things I could say were not positives and I'd happily take the lack of view in return for the central location and the socket placement in return for the traditional building. 

The Luas is in front of the hotel and airport buses are less than 3 mins walk around the corner which made getting there and away again for my flight super simple. 

I had dinner in the bar the night of my arrival - a burger which didn't set the stars alight flavour wise but was a hearty meal with excellent service. The waitress and bar man were two of the best examples of service I experienced in a long time - quick, efficient, very warm and friendly whilst being totally professional. It was very reminiscent of the warm Irish welcome and service you would receive in establishments in days gone by. 

Breakfast was brilliant. Great service, tasty hot food and a nice selection. One of the nicest fry ups I've had in a while. 

I can be a very picky customer but Wynn's really has won me over. I think this will become my go to hotel when ever I visit Dublin from now on!",5,2024,08,30
232,Central location,"Excellent location for proximity to central Dublin. Red line LUAS stop directly at the front of the hotel.
Room was compact , clean well serviced.
Unfortunately, we could hear the kitchen fan and noise from the laneway below.
The internet was intermittent.
Staff very friendly and helpful.
Breakfast well presented.
Well presented historic charm.",4,2024,08,29
232,New favorite Dublin hotel,"I spent one night while helping my son move into graduate school at Trinity College. Wynn's is my new favorite hotel in Dublin. It has mid-19th Century charm but is entirely updated and exquisitely well-maintained. The restaurant was good for breakfast (though Eggs Benedict served in a bagel was a bit odd), and the bar was wonderful for both supper and conviviality with the bartender. The hotel was also very reasonably priced to be in the city center. I highly recommend it.",5,2024,08,27
232,Old Irish feel,"I so want to rate this hotel really highly, but it needs to polish up a little to compare with other historic hotels, especially at the price for the rooms. Stayed here twice - October 2023 and April 2024. The location is great, especially for someone using public transport, and the bar and breakfast room/dining room are lovely, with impeccable service and delicious food. Love that the bar and dining service, which includes an old style carvery, retain an old Irish feel and attract a local crowd. The larger upstairs rooms are comfortable enough but the furnishings need to be spruced up. The rooms can be VERY noisy from the trams below, and we even had a seagull that woke us up every morning. The newly refurbished downstairs rooms are lovely and quieter but smaller. Ours didn't include a desk, and the refrigerator hadn't been installed yet, both of which we prefer for a longer stay. So, my review is mixed, and we'll probably be branching out on our next trip to Dublin.",3,2024,08,24
232,Solid stay.,"We had a family room which had a great layout. The rooms are a little small but considering the excellent location and the price for being in a large city it was a great value. Clean rooms, great breakfast, friendly staff and we felt very safe. Great choice for Dublin.",5,2024,08,23
232,Ok location,"We chose Wynns as it was half way between the pick up point on the day tour we were doing and the drop off point. So it was in a good location, if you didn’t mind crossing the road to get to the hotel as the taxi can’t park out front due to the tram.
The rooms are an ok size, bathroom is a good size and the water pressure is really good. 
The bed is comfortable and pillow (which we had a lot of problems with on our trip) is better than most.
If you are unlucky like we were to get a room on the road side of the hotel it is very noisy. Between the buses, cars, trams, people. It also has very bad wifi service.",3,2024,07,26
232,Medical conference,"I recently stayed at Wynn’s Hotel.. Rooms were spotless, and well decorated. Hotel staff were incredibly friendly and went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed.  Conference room was well-equipped and comfortable, making it an ideal setting for our meetings. Location was ideal, with easy access to local attractions and transportation. Breakfast buffet was excellent, offering a wide variety of delicious options. Overall, really recommend the hotel.",5,2024,07,10
232,Great City Centre Hotel.,"My second stay in this excellent city hotel close to O`Connell Street and to both LUAS tram lines. My room was clean, comfortable and away from street noise. It offers a traditional hotel service, which is fairly unusual these days. An excellent table served breakfast is included. All the staff are friendly and helpful. It is a popular lunch spot for locals, tourists and business meetings in the spacious bar area. You would need to book for the lunch sitting.",4,2024,07,09
232,Saints and scholars bar,Wanted a nice glass of wine to celebrate July 4th. It was disgusting.  I got a glass of beer instead . Bartender not happy. No word of refund for difference. For a hotel of this caliber one would expect a decent wine. Very disappointing. Think I'll have to find somewhere else to celebrate.  ,1,2024,07,04
232,Don't overlook this gem,"The hotel is beautiful. The location is central to many sites. We walked to the Guinness Brewery among other things. The breakfast is fantastic — made to order, and the staff is absolutely top notch. True professionals. We loved our stay at the Wynn's.",5,2024,06,27
232,Would love to return here.,This is a charming and friendly old-fashioned hotel. Staff are very pleasant and the room was great. Perfect location if you want to visit central Dublin. O'Connell Street is around the corner and an easy walk to shopping on Henry Street or over the Ha'penny Bridge to Temple Bar.,5,2024,06,25
232,Beautiful hotel with amazing staff team,"Beautiful hotel, very clean with large comfortable rooms.  It had a lovely historic older worldly feel throughout alongside modern requirements  which was lovely.
The biggest thing that sets this hotel apart from others I have visited is the staff - they are amazing!
They really do go above and beyond to make sure you have the best possible experience.  The service that we recieved could not be faulted in the slightest, nothing was too small or a problem for them.
Can't thank you all enough; we had a wonderful, comfortable stay and you supported us to hold a very successful event whilst making everyone feel welcome, well looked after and thoroughly spoilt!",5,2024,06,14
232,Great place .,"I loved the location of the hotel although noisy since room was in the front. The gym was old and dirty and could have used a cleaning but was happy they had it. The free breakfast was a great perk and so many options. 
The staff was so nice and accommodating ! I asked for a fan since stuffy in the room and they gave me one as and they gave me a converter too for my charging cords. 
Next time in Dublin I would stay here but pick room away from street if possible.",4,2024,06,10
232,A charming hotel with a magnificent staff,"In 2018, we booked a Classic Twin Room at Wynn’s, and upon arrival, we were randomly given a twin room which we absolutely loved.  It was on a high floor at the back of the hotel, so it was quiet both day and night, and it had a walk-in shower which we appreciated for its safety and security.  The room was spacious, with twin beds, an upholstered easy chair, a large closet for storing luggage and hanging clothes, and a tray for making tea and coffee.  When making our reservation for May 2024, we requested the same room, and in their reply, the Wynn’s staff said that they could not guarantee the same room but that they’d do their best to honor our request.  In the end, our wish came true: we were given this room once again, and two weeks later, after traveling throughout Ireland and returning to Wynn’s for a couple of days before our flight home to the USA, the hotel made sure that we had the same room once again.  Now THAT is impeccable customer service!  Thanks to Wynn’s for honoring our special request, not once, but twice!

For us, the appeal of Wynn’s is its mix of both vintage décor and modern convenience.  Our room had a fireplace which probably provided heat in days gone by, but now it is a handsome architectural feature which makes the room look cozy.  Likewise, the bedroom retained much of its original décor, such as the ceiling mouldings and antique wallpaper, yet the bathroom was ultra-modern with brand-new fittings.

Breakfasts at Wynn’s are something to look forward to each morning.  You can choose from a menu of cooked-to-order dishes, such as a full Irish breakfast or eggs Benedict, or you can opt for other items such as pancakes.  In addition to your cooked-to-order hot meal, you are invited to help yourself to a table laden with beautiful baked goods (amazing scones!) and to a counter stocked with fresh fruit and yogurts.  The gentleman who served us each morning was someone we remembered from past visits, and he is not only a delightful man but also has the uncanny ability to remember what you ordered the day before and to ask if you’d like to have it again.  He is representative of the refined, professional service shown by every single member of the Wynn’s staff.

On weekdays, Wynn’s serves a beautiful carvery lunch which we enjoyed twice.  Served in the Saints and Scholars lounge, the lunch is reasonably priced and offers roasted meats, baked fish, and several different vegetable sides.  The food is beautifully prepared, and the portions are generous.

In the evening, we enjoyed going downstairs to the Saint and Scholars lounge for a pint or two in gorgeous surroundings.  We especially loved chatting with a gregarious barman named David, who has a brilliant sense of humor and looks after his guests with kindness and zeal.  We’d also like to compliment another barman, a young Trinity College student named Neil, who was amazingly friendly and attentive.

With its central location just steps away from O’Connell Street and a LUAS tram stop right outside its front door, Wynn’s is the perfect place to settle in when you’re spending a few days in Dublin.  Trinity College and the Book of Kells are within easy walking distance, as are many excellent pubs, restaurants, and shops.  The EPIC immigration museum is just around the corner, and a quick tram ride will take you to Heuston Station, Connolly Station, or the Busaras bus station (Busaras is actually a very easy walk from the hotel).  This was our third stay at Wynn’s, and we look forward to returning.

232,Great stay,Spent the night here with my 3 daughters. Easy access from train. Tram right outside to the 3 Arena as we were watching a concert. Amazing location right across from the GPO. Warm friendly staff. My daughter said they had the best showers lol. Great breakfast vast variety.Five stars.,5,2024,05,05
232,Absolutely perfect in every way,"Can’t give enough stars to this hotel. Perfect in every category. Location was so convenient to the buses, trams, restaurant and sites. The staff are incredible and go above and beyond. My room, overlooking Abbey St. had the comfiest bed and pillows anyone could ask for. Quiet, well ventilated and the heated towel bar and heated robe and slippers were an unexpected extra. I wish there was a Wynns Hotel in every city I travel to.",5,2024,04,26
232,Excellent!!,"Excellent location...all of the main attractions were at a walking distance...many good places to eat were close by...Excellent customer service...very pleasant and helpful staff and their breakfast is outstanding. Not going anywhere else on my next trip to Dublin.
Thank you for making my Dublin experience wonderful.

232,POOR SERVICE,"I LOSTMY APPETITE SHORTLY AFTER I SAT-DOWN! 
Shortly after sitting down for breakfast I had to visit the toilet and on my way i was given the toilet door code by a Manager or a supervisor standing next to the reception. As soon as I opened the toilet door I was almost sick from a very bad smell in the gent's toilet. Unfortunately I had to use the toilet but I couldn't t wait to leave. On my way out I met the gentleman who give me the code and whispered to him that there is a really bad smell in the toilet. His response shocked me. He said. that the toilets did not not open until midday and that a cleaner would clean the toilets at 12pm.  I don't think who ever this gentleman was a manger or a supervisor but I know for sure this person should not be working in the hospitality industry and should not be dealing with customers.it was an extremely disappointing response and unfortunately I didn't enjoy my breakfast as a result of this unpleasant experience.",2,2024,04,23
232,Excellent stay.,"April weekend visit. Food, bar service and staff attention all 5*. Location is excellent, right in the city centre. Rooms have all the amenities that you require and reception staff where only to keen to provide any assistance or information required. Definitely would stay again.",5,2024,04,21
232,Ten out of Ten,"Stayed for 3 nights over St Patrick’s weekend. A great breakfast, friendly staff. Best location. There were 4 of us. 
What a lovely touch. A sprig of shamrock and St Patrick’s day card was left in our rooms.
Will definitely be staying there again. Loved the Paul Costello complimentary Shampoo and shower gel.",5,2024,03,29
232,"Convenient, friendly, clean, fantastic hotel.","Spacious, clean and comfortable suite.  Delicious breakfast, great selection.  Friendly staff at reception, breakfast, bar and cleaners.  Central for getting around town, tram stops outside the hotel, bus stops in the next street, walking distance to Temple Bar!",5,2024,03,21
232,Great location and great stay,"Had a really excellent stay here at the start of March. You can't beat it for location, close to everything you want to do and see in Dublin, which was a great bonus given the reasonable price. Staff were really friendly and helpful, room really comfortable and a great breakfast the next day. Would recommend and will be back.",5,2024,03,21
232,Classy hotel fabulous location,"Wow what a fantastic stay we had at the Wynns! Went on the recommendation of friends. Beautiful hotel, spotless clean and a really lovely welcoming atmosphere. The character of the hotel is fabulous, nothing is too much trouble for the staff and breakfast was yummy, had the eggs Benedict… gorgeous. Thankyou we will definitely return 
Grace & John Connolly",5,2024,03,21
232,Excellent accommodation and friendly staff.,"Had an amazing 4 nights staying at Wynns hotel on my recent family trip to Ireland. Great location and very friendly staff who couldn’t do enough for us. Situated right in the heart of Dublin just off O’Connell street we where close to everything. I travel quite a bit for work and have stayed in many hotels but Wynns has to be one of the top 5 for me. Very spacious and well appointed rooms, not to mention the beautiful restaurant and welcoming bar area ( too welcoming on St Patrick’s day ) thank you to all the staff at Wynns hotel for making our family holiday one we won’t forget.",4,2024,03,21
232,Amazing St Pattys Weekend,"I stayed in Wynns hotel over St. Pattys day weekend and what a gift that was! The location of the hotel is so central we could have taken part in the parade.

After a long journey from California the last thing we wanted to do was wait at a check in as we were exhausted. Thankfully the friendly girls on reception allowed us to check in early which was an added bonus which we were grateful for.  

There is a lift up to the rooms which saved carrying up our bags. A total bonus compared to our last hotel in Dublin! 

After touring around town during St. Pattys day we got to enjoy a delicious dinner in the lounge from the chefs on duty and drinks in the Saints and scholars bar. A total rewind to olden Ireland.

We had a wonderful comfortable sleep in the hotel for the few nights we stayed. Our room was spacious, comfortable beds and pillows, a nice shower unit and a good sized tv (not that we used it haha!) and quite at night.

We received a delightful breakfast for our stay with a good variety of flavoursome options and a continental option too. The waiting staff are very helpful and informative in this breakfast lounge 

We were sad to leave this hotel as it felt a home away from home. If you are considering staying we would definitely recommend staying as you could not get better! Thank you for an amazing memorable trip.

232,Dump is too good a name for this place. The most miserable night I have ever experienced.,"If I could give this place a minus star rating I would. Stayed here for one night (27th Feb) and it was the most miserable night in a hotel I have ever endured.

My room (246) seemed to be part of the lift! In fact if I had moved my bed into the lift it wouldn't have been any noisier. This lift noise kept up all night long!

Add to that a towel rail in the bathroom that wouldn't turn off despite switching it off at the switch which took a while to find as the label has faded away to almost nothing. Switched it off before I went down to the bar to meet friends as the room was like a sauna. Came back to the room around 02.00 to find it still on, so hot in fact that I couldn't put my hand on the rail and the room stiflingly hot. So I spent the next couple of hours turning the air con off and on to try and get the temperature to a level where a human being could actually sleep.

To no avail, so I then tried to open the windows. LOL I think these windows were last opened during the Easter Rising! I managed to force one open about 4 inches (is this even legal having non opening windows in a hotel room?) in a desperate attempt to get some fresh air into the room. This was around 04.00.

That lasted until around 05.30 when what I thought was a Jumbo Jet taking off from the roof nearly deafened me! Now I understand why this hotel does not want you opening the damn windows! I assume this noise was the hotel's antiquated Heating and Ventilation system starting up, I suffered twenty minutes of this racket before I could stand it no longer and forced the antique window closed.

And now I was back to lying on a bed in a sauna! I finally gave up trying to sleep at 08.00 and went down to breakfast feeling like death as I had not slept at all. Breakfast was good which is the only positive thing I can say about this over priced doss house.

After breakfast I then tried to talk to the receptionist about my room's problems. And what a waste of time that was. She was obviously completely uninterested and along with that seemed to be having problems understanding what I was saying. I can't think why.

I checked out at 11.00 with the same receptionist asking me if I had had a good time! My dear girl, I would have had a better time being interrogated by the Spanish Inquisition than by staying in this so called hotel. By this time I was completely fed up, bone tired and disgusted by my experience. She got a very curt no!

So dear readers, find yourself somewhere else to stay in Dublin as there are far superior rooms to be had in many other hotels. And if you do stay in this god forsaken dump then make sure you do not get room 246 or any of the other rooms that surround the lift shaft! You will thank me later.",1,2024,03,17
232,Location location location,"We chose one of the newly done up rooms on the first floor , we were pleased with the comfort of the room , Good room facilities,  tea making , safe , hairdryer , air con , comfortable beds and bedding . As the first floor rooms are to the front of the hotel there is a certain amount of street noise while the trams are running , nothing that disturbed our nights sleep. The breakfast was very nice , plenty of choice and served by the friendliest and most attentive staff. We were able to leave our luggage In reception we checked  out and able to collect when we were ready to travel home . Of course location is excellent right on the green line tram line which connects to hueston train station  and a block away from the red line , which will take you to stephens green , Trinity etc",4,2024,03,15
232,"Very classy hotel, great value!","Excellent customer service.  Rooms are nicely decorated, well maintained and clean.  The included breakfast was delicious and freshly made.  As I was doing a tour very early in the morning, they were able to accommodate me with a prearranged continental breakfast.  I would highly recommend.",5,2024,03,11
232,Fun family weekend,Took my family (2A and 1C) up to Dublin the weekend for some family activities. Location of the hotel was perfect for us. Great central location and very close to all public transport within the city. We received a newly refurbished room on the 1st floor. Great breakfast and really friendly staff. Our daughter is already asking about our next stay.,5,2024,03,10
232,Lovely old hotel.,"This is a very lovely, historic hotel. The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. The breakfast is wonderful with a good selection in a nice bright dining room. The scones were delicious! Staff were very friendly and helpful. There is also a bar where you can get a good dinner.  There are many local pubs within walking distance as well as the River Liffey and the picturesque bridges that cross it. I would stay there again.",5,2024,03,06
232,"Lovely, clean central hotel - excellent staff!","We treated ourselves to a night in Wynns hotel last night. Wonderful independent hotel in the City centre. Our bathroom was without power when we arrived, but this was sorted in minutes! We were offered drinks by way of compensation, absolutely not needed, but we appreciated the offer! We had a fabulous sleep in Room 542  with a jacuzzi bath and a lovely fresh cooked breakfast. Love the staff in Wynns, always friendly and willing to help!",5,2024,03,03

232,Old Wynns Gone Forever,"Booked by phone and given a booking reference..When we arrived there was no record of the booking...Have been a loyal customer of this hotel since I was a student back in the 80 s.My parents travelled up from Waterford and we always ate/stayed in Wynns.
I was so disappointed on January 23rd to be met with n unhelpful,discourteous,unwelcoming receptionist who had very poor communication skills.
I learned that my booking was not recorded and probably bogus but she was so unwilling to empathise with my plight or offer any reasonable rate for a 1 night stay while we were attending a play in the Abbey.
Booking .com offered a room in Wynns for 150e but she would not budge from a fee of 160e.I asked to speak to a manager .He was standing in for the manager..a most disagreeable uncompromising, rude man. There was no move on the rate so we left Wynns forever got a beautiful new hotel 5 minutes away for 99e(stayed 2 nights it was such value) The staff at front of house in Wynns are far removed from the friendly, lovely, welcoming staff of years gone by.
From a loyal fan of Old Wynns.",1,2024,02,02
232,Service Above and Beyond,"I’ve been meaning to post for over a month so it’s about time I did. We only stayed one night in Wynn’s in the last week of November prior to staying with some Dublin based relatives.

We booked a room in the James Joyce wing and were delighted to have done so. The room was spacious with ample storage and a very roomy bathroom with powershower and jacuzzi style bath.

Breakfast the following morning was excellent and the home made, tummy buster scones were a delicious addition.

So all great and no complaints.But what I really wanted to highlight was the contribution of the Head Porter and Porter. We wanted to get a taxi to our next location in the evening after a day spent sightseeing- Wynn’s is brilliantly located for the purpose. Unfortunately, a taxi couldn’t be arranged for love or money. 

Eventually, we had to leave the hotel to see if we could get one in the street. Both the people I mentioned helped with the luggage and remained with us in the pouring rain while we searched, fruitlessly as it happens, for a taxi. 

At that point, we opted for a bus but when I wanted to show my appreciation to the porters for their assistance with a tip, they wouldn’t hear of it. They certainly deserved one and even now I feel sorry they wouldn’t take one.

Service above and beyond.

I’ll just add that getting on the bus we hadn’t been able to get a pass and couldn’t pay by card. The driver took pity on us and let us on anyway.

Dublin is a great place and you’ll be hard pressed to find more hospitable people.",5,2024,01,23
232,"Great staff, great experience!","Lovely stay! We had a super early flight and arrived at the hotel at around 7:30am with the knowledge you can’t check in until the afternoon. Without us even asking, the lady on the desk told us that they are upgrading our room for free and it is ready now! We ended up in room 549 - a lovely spacious room (a little outdated but that is the hotels’ style). The bathroom, however, had been done out and was lovely and modern with a shower with multiple settings and a couples bath that had a jacouze button. The only problem was that when we arrived, the room was freezing but we just turned the radiators on and it heated up in no time really! Bed really comfortable, heard no noise from anyone at all within the hotel - just the wind howling outside as there was a storm but that was actually quite nice to listen to. Breakfast was included and was also lovely! The hotel is situated in the middle of everything so great location too. We had a really positive experience here.",4,2024,01,21
232,Oil be back,The grub was steeped in oil. I nearly skated out the door. The staff were efficient when allowed to work . Fabulous old hotel but less of the oil boys before oil be back.  Oil see yes when the oil on the plate won’t drive a lawn mower. I asked for a pint of the plain stuff at 10.30 and was told that the bar was closed. This is the pub with no beer which may be just as well because there is no place to empty the bladder. This is because the jacks is locked like Fort Knox and you would need a code breaker to get in unless you had it.,1,2024,01,01
232,"Fantastic hotel in a central location for shops, bars and restaurants ",Stayed in Wynn’s Hotel with friends in the week before Christmas. The hotel staff made us feel really welcome and the overall atmosphere throughout was friendly and relaxed.

232,Great hotel in centre of Dublin,"I always stay at Wynn’s Hotel when I visit Dublin. The location is very central and right next to a Luas tram stop. 
The staff are very friendly and professional. The breakfast is the best of any hotel I stayed in. And it is a lovely (very clean) historical hotel. 
I fully recommend Wynn’s.",5,2023,12,27
232,Good choice for lodging north of the Liffey.,"Specifics:  Three days and nights in a James Joyce suite

Pros:  This one is easy:  staff and location.  The individuals working here were very generous from arrival to departure.  I would like to point out Roberta specifically, who I met at check-in and was legitimately interested in how my trip was.  She provided a map of the surrounding area and answered questions I had about the adjoining restaurant and breakfast service.  Speaking of the latter, the staff working here were very accommodating as well.  So… thumbs up on the personnel overall.  Location is ideal.  If you’re looking to stay north of the Liffey it’s tough to imagine a more ideal address.  The EPIC Museum and Jeanie Johnston are to the east, Jameson factory and Leprechaun Museum to the west, and Temple Bar district just across the bridge.  My bathroom was clearly renovated; housekeeping was invisible and efficient.  The room was as advertised: spacious, well decorated, and with all the mentioned amenities.

Cons:  Outweighed by the “pros” for sure here.  Building is a bit on the shabby side; there was a strange yellow covering on the hallway floor leading to my room that seemed like it was for construction even though there wasn’t any.  Noise level left a bit to be desired during the day, but again, maybe they were renovating things and I realize it’s tough to have the best of both worlds. 

Summary:  An overall positive stay.  Cost, workforce, room, and location were superb with some borderline nit-picky concerns.  Would I stay again?  Definitely.  A recommended hotel.

232,Lovely experience ,"A friend and I spent two nights in Wynn’s Hotel Dublin during October. I would highly recommend it for great location, warm welcome from efficient and friendly staff, very comfortable rooms and excellent food. I’m looking forward already to my next visit there.",5,2023,11,14
232,Great stay,"Booked last minute to attend a concert going on family recommendation. The hotel has an old world style, not quite old fashioned but definitely not modern. I loved it!
The room was quite small but had 2 beds, very comfortable. The shower room was well appointed with plenty of towels.
Our room was front facing but the Luas didn't disturb at all. The hotel location is perfect for shopping and sight seeing.
Breakfast was top class, continental buffet and a good selection to order.
 All in all a wonderful stay and will definitely return. ",5,2023,11,07
232,City centre.,"Well stayed here in September and October, again in November. It’s like a family, home to home. They recognise you. Reception staff excellent, must say a big thank you to Miriam and Bea, for sorting out a room we previously stayed in. As I had a hospital visit, must thank Julie for extra pillows. Room was spotless, had a bath and shower. Air conditioning, which was a bonus. The food was amazing, great variety. Whenever availability is here in Wynns, will be staying.
Thank you all Christine and John.",5,2023,11,03
232,Business as usual at Wynns.,"I am a regular visitor to Wynns. In my opinion, a fine establishment with unshakeable quality of service. From the moment you enter the hotel, you are treated with courtesy, respect and a smile. The rooms are always well serviced, clean and comfortable. The food here is top quality, plus, if you are lucky enough to stay overnight, the breakfast is cooked to order to the highest standard, with swift and polite waiter/waitress service. There is always the unseen staff working behind the scenes and they too should be commended for their efforts. A superb hotel with a well trained staff. I can't recommend this establishment too highly.",5,2023,10,27
232,So comfortable ,"A fantastic two nights spent in this beautiful hotel which is very comfortable and the staff are so helpful and efficient. Perfect location for seeing the sights of Dublin. Made my first visit to Dublin very memorable and I would recommend it, and hope to visit again.",5,2023,10,20
232,Carvery Lunch Oct 2023,"Very nice Carvery Lunch for eleven people.
All agreed the food was lovely,
especially the green beans with bacon and cream sauce.
Excellent very friendly and efficient staff. Who organised a table for us in the main dining room as the bar area was full.
",5,2023,10,18
232,Great hotel in a great location!,"We were very pleased with this hotel.  The location is fantastic for walking everywhere in the city. The room was very nice, not huge but certainly big enough. Air conditioning worked great, wifi was strong.  The room comes with a lovely breakfast of hot and cold items. ",5,2023,10,14
232,Location location location,Stayed in the Wynns Hotel at beginning and end of our two week trip. Great location just one block north of Liffey. Ask for refurbished room and bathroom. We were in room 124 and it was excellent. The included breakfast was very good and Trevor is a true gentleman who loves his job and treats you like royalty.,5,2023,10,13
232,Beautiful hotel in a fantastic location ,"Beautiful hotel in a fantastic location with friendly helpful staff who couldn’t do enough for us. 

Our room was quiet, spacious & beautifully decorated as was our bathroom & the beds were very comfortable. 

The breakfast was fabulous cooked to order, you honestly couldn’t get better. 

The bar at night had a great atmosphere & again nothing was too much for the staff.

We’ll definitely be back. ",5,2023,10,08
232,Great stay and Great location ,"Stayed in Wynns hotel last weekend room was beautiful, right at the front. Noise was not an issue. 
Lovely spacious bathroom with nice toiletries.
Staff were super friendly and really go out of their way to assist you. Nice atmosphere in bar at night.
Really nice cooked to order breakfast which we were not expecting for a 3 star hotel better than a 5 star we did recently. Location great for getting around so don't drive as no car park at hotel.",5,2023,10,08
232,Avoid,"Staff were miserable with the exception of the doorman.

Place looks nice from outside but inside it's seriously outdated. You can keep older buildings historical looking without them being poorly decorated, this hotel was very poor.

The rooms were horrible, the window was broken and the bottom half actually LIFTED OFF. The doors were also horrible and looked like you could break them open with a flick. Wallpaper and furnishings were very outdated and the room didn't feel comfortable. We could hear people talking in the room beside us as clear as day.

Bathrooms were outdated, toiletries left behind were minimul but that doesn't affect us as we bring our own. 

We felt it was way overpriced for the experience we received. 

Breakfast was ok, wasn't great but wasn't dreadful.

Wouldn't recommend at all, far nicer around for less or similar price.
",1,2023,10,06
232,Great stay in central location with lovely staff.,"I had a really lovely comfortable stay at Wynn's. It is an older hotel but it was really clean, good value and great central location. The staff were exemplary and took such ownership of their work.I felt so well looked after. Enjoyed good quality breakfast cooked to order - lovely quality yoghurts, orange juice, freshly cooked eggs, mushrooms etc. Well done folks - great to see such service still in 2023!",5,2023,09,29
232,Wynn's - A great boutique hotel  ,"I love staying at hotels like this that are boutique type. It was a classic Dublin hotel in the heart of the city.  It was walking distance to almost everything.  Roberta, the receptionist greeted me when I came and when I left and was the most helpful throughout my stay.   If I lived there, she would be someone I would want to hang out and be friends with!  So positive and gives great directions and tips.  She should be managing the front reception area. Iliana in housekeeping goes the extra mile for housekeeping.  She was so kind and pleasant and was always smiling. Camilla, another star at the front desk and in the bar area serving. Camilla is so friendly and knowledgeable. Pauline and gentleman in the breakfast provided excellent service too. They work so hard to make sure you have an enjoyable breakfast experience.  My room was small but comfortable. Great wifi and it was quiet.  Others noted that the  back rooms are best and I guess that was reason.  Not much of a view but I wasn't in the room much, so it was perfect for my needs.  Train station not too far from hotel if want to go see other parts of the country.  The rail system is the best way to get around. ",5,2023,09,29
232,Well situated but could use some upgrades.  Noisy.,Well situated and friendly staff.  Breakfast was very good! Our room was on the top floor but facing the back alley.  VERY noisy and the whole hotel shakes when the train goes by.  Room was clean but small.  Bathroom was a good size.,3,2023,09,23
232,Still disappointed!,"Having stayed at this hotel a year ago I was excited to book it again I was so impressed especially with the Customer Service. Well what a disappointment. Because it is located on a busy corner with a city train literally going right by the front door, I requested a room at the back. We got one but we were looking right at a brick wall. No problem, I thought, at least it will be quiet. When free Wi-Fi is advertised you expect to get it. Even though I asked about it at check in I was not told that yes there’s wi-fi, but only in certain rooms (depends on location in the building). My 20 yr old grandson was with me so we had to request a room with wi-fi which was provided quickly but of course it was at the front. The next day when we were trying to have a nap, we were rudely awakened by loud drilling, pounding on pipes & sawing!! I quickly contacted the Manager who’s only reaction was to blame the City of Dublin who were doing construction work on the roof from 9 to 6 daily!! I was shocked!! What hotel does this without warning its guests prior to arrival? Not being able to rest in your room for 9 hrs out of each day should certainly be something you would advise of, not to mention a discount in price! 241 Euros a night for this?? The Manager Jack Loftus offered nothing when I spoke to him. I would never recommend this hotel.",2,2023,09,17
232,A gem of a hotel,"A real gem of a hotel charming & quaint in the best sense with  exceptional staff, the best city centre location beside a luas stop , smashing really comfy bedrooms,  delicious food with superb  breakfasts cooked to order. ",5,2023,09,16
232,Nice hotel,"Hotel was okay and it was easy to come by bus from the airport. We had our room at the top floor. The room was small and compact. Noises from the streets and neighbours were heard well. The cleaner listened music from the radio and we heard it to our room which was not nice. Breakfast was good. The first two mornings the service was good but the last two days we were like air. Maybe we stayed too long time, 4 nights. At the reception the service was really friendly.",3,2023,09,11
232,The place to stay in central Dublin,"This is an elegant hotel right in the heart of Dublin's O'Connell St Upper. Streetcar services are literally on the street fronting the hotel. Donuts, chocolate, and pubs are within 2-3 minutes walk. A bank of Ireland ATM is around the corner. The Wynn is conveniently within wslking distance to many major attractions including Trinity College and The Book of Kells. It is also near the Temple Bar district.
The hotel has an elevator.The staff are very friendly and helpful. We stayed in room 121 and enjoyed a very comfortable bed. The room window has a blackout screen that is effective.  We did not hear street noise except for sensing the streetcar driving past. Streetcar service appeared to stop about 11 pm and resume about 5 am.
Our reservation included a complimentary breakfast. There is the typical continental breakfast buffet items PLUS a menu of items typically found at a restaurant: eggs benedict, pancakes, Irish breakfast, etc., very substantial!  The staff are very attentive and welcoming. They make each day a great start.
There is a very welcoming bar in the evenings with a delightful bartender. It is a great place to enjoy a nightcap at the end of the day.
Would I stay there again? Yes, absolutely. Wonderful staff, wonderful service, why go anywhere else.",5,2023,09,03
232,"Quaint, lovely gem with fabulous breakfast and service.  Loved it!","Excellent location, quaint, fantastic breakfast and service.  This is a real gem!

The hotel is beautiful, historic and quaint. We were 3 couples and absolutely loved our stay for 3 nights. Front desk is so very friendly and helpful. Staff all around are efficient!  Our rooms were very nice and the bedding was really good.  Decent sized TV, limited stations. 

Breakfast was a pleasant surprise.  Orange juice was delicious, coffee hot and the food was fresh and well prepared. Best scrambled eggs we’ve ever had all around!   Between the 6 of us, we tried most of the items and everything was excellent! 

Absolutely recommend for discerning travelers looking for something special, but not modern, big or shiny.  We would definitely return.",5,2023,08,20
232,There’s nothing bad to say about this hotel.,"If you’re looking to book this hotel then I’d strongly advise you to do so. From start to finish the staff at this hotel have been exemplary. From the friendly doorman/receptionists to the waiting and bar staff, everyone is always polite and helpful.

The hotel is about a five minute walk around the corner from Eden Quay bus stop, where you can get the Dublin Express to and from the airport. It is located in central Dublin, just north of the Liffey, and guests have the option to either walk or get the bus/tram to local attractions/bars/restaurants. I particularly liked the walk from the hotel to the Guinness Storehouse.

Breakfast was the only meal I ate at the hotel and, both mornings I was there, it was delicious. The Full Irish was very tasty and had everything you’d expect and the Eggs Benedict was equally delicious. Allergens are clearly marked on the menu, which provides clear information about each dish. The waiting staff are also always both pleasant, efficient and always willing to answer any and all queries.

The room was also always very clean. As someone who has worked as a cleaner whilst studying, I must say that the cleaners definitely know what they’re doing and ensured my room was cleaned to a high standard. 

Furthermore, as a girl travelling alone, this hotel made me feel very safe. The hotel has special measures which ensure that only staff and guests are allowed inside the hotel at night. The rooms are also very secure, which grants solo travellers extra peace of mind as-well.
 
Overall, this is an incredibly safe, friendly and welcoming hotel that is situated in a convenient and easy-to-find location in central Dublin. I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to stay at this lovely hotel, which exemplifies Irish hospitality at its best, and definitely plan to stay here again on my next trip over to see family (if it’s not booked up).",5,2023,08,09
232,Go for character and history,"Great location and loved the old school feel of the place. I was lucky enough to have a re-furbished bathroom with a terrific shower. Bed was pretty comfy, and the room was pleasant. The chap behind the bar was brilliant - chatty, friendly and helpful.
We had a very plentiful Irish Breakfast all cooked fresh which was very tasty. The hotel is ideal for exploring the city centrally.",4,2023,08,03
232,"Top hotel for location, service and quality","Great hotel, fantastic location - and the best barman (Damien) in town. Knowledgeable, welcoming and helpful with a map! You’ll be assured of a warm welcome and a friendly chat at this bar, restaurant and hotel. Thanks to all - we’ll be back!",5,2023,07,17
232,Pleasant stay but don’t book a room at the front of the hotel.,This is a lovely old fashioned hotel in central Dublin. It’s full of old world charm. The service was excellent. The staff were friendly and professional. It’s very conveniently located for all the main sights. The breakfasts are excellent. We ate at the restaurant once during our stay. The selection was limited but palatable. Our one gripe was that our initial room at the front of the hotel was extremely noisy. The trams are very loud and run quite late. Our tip would also be to book a room elsewhere in the building. We were able to change to a much quieter room without any trouble. All in all a very pleasant stay.,4,2023,07,14
232,Nice stay except for one little thing.,"We really enjoyed our stay at Wynn’s with one slight reservation.  I’ll get to that in a minute. Our room was clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Food in the restaurant was quite good . The Wynns is in a great location 1-2 blocks north of the river. Great access to the riverfront, Temple Bar District , busses, trams etc. 
The only thing that kept it from 5 stars was street noise at night. We were in Dublin during a bit of a heatwave. There’s no AC in most if not all the rooms so that meant open windows.  You’re in the downtown of a big city that has some typical big city issues. Both nights there was a bit of yelling by people on the street. One night city crews were doing repairs on the metro tracks using a grinder at 3 am. None of this is the hotel’s fault but it did detract from our stay. 
I’d stay there again but this time ask for a room off the Main Street.",4,2023,07,09
232,Wynns hotel was perfect!,"This was an amazing hotel!  Such old world charm, modern rooms, friendly staff, centrally located near trams and attractions.  If there were six stars to give this hotel, I would!  The breakfast that was included was fabulous, and the bar and dining room offered wonderful ambiance and great food.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,07,06
232,"Loved it... staff were wonderful.. Good rooms, location and breakfast great!","I would just like to send our thanks over for our recent 3 night stay.
We loved your hotel, the location was perfect as were our rooms & the amazing breakfast...but what was really wonderful,  was your staff. Everyone went above and beyond... the night porter Paul on our late arrival after a delayed flight....he was lovely and had some good craic when we arrived back after going out, we may have been slightly drunk lol...we loved him!... the young ones at breakfast..so accommodating to fit us on a group table when they were set up in 2's, and they got us combinations that weren't on the menu...the ladies on the desk, so cheerful and welcoming and the two guys (sorry we didn't get names -tall with dark hair and a shaved headed guy) who helped us when the airport taxi didn't turn up(not hotels fault..we had booked separately)...the dark haired one kept his eye on us out the window and when it hadnt come , he came out and across the road to us and said he'd sort us another ...then bald guy even walked round to the rank and sent us one round as he knew we had to get there and it was rush hour..
Everyone was going above and beyond didn't go unnoticed...
Thank you all so much... it was much appreciated 
We will definitely see you again on our next trip.

If you want a central hotel (5 min walk to the bars in temple bar).. this is definitely the place... it was Immaculate clean aswell and our beds were comfy. 

Slightly loud in one of our rooms early morning , bottle bins emptying in the back alley etc... but to be fair we did have all 3 windows open as it was warm... so had we closed them I'm sure it would have been silent. Didn't bother us in the slightest,  but just noting if anyone is a light sleeper...maybe ask for a room on the other side x

",5,2023,07,05
232,"Old hotel, no air con. ","Negative - Old hotel. We had no air conditioner in our room and when questioned I was told if we looked on the website ( by a staff member who bought a fan which was noisy ) it would have said some rooms don’t have it. 

Positive - Front office staff was very front and helpful. Good breakfast. Good location. ",3,2023,07,03
232,Derrick made our stay extra special,"We stayed at Wynn's our last night in Ireland.
The hotel has a lot of character, rooms clean, great location and fantastic  breakfast. We did not find it noisy at all.
But what made our stay even better was Derrick, I believe he is the doorman, He was so pleasant and knowledgeable and was a Godsend helping us with our luggage, which can be challenging to off load.
Great customer service, Derrick , Thanks again",5,2023,06,25
232,"Great historic hotel, terrific location, very nice room! ","Loved this historic hotel for its great location and gravitas. And the furniture, room size, and bathroom featured everything we needed.  The breakfast was comprehensive and delicious and the service was fantastic.  Warm staff, very helpful. We also enjoyed the bar (which has historical significance) in the evening.  I would stay here again for sure.  ",5,2023,06,23
232,Old hotel = old plumbing,"Everything that everyone wrote about the wonderful breakfast is true. 
The hotel bar at this old 1845 hotel is pretty and welcoming too. However, there seems to be a plumbing problem. My room had problems where the toilet didn't flush (broken piece and loose flush handle) so we were moved to another room where we had the same problem (very inconvenient at night)The manager had it fixed the next day but the room was in a different part of the building and it was very noisy in the alley all night long. So, if I hadn't prepaid, I would've moved out. 3 stars, because of the nice staff and breakfast.",3,2023,06,14
232,"Very nice hotel, Fantastic Breakfast!","A very nice Irish hotel. Not  your typical chain hotel.  The rooms are a bit small but the beds are great and the bathrooms well fitted.  If you can get a room away from the street your wont hear the trams, but they stop around 11 pm.  Breakfast was terrific!  Fast service, good quality.",5,2023,06,04
232,Great venue for hosting a business meeting in Dublin,"I booked a meeting room and twenty bedrooms rooms for a two night stay. 
It was an overall excellent experience, everything went to plan and the rooms and breakfast met our expectations. 
The warm danish pastries were a pleasant surprise at our tea break.
The bar had a great selection of drinks and can easily accommodate a group.  
I wouldn't hesitate recommending Wynns Hotel to anyone wanting to host an event in Dublin. 
Situated in the City Centre and within walking distance of all the key attractions. ",5,2023,05,19
232,A little bit of luxury,"We had a lovely quiet room at the back of the hotel. The carvery lunch was delicious as was the breakfast, what a treat to have the breakfast served to your table.   When we arrived back to the hotel after a concert we were warmly greeted by the night porter.
This is a charming hotel with excellent food and very friendly customer focused staff.  This hotel is ideally located in the city centre.",5,2023,05,15
232,Wait until construction is done?,This review is based on a second floor Abbey street side room.  This review should be a 4 star minimum.  I took off 1 star due to 2 things: 1) construction noise that starts early in the morning which might not be a problem for early risers going to work or conference but not for vacationers.  This is temporary though and should resolve itself when they are done with construction.  2) very loud tram noise which unfortunately will always be there.  Hotel is located on a street with a tram line and a tram stop right at front.  Which is normally a good thing for getting around but every tram that comes and goes can be heard in our room from 6am to 1am.  Otherwise staff were great.  Room size is as you would expect from a historic hotel but was nicely updated and clean.  The included breakfast was good.,3,2023,05,11
232,A very enjoyable experience and the hotel had excellent service,"A very classy hotel with a pleasant environment and had an enjoyable breakfast. Most importantly the staff are very polite and fare, I forgot my wallet there and it was returned to me with all of its contents by post ",5,2023,05,09
232,Do you want to feel as if they care about you? then go here.,"Its difficult being a hotel in Dublin, but at Wynns we had a positive experience at every turn. The rooms were smart, clean and just what we needed. I suppose the staff can make or break a hotel, and at this place the staff are second to none (ie brilliant) and have obvioulsy been working here for a for a long time. (the bar man didnt have a scotch whiskey we liked and next day he went out and bought us a bottle and had it available the next night! thats class!
Location is very central and this area has a constant buzz, and you are right next to the Liffey and O'Connell Street. 
I can obviously make some criticisms about the place and certain things, but I do think if you book here you will be happy with your decision, the other reviews will give you a balanced feel. ",5,2023,05,01
232,Family hotel in the traditions,"Very warm welcome, very good staff and services. Despite the work, they did everything to make the meeting go as smoothly as possible. Perfect location, easy access from the airport. Very flexible and reactive. ",4,2023,04,24
232,Great location in Dublin and excellent breakfast,"Stayed as a family recently and we were very happy with the stay overall. The location of this hotel is the big bonus, close to Connolly Train station and right on the Luas line in the city center. Check in was efficient and the staff pleasant. The room had 3 beds in it and was very tight for space and in a ""L"" shape! Because of the shape of the room, there were 2 TVs in there, but that was a disaster as they were not in sync sound wise so you couldn't have both on at the same time!! It was clean though and the beds comfortable. The bathroom was also small but the shower was decent. The bar downstairs was busy and had a good buzz to it, once again nice staff. The breakfast was one of the best we have had in a Dublin hotel in recent times, and that morning staff were very good. They really sent us on our way with a great impression of this very good hotel.",4,2023,04,11
232,Excellent food.,"Lovely traditional hotel. Food excellent and very attentive staff.    I would suggest that reception have a city map handy as they didnt know where the main bus station was ( it was less than half a mike walk).  Unfortunately there was a lot of noise and trouble on Abbey Street  which kept us awake and although that is not the fault of the hotel, just something to be aware of.  Certainly couldn't fault the food at all.  ",4,2023,04,07
232,Got water issue being resolved.,"After a problem with the hot water, the manager Neil contacted me back to offer a solution.
Excellent breakfast and the manager there couldn't be might helpful. Nothing was too much trouble and he was fast and efficient. He did the work of three.",4,2023,04,06
232,WYNNS WASTE!!!,"Dreadful ! Room as small and dark  as a cupboard with no lights working we complained ( £175 a night ) and we’re moved to a larger room though not large ! They had work going on they told us after we complained about hammering and we had to endure said hammering constantly so an afternoon nap after a long flight was impossible! The noise from the street is deafening with trams banging day and night . The housekeeping trolleys bloke the hallways all day and empty bottles of gin and glasses were left on the landing all day , the shower flooded and had to be pumped clear but continued to flood ! The hot AND cold tap run warm ! We were woken at 8-10am with workmen hammering again but the worse thing was the breakfast room where a drill screamed loudly throughout breakfast it was the worst hotel I’ve ever been in . I stayed in this hotel 20 years ago and now even an average premier inn is better . However the staff were lovely but could do nothing. I have written to ask for my money back but I’m not confident! DO NOT stay in this hotel it’s a disgrace and certainly not worth £175  a night !!! ",1,2023,04,05
232,Noisy and seedy,"Noisy both inside and out - tram lines run down the street just in front and I feel the shaking as i hear one roll past now at 11:45pm. At least that drowns out the party next door momentarily. Add to that the odd odors, the skanky neighborhood, and a total lack of parking. With those tram lines, we couldn’t even pull up to drop our bags. Spend a few euros more and get a respectable hotel. ",2,2023,03,31
232,"Loved every moment in this hotel, hated leaving it.","Fabulous Building, old world, but not old fashioned.   right beside the Luas stop, so handing to get everywhere, including shopping.  Lovely Bar, fantastic Barman, David, could not have been more friendly, Great Breakfast, everything spotless.   Staff were second to none.  we loved our stay here and will definitely stay again.",5,2023,03,28
232,A wonderful stay,"We have just returned from the most enjoyable stay at Wynn's hotel and are  so happy to have experienced one of the most professional hotels we have ever encountered. It has the perfect combination of understated elegance, attention to detail and welcoming charm, all made to seem effortless. Behind all this you have the professionalism of the staff, David in the bar looked after us so well and whose easy conversation,  good manners and skills make you feel you have been visiting for years,  Roberta on the Reception  is a true gem and so helpful and interesting, the dining room and staff, most attentive  I didn’t get the head waiter's name but the breakfast first class, best we have had and all home made and compliments to all the catering staff as our evening meal sat in the bar was delicious. We hope to return and will tell all our friends.

232,Good for evening food,"We ate here one evening before the Abbey Theatre. Staff were friendly and welcoming, the food was tasty (the chowder was very good) and you can really sit back and relax for a while in peace. It’s a little old fashioned but that’s part of its charm.",4,2023,03,24
232,"Warm, comfortable stay!","Second stay at the Wynns hotel, it still is very good place to stay.
Old style, kept in good order.
The breakfast room is well decorated, light flows in.
All the members of staff are very helpful, smiling, professional. 
The breakfast service is professional, the quality of the food served is excellent! The Head Waiter at breakfast is great.

On my next visit to Dublin, I will definitely come back a third time.

232,"Very noisy,workmen started work about 7am renovating hotel","Stayed at hotel on 7th February,all seemed OK at first then entered a double room what was a very small double, the street noise of the trams and traffic during the night wasn't great, but the main issue was workmen started renovation work the 2 floors below us at 7am if not a little earlier, the banging and sawing and general disruption was unbelievable,  I went to the reception to complain and asked what time the workmen were supposed to start and she said they start at 8am , funny because I was standing in reception at 7:20am and it had been going on for sometime b4 I went down, we missed breakfast because of the early wake up and wanted to try get some sleep, I was told I would have my bill looked at and all they gave us was a €24 refund for breakfast, the reception staff were nice but I felt the duty manager was not helpfull at all, we definitely won't be staying again and advise other people to do the same",1,2023,02,08
232,Disappointed tiny room and noisy building work from 6am,Very disappointed with recent trip. First one away since we had baby and were woke uo from 6am with refurbishment noise very loud continued so my partner went to complain at 7.20am to be told by management later building work did not start till.8am if we had know this we would not have booked. The room was tiny too other rooms looked larger. No refund offered only the breakfast money was given back and a late checkout which we still managed not to nap due to loud banging hammering drilling noises would not advise to stay here due to this. Location was good.,2,2023,02,08
232,Bridget,"Stayed in Wynns Hotel 28th January . 
What a gem . From time of check in , to time of check out , every member of staff could not be more efficient and always with a smile . 
Ideal location for city centre , every thing provided in room from fridge to ironing board . And breakfast was a  treat with freshly squeezed orange juice, and not from a carton .
Would definitely recommend 100% .

232,Central hotel with pleasant staff,"Hotel is a little dated but this probably adds a bit to its character. Staff are very helpful and efficient, particularly Anna Maria who was overseeing the breakfast room when I was there. The lady at reception (sorry I didn’t get her name) was equally pleasant.",5,2023,01,22
232,Sold hotel,Great hotel. It was exactly what I expected. Felt very safe as two young female travelers and the included breakfast in the morning was a huge plus. It wasn't the most modern or up to date hotel but this did not pose any real issues for me.,5,2023,01,20
232,No respect for wheelchair users," I have never left a 1 star rating for any place we've stayed or eaten. If I were only reporting the experience of typical guests, I would give a much higher rating. The pub was great, breakfast was lovely, and the room was comfortable.

I had read many reviews on TripAdvisor before booking, and I was aware that we would have to enter through the alley as our son is a full time wheelchair user. Several reviews mentioned that the alley was pretty gross, but as a travel advisor, I am used to reading reviews that exaggerate negative issues, so I wasn't too concerned. 

We arrived at about 2:15 and drove down the alley. It was very narrow and there were other cars parked there. It was unclear where the entrance was because there was no signage, so I wasn't even sure which was the hotel building. The alley was even worse than described: a terrible road with potholes filled with more than just water in them, obscene graffiti, smells of urine, broken glass, and people who needed some assistance and were a little frightening.

My daughter and I went to the front entrance to check in and explained that we had a wheelchair. After check in, the friendly front desk worker told the doorman that we needed the ramp. I asked if there was a ramp available for the front door, but he directed us to the alley and gestured down the alley. I said ""can you please show me?"" and he reluctantly accompanied us down the alley to a door with a broken Coke bottle in front of it. I said--there's broken glass here--and he then directed us to another door. He said he would open the door from inside.

So we waited in the scary alley for him to open the door. We unpacked our luggage in order to assemble the wheelchair and were disgusted to have to put the bags down on that street, knowing that we would be rolling them through that alley and into the lovely hotel and then into our room.

When we entered the door we realized that the wheelchair ramp entrance was outside and had trash cans in the way, so my son was bumping into trash cans to get into the building. I don't know how a power chair would fit. The ramp ends in a gorgeous dining room, so our bedraggled group burst into the middle of people's lovely lunch with our luggage in tow. Needless to say they were staring at us, which was understandable but embarrassing for my son. Later I overheard some staff talking about how they had a function coming in and had to make room for a power chair. I only hope they moved the trash cans for that person.

The next morning, we repeated the ordeal but with the added bonus of the dark and the rain. The trash cans were still in the way. I spoke to the man who was hurriedly coming to assist us, and I said ""This is really unacceptable."" That was the extent of my interaction about the issue while we were guests. Normally I like to speak to people in person, but it gets exhausting to constantly have to ask for my son to be treated with dignity. When we went outside, the broken Coke bottle was still right in front of us.

I understand that no permanent ramp can be installed in the front of the historic hotel, but there are modular ramps that fold up that could be used so that wheelchair users can access the front door. They are not very expensive and they don't take up much room. In fact, other reviews here mentioned them, which is why I thought we would be OK, but despite my request we weren't offered that option. If a portable ramp is not possible, it would be nice if the area that the wheelchair user enters was clean-- i.e. no trash cans and broken bottles at the entrance that they need to use to get into the building. I also understand that the alley is the city's but the wall of the hotel was covered in graffiti too. I have attached some pictures of what we were greeted with upon arrival. 

I wrote a letter upon our return and received a vague response that didn't even offer to move the trash cans and do a nightly alley sweep. 

I was going to end this review by saying that no wheelchair users should stay here, but anyone who is against discrimination of people with disabilities shouldn't stay here. Able bodied guests might enjoy a lovely stay, but taking care of others is certainly not a priority here. And even though the bartender made me a delicious espresso martini, I will take my business (and my clients' business) elsewhere.",1,2023,01,17
232,Very Pleasantly Suprised ,"I hadn't stayed here in years as it had gone down a bit in my last visit a few years ago. The Hotel is beautifully old fashioned, rooms were warm, lovely shower... but what made my stay was The Staff, Reception on arrival were very nice and the next morning as I was on early departure, The young guy in The Dining Room was SO nice along with the chef at the Breakfast Counter... I loved the fact it wasn't a buffet... breakfast to order, I had eggs Benidict... suberb.. I'll certainly use the Hotel again, say thanks to your extremely nice staff. ",5,2023,01,17
232,Disappointed,"Had requested a shower facility for person with mobility issues but room was  very small and the shower wasn’t safe to get into as no grab rail .I was unable to have a shower !  - this is a no no when away from home . Also there were two people booked into this room yet body wash and shampoo was only for one ! Felt room over priced for what it offered. 
Lunch was lovely and so was breakfast . Disappointed that no evening snacks available on such cold frosty evenings . 
Staff were very pleasant and helpful- just the shower facility was the big no no considering on booking it was noted.",3,2022,12,13
232,Excellent ,"Hotel was spotless, staff friendly and could not be more welcoming, waiter in the morning was so professional, the hotel gave a old posh titanic fealing. Best hotel I have stayed in and good value for money, beds comfy and was quiet at night from 11 till about 6am and that's coming from a country bumpkin. Thank you wynns for a great stay.
Excellent breakfast to 😋 ",5,2022,12,01
232,attentian to detail is never too small.,"brilliant service ,no question was a hassle to the great staff on reception .our room was a great size the only problem was the shower it gave off really loud noises like an alarm or something . l know l should have reported same to reception  . dublin is the most loved city in our family and it never dissappoints, there is something for  everyone   . dublin is for everyone",5,2022,11,29
232,What a Gem!,"I have just returned from a stay in Wynn's Hotel - which I booked for 2 couples on a night away.  It is a hotel I would have visited many years ago with my parents.   Our rooms were certainly ""snug"" and a bit small - but the team at Wynn's made up for it with their genuine warm welcome.   Breakfast was so delicious, served by a great team of happy people., in a lovely bright room.  Thank you all - and a special shout out to Roberta who made us all feel so special and who took a personal interest in all the guests.  We will be back x",5,2022,11,20
232,Wonderful Conference facilities,"The facilities at Wynn’s Hotel ticked all the boxes. The members who attended were especially happy with the location because all public transport lead to Wynn’s Hotel. As we have members attending from all over Ireland this was much appreciated as Dublin is often a maze for those not familiar.

I will talk to the membership about our Conference 2023 and we will agree a date with Wynn’s hotel once again. As I said to the members, when we find great service and a great location, “wash and repeat”.

We look forward to seeing you again next year.

232,Daughter’s Graduation ,"Charming old style hotel centrally located.

Just to say thank you for looking after us (lovely lady on reception) for daughter’s grad in Trinity college. Short walk up and lovely breakfast. 

Would stay again. ",4,2022,11,02
232,Good Value,"I stayed just one night B&B in this, ideally centrally located, traditional hotel . My room was small but clean and comfortable. A small en-suite with a large shower cubicle and all the usual shampoos etc. A very good, freshly cooked, hearty breakfast included.",4,2022,10,28
232,You must stay here!!!,"You can never know if you are selecting the best hotel experience until you actually arrive, I can say without a doubt .. you must stay here!! First off ..the staff!! I can not express enough how absolutely amazing and accommodating the staff was to our party of 12. They held bags, gave day trip suggestions and even had a staff member provide a continental breakfast for our group before our 4am airport departure!! This really impressed my group and sealed the deal. There is this bar across the street where the sweetest lady sang almost nightly. We opened the windows to hear her gorgeous voice. The hotel is located on and off street but it’s in the middle of everything! We walked and walked.. to shop, to Temple Bar, to the Train for a day trip,  to restaurants…we walked everywhere from here and it was super convenient.This is the place to stay. 
The morning breakfast is so delicious and made to order. We were addicted to the eggs Benedict. Back to the staff they memorized some of those in our group who had allergies or how they preferred their coffee!! You must stay here!
We enjoyed dinner one night and it too was delicious. This place is packed with locals who come in just to eat and hang!! This hotel has so much history and makes for an even more exciting stay. I would say the things that could be improved on were the Wi-Fi.. it didn’t work well for our group. There is a train that arrives just in front of the hotel.. it didn’t seem to bother most of our group and we slept just fine. It’s a busy area so some noise is to be expected. I would without a doubt recommend this hotel!!",5,2022,10,24
232,no a/c or good ventilation,"I am guessing this will be more and more of an issue for summer travels, the property lacks a/c and the # of windows that open is highly limited and when you do open them its not worth the 4-5""s of clearance,  due to location, lots of street noise, party go'ers yelling til 3-4 am, 3 of the 5 night we were there. We were there during a Dublin heat wave, didn't think Ac would be a priority when we booked. Same stuffiness in the downstairs bar w no ac or windows. 
Staff was of mixed helpfulness. There is also no laundry service they can coordinate. 
Location is good as far as mass transit and local sites.",4,2022,10,23
232,A nice old world hotel will all the comforts of home.,"From the minute we checked in until the minute we left we enjoyed our experience at this hotel. The staff are well trained, very friendly, and professional. The rooms are nice, clean, and quiet. I’m a stickler for beds, and the mattress are very comfortable. The breakfast is extremely good with many choices for everyone, including those with food sensitivities. The bar is always busy and a great place for conversing with both tourists and locals. I’ve traveled a lot, and I’ve stayed in several hotels but few have ticked as many boxes as the Wynn’s Hotel. Thank You for a wonderful stay.",5,2022,10,18
232,A special hotel in a special city.,"An excellent 4 night stay at this hotel. Initially our room was not good (dark and small) but we were given another room, for the remaining three nights, which was wonderful. Reception was very helpful, as were all the staff we had to interact with. 
Breakfast was comprehensive, with a cooked menu available and plenty of choice otherwise. 
The hotel is central which can be a little noisy at weekends but you cannot be in the city centre and have total piece and quiet - for us it wasn't an issue.
Out with breakfast, dining was excellent and the bar staff were very attentive even at very busy times.
A special mention for Michelle (cook) who has a smile even at the end of a very long shift.
We will definitely try and book here on our next visit to Dublin.",5,2022,10,18
232,Comfort and location. Hospitality Plus.,"Location. The best. History and tradition. The best. Comfort. Yes. A great experience as long as you are not seeking lots of slick comforts. Meals are homely and staff are terrific. Rooms are comfortable, traditional and without frills. Great bedding. No laundry service, but the warmth, hospitality and history make up for any shortcomings.",4,2022,10,16
232,Great location but poor nights sleep,"Location is great, easy to get too and explore the city! Staff are friendly and check in was simple! The room was spacious but dated and the tram just made it impossible to get a good sleep as they run till 12:30am and start back at 5am plus wifi never worked which was frustrating! Breakfast was good choice but the strangest textured scrambled eggs ever had! One night stay was enough to be honest…",3,2022,10,13
232,Very much lacking only + is location,"i’ll be brief. 
Check in no problems given room 255
Room dated with stains up the walls, the slash window has to be propped to stay open.
Room located directly above the tram stop which I noticed soon after check in as it was very loud, asked at reception what time the trams stop running and was  assured this was 10.30pm.
It’s 12.25 am and they’re are very much still running.
Wi-fi virtually non existent to the point that a connection either could not picked up or it dropped connection straight away
Travelled for business so to be able to use Wifi and get a good nights kip was essential and this failed massively on both counts
Location is good by that really is the only plus",2,2022,10,12
232,Great central location,"This hotel is in a fantastic location, I don’t think you could get anymore central in the heart of Dublin. Approx 5-10 minute walk from Temple Bar area. 
The bus stops to/from the airport are just a few minutes around the corner too. 
We were early for chek in, however we were able to leave our bags and come back later. The lady at check in was attentive and very helpful. 
The hotel is older, the rooms are not modern if that’s what you are looking for, but they are comfortable and spotless. We didn’t spend much time in the room anyway, it was only to get changed and sleep. 
Our room faced the front, which did have some noise from the street and trams during the night which did wake me up. I’m not too bothered, as it was only an overnight stay. My husband slept the full night, however. 
The breakfast was absolutely delicious. There were continental options and we got cooked breakfasts. Again, the staff were very pleasant. 
I would definitely stay at the Wynn’s again if I was in Dublin, and would recommend it to others.",4,2022,09,27
232,Excellent,Lovely friendly staff and helpful they kept hold of our luggage until was time to check in the breakfast was lovely and the hotel was spotlessly clean hotel was very close to restaurants bars and shops there’s a tram that stops right outside the hotel if needed.,5,2022,09,21
232,Gareth Brooks stay,"I seriously can not recommend this hotel enough, great history and whilst a bit “antique” it knows socks off the more branded 3 & 4* competitors because of the staff employed at the hotel. Special mention to both the bar man and night porter working Sunday 17th - great breakfast, engaging reception team both checking and and on departure. Also brilliant location walking district to all the attractions",5,2022,09,18
232,Superb hotel,"Great old hotel, very historic. Fantastic evening meals  in the Saints and Scholars bar, breakfast had a massive selection of hot and cold options. Our standard twin was a fairly small room but still had enough room for myself and my sister. Comfortable beds and very clean. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful, they even made sure we had a breakfast for our early departure time. The location is perfect for Trinity College and Temple Bar areas. If you’re a light sleeper ask for a room off the street because you do hear the streetcars and pub music from nearby, but it didn’t bother us at all!  I’d stay here again for sure.",5,2022,09,17
232,Excellent staff,"We received excellent service, especially from the front desk (Roberta) and housekeeper Paul. We received great advice on how to get around the city. They went above and beyond to make our stay extremely comfortable.",5,2022,08,23
232,The staff make this hotel,"The staff are excellent, from the front desk reception to the breakfast staff to the bar staff. These hardworking people are excellent and excel of proving great service. The rooms are okay, not flash little noisey, but functional and the beds are a little small for two people, especially when one is 6ft. The people make this hotel very good.",4,2022,08,15
232,Wonderful Irish hospitality,"I stayed in this hotel for a girl's trip with my sister and best friend and we all left feeling grateful for have found such a friendly environment, clean environment. The staff was willing to meet all of our needs, they were kind and professional, from the dining room staff to the reception! Our room was very clean and comfortable accomodating all 3 of us and breakfast in the morning was sit down service, including a continental breakfast which was also very good. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming, could not have asked for better service and people!",5,2022,08,12
232,Excellent,"I missed my connection and needed a room for the night. I was a walk in with no reservation and the hotel couldn't have been more welcoming.
Room reflected the charm of the hotel and the bathroom was spotless.

There is of course some street/Luas noise as you're in the heart of the city but it didn't bother me. 

Bed was comfy and I had a good rest. Reception give you an actual key to your room which is different to those card key swipes from most other hotels 

Breakfast next morning was lovely and relaxed. I was served orange juice and pot of tea to my table. You help yourself to toast & there is also more bread selections, scones and croissants.  Cooked breakfast is then served to you table as per your order. 
There were two young lads serving and they were a credit to the hotel. So professional & didn't hang about clearing tables & keeping breakfast flowing without rushing anyone. 

The lady on reception was so lovely & kept my bag for me whilst I checked out and needed to pop up to Jervis shopping centre. 

Thank you",5,2022,07,31
232,Great Stay at Wynns!,"Been meaning to submit this review for over a month, my son just reminded me so here we go!
I’ve visited Dublin many times, but this was my 9 year old sons first visit and Wynns made it really special. 
We were over for the Ireland vs Scotland football match so all very excited. 
Upgraded to a suite and welcomed with an early check-in and really friendly reception staff, so a wonderful start. 
The suite was lovely, really comfortable and certainly made an impression on my son. He felt like he was a real VIP!
Couple of queries, and staff were absolutely perfectly attentive. I messed up safe code, but they sorted in a flash. Everyone greeted us with true Irish hospitality.
Slept soundly in such comfort, and then enjoyed a lovely breakfast with really pleasant helpful staff. Recommend this famous Dublin hotel for such a great location, central to all the sights and transport links and it’s quaint old Dublin charm! Thank you",5,2022,07,25
232,AWFUL. Avoid this place.,"My husband and I chose this hotel after our other hotel in Dublin contacted us 2 weeks before our trip to say they were undergoing reservations and were cancelling our stay. We went with the Wynn because it had great reviews and although it was very expensive ($375 USD) for a single night we figured we would treat ourselves for our last night in Ireland. That was a HUGE mistake. This place was TERRIBLE. When we arrived the woman who checked us in was very kind. But that was where the good part stopped. We went up to our room (room 524) and found that it was about 80 degrees which was way hotter than it was outside. Outside was about 70-72 degrees Fahrenheit. There's no A/C so we tried to open the windows to let the breeze in. But the windows only open an inch. They have blocks of wood screwed into the frames to keep you from being able to open them further. We hoped it would cool down while we were gone. It did not at all. When we got back in the evening it was just as hot but what could we do? There was a small fan so we turned it on and placed it next to the 1 inch opening in the window to hope it would help spread cooler air. Around 3am I woke up (yet again) drenched in sweat and I couldn't take it anymore. Our room was now about 85 degrees. I went down to the front desk to talk to the night manager. He wasn't there so I waited around. He showed up about 10 minutes later and was the rudest person I think I've ever talked to. I told him how hot it was and he could not have cared less. He just kept saying ""nothing I can do"" as if that's acceptable when you're paying nearly $400 USD for a freaking room. I asked him if there was a way we could open the windows more and all he would say was ""nope."" He was in my face and so rude. Finally I got him to give us a second fan but he rolled his eyes when I asked. He finally brought it to our room but quickly left without a word more. The bed was also horrendous. There was a massive pit in the middle of it that was so big you could see it when you walked into the room. I don't know how anyone could not notice it when preparing the room for guests. The pillows were flat and lumpy as well. In the morning when we went to get breakfast, which was included with our stay, breakfast was also horrible. My husband had the eggs benedict and I had the continental breakfast since their one vegetarian option had a lot of sesame in it and I am allergic. The eggs benedict was served on a burger bun. What??? Who does that?? And the continental breakfast was missing most of the items it said it had. For instance, no fresh fruit and no porridge, oatmeal, or eggs either. There were some cereals, croissants, and slices of bread as well as some canned prunes that were mushy. It was super gross. When we checked out I let the woman at the desk know about their night manager and she apologized. I also let her know about the awful bed. She apologized for that too but nothing else was offered. I was hoping we'd get some money back since we paid such a ridiculously high rate but nope. So instead I leave this review to let everyone know to avoid this crap hotel. It's truly terrible and not at all worth your money. Find literally anywhere else but here.",1,2022,07,15
232,Great hotel,"Checking out shortly after an excellent three night stay. I would highly recommend this hotel. It is perfectly situated in the heart of Dublin, and I cannot fault it. The room was very clean and comfortable with a great shower and very comfortable bed. Without exception the staff are a credit to the hotel, so friendly and welcoming. Special mention for Dave, the barman who is a great character. We had a room at the back of the hotel, and you can still hear the trams, but you have to accept some noise in the centre of a busy capital city. The bar and restaurant are popular with older locals and you will never be short of a friendly conversation. The carvery is excellent and good value.",5,2022,07,01
232,A Great Location for All That Dublin Offers,"This hotel is very central in the heart of everything that is happening within Dublin culturally, historically and socially. Temple Bar, Museums, the River Liffey and transport links are all close to the hotel.
The rooms are dated but that is a part of the beauty of the hotel. They are very clean and the shower room spotless. The reception staff were always helpful.  The breakfast was fantastic and the young waiters/waitress were very polite and provided great service; a credit to the hotel.
Whilst in Dublin we visited The Irish Rock and Roll Experience in a live hotel. If you are into rock music well worth a visit. We visited St Stephen’s Park, the GPO learning so much about the Easter Uprisings. We also took in a lot of the bars and had a good craic!!!
Last evening we went to Marlay Park to see Guns n Roses. Brilliant night and end to our stay in Dublin. Would definitely come back and stay at the Wynn Hotel again.",5,2022,06,29
232,A good choice for a tourist,"The hotel has a long history - which can one one hand be seen in a kind of charm and on the other in the rooms being a bit out dated. The rooms were, nevertheless, comfortable enough (even if the the first nigh was a bit chilly even though they had brought a portable warmer) and well cleaned.

The service was friendly to the extent that is not common!

At least for a tourist the location was just perfect: close enough from the bustle of the Temple Bar area so that it was easy to visit the bars and restaurants: i am sure that hotels just 100 meter closer to the busier places would have been affected by the noise from the partying crowds.",4,2022,06,27
232,"No AC, probably barely need it in Ireland but the window only opened a crack and the in room fan only blew  warm air.",Some character. Tramline in front. Convenient to get to Heuston Train station. A few dodgy characters on the street later in the evening. Excellent breakfast and excellent kitchen/front room staff. Room too hot with little circulation. I was there during an Irish Heat wave. Cooked off at night but the crack the window opened didn’t let that cool air in. Would recommend though,3,2022,06,26
232,Authentic Irish Charming hotel,"Can’t find any fault with this hotel, staff are friendly and helpful,  location is perfect, rooms were clean and included breakfast was delicious.  Hotel has old world charm and the room was very comfortable.  Was a wonderful first night in Dublin!",5,2022,06,23
232,Location and service,"Because I saw few Americans at this historic hotel I want people to know about it before you book a chain.  
Wynn's couldn't be more centrally located off Oconnell Street just off the river, across the street from a main tram line (pay by credit card at a machine at each stop)
But the hotel itself is historic and had a central place in the 1916 Easter Rising planning  that helped trigger Irish independence after the war
The staff at the front desk did everything for us --dealt with our phone problems by using hotel computer to print out our boarding passes, recommended an excellent laundry service a block away, awarded an airport taxi 
The breakfasts (included) were terrific --standard cold things, but also individually prepared hot dishes like eggs benedict and pancakes. 
Hope to return to Dublin and wouldn't consider staying anywhere else

Small room safe and housekeeping",5,2022,06,19
232,Great food,"Was the best food we had in Dublin we went few resteraunts  nothing beated  the wynns quality and the amount was outstanding and the price  the fish bisque to die for meal in itself must try
Staff are as amazing 
Breakfast also  g good choice  and scones ate here he bear 
All was amazing  g we will defo be back and will eat in hotel awesome thanks Wynns truly amazing",5,2022,06,16
232,"Location, comfort, friendliness","Had a lovely stay at this hotel. Staff was very friendly and remembered us quickly, breakfast was delicious and prompt, and the atmosphere was a little old school (in a way I enjoyed). We wanted to treat ourselves to a hotel a step above your default US hotel experience and this hotel delivered.

Very important: the water pressure in the shower was AMAZING.

In my experience, the hotel was quite well sound-proofed - it is on a very busy street (our room faced the street) and with the windows shut we couldn't hear the passersby whatsoever (our room was on the lowest floor with guest rooms). We did hear the LUAS tram a bit (as there is a stop in front of the hotel) but it was a very low sound that didn't bother us at all.",5,2022,06,16
232,Welcoming staff and excellent breakfast,"The Wynn’s Hotel is a historic hotel centrally located and walking distance to restaurants, shops, Temple Bar, The General Post Office.  Rooms have been renovated somewhat.  Rooms tend to run small but the beds are comfortable.  The big draw here is the excellent breakfast that is included in the room price.  There is a continental breakfast with a wide selection of fruits, breads, cereals, juices, etc. and you can also order from a menu.  
Service is efficient in their charming breakfast room.  Front desk staff are friendly and welcoming.  Wifi is available in the room but very slow.  To avoid the noise from the trams that run right outside the front of the hotel, request for a quiet room in the back.",4,2022,06,13
232,NOISY AND POORLY SOUNDPROOFED HÔTEL,"Our room was on the second floor, we heard the loud music from the party which was taking place in a room on the 1st floor. We also heard the tram a lot, and the neighbor in the next room. Otherwise the room is ok, the staff is helpful. In short, you can go there if you don't mind the noise.",2,2022,05,30
232,The breakfast...,"Location couldn't be better, and that is the most important thing on my list. Rooms are fine, quite dated and a faint musty smell, but comfortable beds and pillows, air conditioning is easy / works well. Service everywhere is very friendly. Feels a bit more authentic/ homey than, say, Holiday Inn Express up the street. 

But the real selling point is that free breakfast...I travel a lot, and I think it's the best free hotel breakfast I've ever had. The breakfast room is charming and service is efficient. There is a buffet continental breakfast with breads, cereals, juices, yogurts, and a really good ham and cheese. They bring you a steel jug of coffee, and you order your main breakfast - full English breakfast, smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, pancakes, eggs benedict, and I think there was a vegetarian option. I got the full breakfast (tons of pics already on TripAdvisor) - exactly as depicted and so, so good. It's noon and I'm already excited for breakfast tomorrow even though we're booked at a Michelin star restaurant for dinner!

I would definitely come back to this hotel. Likely even if they didn't have the breakfast (as sad as that would be), given the location and price.",5,2022,05,28
232,Absolutely delightful!,"This hotel is like stepping back in time. It is old but very well cared for and very classy. The staff appear to be career employees who really care about their customers.  From the front desk to the breakfast staff, they couldn’t have been better. The room was nice and clean with everything working properly. As a 30 yr airline employee I have travelled extensively. In recent years I have noticed hotels are more than happy leaving the cleaning of the rooms so late in the day that you will offer to skip it. Replacing towels & coffee only, seems to have become the norm. The Wynn hotel is not one of those hotels. Because they still use the old key system with a huge brass fob, you are required to leave it at the desk. It appears that they notice when you have left & clean the room right away. What a treat to come back from a morning tour to have the room done. The breakfast is exceptionally good. There is a continental option but you can order from a menu as well. The eggs Benedict were unbelievably good and pancakes are as well. Tables have  tablecloths and there are actual servers! 
The only downside is that while the location is perfect for seeing all of the highlights of downtown Dublin, it is noisy. The tram runs right past the front door & O’Connell St is very busy. If you can, request a room at the back. 
You will be fortunate to get a room at the Wynn so book early.",4,2022,05,24
232,Dublin,"Excellent hotel, service, and meals. Rooms are very nice. The staff is exceptional. This is where I will be staying every time I am in Dublin. 
I would recommend this establishment to anyone. 
I don’t need two hundred characters to describe this place.",5,2022,05,21
232,Faded old glory with maintenance problems.,"One star for beautiful old glory and decent breakfast plus one star for location and price.
Night 1: people in the room above us took a shower at 11 PM. We got an extra shower in our bathroom outside the shower area. Water running down through the ceiling and the downlights. That is a fire problem, mixing electricity with water.
Night 2: we told the front desk, and they said they would try to get us another room. We packed before leaving for the day, and asked to have a room in the back as the road in the front has trams, buses, cars, bars and lots of noisy people. We came back from our walk that day, and got a room in the front. They had moved our stuff, which we appreciated. No hot water in the taps, and we were later asked not to use water at all for thirty minutes as they had problems with the pumps and were about to fix that. The shower head was dangling as it did not fit the holder, so only hand held shower was possible. 
Night 3: we told them about the shower head (which they must have known about), and asked if we could have a room In the back as it had been so noisy. We got that, but they told us that the room we had had the first night was occupied again so we got another. Occupied with these leakage problems??. This third room had a toilet seat that was fastened only on one side, and additionally was way to small. Also something the cleaners would have seen and was not fixed. One lightbulb was not working. We had this room for two nights.

Granted, they might have (ad shortage of satay due to COVID or whatever, but normal maintenance like fastening a toilet seat, replacing a lightbulb and shower head, can’t be that difficult to sit and not very work consuming.",2,2022,05,08
232,"Lovely room, great breakfast","The hotel is in a great location, slap bang in the middle of town. The bedroom was perfect  - good size, comfy beds, very clean. 
The breakfast was very good and freshly cooked. 
I also want to highlight the staff, all of whom were excellent.",5,2022,05,07
232,Great hotel,"Friendly staff and we were let into room early which was great. 
Loved the breakfast, which was cooked to order. 
Room had all the facilities we needed and was cleaned every day.
The only downside is that it is noisy at the front , as there is a tram line outside.",4,2022,05,06
232,Wonderful,"I had the pleasure of staying in this hotel three times and everything was always perfect. Location is great, my room was spacious, comfortable and clean (upgraded, no extra charge), with every comfort you could ask for. Breakfast is delicious with freshly baked pancakes and many other options both salty and sweet. Last but not least, the staff is really helpful and friendly, they all made me feel at home - a massive thank you to Roberta and Ana at the reception!! Can't wait to get back.",5,2022,04,08
232,Irish Hospitality,"Wonderful hotel with great staff ! Friendly, Helpful.
Hotel was super clean, beds very comfortable after weary traveling the jacuzzi tub was an unexpected bonus. Food delicious, location in the heart of everything, but the staff is 5 ⭐️.
Thank you WynnFolk for the best stay in our travels throughout Ireland !!",5,2022,04,07
232,Can't go wrong by staying here,"I had read all the positive reviews about the Wynn, and they are all correct.  You truly cannot go wrong by selecting this hotel for your Dublin adventure.  It is beautifully located with the trams and busses literally at your front door.   The Connolly train station is, at most, a ten minute easy walk.
Pretty much anywhere you wanted to go was within walking distance.  If you thought the distance was a little further than you wanted to tackle in one swoop, you could always duck in to one of the ever present pastry shops and take a break.  At least it's a good excuse for stopping at a pastry shop:)

A couple good restaurants were close also - one was about half a block from Wynn's and was called The Oval.  Good food and the evening we were there they had some delightful music.
The other would be Ann's Bakery.  There are two - one is a sandwich shop and closes earlier than the bigger one which is open until 5:30 but features quite a few choices for sandwiches, hot main dishes, etc.  (Good pastries also.)

The Church was also delightful, yummy fish and chips and they also had some Celtic music with dancers the night we were there.

The Wynn's bar area/restaurant also served delicious entrees if you are so inclined.  Seat by the fireplace was my favorite.

We stayed ten days in Dublin, all of which were at Wynn's.  The room was larger than I had expected (we were in 837 which is toward the back of the hotel and was nice and quiet.)  Everything was exquisitely clean and the beds were exceedingly comfortable.  Bathroom was nicely appointed and had plenty of hot water.

It is the staff that truly makes the Wynn exceptional, from the desk clerk/receptionists, the various doormen, the ladies who clean the rooms, the wait staff in both the restaurant and the bar area - exemplary.  Using the adjective ""nice"" just doesn't convey how truly welcome they made you feel and always so helpful and you would never know they probably had answered the same questions a zillion times.  I cannot rave enough about the personnel.  I have no idea how Wynn management consistently manages to get such top notch people, but they certainly have.

And the breakfasts....what a treat.  You can choose from a full-blown Irish breakfast with sausages and eggs, potatoes, etc., or smoked salmon with scrambled eggs. and much more.  The variety was truly astonishing.  My favorite ended up being the porridge.  Not sure what they do to it to make it so mouthwatering, but I have a hunch it's not the microwaveable out of the packet oatmeal.  Maybe the offer of real cream poured over the top had something to do with it also.

I have no qualms about recommending  Wynn's for any stay in Dublin.  Top notch.",5,2022,03,11
232,"Great hotel, excellent services & staff","We needed a good hotel for an offsite meeting for 8 executive staff, the hotel provided good accommodation, great meeting space, and excellent & attentive staff. I would definitely recommend this hotel for an offsite meeting & stay.",5,2022,02,17
232,Lovely comfortable hotel,"Cosy super clean room on beautiful elegant hotel. Friendly staff , delicious breakfast the eggs Benedict are amazing ! 2 things negative is that it's very noisy, not only because of the noise from the popular street but as well from rooms around.. and there was no information in the room about how to contact reception , hotel rules etc ...apart from this , highly recommended hotel.",4,2022,02,13
232,First time visit,"First time staying here, and we were both very impressed.  Lovely historic vibe about the place; the staff were without exception excellent and welcoming, and the hotel is spotless!  The breakfast was among the best we've had, and the bar on Saturday nite had a relaxed, friendly atmosphere - with brilliant bar staff.  Would we stay here again?  In a heartbeat!! ",5,2022,01,31
232,Very nice stay at the Wynn's,"We've had a very nice stay for 2 nights. We've been warmly welcomed by Roberta. The staff is really nice and helpful. The room we had was quite big and the beds were really confortable. Regarding the breakfast, it is more than complete and it tastes really good. I recommend !",5,2022,01,31
232,Wyns Hotel Abbey Street Dublin,"Stayed there for 2 nights in the middle of the week in November, found the staff excellent and very accommodating,  food was very reasonably priced and very tasty, rooms were very well cleaned plenty of towels and toiletries, close to all amenities in the city centre ie trams taxis and shops bars and restaurants.",5,2021,11,28
232,"Great location, great staff, very clean.","This hotel is a has a great city centre location with convenient discounted parking near by at the Irish Life car park approx 3 min walk away.
Genuinely friendly and very helpful staff.
Old style hotel, extremely clean.
Good breakfast selection.",5,2021,11,09
232,Don’t ask them to book you a taxi,"Comfortable characterful hotel in a good location close to shops and Temple Bar.  The family room was a good size, powerful shower and 2 TVs (but only one remote which controlled both). The carvery was good - turkey, lamb or fish of the day - and generous portions.  Breakfast offered a wide range from full Irish to pancakes and continental. The big let down was the taxi which we booked through reception. We asked for one that could take 5 to the airport at 3pm.  After much chasing a 4-seater arrived at 3:20pm.  Reception then told us it was really busy and there weren’t any 5 seaters so two of us took the first taxi and we asked them to order a second taxi but they couldn’t give us an eta so we ended up going round the corner (1 minute away) to the taxi rank where it wasn’t at all busy and there were plenty.  Our driver told us that the hotel have a deal with one firm, charge customers an additional €2 but then aren’t bothered whether it arrives or not.  Definitely recommend the hotel - just don’t ask them to order you a taxi.",4,2021,11,05
232,birthdat treat,"traveled from wales to ireland and spent 3 nights at the wynns hotel . cant fault the service or staff ,everything was perfect. It is situated on a busy  street and tram line pass directly outside the hotel.This might bother some but it didnt bother us as so busy seeing all the attractions dublin has to offer we slept well.My only regret was we never dined in the restaurant other than for breakfast which i have to say was delicious and varied choice , We were celebrating my birthday and was given a upgrade in room. Room was clean and large in size ,
Planning on returning in may 2022 for my husbands birthday if covid allows as some of the attractions we wanted to visit were either booked up or not fully open.thank you to everyone for giving such personalized service .",5,2021,11,03
232,Beware: Hotel cancelled our reservation without notification,3 days to go so I thought I'd double check the hotel only to find out they'd cancelled our room without telling us. We have stayed there before and they had our old card on record through the online agent. And for some reason they tried to take pre-payment (unauthorised) and then cancelled when they realised the card was out of date. They didn't email or call even though they had our number. Why is this? Are they under new management? They used to be so professional here. We've been given no answers or help. Terrible.,1,2021,11,01
232,Wonderful stay with friendly and helpful staff.,"I would recommend staying in Wynn's Hotel. My family and I stayed there on 28/10/2021.  The hotel is very central and everything (including the room and dining) is very reasonably priced. The lady on reception was very friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome. She checked us in very efficiently, and we knew everything we needed to know about the hotel and its services. We had asked for two rooms close to each other, and we got rooms right beside each other which was brilliant. They clearly care about their visitors.  We got lunch in the carvery and the food was fantastic and very well priced. The bedrooms were lovely. There was plenty of space, and the shower was very good. The beds were comfortable. The following morning, breakfast was served quickly and there were many options on the menu. The breakfast staff were accommodating and efficient, and the food was great. A special mention to Derek, the porter, who was very helpful and took such good care of our luggage. We had left our luggage in storage as we had a morning event to attend. We were hugely inconvenient when we returned just to change our clothes after this event; we needed access to our bags without removing them from storage at that point. Derek was very kind and went above and beyond to accommodate us. 

I would certainly recommend staying at Wynn's hotel and I intend to stay there again when I return to Dublin.",5,2021,10,30
232,Wynn’s a Winner,"Stayed for the weekend in this beautiful hotel. Just off O’Connell Street right in the centre. Checkin was easy room on third floor was very quiet at night. Bed was very comfortable and huge. We were a couple but had a quad room so the two singles were our dressing area. Shower great plenty of hot water. You had to checkin and then wait until called for breakfast.  It was a delight to start the day with a cooked to order breakfast one of the best we have had. 
Covid restrictions carried out efficiently . Had dinner on the Saturday night in the hotel was excellent.
Cannot recommend this old world hotel enough will definitely go back.",5,2021,10,25
232,Two Night Stay.,"The Hotel is situated to all that Dublin has to offer. Breakfast very tasty and cooked to order.Staff at reception were exceptional always very helpful and friendly.
I will stay here if in Dublin on a visit.",4,2021,10,24
232,Lovely Historic Hotel ,"Wynns' slogan is 'in the heart of Dublin since 1845' which gives an idea of the history of the hotel. It is full of character with beautiful tiled floors and stained glass windows. 

The rooms also have much period charm though some are rather small. They are very well equipped and comfortable though.

Saints and Scholars lounge offers a really great carvery lunch and evening menu with a daily roast option. A special thank you to David and Irina here who provided exemplary service 

You couldn't be more central, just around the corner from O'Connell Bridge.

232,"Classic hotel, friendly staff, great location","It's a traditional style hotel with a lot of old world charm about it. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was great too. Room was comfortable, clean and just what I needed for my night down in the city but no hairdryer though. Decent location, all the main sights are within walking distance.",4,2021,10,16
232,Tea and scones,"Called in today at 2pm, perhaps not the best time as we didn’t want lunch just tea and scones. Prompt service and provided with warm scones with butter, jam and cream and a good pot of tea. Very enjoyable with very friendly accommodating staff. Well done.",5,2021,10,13
232,Amazing staff and lovely accommodations. Authentic Dublin with a perfect location!,We loved Claire at the front desk and I can't wait to bring my daughter to stay with you. It's been a couple years but my memories of our lovely stay are the best! Fantastic in every way. The breakfast surpassed anything in the states.,5,2021,09,29
232,Perfect for Dublin City Break,A charming hotel with excellent character. Staff are incredibly friendly and super helpful. The hotel has an impressive interior and rooms are spacious with good beds and bathrooms. Free coffee and tea in rooms. The bar downstairs has a great atmosphere and is a favourite of locals and guests. Breakfast is excellent and served in an impressive dining room; both cooked and continental options. I had an early flight and breakfast was made available at 5am for me. The local area is a bit rough but in a way usual for a city centre. Very easy transport links or just to walk out the door and be already in central Dublin.,5,2021,09,13
232,Poor customer service,This is a lovely hotel but the customer service when something goes wrong is very poor.  On their advice we parked overnight in a nearly car park with which they have an arrangement. We told the hotel staff we needed to be at the ferry port by 7:40 am yet the car park did not open the following morning until 8am  as a result we missed our ferry. The hotel staff were most unhelpful and accepted no responsibility saying the matter was between us and the car park.,2,2021,09,09
232,Wynns hotel,"Lovely staff and a perfect location. Very clean and safe hotel. Staff very helpful. All the sites are within an easy walk and lots of good shopping, good food and excellent Guinness in the bar. Excellent breakfast choice. Kettle, tea, iron and hairdryer in the room",5,2021,09,05
232,Wonderful week,"I enjoyed a wonderful week in this hotel. Located at the center of Dublin, it provides excellent accommodation services with clean, spacious rooms, excellent staff, rich breakfast and efficient wifi. 
Security, health and safety of visitors is assured.",5,2021,09,05
232,Lovely stay at Wynn's Hotel,"My sister and I stayed 3 nights at Wynn's Hotel in late august 2021. It is a lovely classic style hotel steeped in history. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and our room was nicely furnished and kept spotlessly clean every day.
The included breakfast was excellent - full Irish breakfast of thickly cut bacon, sausages, egg, black pudding, potato cake, mushrooms and tomato with juices, cereals, pastries, breads, toast all washed down with fresh tea or coffee - it was a full meal in itself. 
The hotel is very centrally located just off O'Connell Street and there is a tram stop right outside the front entrance of the hotel to take you to the National Museum of Ireland and the Guinness Storehouse. It's just a short walk to Temple Bar, Trinity College (Book of Kells), Dublin Castle and both gothic cathedrals St. Patrick's and Christ Church.  
We loved the classic décor of the hotel - it even had a dial above the lift to show you where the lift was like in old films - and the warm and friendly welcome.
We just loved it.",5,2021,09,01
232,Request a room with a bath ,"Arrived at the wynns at about midday and we could check in early.

Was disappointed with the room as there was no bath after requesting one. The bed was also tiny not what I excepted for a well established hotel.
Also very hot and only a small fan that didn't do much. Not enough toiletries. 

Staff were lovely very accommodating, especially the porters on the door.

Breakfast was nice made to order which was lovely but watching them clean down tables was terrible. Nothing was moved to wipe them down. Just a damp cloth to remove crumbs. 

Im not sure if I'd stay again if I would it would be for location only. 

",3,2021,08,22
232,Good Location. Value for Money,This hotel is a great venue right in the centre of Dublin. Coming out of lockdown the hotel like the city was very quiet. While it is a modern hotel it has the appeal of a hotel from an earlier age. The staff were very helpful. There is a convenient local carpark that offers discount to hotel customers. The breakfast was freshly cooked and of great quality. The one downside for me was that it is on the LUAS route (tram) so it was very noisy until midnight and then early in the morning. If you are not used to city centre living you might want to bring ear plugs.,4,2021,08,20
232,Beware of poorly cooked potatoes,Went in here for the carvery. At €14.95 the Turkey isn't cheap but with the exception of the potatoes it was fine. Potatoes dreadfully undercooked and rock hard. The ladies on the table next to us sent their mash potatoes back. The interior of Wynn's restaurant is great but their chef clearly can't cook potatoes.,3,2021,08,18
232,10/10 visit,"We found Wynn’s after a long, tiring day of walking because our train home was cancelled. We were immediately welcomed by the kind, accommodating staff who couldn’t do enough for us. We were shown into the cozy restaurant with a great selection of dinners. We had a hearty meal of turkey and ham, followed by tea. Would 100% recommend to a friend and will be back again in the future! 

Sarah & Aisling",5,2020,10,19
232,Lovely hotel ,Stayed here again recently on 2 separate nights. This is a lovely hotel. Clean and comfortable with the most amazing cooked to order breakfast. Staff are really attentive. Covid compliant. Felt well cared for and safe and well refreshed after sleeping in a comfortable bed in a comfortable room. A hotel not to be passed! ,5,2020,09,30
232,Unforgetable,"I hope Ireland will be soon fully open again and I can come back to this hotel. I was there last January with family and experience very unusual service. I and my family felt there like a part of big family. There was a lot of fun, especially in the lounge and the location is also amazing. Everywhere within a walking distance. Hope to be there soon again.",5,2020,09,24
232,My colleague recommended me WYNNS HOTEL,"For the last eight months, I have had the opportunity to work on an interesting project in Cork, Ireland. On my return, I decided to spend the last three days of my stay in Dublin. My colleague recommended me WYNNS HOTEL and I must admit that he could not recommend better! Even in difficult conditions, in which everyone has to work, the quality of services was absolutely PERFECT! Excellent location and within walking distance to main tourist spots and tram stop right outside the front door! Top class cleanness in the whole Hotel. It has a colorful history as the prints, plaques and other material in the bar testify. Room was large and very comfortable. Bed was very comfortable as well. Outstanding breakfast. Dinner with pint of Guinness too! The kindness of all staff made for a very pleasant stay. My next stay in Dublin will definitely be combined with accommodation at WYNNS HOTEL.",5,2020,09,21
232,Great Stay,"Really enjoyed the hotel, it was extremely comfortable and the staff was amazing. Luas just at the doorstep is definitely a great plus . 
They were taking the right precautions for COVID. Thanks for a wonderful stay",5,2020,09,18
232,Not good,"Booked b+b for one night. Got confirmation email for b+b deal and price. No restaurant no bar, no cooked breakfast. Charged full price. Complained. Got no reply until I complained again. Offered upgrade the next booking. This will never happen. Poor all round",2,2020,09,07
232,Booking Deposit not returned,"DO NOT STAY OR BOOK ANYTHING WITH THIS HOTEL:
This  is an ongoing issue I have been having since February this year with Wynns Hotel in Dublin. I even went as far as telling the Managers in Wynn's hotel that I am going to do this, but it seems to have had no effect. 

It started out Feb 12th when I, and my friend, went into the hotel to inquire about booking one of the function rooms for my brother's 50th Birthday which was coming that May. I spoke to a lovely Assistant Manager named Douglas, who went through the booking with me, and I paid a 300 euro deposit to secure the room. 

After the invites went out, we quickly found that the room I had booked would not accommodate everyone who had accepted, it was clear that more people wanted to be added to the list of invites, and now we had to do something to make it work. So a few days after the booking I got back in touch with Douglas, and checked once again the capacity of the room, I asked about the availability of a larger function room that they had in the hotel. Unfortunately that room was booked out, and after speaking with my siblings we decided to cancel it, that was on Feb 18th, 6 days after the initial booking with Douglas. 

Since that time, and until now, I have been waiting for a refund. I was promised it was happening on more than one occasion, even being told to wait as it would take 3/5 days for it to hit my account. 

I sent many emails, and made lots of calls, I even left it alone when the pandemic was ongoing. But recently I got back in touch, and I am told that I can not have my refund as per T&C's (which I never saw, and was never told about, also it is not on their website), but I could have a voucher. I rang within two minutes of receiving this email, and was told that the manager who had sent it, had just left the building. Excuses like this have been ongoing, and to be honest either the replies to my emails or calls have been ignored, or I have received short and sometimes rude replies. 

I don't know what to do at this stage, other than go in and refuse to leave until I get my refund, or get a solicitor. I believe they have behaved in a manner that is extremely unprofessional, considering the iconic status of this Hotel. 

Just a note, my siblings and I had booked a function room in this hotel a few years previous for my aunts 70th, which was a great success, and this is why I returned to Wynns. Clearly the management has changed, and their standards and not what they used to be.

232,Pleasant Stay,"The staff were excellent, they really made you feel welcome, cracking breakfast, good location, really nice traditional looking hotel, everything is within walking distance, bars, restaurants etc. I can't really say much more, would certainly stay there again. Well done Wynn's hotel.",4,2020,03,25
232,Weekend Away,"Stayed here for a weekend break and very happy with our choice.  Very close to everything, yet we had no noise at all in our room (although they do offer free ear plugs should you ask). The service was excellent, even opening the gym at 11.30 at night (son was super keen) without a grumble.

Rooms were bit dated but let’s be honest it’s an old hotel so added to it, and had all the facilities that we needed. Gym is in the basement but again was fully stocked with a range of equipment.  Breakfast was also very good

Would fully recommend ",5,2020,03,11
232,Great Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,"Stayed for one night in March 2020 after a concert at 3 Arena. We selected a superior room but were upgraded on our arrival. We had stayed at Wynn's before so we knew that we were booking into a great hotel, but the room we got this time was amazing. Comfort, cleanliness, friendly staff, quiet location, excellent breakfast all helped to make this a really nice experience.",5,2020,03,10
232,Dublin's Grand Dame of service and hospitality,"We stay here whenever our travels bring us to Dublin, where we are always warmly greeted like family and treated with gracious hospitality.  The staff is most-cordial and cannot do enough to make sure that your stay is a pleasant one.  The rooms (and, the entire hotel) are spotless and their restaurant is definitely an oasis for those that prefer a pub alternative.  Full Irish breakfast is second to none and a great way to start your day in Dublin or before your departure.  Extremely attentive to our needs during a recent health issue which was most-comforting to us.",5,2020,03,05
232,“Superior” twin room,"Stay here with a friend a few weeks ago in a “superior” twin room.
I’ve stayed here a few times and generally found it to be a comfortable , traditional , older hotel with a bit of character and certainly very central .
Breakfast is great , as is the lunchtime carvery.
This time we stayed in a “superior “ twin room on the third floor ...it was   Saturday night and while we certainly paid for a superior room (room 375) the room was anything but superior .
I’ve attached a photo of the jacuzzi bath in the room which you can see has a very badly cracked bath panel.
The bath panel hasn’t  been damaged recently..it’s been like this for some time.
We might have overlooked the very small size of the room but coupled with the shoddy bathroom , it’s kind of obvious this room is far from superior and we felt kind of cheated considering the high price we paid.
It’s a pity but standards have fallen at what was once one of my favourite hotels in Dublin .
Oh and they “made a mistake “ with my already very high bill and attempted to overcharge me compared to the agreed price.",2,2020,03,04
232,Excelent hotel,"Stay for one night  on Feb 10th,was attending a  concert in the 3 arena,hotel very clean and ideal situated for all needs,luas stops outside door,which was perfect for us going to the show,a 2 minute walk away from shops,what realy made our stay was the breakfast great selecting of buffet and an excelent hot option and off course the breakfast staff were highly professional,all in all an excelent stay and will be back",5,2020,02,23
232,Hidden gem in central Dublin,Found Wynnes hotel to be the perfect location for our stay in Dublin.  Hotel is full of charm and history. Our room had been recently decorated with an extremely comfortable bed. Delicious breakfast with a great choices.  The friendly and helpful staff are what gave the hotel the edge on other hotels we have stayed in in central Dublin. Will stay there again the next time in Dublin City.  ,5,2020,02,22
232,"Good stay, great location","This hotel offers a good stay.  The staff is warm and wonderful.  Breakfast is good.  The hotel and rooms are clean, spic and span.  The location is totally awesome - right in the middle of everything downtown Dublin has to offer.  A couple of things to watch out for.
1) The rooms are really small, so are the beds.  If you are 6' tall or over, you may not fit on the bed.  But this is downtown Dublin, very expensive real estate so this is probably the norm.

2) The wifi is terrible. In some rooms you don't get any signal and where you do have a wifi signal it makes you wait minutes for email and Whatsapp to load, never mind streaming movies or downloading files.

Hotel Wynn - in 2020, good and fast wifi really should not be a point of discussion.  Please take care of this.  Everything else you have is great, cover this one base and you are golden.",4,2020,02,13

The staff were excellent and a special mention to Roberta how look after us from when we arrived until we departed on Sunday",5,2020,02,11
232,great stay,"Arrived for our stay early due to RyanAir flights moving, had emailed the hotel beforehand saying this and when we arrived late morning they had organised our rooms, what service.
Check in took moments, room was large, clean and perfect, if a little warm.
Bed was comfy and the shower was amazing, the most powerful shower ever !!! (was fantastic to clear those heavy Guinness heads).
Breakfast was superb, in a beautiful room, service was fantastic and food was great.
Location was fine, 2 mins walk from the Liffey and loads nearby.
Would stay here again.",5,2020,02,06
232,Great all round hotel,"This was my second visit to Wynns and again it was with friends for a long weekend. 
We arrived at the hotel at 08.00 am after an early morning flight and the reception were only too happy to allocate some of our rooms so we were able to leave our bags and head off for the day.
The rest of the rooms were sorted when we got back later and we all agreed they were clean spacious and well equipped. 
We met in the hotel bar in the evening and it’s a lovely friendly place where prices don’t take your breath away unlike some hotels I’ve stayed in.
Next morning the breakfast was absolutely fantastic with all the usual things juices, fruit, cereals and pastries and the Full Irish was a triumph with everything freshly cooked to perfection.
All the staff we met were really pleasant and helpful plus they looked happy to be working there.
We are planning another trip and the first thing we all agreed was we’d be staying here again. Great all round hotel, excellent value with a very good central location 
Well done to all at Wynns.",5,2020,02,05
232,Very nice hotel with a great breakfast,"The room was clean and comfortable, the staff were extremely courteous and helpful, and the breakfast was absolutely spot on. The hotel is located in the centre of the city, so the majority of sights and attractions are easily accessible on foot, or alternatively you can hop on the tram which stops right outside the hotel. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2020,02,03
232,Lovely central hotel,We stayed here for one night recently and it was a lovely hotel right in the centre of Dublin. So convenient to shops and restaurants. We had a car with us and the porter parks it for you when you check in. It’s €14 for 24 hours. The Luas is right outside the door which is handy for the 3 arena and other tourist sites. Overall great hotel with friendly helpful staff and comfy beds. ,5,2020,02,03
232,Wynns again,"Old world splendour, modern
comfort and hospitality levels. Friendly attractive staff. Couldn't be more pleased. Breakfast to die for.
Will be back. Very convenient for dining and theatre.

Bar, bedroom and dining room very well appointed.",5,2020,02,01
232,Lovely hotel ~ Hope to return!,"We were only two nights here, a kind of respite for jet lag between lengthy travels -- a breather that allowed us to see some of the sights and catch a play at The Abbey.  This beautifully appointed historic hotel is situated in the heart of Dublin, within walking distance of so many sights and restaurants.   Much of the old woodwork and other fixtures have been preserved/restored, and we enjoyed the festive holiday decor.  The staff was SO friendly and courteous.  Our first night was noisy (our room located right above the front entrance, with very busy bus mall and trash trucks on the street below), but we asked to be moved to a quieter room the second night and this was quite a bit better.

Our accommodations were clean and comfortable.  The breakfast was outstanding, with delicious oatmeal, fresh juices, hot cooked breakfasts, pastries, such choices! and such impeccable service!  We also enjoyed a delicious meal and after-theatre libations in The Saints and Scholars lounge.  (Even though meal service was technically over, Jason kindly arranged to have a bit of dessert for us after our theatre excursion -- a welcome treat!)   If we were to ever return to Dublin, we would not hesitate to stay here!",5,2020,01,25
232,Helpful staff.,"Breakfasts were wonderful!  The staff were exceptionally helpful. The welcome when we arrived set the tone for our most enjoyable weekend in
Dublin. 
The waitress remembered my preference for decaffeinated tea on the second morning! I was very impressed. That was a personal touch.",5,2020,01,20
232,Excellent hotel,I had a fantastic stay here. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Rooms were comfortable warm spacious and bed was lovely. The staff were excellent. The door man was a gem and the reception staff were so helpful. The man helping at breakfast was so professional and kind. I will be back again soon for sure. Bonus -the luas stops right outside.,5,2020,01,10
232,A must visit,Two nights stay for my family at wynns hotel dublin. From start to finish everything was perfect all the staff were a credit to the property from the reception to the maids. Breakfast was one of the best we have had from all over the world. 5 out of 5 on everything,5,2020,01,05
232,Great city centre hotel,"An old-style hotel full of character. Comfortable, spotless room. Couldn't be more central; also at Luas stop (yes you can hear the trams and the seagulls - part of the charm). Breakfast room is lovely. Breakfast itself OK. A couple more non-meat items on menu would be nice. Delighted with our stay. ",5,2020,01,05
232,Another Great Stay,Just checked out of Wynn's and as always I am well pleased with my stay here. The staff love working here and it shows because they are just great. Old world charm at its best. Great food in restaurant also. Good choice for dining even if you are not staying. Location perfect.,5,2020,01,05
232,Excellent as always,"My daughter and I go to Dublin on average five times a year and Wynns is by far our preferred hotel. We always look to book it and as such, have stayed here numerous times.
It is from every aspect superb.  Spotlessly clean and warm rooms, comfortable beds and pillows, yummy breakfasts, fabulous dining room . However, it is above all the staff at Wynns who are absolutely outstanding. Friendly and genuine,  efficient and extremely helpful. Nothing is too much effort for them.  They are so welcoming and make one feel completely at home. Dining room staff, those on reception and front door porters are all in a league of their own. 
We are already looking forward to our next visit!",5,2019,12,29
232,A very charming city hotel,"I enjoyed my short stay at Wynn's Hotel in November 2019. The hotel is situated very central near to most of the important points of interested, the river Liffey and the famous Temple Bar District. The hotel looks a little bit old-fashioned, but it is very comfortable and clean. 
The only bad thing during my stay were the loud parties in the second floor (My room was in the third floor).",4,2019,12,17
232,Traveler from the U.S.,"Had a 3 night stay during December 2019.  This hotel is very nice and secure.  It is located tangent to the main areas of the city, so if you are open to walking .25 to 1 mile you can get to most any location you want to go to, i.e. Dawson street, Grafton street, Temple Bar, etc.  And the tram runs past it so you can take the red line or green line easily.  Good breakfast, which is included and great service, clean.  The hotel itself is an older style hotel so you get the fun of staying in a local hotel as opposed to a chain.",5,2019,12,17
232,Old World Victorian Charm With Modern Comforts,"In the heart of Dublin is the Wynn's. Close to shopping and great places to eat and get a pint of your favorite. The hotel has a charm from the past but everything else is modern and up to date. They are close to a great pub on the corner and several more within 2 minutes walking distance. The rooms are good size, very clean, quiet at noght, and very comfortable. All modern bathroom upgrades. The staff is very friendly and efficient. 
The unload zone is in front of the hotel (but on the oppossite side of the street). A parking garage is two blocks away, but is an easy walking distance. The Parking facility is called Park Rite, down the street on the left.",5,2019,12,07
232,Top-notch service!,"I do admire that the hotel maintains its historical legacy in form of interiors, old-fashioned keys, furniture and several other details. The service is probably one of the best, I have experienced so far: professional, polite, swift and friendly all over the place: in the reception, bar and the dining room. Due to certain reasons we were not very easy guests, but the service was still top notch. I was seriously impressed by the breakfast there: ""the full Irish"" could not get any better (of course in my humble opinion). Otherwise, the hotel is located at one of the best spots in the downtown with tram stop right outside, 3 minutes-walk to the main bus stops, airport shuttle and taxis' stop. The only thing, I could slightly complain about is that it can be a bit noisy at the lower floors, but I guess this is difficult to avoid, when you have a building with respectable age and a tram stop right outside the front door.",5,2019,12,05
232,"Great location, GREAT STAFF.","We spent 6 nights at this hotel and were very pleased.  The location; 200 feet off of McConnell St. which is the main street trough Dublin, yet quiet.  A 5 minute walk to the bus lines to and from the airport.  A 10 minute walk to the Temple Bar Square area with more pubs than you can count.       The staff is wonderful, friendly, helpful and sincere.  The morning breakfast was well worth it, either a continental breakfast , a full menu breakfast cooked to order or both.  Beds were very comfortable, large bathroom (for European standards).  However, room was cold. we were here in February and it was cold outside.  Even though the radiant heater was set at 21.5 Celsius, (appox 71 degrees F.)  the actual room temp was closer to 64F.  I would stay here again and would recommend this hotel.
                                                                                          ",5,2019,12,04
232,The perfect stay for a busy composer,"We stayed in Wynn's for two nights as my work was being performed in Liberty Hall Theatre (which is just 5 minutes walk away). Wynn's is a beautiful Olde World style hotel, but it has all modern facilities (including wifi). 
The breakfast was really fantastic and nutritious, the breakfast room is beautiful.
On the night of the performance, we got back late, just minutes before 21:00. The restaurant staff was superb and we had a very nice dinner while trying to wind down.
Our room was really nice and as quiet as it can get in a noisy city. The bathroom was magnificent, with shower/bath AND jacuzzi! Extra teabags and milk were available too, as we love a good few cups of tea at night. We'll be back!",5,2019,11,29
232,Dublin visit,"Excellent friendly staff in a fantastic location. The restaurant manager deserves a special mention. 
We can recommend this hotel . 
Use the team to visit Dublin especially the Epic emigration museum which is fantastic",5,2019,11,23
232,"Great place, great location, great breakfast !!","Very comfortable stay. Nice size room with a great shower. This was the first time ever not turning the shower on full pressure, very powerful. Great breakfast with nice service. Convenient location, felt very safe. Hotel staff was very helpful. Visited The Irish Emigration Museum (very interesting), Christ Church Cathedral and Saint Patrick Cathedral all within walking distance. Would definitely return.",5,2019,11,20
232,First class barman,A lot of positive for this central hotel. What realy stands out is an fabulous barman in David. A pro behind the bar with a service mind and a fast delivery - plus always a kind word to any customer. The bar is called Bar of Saints and Scholars!,5,2019,11,12
232,Charming hotel in an excellent location,"Stayed here for 1 night as we were attending an event in Dublin. We were very pleasantly surprised by the hotel. Rooms were very clean and decor was befitting of the hotel. Main foyer area was small but staff were very pleasant and very helpful. We didn’t get an opportunity to visit the bar and it was closed on our return about midnight. The main doors were also locked on our return but a short wait and the night porter let us in. Breakfast the following morning was delightful. The dining room and ambience added to the experience. The choice of food and the attention of the staff were both terrific. The location of this hotel also adds to its appeal, it is steps away from O’Connell Street, the Dart Station and Temple Bar are also a shirt walk away. Would definitely stay again if looking a hotel in Dublin City Centre.",4,2019,11,05
232,Very pleasant stay,"We stayed Friday 1st November,booked on line on hotel website,much cheaper than booking.com
Check in very pleasant and quick.room very nice,clean and warm with big en-suite.
The location is the best,in the centre,Luas stop outside,takes you everywhere.
Breakfast was really good and service very good.The bar had such character and historical information,not out of date at all,keeping in character,Avery busy hotel",5,2019,11,03
232,Dark,Dark interior. Food nice but expensive. Portions are ok. I think this place has a strong history in Dublin City centre but it doesn't sell it unfortunately. Staff were friendly enough. I think I would return,3,2019,11,02
232,Old world charm and good location,"I've stayed at Wynn's several times now. Love the convenient location next to O'Connell St. and the Luas, but that also makes it a noisy spot, so ask for a room on the back side of the hotel. Some of the rooms have updated bathrooms, and some do not, so that is another consideration - this last time, the bathroom was impossible. Breakfast is served in the elegant dining room, sit-down style, and cooked fresh to order, that is a plus. The staff is generally willing to please. Be aware that the entrance to the hotel is up several steps and there is no ramp - there is a doorman who can help, but it is not suitable for handicap access.",4,2019,11,01
232,Well located but tired and out of date,"Perhaps I am being harsh given that this is locally known as an historic hotel but, given the room rate of €250+ per night for essentially a bed & breakfast type stay, I was expecting something a little more polished, and renovated.
Having said that, the bed was comfortable and room size adequate. No real amenities. Bathroom shower was impossible to get a consistent bearable temperature from, very frustrating.
But the breakfast almost makes up for the other deficiencies.
Worth considering for a short stay but try to get a better room rate given there's no frills with this one! ",3,2019,10,31
232,Great Location Great Staff,"Read the reviews and it is a hard  place to get to  with luggage as you can not   stop out the front to unload due to trams.  We had trouble finding the lane way to drop of bags and when we did it was blocked with a vehicle that had a wheel clamp on it.  In the end we parked and walked to the hotels and dropped off our bags, which was not easy. Once inside the hotel staff assisted us with our luggage. Rooms are good but if you have 2 large bags  like us it made it hard to move around the room. We were out the back and our room was quiet except for 1 morning and this was due to house keeping  taking a call on her phone and talking at the top of her voice out the front of our doorway, when I had had enough  I opened the door and  she then moved away it was a shame that she managed to   wake us both up at 7am in the morning.  
Breakfast is outstanding and the bar staff and drinks great,
Would stay again  ",4,2019,10,31
232,A Gem,"Cannot recommend this hotel enough. Location is perfect, right in the heart of the city, easy walking to everything we wanted to see but also with every means of transport right outside the front door, airport bus a block away. Staff from reception, housekeeping, breakfast room and bar/restaurant could not be more welcoming, helpful, courteous, friendly to say the least.  The property itself is in exceptional condition, very well maintained. Our room was lovely with comfortable bed and pillows, immaculately clean, bathroom very nice even with a warming towel rack. The full Irish breakfast is abundant and delicious and the breakfast room is lovely and elegant. We loved this hotel and will be back.",5,2019,10,29
232,Great location next to temple Bar area,I was looking for a hotel close to the temple bar area that was reasonably priced.  Very friendly staff.  good Breakfast.  They even suggested ways I could save money on parking.  For the price I would give it 5 out of 5,5,2019,10,16
232,Great Location,"Traditional, friendly hotel in the heart of the city. My room was very small and had a viiew over a brick wall, but was functional including free wifi. One complaint -- the wash basin wa so tiny that the oversized kettle didn't fit under the tap unless it was lying almost on its size.
Excellent (and enormous) breakfast included in the room price.",4,2019,10,14
232,Wynn's Hotel,"My husband and I loved this hotel, especialy the wonderful front desk staff, the delicious breakfasts and incomparable location--close to so many attractions and restaurants. We will stay there again on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2019,10,13
232,Excellent location ,"Hotel is in an excellent location, just around the corner from the airport bus stops and the stop for the the tourist city bus. Within easy walking distance of all the central city sights and plenty of great restaurants. Rooms were large and comfortable, I had one at the back which had no view but was quiet at night. Staff friendly and helpful, would stay there again if I went back. ",5,2019,10,12
232,Birthday celebration ,"We stayed at this hotel to celebrate my husbands birthday.
We stayed for 1 night and wished it could have been longer.
The hotel has a lovely old time feeling and feels so homely.
We stayed on the fifth floor and found our room to be very spacious and comfortable with a large bathroom with the same homely theme.
We had dinner in the bar area which we were served quickly even though they were very busy .
We had a roast dinner which was very tasty.
We returned to the bar for drinks later and were served by David he was so friendly and charming. We felt like he was an old friend.
He is definitely an asset to the hotel and deserves recognition for his work.
We enjoyed great service at breakfast in the morning .
The reception staff were warm and welcoming too.
Definitely stay here again on our frequent trips to Dublin.",5,2019,10,12
232,Great hotel great location,"Stayed in Wynns hotel for one night. We booked a deluxe double and we had a lovely room with views of the spire on the fifth floor. The room was really quiet with lovely window seats to watch the world go by. The bathroom was well appointed with Jacuzzi bath. The bed was really comfy and an amazing cooked breakfast included in the price. Nice friendly staff, I wouldn't stay anywhere else when in Dublin.",5,2019,10,10
232,"""Dublin's Best Hotel!!""",This was a wonderful hotel rich in history! My husband and I arrived very late at night and we were greeted warmly by hotel staff. Effortless check-in. No paperwork or credit card processing. We were given our key and off we went. Airport shuttle is very close so a very convenient way to get to and from the airport. The breakfast on offer was superb!! The setting even more so! The staff were friendly and efficient. Everything was on offer. All the sites were within walking distance. The only small criticism is the noise from outside late at night. We had a room facing Lwr Abbey Street (the front) and loud voices could be heard from the street well into the early morning. Young Dubliners like to party well into the night!!,5,2019,10,09
232,Sunday Meal,"The cavery meal was very good, a small dinner is more than enough. The service was professional and each item on the menu explained and well presented. The dining room becomes crowded fairly quickly so it's better to be seated by 1 pm",3,2019,10,07
232,Worth a Visit,"A hotel that has everything. Great central location. Great breakfast. Nice room and comfy beds. The staff are so friendly, helpful and good fun too. Busy hotel but no delay with service. Will definitely recommend to friends and family.",5,2019,10,05
232,"Excellent location, great service, awesome breakfast!","Highly recommend Wynns for a short stay in Dublin!

My fiancé and I stayed here for 2 nights during our visit to Dublin, last month and I cannot recommend it enough.

The service we received from everyone we met here, from the reception, to the bar staff, to the restaurant staff was first class. It’s a beautiful old hotel that has been renovated to a high standard, whilst still maintaining that ‘old world charm’.

The only thing that I would say, was that the room we had was very small and compact. It was a bit tight for two of us to move around in with luggage, if I’m honest, but it was a lovely room with a nice bathroom. It was fine for us as we were only there 2 nights, but any longer would have been a bit uncomfortable I think.

We did use the hotel gym, which was basic but functional. I don’t think many people use the gym here as we were the first people to sign out the key for the gym, in several days. It was fine for a quick workout pre-breakfast though.

As for breakfast, wow! Thoroughly impressed! All hot items are freshly cooked to order from a good sized menu of options. The service at breakfast is first class. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, The freshly baked croissants hot out of the oven, are THE BEST I’ve eaten anywhere in the world (including France!). 
We had the full Irish breakfast both mornings and it was the perfect start to our day!

If it’s your first time to Dublin, or even if it’s not, this hotel is perfect for exploring Dublin. The airport shuttle bus stops just 100m away on O’Connell St, which makes for an easy stress free arrival. You’re right in the heart of the city and only a short walk to Trinity College. We walked everywhere and it was so easy and convenient. You’re also only a short 10min walk to the Train station too.

Thank you to all of the staff at Wynns for a wonderful stay!",4,2019,10,04
232,Fine Dining.,"I had a very fine meal in this fine hotel, with old style traditional decor in it’s beautiful restaurant with very soft background music, an lovely food served in a traditional style ie cutlery etc. A hotel with a very interesting history going back some time. Very friendly staff.",4,2019,10,03
232,Good Location for Airport Bus shuttle,"This hotel has clean room, nice staff and is conveniently located. The Breakfast was pretty good as well as the service. The front staff were kind enough to let us check-in early after a Trans-Atlantic and check out was easy.. Great price and overall a good hotel for a night or 2 in Dublin.",4,2019,09,26
232,"Nice Room, Great Staff","We stayed 1 night here and it was very nice. Our room was newly renovated and was very nice (much nicer than the pics they have on their website). It was also pretty clean and the bathroom was very spacious. The staff was also excellent! We were leaving very early for the airport and they let us eat breakfast before it was officially open. We thought that was so nice! 

This area of Dublin is a little dicey at night, but it is very walkable. It's close to Temple Bar area and close to trams and busses. Very easy to get around.",4,2019,09,26
232,"Comfortable, central and civilised.","Location was great for meetings in central Dublin. Traditional, established and well maintained. hotel Receptionists helpful and efficient.  My room for single occupancy was small but comfortable.  Clean and good bathhroom. Good wifi signal. Delicious and perfectly cooked breakfast (by order rather than a cooked buffet) with attentive waiters and waitresses.  I will choose this hotel if I come to Dublin again. Close to where the 747 Airport bus dropped me ( 3 miniute walk away).",4,2019,09,26
232,Great hotel,We stayed here for 4 days had a great breakfast was great you get big portions.room very clean  clean towels every day right in the heart of Dublin  so easy access to all the sites and shops will defo stay again at Wynn’s staff are very helpful and friendly ,5,2019,09,21
232,Great choice ,"We stayed for one night and are going back for the last night of our stay this week. It was a great choice for staying in Dublin. Very neat old hotel with updates. We found our room comfortable. It is a bit noisy but tolerable, you are in Dublin after all...if you want silence you can get that elsewhere in Ireland. ",4,2019,09,15
232,Location and staff make this a winner,"My wife and I made a booking error and arrived a day before our reservation.  The hotel was fully booked but Roberta, the desk clerk on duty, went the extra mile, going online to find us a room at a nearby guesthouse.  Good job Roberta!  We returned the next day for or original booking.  Our room was small but comfortable, and quiet even though it was near the elevator.  Some street noise crept in from Lower Abbey Street, but it is a busy place, and a small price to pay for the terrific location.  They have a lovely breakfast room with a small but delicious menu(cooked to order), especially the excellent Eggs Benedict.  Good value for the money too, considering that this is Central Dublin.",4,2019,09,14
232,Great Hotel!!,"A beautiful hotel in a perfect location.  Very clean and friendly staff.
I would suggest asking for a room not facing the street as the noise from the street can be loud.  But the beds were comfortable and we had no problem sleeping.",4,2019,09,11
232,Beautiful old school hotel in the heart of Dublin,"We stayed in this hotel for two nights at the tail end of our UK trip and it was delightful! I’m stunned it’s not rated higher. We were surprised to find an old-school hotel with physical keys (not automatic). It was definitely a 5-star, upper-class hotel in its time. It’s still very nice. The staff goes beyond expectations, the breakfast is amazing, and it’s an easy walk to all tourist destinations in the city. The only, and I mean ONLY, complaint is that there are subway/transit tracks right outside the building, so you’d hear the subway go by every few minutes. Other features included in our superior double room: Dyson fan, jacuzzi bathtub, fridge, safe. Overall amazing experience and I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2019,09,08
232,Break with Neighbours,"Really great place to stay. Amazing staff, great food, best location. Street noise a small problem as was lack of variety on food each evening. Best breakfast, keeps you going for the day. Transport outside front door. Look forward to next visit.",4,2019,08,29
232,Cosy Old fashion Hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Nice old fashion hotel, overall pleased with our stay, room a little small but ok. One negative, our room had no AC and noisy at night when the resturant/hotel staff were dumping bottles from bar/resturant.",4,2019,08,23
232,Cosy Hotel in the Centre of Dublin,Nice old-fashioned hotel situated a few metres from the busy O'Donnell Street and in walking diistance from many of the museums. The staff were very friendly. And the breakfast was delicious. The room was spacious and very cosy.,4,2019,08,23
232,Great as usual,Have stayed at this hotel many times and it never disappoints. Staff are so friendly and so helpful. Rooms always spotless. Great location just off O’Connell Street. Breakfast is excellent and lovely to have table service. Will definitely be back,5,2019,08,19
232,Perfect Location...,"First the PROS

1) This hotel is in a great location within easy walking distance to Trinity College and the Temple Bar area. We like to tour cities primarily on foot so location is priority number one and this hotel is perfectly located.

2) Wynn's Hotel is a wonderful historic old building and with that comes lots of charm and character.

3) The complimentary breakfast is wonderful. You can eat from the buffet or order off of the menu and the eating area is beautiful. This is way above average in terms of free hotel breakfasts!

CONS

1) With the charm and character of an old building comes some challenges. We had such a hard time flushing our toilet that we had to move rooms. Then we were moved to a room that hadn't been cleaned... then we were moved again but this time to a suite! We also had some challenges ""dialing in"" the right temperature in the shower. This sounds trivial but it was quite a feet and more important than you might think!

2) Rooms are a bit small and a little dated as you would expect with an older hotel. This really isn't a CON, just thought I would mention.

All in all after a bit of a rough start the staff sorted us out and all was well. I would recommend this hotel on location alone.",4,2019,08,17
232,Chill break,We arrived at 11am n asked if we could leave our bags in storage but girl at reception said our room was ready and gave us an upgrade.from start to check out no problems .staff very helpful and friendly.we even had one of those new dyson fans in the room which was a godsend as it was very warm.hotel old but very clean n food 1st class.location ideal as is very central.we will be back.our no 1 hotel in dublin.,5,2019,08,15
232,Elegant and friendly ,"My friend and I arrived very early in the morning after a trans Atlantic flight and were warmly welcomed into this jewel of a hotel by charming staff who immediately accommodated us with early check-in and made us feel at home on our first visit to Ireland. Our room was well appointed and comfortable. The breakfast (included) is unbelievable- made to order and delicious! What a terrific place. Location, location, location, a slice of Dublin history, and not to be missed.",5,2019,08,13
232,Very nice stay !,"I spent 3 nights at Wynn's hotel. The location of this hotel is ideal: close to the city center and main touristic sites, and bus stations to the airport. The room was nice (a bit old fashioned, but I personaly like this), I asked for a quiet room and it was the case. The breakfast is just amazing. If I come back to Dublin, I know where to go.",4,2019,08,11
232,100% recommend this lovely hotel,"My daughter and I stayed here for two nights after stopping in a modern hotel in Dublin in May, although we enjoyed our last stay, Wynn's Hotel made it more special it felt more like the real Dublin.  The room was perfect 4th floor on the front, the noises outside were not a problem, the bathroom was lovely well stocked with toiletries. The breakfast was one of the best we have had I had the full Irish my daughter had the pancakes and syrup, you could also have toast, scones, croissants, fruit, cereal, yogurt etc. The service from all the staff was exceptional, I have stayed in many hotels this to me is more than a 3 star.  We will definitely be staying here again, the location is ideal too. ",5,2019,08,08
232,A little disappointed,"We were so excited returning to Wynns for the 1st time in 25 yrs.! We had been touring all of the west coast then came up the east coast and decided to treat ourselves to a 2 night stay costing £398 for a twin room with en-suite. We had a gorgeous room but at the front of the hotel. The room was so hot we had to have the windows open all night so didnt sleep much with all the noise. The hotel had changed in the 25 yrs, what is now the restaurant area and bar used to be a cozy room with settees to sit on and listen to the locals who came to play live irish music. We deliberately timed our trip to include a weekend stay here just for that reason. Unfortunately, there was no live music and the room seemed void of atmosphere. The staff were all lovely and helpful but Im genuinly sad to say we wont return to Wynns again.",3,2019,08,07
232,3 night stay in Dublin to round off our holiday in Provence,Iconic! Wynn's has that true character that is getting harder to find in Dublin. Beds extremely comfortable and room surprisingly quite despite location just off O'Connell street. Nothing was a problem and food and staff were both excellent.  ,5,2019,08,07
232,Great stay,"We recently stayed in the wonderful Wynn's Hotel, situated in the centre of Dublin, so it is easy to get around Dublin. The welcome you get on arrival is excellent from the lads at the door who park your car if need be, the reception staff are very helpful no problem in checking in. We had a pre Theatre meal excellent value and the food was excellent and served by proper waiting staff, breakfast is wonderful fresh orange juice to an array of continental to a full Irish breakfast and not a buffet server to your table by friendly waiting staff, you only have to do your own toast which is no problem, we will definitely be back.",4,2019,08,04
232,it stays untouched ,"we visited this hotel 20 years ago and now we are back. The hotel has not changed at all / it is crazy traditional.

rooms are small and cozy but they need an upgrade

Staff is very nice and friendly 
Breakfast is good
Location is perfect in the middle of everything ",4,2019,08,03
232,Great location and breakfast!,"Hotel is centrally located and within 5 minutes walk of bus and train station. Breakfast was amazing. Room was clean and quiet with window closed, though a little small. Bathroom had a big shower. Lady working reception seemed overwhelmed and we felt rushed checking in. Key is massive, but can be left with front desk to hold. No air conditioning in room made for a bad nights sleep during the hot summer nights. Tried opening window for cool air, but was very noisy outside. Room needs a fan. All said, we would stay here again. ",4,2019,08,03
232,Little gem ,Fantastic location. Just off O Connell street. Arrived early in the morning so our room wasn’t ready. Very friendly receptionist checked us in and took our bags and off we went for the day. Our room was spotless and the breakfast was lovely.  All the staff are very helpful. Couldn’t fault the place. ,5,2019,08,02
232,Gorgeously quaint ,"Had a one night stay here in a teeny, spotless room with excellent shower. Pillows so soft and bed so comfy. Staff lovely. Whole place is like Downton Abbey but in a really lovely way. Would definitely stay again. Felt safe (was travelling by myself) and slept very well in my quiet little room. ",5,2019,08,01
232,Great location,The hotel is easy to find and right by the spire. The lady on reception was very welcoming and helpful. The rooms are old fashioned but cosy and very clean. Breakfast was lovely and the breakfast staff were very polite and friendly. We hope to return to wynns on our next trip to Dublin.,4,2019,07,31
232,A real find,"I booked 2 rooms last minute direct with the hotel. What a find!! This hotel has everything, Location, Food, Service, great staff and history. The airport bus stops around the corner on O'Connell St(the booth outside the airport had a lovely man who advised us to get a 12 euro return ticket) The Staff in the hotel are superb from the doormen, reception, Bar staff (thank you David for your wonderful service in the late evenings), restaurant everyone .We had the full breakfast included and it really sets you up for the whole day. We also had the sandwiches in the Sts and Scholars bar one evening and they were excellent. We had a fridge in our rooms and ironing board with iron also a safe. The Trams run past the front of the hotel so if you are a light sleeper I would suggest a room at the back but it not really a problem. We would definitely go back.",5,2019,07,22
232,Great Location. Excellent Stay,I stayed in the hotel for one night while attending a concert in the 3 Arena.  It is an excellent location as the Luas to the 3 Arena is right outside the door.  The hotel is only 1 minutes walk from O'Connell street - the centre of Dublin.  The staff are all so friendly.  It is an old world style hotel and in excellent condition.  We had a room overlooking Abbey Street and it was perfect.  The evening meal is excellent and so it the breakfast.  I would highly recommend staying here.,5,2019,07,21
232,"Great hotel, convenient location",The hotel is well maintained and charming. Our room was small but spotless and quiet. The location just off O'Connell couldn't be more convenient for walking to all the sights in town. Breakfast was plentiful.,4,2019,07,20
232,Lovely Hotel,Stayed here for one night as got a good deal through the hotel directly. Room really nice and staff very friendly and efficient. Food in bar also good and breakfast excellent.The hotel itself is spotless. Would stay here again.,4,2019,07,18
232,Perfect Location!,"This hotel is in a perfect location, right in the heart of Dublin and walking distance from everything! Staff were also very helpful especially the porter. Only downside was that the room was quite dated and the bathroom wasn’t great but if I was back Dublin I would stay here again!",4,2019,07,17
232,Great location,"Stayed at Wynns for one night in June. The location was perfect,  so central. Staff were friendly and attentive. Had a drink in the saints & scholars and the barman was chatty & welcoming. I had to leave early so missed full breakfast but a continental was prepared for me. Will definitely return on my next visit to Dublin.",4,2019,07,08
232,most enjoyable stay,"Booked for my parents. Staff excellent really looked after them. Lovely room to the front of the  hotel, modern facilities but still that old style that they loved. Breakfast fantastic and lots to choose from.",4,2019,07,08
232,Bedbugs,"Nice personnel, great breakfast, good location in walking distance from most attractions- bud they do have bedbugs. They gave us another room, but we were already attached, and unfortunately also got some of the bedbugs with us back home. After intensive traveling all over the world for years this is first time to have experienced bedbugs. ",2,2019,07,06
232,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed recently for one night. I loved this hotel, the staff on check in were lovely especially Roberta. Our room was beautiful, very spacious and spotlessly clean. It had everything we needed. Breakfast was complimentary as I booked directly on the hotel website, it was excellent. I found all staff at this hotel were very efficient and competent. The location of Wynn’s hotel is so convenient, city center with the Lucas on its doorstep (literally). I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,07,02
232,Excellent hotel,"We had a 2 night stay at Wynns hotel and I have to say it is one of the best hotels we've stayed in. It was all silver service, all the staff were polite,friendly and very helpful. The food was excellent, the room we were in had obviously been refurbished and we could not find any fault.

I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again.",5,2019,07,02
232,lovely but loud music,"This hotel is charming.  The breakfast was excellent.  It is just like the photos on the site.  However, I paid $300/night and didn't expect the hotel to rent an area for a party with a loud music that started at 9 PM.  The room was a few floors directly below us and the noise traveled through our windows.

There is a doorman who does not help you up the steps with luggage.",4,2019,06,29
232,Great Dublin Hotel in nice location!,"This is an amazing place to stay while you are visiting Dublin. The staff is excellent, the breakfast is absolutely awesome and the location is perfect.Only a 10 minute walk across the river to the Temple Bar district.Much quieter than locations on the south side of river.",5,2019,06,25
232,Charming Hotel in an Excellent Location,"I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.   Brendan was amazing at check in.  We arrived at the hotel at 6:00am.  While he was checking on our room, he brought us into the dining room so we could enjoy coffee/tea and the cold breakfast items that were out.  We were pleasantly surprised to be able to get into a room very quickly for some much needed rest.  The neighborhood and location are great.  It is very close walking distance to Trinity College and many other attractions.  Breakfast was very good.  Cold items such as Croissants, scones, and cereals were served buffet style and there was a menu to order hot items.  Roberta at the front desk was very helpful and Claire was especially helpful - she went above & beyond to help us.",5,2019,06,22
232,vacation," Wonderful. Roberta is such a delight. She catered to my  every need and was always so gracious and kind. I found from front door to housekeeping everyone so helpful. This is a hotel steeped in Irish history.",5,2019,06,20
232,"""A Grand Old Hotel""","Wynn's exudes a grand ambience! From the doorman/porter to the front desk staff, to the early 20th-century decor, the experience is extra special. 
Central location can't be beaten. City Tram(RED LUAS line) and pedestrian malls are literally at your doorstep with central Dublin and the River Liffey a mere block away.
Our room (#537) was very spacious and could accommodate up to (4) guests. Top grade toiletries, large bath sheets, ensuite wardrobe and a king bed were much appreciated. 
Did not use the bar/lounge but nice decor and well occupied.
The included breakfast was delicious and made to order if you desired; speciality coffees available for the asking. The dining room was professionally staffed with particular attention to excellent and attentive service!
Parking is off-site, a slight inconvenience for the self-driving tourist. Also, our room opened to a fire escape with a bright light entering the windows. 'Blackout' blinds would be in order for any similar rooms. 
We thoroughly enjoyed our two-day stay @Wynn's and would recommend this property to everyone as ""a classy gem""!",5,2019,06,18
232,Central location,You can not beat the location in central Dublin. The airport bus lets you out at the corner. The hop on and hop off buses stop at the same place. The red tram is right in front of the door. I got a small upgrade and my room was fairly spacious with a jacuzzi tub. The staff was very helpful. The included breakfast provided a lot of choices. The one down side is that it was pretty noisy very late on Saturday night having a room facing the front. There is a pub also on the ground floor.  Would stay again.  Needs an accessible entrance for luggage!,5,2019,06,16
232,Ideal location in central Dublin,"My wife and I had a  1 nite stay on Thur nite 6 June as we attended the Michael Buble concert...hotel ideally situated in central Dublin minutes from o Connell st, Luas  tram stops outside !
Hotel is charming, and retains the features of a grand old hotel...we stayed in 412  - a spacious room with v comfortable furniture and amazing large bed...v nice modern decor and a lovely ensuite  with awesome shower and really high quality toiletries included, the breakfast was truly delicious in a spacious and airy dining room with very a professional and attentive staff....will definitely return....just 2 small observations....in the room plastic drinking glasses.....not in such a salubrious hotel please!.....also our bill was wrong ...we were undercharged by 20e....but the receptionist took the 20e out of our account without even discussing or consulting us....imagine accessing our account without discussion...a feeble apology offered...not good enough....still overall we thoroughly enjoyed wynns and would recommend it to everyone....",5,2019,06,09
232,Great Hotel with fantastic staff,"A great hotel in a great location in the centre of the city with Luas stop and bus connections directly outside.  I had requested early check in as I was attending a concert and Roberta the receptionist was so helpful and got me a room at 11.30am which I was much grateful for her manner on reception was so friendly but very efficient at her job at the same time, the two male porters on the day and night shift on 08/06/19 we're very helpful also. The breakfast is lovely plenty of options and great and fast service by the staff. I will definitely stay here again when I return to Dublin.",5,2019,06,09
232,"Beware!  ""Obnoxious Attitude"" in review below best describes this hotel!","I made a booking on the hotel website and had to cancel shortly thereafter.  The cancellation was well within the time frame for ""free"" cancellation.  The hotel has charged my credit card any way.  I have repeatedly emailed the hotel and have gotten no satisfaction.  I am now having to use my credit card company to get the money back.  What a hassle!  We travel extensively and have never incurred such poor business manner and practices. I do wish someone would have warned me.  Also, if you do choose to stay at this hotel, please be wary of venturing anywhere to the left (facing hotel) because it is a very sketchy area.  People peeing in the street etc.",1,2019,06,05
232,"Lovely old hotel, great location, noisy if facing street","Wynn's Hotel is a lovely old hotel, with very clean rooms and a fantastic breakfast. We stayed in 6 hotels in Ireland and decided Wynn's had the best breakfast.
We loved the location, an few blocks to Trinity College, shopping, restaurants. The hop-on, hop-off tour busses stop in front, and two Luas (tram) lines are right there, making it easy to get around.
The downside is that our room faced the street and was very, very noisy. We were awoken every night we were there, by tram lines, by drunken people at 3:00am, by trucks. 
I'd stay here again, but only if I can get a room facing the back.",4,2019,06,04
232,Very pleasant 2 night stay.,"We stayed Sunday and Monday nights. Room was quiet,at rear of hotel.shower curtain was inside bath but water flowed onto floor.Handle on toilet flush needs attention. I did leave this feedback at hotel. Will be interesting to see if points are taken on board. Very fine choices at breakfast. Service is professional and staff helpful. We also ate evening meal in hotel. Fresh fish and tasty lamb.Served by very cheerful ,friendly staff. Well done. Great customer -friendly hotel.Centrally located. Doors locked early/ish not sure of time. No problem getting in at night.Would like to return.",4,2019,06,04
232,So love Wynns Hotel,"Just back after our second stay in Wynns Hotel and loved our 2 nights.  Lucky to have stayed in the fabulous James Joyce Suite on the 5th Floor - quiet and very comfortable and spacious.  
Reception staff Concierge and Dining staff throughout very friendly and accommodating.
Great breakfast - Help yourself plus self ordered. 
Centrally situated with Luas tram transport outside front door.
We will definitely be back again.",5,2019,06,01
232,Thoroughly enjoyable stay,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Wynn’s Hotel... staff were friendly, the hotel has lovey charm and curb appeal. Rooms were not exactly spacious, but weren’t small either. Bathroom was a decent size. Breakfast was included and had an option to please everyone. I ate dinner at the car very for two nights and was very happy with the price, quality of the meal and portion size. The location was another big tick - just a short stroll to Temple Bar area, Grafton Street, Trinity College and St Stephen’s Green. Plenty of taxis nearby. I felt perfectly safe on this neighbourhood as a solo female traveller. My room faced onto the street and whilst I could hear some street noise through the day, it was fine at night and no disruption to sleep. I’d highly recommend this hotel if you want a bit of charm and history, without sacrificing comfort. Thank you Wynn’s. ",5,2019,05,30
232,Obnoxious attitude of hotel manager,"My wife and I visited this hotel on numerous occasions, and recently with visitors from Canada. Last Friday 24 May 2019 we went to the carvery restaurant. We were not staying in the hotel. 

After ordering lunch at the counter, my wife decided she could not eat a full portion, so we asked for an empty plate in order to share it. However, the carvery assistant refused to give us one, telling us that as this was against the hotel’s policy we would both have to eat off the one plate! We paid for the meal before sitting at a table.

We spoke to the manager who said he was the hotel owner's son. He re-confirmed it was the policy of the hotel not to serve empty plates, and that the hotel was not in business to provide free lunches. We informed him that we had paid for the lunch, and only wished to share it. He then stood over our table in an overbearing manner, began to raise his voice and point his finger to emphasise his HOTEL'S POLICY. We said we never experienced such a rude attitude as his. His reaction to us was to threaten that he would call the doorman to escort us off the premises. As we were leaving the hotel he followed us all the way out to the front door. 

Overall we had a nasty, unnecessary and embarrassing experience which this ""manager"" created in front of other customers at nearby tables, all because we requested an empty plate to share our lunch!
",1,2019,05,28
232,Great stay ,Arrived to a nice welcome and a surprise of a upgrade on our room. Really clean and spacious room. Great bathroom with lots of toiletries. Had a great nights sleep. Breakfast was great lots of choice. Bit of a wait but not a problem. Reception were friendly and helpful. Looked after our bags while our flight home. Near to the center .We would return. ,5,2019,05,27
232,Historic hotel in great location. Great concierge service. Great place for a drink.,"Breakfast included in our rate. Nice continental style choices plus table service for full Irish breakfast plus other options to choose from menu. Delicious coffee. Rooms are small but expected of a hotel this age. Bathroom was again small but everything worked well and shower fine. No bathtub. The location was perfect.
We arrived early but our room was ready so after a long flight, it was nice to have a place to rest.",4,2019,05,26
232,Do not stay here if you are travelling by motorbike..or car for that matter,"I can’t tell you what it’s like to stay at this hotel as we never made it beyond reception. 

I can tell you that six months ago, whilst planning a five week tour by motorbike around Scotland and Ireland, I contacted the hotel by e-mail to ask if they had secure parking for my motorbike at the hotel. I had read a review in the Daily Telegraph that said that the hotel had ample parking but thought I’d better check to be sure. I specifically stated that I required safe parking for my bike and asked if they could confirm that it was possible to park at the hotel. 

This was their response:

Car parking is available complementary to Guests staying in the Hotel.  As our car park has limited space, we operate on a first come, first serve basis.

On this basis I booked two nights for myself and my wife and one night for my nephew who was flying in from America to join us in Ireland.

Roll forward six months and after a long ride from Belfast we arrive in Dublin and our sat nav takes us into a horrible dark, stinking, graffiti ridden side alley where three people were sat on the floor taking drugs, two others were slumped drinking in a corner whilst another was urinating up the wall. There also appeared to be one man completely comatose lying flat on the floor beside a parked car. He could have been dead for all I know.

Somewhat alarmed at the situation we found ourself in I rode to the end of the alley which worryingly looked like a dead end. Thankfully, it was possible to escape at the other end so we got out of there as quickly as we could. 

Assuming my sat nav was wrong I searched for the hotel on Google maps on my phone and set off again only to be delivered back to exactly the same spot. This time my wife said that she would jump off and go and find the hotel while I went round the block again.

When I returned she was talking to a doorman at the far end of the alley and came to tell me that the car park was actually about half a mile away but that we could unpack the bike there and take our stuff into the hotel.

At this point an elderly lady, who had also just arrived in the alley in her car, asked us if we knew where the hotel was. We repeated what my wife had been told and she said she was there to deliver some wedding cakes to the hotel. I said I’d go and find out what was going on and the lady came with me whilst my wife watched over the bike and her car.

The doorman simply re-iterated that the car park was some way away and that once we’d unpacked the bike and checked in he’d show us where the car park was. Whilst we were talking the lady interjected saying that she had a load of wedding cakes and other stuff to deliver and was told, quite rudely, to wait her turn while he dealt with me. I told him there was no way I was unloading my bike and leaving it in the filthy alley with a load of drug addicts and he just shrugged his shoulders.

As I was getting nowhere with the doormen I went to the front desk and asked where their car park was. The man repeated what the doormen said so I stated that I had been told there was parking at the hotel. He told me that there wasn’t.

I returned to the bike to find yet another elderly couple parked up in the alley wondering where to go. They were left lugging their own bags to the hotel as the doorman clearly had no intention on going into the alley to help them. The other lady was also left to carry her wedding cakes and her luggage into the hotel by herself.

As I would need to get to the bike several times whilst we were there it was completely impractical to park some distance from the hotel so we decided to cancel our booking and find somewhere else.

I went back to the front desk where, by now, there were several heated discussions going on about the unloading and parking situation, and told the man that I wanted to cancel my booking. His immediate response was “well you’ll be charged for it”. I told him that they had better not charge me as I’d made the booking based on misleading and factually incorrect information that they’d given me.

Anyway, we left as there was no way we were staying there. As we got back on the bike a taxi pulled up into the alley and dropped off another guest of the hotel. So, if taxis are dropping guests off there I can only assume that this is indeed the official drop off point for the hotel.

It appears that as the tram runs past the front of the hotel this alley is the only place to park up and unload before leaving you car some distance away in “their” car park.

I later received a cancellation notice confirming that they had indeed charged me for two nights, one for me and one for my nephew. I sent an e-mail asking for my money back and explaining that I did not expect to be charged given that I had specifically asked if there was safe parking and my understanding from their reply was that there was.

I received a reply from the general manager, Neil Loftus, simply stating that they have a 48 hour cancellation policy and therefore we had been charged. I replied, including a copy of my original question and a copy of their response. His reply, this time, said that he could find no mention of “on-site” parking in his colleagues response. No, but it did state that there was complimentary parking for guests in OUR car park. Clearly my fault then for assuming that THEIR car park was actually at THEIR hotel. He has not replied to my e-mail pointing this out. 

At best their response to my specific question was deliberately vague and misleading and I can only assume it is written in this way because if they told the truth no-one would book this place.

So, be warned. If you are travelling by bike do not stay here. Full stop. And if you are travelling by car you will be expected to park amongst a bunch of drug addicts and drunks in a urine stinking, graffiti filled, alley while you unload your own luggage and carry it to the front of the hotel. The doormen clearly won’t enter this alley and, to be honest, I don’t blame them.

In fact, just don’t stay here. They’re attitude stinks, just like their alley.

I was charged €318 for the two nights including breakfast (which clearly we didn’t eat as we didn’t stay) and were left late in the afternoon to find alternative accommodation. Incidentally, we ended up in a 2 bed apartment in a simply amazing and beautiful place called Cliff at Lyons about 20 minutes outside Dublin costing €15 more than it would have cost us to stay at Wynn’s. I can thoroughly recommend this place if you want stunning place to stay in peaceful surroundings and with safe parking not far from Dublin.

Wynn’s on the other hand I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy.",1,2019,05,24
232,"Great location, charming hotel","The hotel was in a great location in the City Centre, has a wonderful pub attached, great team (nothing is a problem) - super friendly! The room was 4 stars - a bit dated, but definitely comfortable beds and was very clean. All in all, when you're busy sightseeing, how much time do you spend in your hotel room? Not much!

Lastly, the breakfast was delicious with great service & coffee. Thanks for a great stay!",4,2019,05,22
232,Fabulous hotel,"Just spent 3 nights at this lovely hotel. It is centrally located with very easy access to O’Connell street and the river. The rooms are large with all the facilities you need, including a tea/coffee facilities. Staff are very friendly and helpful. ",5,2019,05,14
232,Decent Hotel,"Stayed here for an overnight. The hotel was decently priced and in an excellent location. The decor was old fashioned and the staff were friendly enough. The rooms were clean and came with tea and coffee making facilities. 
However, during our stay we were woken up by someone who opened the door to our room. it was probably just room service as they quickly realized we were asleep and left. We opted to use the valet parking services. It was difficult to understand how to use this and when our car was returned to us, it was clear the tyre had been hit off a kerb and had deflated.
All in all, not a bad hotel.",3,2019,05,14
232,A great little find,"We travel regularly to Dublin but this hotel was not on our radar to stay out.... How that has changed, will definitely be back!
Whilst there is an air of antiquity and a bygone era about it the place was spotlessly clean and appeared to have fresh decor and carpets.  Our bedroom on the 4th floor overlooked Abbey Street and I thought it would be noisy but this not the case. It was spacious, more so than some of the more popular chains, and comfortable. I would prefer bigger towels!
Breakfast was excellent with a good choice if hot and cold food and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.

The hotel is conveniently located and is within walking distance from Connolly train station.  It is close to the shopping and entertainment around O'Connell Street and Henry Street and is only 10 minute walk from Grafton Street and the busy Temple Bar area.",4,2019,05,13
232,"Food, glorious food!","Walked past this hotel on my second day, food smelt so good, thought we would try for lunch! Went back 4 days in a row. Great  carvery, staff and reasonable price. This is such a beautiful old fashioned style hotel and if we had known it existed would of stayed here. Selection for lunch was soup, roast meats and the vegetables changed daily. Desserts I could not tell you as there was no way I could fit one into the meal, they main course serve was big even in the smaller portion size serves.",5,2019,05,09
232,Lovely and traditional,"Lovely hotel, lovely staff and the breakfast is delicious. 
The room is comfortable and has air conditioning.
They leave a paper on your door too so when you return after a day of exploring you can come back to a paper with a cup of tea ! 
The shower is great, nice a powerful.

There is one member of staff, who i have made a complaint about to the hotel directly and I'm just waiting i a response.

A gate is locked on the outside of the property at night, after 11pm. After this time you will not be allowed any guests. A night porter will make sure of this. None of this is explained when you check in so just watch out for that one.

Apart from that, it is a very pleasant hotel.",4,2019,05,08
232,First class Hotel ,"We stayed in this wonderful hotel this weekend and it was amazing. Fantastic surroundings and great to see the staff working so professionally, helpful and friendly. It's along time since I saw staff looking proud to be part of the service industry.  Our room was clean and very comfortable. Breakfast great. But what really made the weekend was the staff, couldn't praise them highly enough. Will be back again. Thank you for a great stay. ",5,2019,05,07
232,Charming Hotel,"This was our first visit to Dublin and we wanted to stay in a hotel that was full of  character, charm, and close to the city centre.  We also wanted to be able to enjoy breakfast at our hotel as well.  The Wynn's Hotel met all of these desires and more. The staff are most helpful and friendly!  The breakfast is delicious and includes freshly made hot dishes like pancakes, full Irish breakfast, porridge,  vegetables on toast, to name a few.  There are juices, scones, toast, croissants, various cereals and fresh fruit available as well.  We don't use milk on our cereal or in coffee or tea;  our server provided us with Soy Milk.  The cooked dishes were served to us piping hot, which I love!  

Our hotel room was very comfortable, clean, spacious, with a Queen bed, sofa, desk and chair.  The bathroom is a good size with a full bath/shower combination.  

The 747 Airlink Bus from the Dublin Airport dropped us off on O'Connelly St., a couple of blocks from Abbey St. where Wynn's Hotel is located, so that couldn't have been more convenient.  The Luas (electric tram), busses and the Hop on Hop off Big Bus can be found right on O'Connelly Street within a short distance from Wynn's.  Bus tickets can be bought at the red store right across the street from the hotel.  The Leap card which gives you access to all forms of  transportation over various periods of time can be purchased at the Dublin Bus Ticket office on O'Connelly St.  If you have any questions, the receptionist at the hotel or newspaper kiosk folks are always so helpful.  The way to get around this city is by using all forms of public transportation and walking.  As we were continuing on visiting Ireland, we picked up our rental car at the airport rather than driving in the city--proved to be a wise decision!

We could not have been more pleased with our stay at Wynn's Hotel and would highly recommend this hotel.  Its location near Temple Bar, The Irish Emigration. Museum, Jeanie Johnston Tall Ship and Famine Museum, shopping and restaurants makes it most convenient.
",5,2019,05,05
232,Recommend ,"Very good location right in the middle of the city. Check in was early at 11 which was very useful. Room was OK size with large TV, kettle, safe and iron. Shower very good. Breakfast was well cooked and the service good too. Recommended. ",4,2019,05,05
232,Excellent bar food,Been here a few times recently around lunchtime. The place is busy which is always a good sign. Good food served with a smile at reasonable prices. Varied menu offering a good choice. Convenient to Abbey stop on red line Luas.,5,2019,05,01
232,Great Visit,This was our first visit to Dublin and chose the Wynn's Hotel based upon the reviews and location. The hotel is absolutely lovely and I would highly recommend anyone visiting Dublin to stay at this hotel. The included breakfast is delicious and just what is needed to start your day; the rooms are warm and comfortable; the location is amazing with the laus right outside the door and adjacent to O'Connell Street but the thing that sets this hotel apart is the staff. From the moment we walked in we were treated like family by everyone we met. Thank you to the staff at the Wynn's Hotel!!,5,2019,04,30
232,Perfect hotel with character and friendly staff,We stayed in this hotel as a group on our art tour of Dublin.  The location is excellent and we could easily walk to all the galleries and places of interest.  It is at the bottom of O’Connell street is almost next door to thé Abbey théâtre.  Nowadays so many hotels are the same; you could be anywhere! But Wynn’s had an individual family feel to it and an old fashioned traditional Irish charm.  Nice to see that thé bar was popular amongst locals and not just tourists and the food there was good. The bedrooms were spacious and comfortable but what really set the hôtel apart  was the staff.  They were all so helpful and friendly; nothing was too much trouble.  Everybody in our group enjoyed their stay and I will certainly use Wynn’s again on future tours.  Highly recommended!,5,2019,04,30
232,First visit ,"This was my first visit and stay at this hotel and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised 

The first thing that surprised was how quite the room was considering the proximity to o Connell street at the fact that the luas line runs right by it. I had expected noise and prepared by bringing ear plugs given experience with another central hotel in Dublin but am happy to say no issue.

The service was excellent across the board and the staff very friendly and warm

The room was smaller than I am used to but perfectly fine for what I wanted although given it's size a little expensive but I guess you pay for location. There was a certain charm with the fact you had to use an actual key for the room even if the weight on the end was awquard.

Breakfast was nice also

All in all a great stay will definitely consider coming back

232,"Really nice, old-school hotel with modern fixtures and amenities.","I spent one night at this hotel after a week of B&Bs or Airbnbs, and it was such a pleasure to shower and relax in a ""proper"" hotel. Great lobby with full bar and dining room and our breakfast, which was included, was superb.  I liked it here very much and would be happy to return.",5,2019,04,23
232,Lovely friendly hotel with nothing too much trouble,Room was non smoking which was great although small but the bathroom was great. Rooms tidied brilliantly each day. Staff were so helpful in all matters and system in place tro store cases on the last day which was great and free. Food and the bar was really good value. The breakfast was outstanding. Would recommend and use again.,5,2019,04,21
232,Short stay,"Had booked rooms for myself and family. Excellent service and hospitality throughout the stay. Breakfast was a great success, particularly for the daughter-in-law and grand children, who are used to danish cuisine. Would stay again when the occasion arises.",5,2019,04,20
232,A hotel with a history,"I went to Dublin for training. I initially stayed at another hotel. Since this was my first visit to Dublin, I stayed behind once the training was completed. I then moved to Wynn's Hotel. A lot of people asked me where I was going to stay. When I said Wynn's, I more than once got the answer ""Now, that's a hotel with a history."" Only later did I find out the historical significance of the hotel.
The Wynn is a bit like a time machine. It wasn't too hard to imagine what the hotel must have been like in the old days. Admittedly, the hotel is a bit run down. Still, that's part of the charm. The staff was exceptionally friendly. The breakfast was a memorable experience.
The Wynn may not be the most comfortable hotel in Dublin, but it's part of its history. I enjoyed the stay. If I ever return to Dublin, I will stay there again.",4,2019,04,15
232,chowder,lovely place to go after my visits to the Abbey Theatre.. lots of people of my generation and plenty of younger people also .. The food is very Irish which i like and the chowder is kind of Dublin northside as it even includes fish sticks.. and lovely brown soda bread that you can taste the salt in. very pleasant staff and a reasonable price,5,2019,04,14
232,Beautiful Historic Building,"Great experience and wonderful service. Doorman and front desk always super helpful. Literally everyone was great. The only issue was noise at night, but it’s hard to fault the hotel since it’s in the city center and an old building. ",4,2019,04,12
232,Quaint central cultural hotel real Dublin ,"We came here for a book talk on the Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh, a wonderful evening there was a reception of beverages and drinks after it was so delightful we decided to book in and stay the night, have been here for lunch in the past but to stay overnight was an experience to see the city center on the move by night into the early hours, the breakfast room was the most delightful enchanting quaint place, table service, really this is one of Dublin’s real last standing irish proper places with real quality service. Room was small but spotless and oldie worldly  in a very pleasant manner, all over great place ",5,2019,04,10
232,Wonderful Old World hotel in the heart of Dublin.,"This centrally located hotel in the heart of Dublin, oozes charm and is a short distance from Bord Gais Theatre and a tram ride from the 3Arena. Despite its location on a busy street, the bedrooms are quiet, well appointed, with all home comforts. WiFi coverage is excellent and free. Food and service is excellent. In fact every staff member we encountered was extremely friendly and efficient. We would highly recommend this great value hotel and will certainly return.",5,2019,04,05
232,Great Location!,We enjoyed a night at Wynn's Hotel but the cost was VERY high because of St. Patrick's travelers.  We opted to stay elsewhere when we came back to Dublin.   The room was clean and the staff was pretty amazing.  The gentleman that checked us in was fantastic and helped us map out our week in Ireland with some great advice.  Getting to the hotel was a bit of a challenge since GPS took us in circles.  We finally found our way there and pulled up across the street and gave our keys to them to park the car.  Overall...was a great stay.  I only gave it a 4 instead of 5 because it was a very small room for a very high price.,4,2019,04,01
232,Comfortable stay,"Yes, this hotel is a little old fashioned - not necessarily dated. The room we had was quite small, but adequate - although any smaller dnd we’d have been tripping over suitcases.

The breakfast was very good, as others have said. Staff friendly. Noise wasn’t an issue at all, although we were on the fifth (top) floor. Location is great. Minutes to old Dublin, Trinity College and Temple Bar.

Hard to say on value, not having stayed at any other Dublin hotels, but seemed reasonable given inclusion of quality breakfast. ",4,2019,04,01
232,Grand Hotel In The Heart of Dublin,"We stayed here for one night on a short break. Check in was easy and we were straight into our room. The location is fantastic with a tram stop right outside and you have bars and attractions on your doorstep.

 The room itself was rear facing so not much of a view but we didn't spend much time there! The only negative would be the beds, I found them really hard and the pillows weren't great. For one night it was OK but any longer may be an issue!

The room rate includes breakfast which offers a great selection and they were quick to bring out hot food selections.

Overall- a great city break stop with friendly staff and lots of history!",4,2019,03,21
232,"Room was alright, but terrible racket could be heard from the street all through the night.","Room was alright, but terrible racket could be heard from the street all through the night. Windows were anything but soundproof. Decent breakfast. Water came through the ceiling to our bathroom. Obviously not good. 3/5",3,2019,03,20
232,Weekend visit,"Stayed at this hotel this weekend, although the hotel bar is very grand and has really nice charm about it it, the rooms are very dated. The location is brilliant for Central Dublin and you can walk to most places and the price of the hotel was reasonable for Dublins prices ",3,2019,03,19
232,our Ireland visit,"Absolutely excellent choice! Picked from pricing, location and historical aspect! What a gem!! The reason why we will return next year. Felt like being home when we returned from long days of excursions. Loved the hospitality and help with everything from restaurant choices to transportation needs. ",5,2019,03,14
232,Great hotel in great location,"We stayed in Wynn's last weekend and were impressed from the beginning. The staff were very helpful and friendly, particularly the foreign barman, unfortunately we didn't get his name. It was great to see a manager running the breakfast room with obvious efficiency, something lacking in other hotels. We found the bar food and the breakfast fabulous. The room was compact but very clean. One little gripe is we didn't have enough toiletries for three of us but I'm sure if we asked we would have been looked after.
Overall Wynn's is a hotel I would recommend to anyone. It is in a great location, very central to O'Connell St and the Luas stop is outside the door. I am staying here again in the summer and I look forward to it.",4,2019,03,12
232,Wonderful Wynn's. ,"I was greeted by the friendly and efficient staff at reception and checked into my superior room on the 4th floor. 
My bedroom was warm, clean and comfortable with a window facing the street. I was pleasantly surprised to find a modern bathroom with a jacuzzi which I used on both nights. 
I was greeted on both mornings by the breakfast staff and given a choice of table. The breakfast was delicious! I helped myself to cereal and toast on both mornings while the staff served teas, coffees, juices and full Irish breakfast to my table. The breakfast staff were friendly and most efficient. 
I ate a hearty lunch to the right of the saints and scholars lounge while to the left, other guests were busy enjoying afternoon tea. Once more, the staff at the saints and scholars lounge were friendly, efficient and professional.
I highly recommend Wynn's Hotel at the heart of Dublin city for business or pleasure and I hope to return. 
Kind regards 
Alan D. ",5,2019,03,09
232,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed in Family room. Great size. Quiet room. 
The bar had great energy and staff could not do enough. 
If your looking for a place to stay in Centre of Dublin I’d book here. 
My son fall on the stairs and broke a glass, immediately the staff were very kind to him and checked him out for any injuries.
They have a lovely breakfast too.
Will stay here again!!",5,2019,03,08
232,Weekend Break,First time in Dublin. Happily accommodated early check in. Spotless & well maintained room. Terrific breakfast. Special mention to the night staff who were more than happy to see us taken care of in the dining area before our taxi arrived at 5.00AM. Perfect.,5,2019,03,05
232,Central Dublin Hotel,"Mid week break booked in advance at a reasonable price. Delicious breakfast served by a head waiter who knows the meaning of hospitality. Yes the single bed was a bit narrow for me, but central location and lovely clean room more than made up for that. Also the lady on reception was very helpful when we needed directions.",4,2019,02,26
232,"Quaint , Olde Worlde Hotel","Stayed in Wynns Hotel over the weekend with a friend. We were celebrating a birthday and girl on reception upgraded us to a family room instead of twin. All staff at hotel were excellent at their jobs... helpful and pleasant , providing great customer care.
Hotel is in an excellent central location. Food good especially breakfast. Great selection and variety.  Cooked meals were ordered from table so everything freshly cooked. Beds were very comfortable and bathroom was great also. Both have been recently refurbished.The hotel is quaint and charming with an Olde Worlde feel which we loved. Will be back and definitely would recommend.😊",5,2019,02,25
232,Greet location and ideal for a short stay,"The property is in a great location to get to restaurants and to see the sights of Dublin. The infamous Temple Bar area is 10 mins walk  but everything is accessible by foot. It’s about 25 minutes from the airport which will set you back roughly €22. 

Check in was quick and easy. There is also complimentary WiFi in the rooms which I didn’t find very quick and was quicker to turn 4G back on. 
The hotel has an old fashioned feel it including the room. Our room had one single bed and one double bed. It was a decent size and had everything you need - a small safe, enough hanging space for two, towels, a few toiletries and a small Tv.  The bathroom was small and only had a shower. Again, sufficient for my one night stay but you wouldn’t want to stay more than three nights here. Our room was on the front of the property which was onto the main road where there were trams. The noise from the trams wasn’t great. It wasn’t enough to keep us awake and they do stop at night but there was a noticeable rumble and could hear the bell once they were up and running. 

Breakfast was lovely and food was very tasty. There’s croissants, toast and fruits which you help yourself to but the other food you order so it’s nice and fresh. Would recommend the Full Irish breakfast but the porridge was lovely too. Waiting staff were friendly and attentive.
 
There was a bar area which was popular and could see they served hot meals which looked nice and again were popular but can’t comment on this. 

Staff were helpful in getting us a taxi to the airport.

Overall a pleasant stay for a short stay in Dublin but not a hotel if you’re looking for luxury. ",3,2019,02,19
232,Positive: location,"This hotel is like stepping back a 100 years, so if that's what you like; you're in for a treat. Stayed here a few times. Unfortunately if there is a function on, don't expect to sleep until the early hours of the morning. Fantastic location. Luas right outside!",3,2019,02,17
232,Wonderful hotel,"Wonderful hotel, excellent location just off O’Connell Street. 
We arrived late morning expecting to have to drop our cases and check in later in the day. The receptionist upgraded us to a superior room at no extra charge, and we were able to check in to our room. 
Lovely room, everything we needed. 
Breakfast the next morning was excellent, buffet fruit, cereal, toast, scones, croissants, followed by an excellent choice of menu which we chose full Irish breakfast there was also an excellent choice of other freshly cooked breakfast choices. This was 
served by extremely friendly local waiters/waitresses who couldnt have been more helpful. 
We will definately be back and would highly recommend. ",5,2019,02,12
232,Tears For Fears @ Wynn's Hotel,"For many years I have wanted to stay in this Historical Gem in Dublin City and all I can say is it was everything I thought it would be....Welcoming Homely Friendly and enchanting..The front of house staff were so welcoming and friendly they were extremely helpful..The hotel it self is steeped in Dublin history and you can immerse yourself in the nostalgia of Irish history..The bar and restaurant staff were so helpful and great attention was spent to the perfect customer experience..
On returning from our rendezvous with Tears For Fears we returned to the hotel and met David our Night Bar Assistant..Well what can I say he personally crowned our evening not only was he excellent in his job & polite to customers he turned out to be an avid Tears For Fears fan like myself..During the remainder of our evening we were treated to memories of the concert we had attended earlier thanks to the hotels music system...Yes Tears For Fears played into the small hours of the morning in one of the most Iconic hotels in Dublins fair City..Thank you David for making our evening extra special..It was always my wish to stay here and it was one of the best nights we've had So Well Done To All
we will see you again soon....",5,2019,02,02
232,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here mid week , lovely hotel . Room spotless , comfortable bed . Breakfast top notch ! We will definitely stay here again . The staff are all very pleasant , and helpful. I asked for a lower floor room and again got it without a problem.",5,2019,01,30
232,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Extremely welcoming, great location for all things Dublin. Quaint charming hotel, very clean, fabulous breakfast,  friendly helpful staff across all areas. Definitely recommend and great deal on their own hotel site.",5,2019,01,29
232,A Very Charming Experience,"I often stay in Dublin at one of the larger big name hotels. Due to the large numbers attending conferences I happened to find Wynn's Hotel, excellent location and pricing for a 9 night business stay.
Small, very friendly staff and a time capsule of experience of times gone past. Breakfast excellent and a nice change from the buffet style to individual service.
Sitting in the bar was a chance to capture a wealth of experiences, tourists, locals and those of a more mature age. Simple but good quality and value food.

David, the senior barman was excellent.

Well worth a stay if you are visiting Dublin.",5,2019,01,27
232,"Ideal location , friendky staff & great breakfast","Ideal location for city centre. On the luas line. Friendly staff and great fresh breakfast. I had vegetarian option, it was delicious. Room was clean and comfortable. Ensuite looked to be recently refurbished and was very clean I will be back.",5,2019,01,16
232,Poor menu choices,Great staff they were very helpful and courteous. The menu in my opinion wasn't great and didn't have many choices that I would like. I also thought that the food wasn't great and some of my meal was cold. I personally wouldn't eat here again. It is a convenient location for anyone using the luas.,3,2019,01,06
232,Stop over in Dublin,"This is the second time I have stayed at the Wynn's Hotel it's just off O'Connell street walking distance from the likes of the Temple Bar all worth a visit.
The hotel is a step back to the sixties very well presented at a good cost. If you have a car the concierge will park it for you at a nightly charge food ok but most times I will go out and about.
",5,2019,01,01
232,Wynn's never disappoints.,"At Wynn's, the staff treat you like an old friend. They make every effort to ensure a warm welcome coupled with sheer professionalism. For us, it feels like coming home. When we needed an extra night at the hotel, we were catered for without any fuss or hassle. I highly recommend Wynn's to anybody visiting Dublin at any time of year. A special mention to Claire, Roberta and Niall. Happy New Year to you all.",5,2018,12,30
232,Christmas dinner,"I have Christmas dinner here every year and the food is always excellent.  This year was no exception. My quail starter was so tasty, my turkey and ham top notch, and my ecliair in particular was suberb. I had a lovely bottle of white wine,which like the food, was excellent value. Oh, and the staff were lovely too.",5,2018,12,30
232,Retirement party and stayed iver,"The minute I arrived in to the Hotel I was met by Clare on reception who is a character, very welcoming, cheerful and full of buzz. The room I was allotted was old worldly, spotlessly clean and I had the lunch there from the car very which was very enjoyable.

All staff were very friendly and professional. The residents bar was also very enjoyable.

Next morning breakfast was absolutely gorgeous and helped with curing a mysterious headache I woke up with.

Would recommend to everybody who enjoys an old worldly type of accommodation.
",5,2018,12,16
232,The devil on phone ,Absolutely loved this hotel! It's central to everything and met all my needs 😄 the only problem I had was with the shower. There is a glass door attached to the bath and water ran out from the shower to thr bathroom floor and into my bedroom floor.  It wasn't a huge problem. The receptionist were lovely even though I recked their heads with sooo many questions prior to arrival they were very helpful and cheerful 😄 the concierge was lovely to assist me with a taxi to my work party on a rainy Friday night ! The bed was sooo comfortable and I actually had a good night sleep and woke up to delicious full Irish breakfast served to my room free! Honestly couldn't fault anything.  ,4,2018,12,15
232,Wynn's Wins,"Always A DELIGHT to call in for tea or a drink after shopping and before heading ""down the country"". It is very handy that the LUAS stop is outside the door.
Staff are always pleasant and lovely charming ambience.
",4,2018,12,11
232,A Wonderful hotel ,"A friend and I stayed 8 nights at this hotel and it was lovely! The staff was very helpful and kind and the breakfast was amazing! I loved the shower and again the breakfast was so good! Some people in the reviews complained about noise but it is after all a hotel in a city so noise is expected, though I never had a problem with it and never had trouble falling asleep. The location was perfect for us and was close enough to walk to everything we wanted to do! I had a lovely time in Ireland and this hotel played a big role in that! My only wish is that they offered Netflix on their TVs or more channels, because I could only take so much British reality shows and history documentaries! ",5,2018,12,07
232,Great stay !,"Great hotel.
Very friendly staff. The hotel is located in the center of Dublin with many restaurants, shopping opportunities, pubs, etc around.
The room was very comfortable with enough space. I had a great kingsize bed and I have slept awesome that night.
Breakfast was also very good.
Great stay in Dublin.",5,2018,12,05
232,Wynn's hotel is a treasure in Dublin,"Great location within the city, perfect connection from the airport via the bus 747. The age is part of the charm of the hotel, room was well taken care of with all modern features like USB ports etc, bathroom well refurbished. Breakfast room is a bit small, but with a good timing you will enjoy the good breakfast. Very friendly stuff.",4,2018,11,18

232,"Good Stay, Thoughtful Hotel","Nothing went wrong, and the hotel continued to surprise me with their thoughtfulness. It’s obviously older, which is part of the charm. The included breakfast was incredible and large, with lots of variation in a very nice ballroom. We left up the do not disturb sign, as we were only there for 2 nights and did not want them to come thru. The staff left all new towels and toiletries outside our door with a nice note about missing us and calling for any needs. Very surprised by this effort. Great location as well, easily walkable to everything! We enjoyed our stay!",4,2018,11,12
232,"Hotel amazed so much, we returned as soon as we could!","We stayed in the Wynn's Hotel on our first night in Ireland and it was fantastic. We arrived very early, but the staff were helpful and stored our bags while we traveled around the city. The room that we had was beyond fantastic, with a wonderful jacuzzi tub that comfortably fit two people to relax at the end of a long day exploring. Was a wonderful surprise! The full breakfast was delicious and very classy. Made the whole trip a fantastic deal!

I loved the hotel so much that when we returned to Dublin at another point in our trip, I cancelled our accommodations so that we could stay at Wynn's again. The staff even upgraded us to the suite for the night!!! It was a lovely surprise to stay in such a large, beautiful and historic room. 

Great location, great service, great value, great food, overall AMAZING experience!",5,2018,11,11
232,Wynn's Hotel,"My wife and I stayed at the Wynn's for four nights in November.  The room was clean and neat, the full Irish breakfast was great and the stay was exceptionally warm and courteous.  They were the friendliest hotel staff that I’ve encountered in quite some time.  I’d certainly stay here again.",4,2018,11,11
232,Great place and great service,Very beautiful hotel with traditional decor. Very easy to find. Next to the bus service and tram. 5 mins walk to temple bar area. Jack and Andre were amazing staff. Very helpful. Very clean rooms. Breakfast was really traditional irish. Must stay. ,5,2018,11,11
232,Oasis of Tranquility,"Just yards from the hustle and bustle of a Luas stop, just a short short walk from the capital city's main street is an astonishing Oasis of Tranquility, the quaint Wynns Hotel, a trip back in time in some ways in that it has an old traditional feel and ambience but right up to speed as regards service, be that a cuppa, a pint or a sumptuous meal. Call in an relax, not so much far from the madding crowd as just yards away!",4,2018,11,06
232,One night stay,"Fabulous room very comfortable bed, delicious food, brilliant location very quite for a city hotel staff wonderful we will definitely be staying here again, we asked for a room away from noise, elevators, that's exactly what we got thanks",5,2018,10,30

232,Fantastic,"We held our mothers 90th Birthday meal at Wynnes Hotel in September 2018.   From beginning to end it could not have been better.  The planning was all done by EMail with Mr Loftus the hotel manager.   We were offered an excellent menu.  On the day of the meal we had the restaurant to ourselves and it was laid out beautifully with personalised menus on the tables.   The staff were extremely attentive and helpful.   The food was fabulous and service slick.   To sum up, we had a fabulous evening and would like to thank the hotel for making our mothers birthday so special.",5,2018,10,25
232,Extreme noise if near event room,"Such a shame. Nice facility with friendly staff and very good food. However, I would never, ever stay there again. I have spent hundreds of nights in hotels and have never experienced noise from an event room like this hotel. We got back to the hotel at 10:30 pm to experience unbelievably loud noise from an Elvis imitator  party. Called desk at 11pm and was informed  that noise (horrendous) would continue until 12:30 am. After lying there trying unsuccessfully to sleep, the volume was turned down a bit at 12:30 but continued til 2:30am.
Today we returned at 4pm and found another loud event! It is supposed to be over by 7 pm. We'll see. If I turn up the tv I can't hear the music and the drum and bass vibrations are giving me a nice massage. PS it did end at 7pm",2,2018,10,23
232,Very Traditional Place,"Visited for lunch with some friends who we were meeting up with in Dublin and decided to have lunch in the restaurant.  We were not disappointed. 

They offer a special price 2 or 3 course lunch. The choice was varied and the food and service was very good.

Well worth the lunch.",5,2018,10,20
232,Classic old hotel,"We enjoyed our stayed at the Wynn. Location could not have been better. We took the
Airlink bus to and from the airport which was a two minute walked to the hotel when we arrived and a 8 minute walk for the return bus.  A ten minute walk to Temple Bar, lots of places to eat and shop within walking.  Wonderful breakfast.  Room very pretty and you order from a menu.  Breakfasts made to order, no buffet.  There are selections of bread, fruit, cereal and yogurt available too.  Lightning in the room great.  Only negative comments on toile, you have to wait a few minutes before flushing again.  There is no furniture with draws, just a few small shelves for your clothes.  We had to leave them in suitcases.   However a great value.",4,2018,10,16
232,Great hotel in the city center!,"We stayed here on Friday and Saturday evenings after arriving from US. They did warn us upon check in that there were going to be party/wedding on the second floor both evenings with loud music. We were not bothered at all by the music as I believe it ended at 11 p.m.

The room and bathroom were both very large. We enjoyed the Saints and Scholars bar both evenings - David the bartender is great!

If I get back to Dublin, this is where I'll stay!",5,2018,10,16
232,Noisy hotel,We went to spend a weekend with my wife. We couldn't sleep any night. You must know before you book if there is any celebration cause they have a disco on the 1st floor. Our room was noisy and even the mirrors were vibrating. Couldn't sleep till 2 am. They didn't  give us any solution. The manager pay us some pints but they didn't tell us there was a party before we book (We would have cancelled),3,2018,10,14
232,Wonderful hotel in Dublin Centre,"Outstanding accommodations reasonably priced.  Great location with Luas Tram right in front of hotel.  It is situated at the corner of O’Connell Street (Main Street in Dublin) and Abbey Street.  You are within walking distance of most attractions.  You are also right at the Hop on Hop off bus stop.  The staff is wonderful.  It is an ultra clean hotel, beautifully decorated.  And, if you buy the breakfast package, you will get a great continental breakfast and an outstanding full Irish breakfast served in the beautiful dining room of the hotel.  There is also a quaint bar open until 10:30 pm daily.  Loved my experience there and would definitely go back if I am ever in Dublin again.",5,2018,10,13
232,"Comfortable, great breakfast, wonderful staff","Right near the river, inbetween O'Connell Street and the Abbey Theatre, and by a tram stop.  Lucked out with getting the Executive Suite (we were on a tour, just asked for an upper floor), very comfortable.  Breakfast extensive, table service by great staff, also room service on time.  Nice bar as well.  Would definitely stay there again.",4,2018,10,13
232,Perfect Location,My daughter and I stayed at Wynns for 1 night. Our room was upgraded which was fabulous. The staff were really friendly and the food in the bar was very tasty. The breakfast was really nice with lots of hot options. I can't fault the location it was perfect for a visit to the city centre. Will definitely stay there again,5,2018,10,08
232,Disappointing service,"We booked a couple stay for the weekend back in June for October. This was our special weekend as it was the weekend we got engaged! So ahead of our trip I emailed the hotel to ensure we had a good room (4 months notice for them). I received an email back from Roberta ensuring me all was in hand and ready for my proposal. We arrived at 9am but knowing check in was not until later we were able to leave our bags and go out to explore. Staff were very friendly and hotel seemed lovely. Upon returning we were allocated room 527 and could check in. We did get asked for payment which was odd because we had already paid in June. We were told the room was a Superior Double and went to find it. As we opened the door the room looked lovely, except there were someone else's thing in there and luggage. Immediately we went back to reception where they apologised and explained that that was our room but due to it being ""first come, first served"" our room had been swapped to 530. On receiving the paperwork I was shown 527 was tippexed out and 530 had been written over the top. We took the keys to the room and found a very small double room with no view, cracked bathroom tiles on the floor and walls and the bed linen was stained. What a difference in the two rooms and for the same price. We paid £170.00 a night and the room we were allocated was not worth that charge nor was it a room for a celebratory engagement weekend. I went back to reception to explain the room was not suitable and to show us what we could of had then produce this room was not acceptable. I wanted to know why the rooms had been swapped, I'm guessing the couple were originally allocated 530 and refused it so were moved to our room 527. None of the staff could explain to me why our Superior Double had been swapped for potentially the worst room they had especially when I had requested a nice room due to the occasion and had had confirmation back that ""All was in hand"" from the hotel. The room was no higher star rating than a 2* Bed and Breakfast. The staff checked but they had no other rooms available, we were not even offered a drink in the bar as a form of apology for the mix up, the embarrassment of walking into someone else's room or the lack of interest in why we were in Dublin, I am very disappointed. 

The location however is central and was perfect for us as we wanted to walk and see everything.

The breakfast is phenomenal and the staff are extremely friendly in the restaurant.",3,2018,10,08
232,Nice hotel,"We stayed at Wynn’s Hotel for three nights while in Dublin.

The hotel itself is steeped in history, it’s a lovely old building.  The canopy at the front of the hotel very eye catching, especially at night when it is lit up.

Our room was nice, compact yet comfortable.  It was nice being up on the fifth floor as we weren’t bothered with noise from the street or from the Luas.  The only thing I would comment on is no bottled water in the rooms (which now, it should be pretty standard to have water in rooms) and the shower cabinet being a bit on the small side (although I appreciate nothing could be done about this what with the room layout, size, etc...)

Pleasant staff, who were polite and professional.  Breakfast was tasty, food portions and service was good.",4,2018,10,05
232,Fantastic stay in Dublin.,"This grand hotel, established in 1845, was our home for our 3 day visit to Dublin. The current building was built in 1926 after the original building burnt down during the 1916 uprising. What a wonderful place! It is conveniently located in Abbey Road, just off O’Connell street, and you really can walk anywhere or catch any mode of public transport. The hotel is beautifully maintained and the elevator and bathrooms are modern. All the staff members are extremely friendly and will go out of their way to help you. Notably, all their sauces and soups are gluten free and they have a dedicated toaster for their gluten free bread at breakfast. I have never found this at any other hotel - an absolute winner for me! We popped back into the hotel at lunchtime for a breather and noticed that the restaurant was filled to capacity- clearly their lunch menu is extremely popular too. We would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Dublin.",5,2018,10,04
232,Great food,"I must qualify this review by stating that I’ve never stayed here. However as a native Dubliner I eat here very regularly. At lunchtime there’s two options - carvery in the bar / lounge and a full waiter service à la carte in the restaurant (which I really like).

Great, solid Irish food, beautifully prepared and served in very comfortable and clean surroundings. What’s not to love?",5,2018,10,03
232,Cranky receptionist,"The check in desk says a lot about a hotel, a pleasant check in sets you up in a good mood about where you are staying. We had a very poor check in experience. The woman was on her own and looked extremely stressed to be on her own and was taking it out on the guests checking in and all the customers that rang. As we were checking in she said to us if the phone rings once more you can come behind here and get your owns keys",2,2018,09,30
232,Wynn's Hotel wins!,"Stayed here in 2008. Lovely room,staff and food. Now call every time I am in Dublin for lunch or drinks. Consistently excellent value for money lunch and pleasant staff. The owner kindly supplied me with history of the hotel when I was researching 1916 in 2016. These people understand hospitality unlike some of the other people in the same business who charge too much for an unacceptable service. Thanks Wynn's!",5,2018,09,26
232,Great experience,"Myself and my husband stayed here on the 24th Sep for a concert in the 3 Arena. It was ideal as the Luas is just outside the door and goes directly to the venue. The hotel itself is quiet old fashioned but I really liked that. We got upgraded to a suite which was very spacious. The staff were all very friendly and helpful (a special mention to the receptionist from yesterday). Breakfast was also included and was lovely. Overall great location, value for money and excellent customer service.",4,2018,09,25
232,"An elegant, convenient and comfortable place to stay in Dublin","A beautifully maintained Victorian era hotel in a superb location that preserves the atmosphere and furnishings of the time with all the modern amenities.  Reception staff (and all staff) was welcoming, professional,  and very helpful, especially a young lady named Claire.  We stayed for two nights on our arrival and for two nights before departing Ireland.  Due to my error in booking directly with Wynns, I failed to book the the first of two nights on return trip, but Claire worked with us and arranged a room until we could move into our original reservation (a considerable upgrade).  She also arranged an early morning taxi to the airport on our departure day.  Her cheerful and professional service really made our stay at Wynns special. Rooms and bathrooms are compact, consistent with European standards, but clean and comfortable with limited flat space, but ample electrical outlets, safes, coffee/tea making equipment, small refrigerators and good Wifi.  Limited TV channel selection (no CNN), but Irish news and Sky news kept us informed.  Rooms facing Abbey street get some noise.  We didn't eat in the bar, but our dinner in the restaurant on the final night was ample, quite good and reasonably priced.  Overall, between location, service and comfort Wynns provided us a delightful stay in Dublin.",5,2018,09,24
232,"Quaint, historic, authentic","Loved our stay at the Wynns. The location in Dublin was safe, right on the luaus line, within walking distance of many main attractions, the hop on hop off bus was right across the street, SPAR (convenience store/fancy coffees/mocha/cappuccino/salads/sandwiches freshly made), restaurants, etc. 

The staff were attentive and lovely to chat with. We really enjoyed the Scholars bar. Desk staff were fabulous as well as the door staff. They do lock up at night but there’s a doorbell to ring and they quickly open the door. 

Rooms were quaint, older flavor/retro decor. Well maintained. 

The food was edible but We’d recommend eating elsewhere. This was the only thing We did not like at the Wynns.",5,2018,09,24
232,"Old, tatty and dull","Old, tatty and unsophisticated....and that's just the clientele. The hotel itself is well passed it's prime. One single lift serves all four floors. It's so old it needs a Zimmer frame just for itself. The rooms are basic, and haven't seen a stylist or interior decorator since the late 1980's.

If you still insist on staying, then ask for a room at the rear, as those facing the street will mean you won't sleep until the tram stops well after midnight, and you'll be woken up at 5:30am when it starts back up again.",2,2018,09,24
232,Nice facade- tired rooms,Claire was very pleasant and helpful- upgraded us to a better room. the room was very basic and required updates so would be worried what the regular room looked like. Good location but had trouble with parking,3,2018,09,23
232,Great location and breakfast but poor wifi connection,"We stayed at this hotel for one night. I would rate this good as opposed to average but the trip advisor rating goes from average to very good. The best feature of the hotel is their location. You can easily walk to areas such as Temple Bar, Trinity College and Grafton. There are restaurants, cafés all around. That being said, it can get noisy at night and early in the morning. Subsequently, I would suggest getting a room that faces away from the main streets. Since it was our last day in Dublin, we tried to check-in for our flights as well places to visit before we departed. But, the wifi was really poor that day/night. We eventually had to go elsewhere to eat and use their wifi connection as my friend had been booted a few times while attempting to check-in for our flight. The wifi would work for a few minutes and became weak or stop altogether the next. Apart from the issues with noise and poor wifi connection, the hotel was good. Their breakfast was great.",3,2018,09,17
232,Wonderful hotel,"Close to temple bar and train, this central location is hidden down a street, which makes it quiet for sleeping. Wonderful mattress, linens and very clean. Water pressure in shower very good! Good restaurant and breakfast too
",5,2018,09,12
232,Short break for visiting Ireland & the Isle of Man,"Excellent location in Central Dublin. Good for sightseeing on foot plus having a tram stop outside helps. Friendly staff on the reception, restaurant when having breakfast and bar staff as well. Room was clean and comfortable. Will return",4,2018,09,11
232,Claire makes Wynns Hotel excellent vrsus very good,"This is a fantastic hotel, close to the city center, with public transit right outside the door.  The staff go out of their way to make your stay perfect.  We had to check out at 6:30 a.m. to catch an early flight and even though the restaurant did not open until 7:30 they made a continental breakfast available to us.  Claire, who works evenings at the front desk, is quite easily the nicest person we met during our two week stay in Ireland.  She is so efficient, outgoing and helpful.",5,2018,09,09
232,Our 3 nights at this lovely hotel,"This is such a lovely hotel and in a great location to see Dublin City.  All the staff are welcoming, very professional and made us feel like valued customers.  The Head Waiter in the restaurant is just second to none giving excellent service and very good food.
This would be my first choice when we go back to Dublin.",5,2018,09,06
232,Great find for lunch,"Carvery in Wynns proved to be a great find.  Roast Turkey & Lamb were specials.
A good variety of other dishes on offer, but I decided on the Lamb.  It was great!
Large portion, served with carrots, cabbage, mash & roast potatoes. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Will be back.",5,2018,09,05
232,Old fashioned irish hotel bar food Carvery.,We just ate and drank at the bar lounge. Everyone was helpful with the carvery and food was of good quality with a fish option.  This place has an old fashioned feel to it and plenty of seating. TV in the lounge area. And decent pint of Guinness of course...on O'CONNEL St so near the GPO museum. ,5,2018,08,30
232,"A+ location, cleanliness & service","Stayed for one night early August with my 17-yr-old son before heading west to Limerick. Had just landed from New York, but room wasn’t yet ready. They held our bags while we toured the city. Came back at 3pm, and crashed for a few hours. Woke at 7pm, and walked around again for dinner & to explore Temple Bar area. So much to see and do within walking distance of hotel. Clean room (though small), comfortable beds, and large, updated bathroom. 4th floor in front, but street noise was comforting (we are from NY after all), window opens a few inches. Very good breakfast included. Again they held our bags while we rented bicycles, then we hopped the tram (directly in front) to bus station.  Was unsure about leaving our key at the desk while we went to dinner, but it was fine. 
Highly recommend Wynn’s. Great location. Clean. Friendly staff. ",5,2018,08,30
232,Charming Dublin City Centre,"Excellent choice for location.  Friendly and competent staff. Spotless rooms . Great breakfast which was included in my rate , served in a lovely setting. 
My only critical advice: avoid rooms on lower floors to the back !!!",5,2018,08,29
232,Great location/staff/service,"Great location/staff/service, stayed during papal visit so cost of room was high but can’t rate the staff highly enough.

Rooms are somewhat dated, but very comfortable

Very clean also. Check in time was from 3pm but I was very kindly checked in on my arrival at approx 11:30am",4,2018,08,28
232,Dublin trip,"Lovely old style hotel with a touch of class.arrived at 11am n wanted to leave case at reception only to be told our room was ready.checked in n found fruit basket n bottles of water in room,towels made up like swans n rose petals on bed.dont know if this is the usual as it was our anniversary treat but just showed great attention to detail.just beside abbey street luas stop n 20yards from o connell street so great location.cant wait for next trip.10 out of 10",5,2018,08,27
232,Lovely Hotel,"Only stayed for one night on our Wicked theatre trip but great, friendly hotel. Staff are warm, welcoming and helpful. Lovely breakfast, comfortable room and central location. Would definitely recommend and would stay here again!",5,2018,08,22
232,breakfast at Wynns,"My husband and i stayed in Wyns hotel last week  last week for one evening . It was our second time staying there. Its is a beautiful hotel , room was excellent , staff courteous and helpful, Dinner in the bar on the day we arrived excellent. But we were very disappointed at the breakfast. The bacon and sausages were good quality and tasted nice. But the breakfast was very greasy and was cold. We didnt receive any white pudding with our breakfast and I ordered a poached egg  and it was broke on the plate. It was not what I was expecting and ruined what was otherwise a pleasant stay.",3,2018,08,20
232,Quickly went from 4 stars to 2 stars ,"I was all ready to give a 4 star or higher review on this hotel.  Great central location. Located that a traveler can easily walk or catch public transportation around Dublin. The woman working at the front desk was very kind and helpful. The breakfast was great offering hot food options along with a great assortment of continental breakfast items.  However when checking in we were informed that there would be a wedding the next night lasting until 1 am.  We could somewhat hear the music from the floor below.  It was not loud and was muffled through the walls.  This was not a problem.  The problem came when our room was sandwiched between the wedding guests rooms. Little kids were running in the halls slamming the doors.  We just assumed it would calm down shortly after 1am. However it intensified. The adults from the wedding participated in door slamming and instead of keeping their celebration to their rooms,  they stood right outside our room partying until 5:30am! When we brought this to the attention of the hotel staff,  nothing was done.  We just wanted the wedding guest to continue their celebration in their rooms.  We had a long drive ahead of us that day and received very little sleep.  I was greatly disappointed in the customer service of the hotel.  I will not recommend this hotel to any traveler. ",2,2018,08,14
232,Excellent Hotel,"Our stay a Wynns Hotel was very very pleasant. The staff are friendly, room was lovely and very clean. Beds comfortable. We had dinner in the bar the evening we arrived and it was beautiful. The dining room where we had breakfast was a beautiful bright room and beautifully decorated. The waitress extremely friendly and helpful. They had gluten free cereal and bread which was an added bonus for me. The very nice Porter parked our car and the next morning he took our cases to our car and left the ticket in the hotel as we were taking a hop on hop off bus tour around beautiful and historical Dublin City. Hotel is just a step away from O'Connell Street which is  street of Dublin City. Also the GPO and Trinity College are just a stroll away",5,2018,08,09
232,Always Been A Good Spot,"I used to visit Wynns regularly for food and drink when I lived in Dublin and always had an enjoyable afternoon or evening there.
I had reason to return recently for the first time in years. It's been extensively renovated which is I suppose welcome but its still retained its age old charm.
Good food, good service and nice ambiabce. 
Just a few steps from O'Connell Street and just 5 or 6 minutes walk from Connolly Rail Station and the central bus hub Busaras.",4,2018,08,06
232,A jewel in the centre of Dublin,"We brought a group of 26 people from the U.S. to see theatre in Dublin, and stayed in Wynn's because it is centrally located and within walking distance of great theatre, restaurants, museums, and historic sites. It is one of the oldest hotels in Dublin, and maintains its character while offering modern amenities. The staff is extremely friendly and personable, and all needs and requests were met in a timely manner. The rooms are comfortable and the breakfast is excellent. We will continue to return to Wynn’s in the coming years.",5,2018,08,04
232,Loved this place,"What a great place to stay (in contrast to our disastrous experience in Galway already reviewed).   Smiling and friendly reception staff, lovely rooms, great location, fantastic breakfast.  The list goes on.   Special mention to Robbie who parked our car.   When you stay at Wynns they will park your car as it is very difficult to stop near the hotel since the tram runs right outside of it.   So you park in the loading zone, run in and see them, and they come right out and help you with your luggage and then take your car off and park it.   Great service in traffic crazy Dublin.   Everything about our stay here was just lovely and we would definitely return.",5,2018,08,03
232,Friendliest Dublin Hotel with an Amazing breakfast,"I contacted several Dublin Hotels before our stay... Wynn's was incredibly responsive, they obviously wanted our business. We arrived at 9AM after an overnight flight from Japan via Hong Kong, with our five year old, expecting to leave our bags for an afternoon check in.  The staff immediately recognized us from our email exchanges and offered us a room (no extra charges) and allowed us to shower and and take a well needed nap.  The hotel is old, with lots of charm, but realize the views from the rooms are not romantic (old Dublin was gritty), but the space was immaculate, the pub pleasant and comfortable for an afternoon drink.  The star is the breakfast - and depending on who's working and how crowded they are - the service can be solid to fantastic (with little extra bonuses). We spent an hour and a half leisurely eating the huge breakfasts and sipping pots of tea, and didn't need to eat again until dinner. 
Lots of little touches that the Gresham (our other hotel) didn't have, friendly staff who knew us from day one, and would have chats with our daughter, the 1 kg brass room key, large room fridge, updated bathroom, and very close to Temple Bar and the airport bus.",5,2018,08,03
232,Lovely hotel in a fabulous location.,"What a lovely hotel. A brilliant location, just off O'Connell street, tremendous value with a fantastic breakfast included.
Although the hotel has all the modern facilities one would expect, it still retains an old world charm that sets it apart.",5,2018,07,31
232,Perfect location; very good service,"We have stayed at the Wynn’s hotel three times over the last years, and would go there again if we go back to Dublin. We always got two rooms close together on the same floor (I travel with my parents and my mother is in a wheelchair), and service is excellent. They even lend you adaptors for the very unique Irish plugs free of charge. Breakfast is wonderful, with a full menu of cooked breakfast to choose from, in a spacious and luminous room. The noise from the street is not a problem, even with an open window at night, if you have a room facing Lower Abbey street. The location is awesome, just along O’Connell street and just above the Liffey, very close to Temple bar without the agitation.",5,2018,07,27
232,Perfect for exploring the city,"Very central location. Easy to walk to the most important places you want to see. Old style, classy hotel. The staff is very nice, friendly and helpful. Excellent breakfast. Good choice for leisure and business.",4,2018,07,27
232,Weekend Break - The Best Hotel in Dublin,"My mother and I stay in the Wynns hotel every July for two nights, when we head to Dublin for our usual shopping spree. What can I say, the hotel is in a fantastic location, excellent staff and has a great breakfast. On arrival, we were greeted by a young fella, not sure of his name but he was extremely pleasant. Then we dealt with Claire who is a delight to speak to, so friendly and helpful and always greets you with a smile. Normally we would see Roberta working at the hotel who is fantastic at her job, but I’m not sure as to why she wasn’t there - but the staff here are fantastic. Arriving to our room, it was beautifully finished. Yes, there is a bit of a noise problem when trying to sleep at night, but it’s a busy city so I would not fault the hotel for this. The breakfast was fantastic, so much to choose from and the staff working during the breakfast were lovely. Overall I would highly recommended this hotel with its fantastic location, we stepped straight of the Luas and it’s just a few steps away. Mum and I can’t wait to come back next year for another stay. ",5,2018,07,24
232,Good price and central ,"I stayed here for one night on business. I usually stay in the Hilton, but prices were unusually high the week I went so I plumed for the Wynns.
It was a pleasant surprise. The location was great as it’s right in the centre of the city. The receptionist was very friendly and professional. The room was clean and breakfast was excellent. 
Only one downside my room was overlooking the street and at times it was quite noisy.
Overall a good value hotel. ",4,2018,07,21
232,Working Boots,"I booked my husband into this historic hotel for one night recently and he was happy enough with his room.The trouble began once he came back after having paid upfront 169euro rate.After walking around the city for a bit,at around 7.30pm he's a serious walker,he was stopped at the door and told he wasn't allowed in. He explained he was a guest staying at the hotel and yet there was a problem,He was mortified and extremely upset at the situation as there were people coming and going  all around him.Once it was established that yes indeed he was a paying (Paid) guest at the hotel 
  they said fine off you go.He asked why they had refused him entry in the first place and he was told it was because he was wearing working boots,They were not working boots but extremely expensive walking boots.This is Wynn's hotel which has a huge history in relation to Irish History and Socialism and Jim Larkin's Statue is a mere few steps away of which they proudly promote. My Husband was so upset he did not go down to breakfast in the morning ,rather he rang me and told me what had occurred.I was furious and rang the hotel.I asked to speak to the manager no joy I asked to speak to the Guest relations mangers no joy,I was as I say furious and now becoming increasingly frustrated. Many hours later I spoke to the manager and explained to him what my husband had endured.He apologized met my husband offered him food etc,But the damage was done.We will never ever stay in this hotel again .Stopped for wearing working boots??Jim Larkin ,James Connolly et al would be swirling.......et al",2,2018,07,19
232,"Great location, very helpful staff, great breakfast!","It's an easy walk to pretty much everything in the inner city. If you need to get to destinations that are a bit further away (Botanic Gardens, RDS, etc.), there are many bus stops within a block or two of the hotel, and the east-west tram stops right outside the front door. The front desk staff (Claire in particular) are very friendly and helpful for everything inside (a fan for the room, luggage storage) or outside (dinner recommendations, public transit) the hotel. The breakfast selection (included!) is great, there's a buffet with fresh baked goods, fruit, cereal, yogurt, cold cuts, cheese etc. and à la carte service for a full Irish breakfast, pancakes, eggs Benedict, omelettes and the like - all very tasty. A very nice hotel, definitely would go back! The room and bathroom were small, but beautifully furnished and impeccably clean. There was no air conditioning in the room, but this is Ireland after all and not Florida.",5,2018,07,19
232,Traveling with family,"I stayed at wynns back in June and the hotel was prime location for anyone that wanted to stay right in the heart of Dublin, everything is at your door step and in walking distance which is a bonus in the busy streets of Dublin.The staff in the wynns could not have been more accommodating from the moment we arrived though out our whole stay. The rooms in the hotel are spacious and beds are super comfy and the food is great, the hotel is a modern hotel with a very homely feel I would definitely recommend this hotel, il be back 😁",5,2018,07,19
232,Great hotel in Dublin,"The staff are so welcoming here, and made us feel right at home.  From the receptionist, to the porter, to the wait staff at breakfast, they were all great!  

Our room was clean and spacious, with lots of fresh air.  We were within walking distance of just about everything we wanted to see, so it was in a very convenient location.  We weren’t sure what to do about parking, but once we figured it out, Robbie helped us with our vehicle (thanks Robbie!). 

The breakfast was wonderful, very delicious and filling. Great coffee too. ",5,2018,07,16
232,Gem of a period hotel.,"Having read a lot of the reviews, good and bad and a recommendation from a family member we opted for Wynns due to the location. What a great find. We arrived very early but reception was quite happy to hold our luggage allowing us to head off into town. (They also held on to it until 5pm after we had checked out the next day) Room was small but charming. It was spotless and looked like it had recently been redecorated. No aircon and a great run of hot weather meant it was warm, so we had left a window open. There was a bit of noise, as expected in the city centre, and the seagulls can be quite vocal, but nothing that stopped us from sleeping. Probably wouldn’t have noticed if we’d closed the double glazed window. We were there mid week so might it be worse at weekend. Staff were genuinely friendly and really helpful. Breakfast cooked to order and delicious. Location would be hard to beat. To sum up, it’s not a modern hotel, but it has a charm and a friendly team that make it a unique place to stay. We’ll be back I’m sure.",4,2018,07,14
232,What an amazing hotel experience,"If you're staying in Dublin, stay here!  Stayed here for the first time last week.  I have to say, the whole experience was fantastic.  It's a lovely period hotel which retains tons of its period charm.  Its incredibly central.  The staff though ....  they have to be the friendliest most helpful staff I have ever experienced in a hotel.  We were greeted with the most warm welcome from the lovely lady at reception and it continued on that note.  I asked for a fan and it literally arrived 40 seconds after I put the phone down.  Everyone was amazing.  I'll definitely be back",5,2018,07,12
232,Great Base for Your Stay in Dublin,"The outstanding feature of this hotel is it's location, right in the middle of the CBD, just off O'Connell Street. It is within walking distance of most places you would want to visit & Dublin is a city made for walking.
There are scores of pubs & restaurants in close proximity and Temple Bar is just across the river, again, close to the hotel.
We arrived early, but could not get our room until 2.00pm (they have a late check out of 12 midday) & from the amount of luggage left for safe keeping, we were not the only ones who had arrived early. Don't fret, there is plenty to do whilst waiting for your room. Catch one of the Hop on, Hop Off buses and go for a tour. Bus stops are just around the corner in O'Connell St. 
When we returned to the hotel our room was ready. The room itself was very nicely furnished,  eye clean, air conditioned, separate bathroom, tea & coffee making facilities, flat screen TV, free WiFi, but the room was itself was quite small. Not a lot of space when you bring your luggage in. Importantly, the hotel has a lift/elevator.
We stayed on a Sunday night when the main restaurant is closed. However, there is a very nice bar where, in addition to drinks, meals can be obtained at reasonable prices. (We elected to visit one of the local restaurants instead, which was excellent).
A cooked a-la-carte breakfast is included in the room tariff, which was OK (average).
Overall we enjoyed our stay at Wynn's and recommend it as a very good place to stay in Dublin.
",4,2018,07,11
232,"Loved, loved, loved this hotel","Spent two nights at this property recently.  Loved the old style and exceptional service at this property. Roberta at the front desk was so kind and helpful each and ever time we stopped at the front desk. Full cooked to order breakfast each morning was delicious. We knew up front this hotel did not have AC but it was not a problem for us. Roberta offered to send up a fan and ear plugs but it was not necessary. The hotel is in a great, central location. I'll be recommending this hotel to others traveling to Dublin. ",5,2018,07,09
232,Perfect,"My Mum and I only stayed a night, but we'll definitely be back as we can't fault it.

The hotel is lovely, but doesn't make you feel you aren't posh enough to be there or anything :) 
In a perfect location too - just a few minutes walk to many things (shops, Olympia theatre, museum's and the stations).

The gentleman at reception had us checked in quickly and gave us all relevant information (which is also found in their booklet thing in the room anyway); check-out was also quick and easy.
We didn't have specific questions or anything for any staff, but anyone we saw were friendly and helpful.

Our room was a great size (we had a double bed and two singles!), with a good sized, clean bathroom and we had plenty of tea, shampoo, towels, etc.  
A good wardrobe too (a mini fridge and safe inside as well), bedside cabinets, and a bookcase type thing too.
A fan above the double bed was much needed and appreciated! :)  A bit noisy though, so some might dislike that.
(The only possible negatives were that when we arrived there was a loudish party or something going on, but it was thankfully all over by the time we came back for the night anyway (around 10.30pm).
There was also no view out our window, but we're never ones to complain about that as the room is only for sleeping and freshening up :) )

A good breakfast (honestly - best scrambled eggs I've had!!) available in a lovely room with staff who were attentive but not hovering over you.

We hope to be back in Dublin for a few more days relatively soon, and we'll definitely be staying here again.",5,2018,07,09
232,Wonderful vacation stay,"We stayed here for three days before starting a British Isles cruise.  It was the perfect location for us.  The location was just feet from O'Connell Street, the main thoroughfare.  It is a block from the GPO, where the 1916 Easter Rising began.  It is well within walking distance of Trinity College, and many excellent dining and drinking establishments.  The breakfasts were substantial and varied, and the service was attentive.  The lounge staff was good, but a bit understaffed.  The room was comfortable, though the temperature control was a minor issue.  The bathroom was modern despite the fact that the hotel opened for business in 1845.  All in all, a great place to start our vacation.  We will return.",5,2018,07,09
232,Will definitely be returning to the wynns ,We stayed at the wynns for 3 nights in June and it was a fantastic place to stay. The location in the city is perfect located right in the city center of Dublin. The room we stayed in was spacious clean and quiet and even had AC during some warmer weather. The breakfast was great and the staff and the bar was great as well. We will definitely be returning on future trips! ,5,2018,07,05
232,Romantic trip to Ireland ,"We started our trip around lovely Ireland in this old but elegant hotel. The staff were so very pleasant.
There were two very loud parties going on that the hotel was catering. Our room was right above them both. We were told if it was too loud for us they would try to change our room. 
The hotel was completely booked out. Fortunately they had a smaller room on the 4th floor which we could change to. 
We arrived late so so the restaurant had stopped serving, however they were so kind in the bar and served us lovely sandwiches. Breakfast was very nice and served in a beautiful room. 
Would definitely return to this hotel, however would make sure that they are not catering to any parties!
",4,2018,07,01
232,Will definitely be back!,I stayed at Wynns Hotel a couple of weeks ago and I could not fault it. It has a superb location in the heart of the city. The rooms are immaculate and spacious and breakfast was fab. The staff couldn’t do enough to help and I loved how despite the fact that the hotel has been modernised it still has a lot of its original features! I will definitely be returning!,5,2018,06,27
232,Second stay just as delightful as the first!,"Our first thought upon returning to Wynn’s was gratitude that a hotel like this exists and thrives, surrounded by cookie-cutter, modernistic lodgings which make no effort to celebrate their architecture or their history.  We first discovered Wynn’s Hotel in September of 2016 (see review from that date), and when the opportunity arose to return to Dublin, we knew exactly where we would be staying.  It remains a stately building with impeccable service, gracious staff, and a location perfect for exploring the city on foot.  We took advantage of the frequent LUAS tram which stops directly in front of the hotel and enabled us to travel quickly and inexpensively to both Connolly and Heuston stations for the train journeys we made.  We also loved having the Airlink 747 bus stopping right around the corner on O’Connell Street for our transfers to and from the airport.

In our online reservation made months before our arrival, we made a special request for a room located away from the ambient noise of Abbey Street, and our request was honored.  We received room 416, which overlooked the back of the hotel and was quiet at all hours.  The room was spacious, as was the beautifully tiled bathroom, and there was a closet which contained a tea-making tray as well as plenty of space to store our luggage and hang up clothes.  The lovely wallpaper, the framed prints of 19th-century Dublin, and the fireplace (decorative now, not functional) gave the room a cozy and serene ambiance.  Both the bedroom and the bathroom had large windows which we opened to allow fresh air to come in.  We had also requested a walk-in shower rather than a tub, and the staff honored this request as well.  The hotel's wifi has greatly improved.  Two years ago, we could connect only while sitting in the lobby, but during this stay, the wifi signal in our guest room was excellent and dependable.

The Wynn’s breakfast is a stylish affair.  Guests can order a hot cooked-to-order breakfast (the full Irish is outstanding) and also choose items from a cold buffet of pastries, cereals, juices, yogurts, fresh fruit, and Irish ham and cheeses.  The scones on this cold buffet are wonderful.  The breakfast room is another of Wynn’s architectural preservations, with beautiful mouldings, chandeliers, mirrors, leaded glass, deep carpet, comfortable upholstered chairs, and a great view onto Abbey Street.  The breakfast staff are friendly, attentive, and efficient.

We loved room 416 so much that we asked if we could have it again when we returned to Dublin three weeks later, on the day before our flight home to the USA.  Once again, the Wynn’s staff came through for us, and we enjoyed 416 for one more night.

On that last night, as we were reading and settling in prior to bedtime, we heard a loud disturbance coming from the alley below.  We couldn’t see down that far, but we assumed that it was a brief argument among a group of loud, possibly drunken men, and we ignored it for a while.  When it continued for more than 30 minutes, and close to our bedtime, we went downstairs to the reception to report the noise, fearing that we would not get a decent night’s sleep.  Claire was at the reception and sent a staff member to the back of the hotel to investigate.  When she learned that the problem would not go away on its own, she phoned the Garda, who arrived quickly and resolved the issue within minutes.  The noise ceased, and we did indeed have a peaceful night’s sleep.  Well done, Claire!

As was the case in our first stay at Wynn’s two years ago, we had to check out of the hotel very early in order to arrive at the airport at 7:30 AM.  When we notified the reception desk that we would have to leave the hotel at 6:30 in the morning, well before regular breakfast hours, the receptionist said that the night porter would open the dining room for us and that we could have a continental breakfast at whatever time we wished.  At 6 AM, the night porter was there at the breakfast room door, waiting for us.  He brought us hot tea, coffee, and toast while we put together a hearty breakfast from the cold buffet.  We greatly appreciated having this opportunity to have a morning meal before heading off to the airport.

Wynn’s Hotel exudes Irish charm and hospitality.  Highly recommended.",5,2018,06,27
232,Context of Latest Visit Made Me Appreciate It Even More,"I stayed here again this month, my flight back from my holidays being in late. I've commented on the bathrooms and rooms before, so I needn't go into detail again about how great they are, but what really stood out even more than usual this time was the breakfast. Myself and my friend had spent a week in Italy, and at our hotel the breakfast was so bad that on a couple of mornings we simply did not bother with it at all. In contrast, at Wynn's, were you to go with the abundance on offer you could be there till lunchtime.
My friend had never stayed before, but as well as the breakfast, she loved the unique details of the rooms and such.
So well done again, lads!",5,2018,06,27
232,Beautiful Hotel,I recently stayed in the Wynns hotel Dublin. The hotel was very central to the heart of Dublin and the G.P.O. It was a modern hotel but had an old world feel. Rooms were clean and spacious. Staff were helpful and courteous. Will definitely be staying again.,5,2018,06,26
232,My visit at Wynn's,"I had room 253, a four star double room that contained a queen and a double, and stayed with a friend on the trip for two nights. The prices are moderate, and you get what you pay for.

The room overlooked the busy Abbey Street in the center of town, and was about a fifteen minute walk from several major attractions. You will always have something to do and exercise to achieve.

They offer a full continental breakfast and Irish breakfast every morning incurred with the facility cost, and offer a full range of options from a full Irish Breakfast to a Vegetarian Scramble. You are also no more than a five minute walk from many local restaurants and bars that all offer cheap to moderately priced meals.

The housekeepers and kitchen staff all prided themselves on creative and prompt service. For instance, I accidentally poured tea into my cup, expecting coffee, and they walked by and offered me an entirely new cup. The maids made the bed fresh every day, deep cleaned the room, and dropped off new toiletries, even though we still had some left over from the prior night. The front desk attendants provided a wealth of information on things to do in the area, and made sure our room keys were kept safe when we left the facility.

There are several amenities offered in the hotel, including a pool and a bar. Trinity College and the Christ Church are two major attractions that were only a 20 minute walk or so away.

Although the toiletries werent top quality, they were functional and well worth the extra. The bed was comfortable and had plenty of sheets to keep warm with and the television had about thirteen channels in four languages.

Overall, staying at the Wynn's hotel was a great experience. I recommend it to anyone who is keeping up on city life in Dublin.",5,2018,06,26
232,Seagulls?!?!?,"We stayed here overnight, needing to catch a train early the next morning. My father stayed here on his visits to Dublin many, many years ago and I recalled the Wynn's as being a cozy, elegant hotel. So despite the inflated central Dublin room rates I booked a room for the sake of nostalgia. 

The Wynn's iconic wrought iron exterior which is its trademark is well maintained. It still has a touch of interior elegance, the reception area featuring marble and polished mahogany has been wonderfully preserved, as has the large mirrored dining room. The halls are nicely carpeted and have a Victorian personality, with lots of molding on the walls. Our room was very quaint, if on the small side. The bathroom had been recently updated and was sparkling clean. An immediate problem was a rattle under the sink everytime an upstairs room turned on water, which turned out to be a flexible metal pipe vibrating against the drain (I fixed with a wad of toilet paper). When I pulled aside the drape covering the window I was looking at the building's central shaft with other room windows looking back at me. No big deal, I was here to get some sleep, not admire the view. 

From the sound of it, It was apparent that some seagulls also resided somewhere in the shaft. It was now 9pm and we climbed into bed exhausted. The seagulls were screaming in the shaft. I set the alarm for 4am and assumed the seagulls would quiet down before long. 10pm came and the seagulls were louder than ever. The shaft magnified the noise. Came 11pm, midnight, 1am and the %*#%*#^ seagulls were still partying! I finally got to sleep sometime around 2am. 

I hate to give an otherwise acceptable hotel 2 stars, but this stay was one of the most aggravating I experienced in a long time. Wynn's: you need to do something about the seagull rookery!",2,2018,06,22
232,Perfect Location,"Wynn's is a hotel I've walked past countless times in Dublin and when we saw a good deal on their website we decided to check it out.

We were in to 534, apparently recently renovated and I have to say everything about it was perfect- great bed, excellent bathroom, spotlessly clean and had all you could need. 

The hotel itself is historic and quite old in style, from what we saw some rooms are still very basic but if they're all renovated to the standard of ours it would still suit the character while giving modern facilities.

It's definitely catered towards an older crowd but it wouldn't put me off going back. Have to give a special mention to Claire on reception, she had a genuine welcome for everyone. She was always happy to help and her personality really added to the stay- a perfect ambassador for the hotel and traditional Irish hospitality.",5,2018,06,19
232,Wynn's Hotel Dublin,"I had an absolutely wonderful time at the Wynn's Hotel, which far exceeded my expectations in quality, service, and location for the week I spent in Dublin. The room was spacious and clean, and I had no issues with excess noise. The location was within walking distance from everything I wanted to see in the city, and the hotel's own bar and restaurant were exceptional. The hotel staff was friendly and accommodating as well. In particular, receptionist Claire went above and beyond expectations to help with questions, besides being one of the most attractive women in Dublin! The next time I visit, I will undoubtedly book another room at the Wynn's!",5,2018,06,19
232,Great location to explore Dublin!,"Beautiful old hotel, comfortable room, inviting bar.  Getting inside can be a challenge if luggage is large and heavy.  It is conveniently located to shopping, sites, and food.  We had some confusion at check in but it was quickly resolved by the pleasant employees.",4,2018,06,18
232,Perfect location & good service,"The hotels location cannot be beaten. 5min walk to temple bar and all the shops are on your doorstep. The staff were very professional and it was a nice hotel with plenty of traditional charm. The bar area was nice for a couple of drinks before going out.  I would say the older guests would stay here as opposed to younger so not the place to go for a large group of lads or gals. We found the room ok, this was probably the weakest bit. The bed wasn't as comfortable as other hotels and we had no air con so it got warm during the night which didn't help with the hangover! My brother stopped in another room and he had air con and lived his bed so we may have just had come bad luck. I'd stay again if I returned to Dublin anyway.",4,2018,06,18
232,Great family get together,We stayed here for the nite on 2nd june for a family get together great friendly and lovely atmosphere from staff from we arrived to we left breakfast was so good and rooms were lovely and very clean love this hotel defo be back xx so handy as well for getting from train station and goin to station xx,5,2018,06,15
232,Great choice and location in Dublin,"The Wynn was a great way to start our first Irish vacation.  We definitely recommend it when visiting Dublin.  The location is centralized but not in a loud area.  I.e. Walking distance to Temple Bar area and Trinity college.  The rooms are not huge, but very nice and clean, with historic charm.  The women at the front desk were helpful in answering our tourist questions, transportation recommendations, dining ideas, etc.  
The on-site bar was quaint, and breakfasts were wonderful.  ",5,2018,06,14
232,Great Location and full of history!,"If you want a historic atmosphere in a great location then this place is it! You're right next to o' connel street which is basically one of the main streets of city centre.

 I was nervous because we arrived 5am and it seemed like Dublin was just empty , nothing open, no one on the streets . We arrived at Wynn hotel and although there was a closed barricade gate, we rung the doorbell and the doorman let us in. We were able to check in and the doorman  was the sweetest offering us coffee/tea as he invited us to sit and relax in the sitting room until our room was ready.

The hotel atmosphere is like you're back in time and the decor is just exquisite. I only left out one star because it does get noisy at night but they do offer earbuds and if you visit during their heatwave , i don't think they have A/C. 

BUT, their breakfast is awesome! I lived for waking up every morning for the complimentary Irish breakfast. I would definitely come back again to stay here!",4,2018,06,13
232,Could not have asked for more,"The hotel was excellent. The staff superb! It is very convenient to city center. You can walk to most places from the hotel. But if you can not walk that far, the tram has a convenient stop outside of the hotel. They stored our bags upon arrival since we arrived early on an international flight. Would stay here again.",5,2018,06,13
232,"A Relic most loved for history,  not present","We barely navigated commute time in Dublin.  To be completely open, we were fried upon arrival.  One way streets,  every kind of transportation (pedestrians,  bikers,  cars,  taxi's, buses,  the trolley had us all on edge. 

We called for parking help 3 times and each time they were helpful - it's just not common to park your car in a bus lane and have a porter drive your car to a parking garage.  

Nice enough and updated; no AC, no room to gather in your room with fellow travel mates. Our room allowed a small outside breeze to come in but it was too close to the outside noise.

The second night we took a table at a bar and played a game.  It was so warm - I don't know if they have AC in the common rooms or if they just keep the larger room warmer but whatever the reason - i was drunk drinking with water,  haha!

We easily walked to Trinity College to see the long library hall and The Book of Kells as well as the tourism office (for hop on hop off bus) and places to eat.  Wynn has a great location. 

The area is full of homeless people,  some passed out, some collecting money,  some in the sidewalk food line.  Clearly the group(s) were taking good care of whomever needed or wanted it. Still,  lots of sleeping bags and cold people.

Wynn's offers a nice, hot, breakfast cooked to order.  We all enjoyed that!

We had trouble with noise heard from below us in our room.  There was a Seniors Dance going on in the bar below  us. 😊

Impeccable service!",3,2018,06,08
232,EXCELLENT in almost every way,"We loved our 2 nights here.  The staff are super friendly. Our flight arrived early in the morning. When we arrived they were able to store our luggage until our room was ready which was only about an hour later that morning. They have an area you can sit & relax in or it was a short walk to a bakery to get some goodies. The room though smaller as most rooms in the historic city buildings are was very clean - so clean I walked around with bare feet on the carpet.  The layout was practical, providing places for all our luggage. It was quiet, the bed was comfy. Wifi worked great. 
The typical ""full Irish breakfast"" (2 eggs, bacon, sausage, white pudding which is also like a sausage) was the best we had on our trip in 3 hotels. It was included in our room.  
The location was GREAT. Only a block away from the river which you crossed to be right in the heart of Dublins City Center.  We easily walked to Trinity College, Temple Bar area. We walked everywhere, no taxi needed.
The only thing I didn't like was the shower design, but the water pressure was good.  I would definitely recommend this hotel! We were so glad we stayed here.",5,2018,06,04
232,Lovely old hotel,"In the heart of the city center.  Convenient to all.  Not modern so keep that in mind.  Rooms small but beds comfortable.  We were on the back side off an alley, which was perfect.  The rooms facing front might be noisy so go for the back.  Breakfast is very very good. You can order off a menu and can have some customization.   ",5,2018,05,31
232,Afternoon Tea,"We attended Wynn's Hotel on Friday 25th May, 2018 as part of a Hen Party for afternoon Tea.  Despite having a confirmation e-mail from the Booking Agency Wynn's did not have our booking.  Despite this they stepped up to the mark and within 20 minutes had us seated and a beautiful afternoon tea with delicious open sandwiches, scones, fabulous cakes and tea/coffee.  They also supplied a different selection of sandwiches for a member of our group who suffered from food allergens. I can't thank the staff enough for everything that they did at very short notice.  I am sure they will know who they are when they read this review.  I am just sorry I didn't get their names.  So thank you very much Wynn's Hotel for everything that you did.  You got the weekend off to a very good start!",5,2018,05,29
232,Central," Hotel is nice clean and central in Dublin city centre but couldn't hear much noise so slept well. Beds were comfortable.  Breakfast was nice too. Luas stops right outside hotel so very handy for getting about.  ",4,2018,05,27
232,Good option for a short break,"Well located hotel just off O’Connell street within walking distance of many central attractions.  We had 2 deluxe rooms on the top floor overlooking the street which were a good size – nothing fancy about them but they were clean, comfortable and surprisingly quiet given the hotel’s location. Similarly the bar & dining areas were well maintained and decorated – again nothing exceptional about them but they did the job. Service was friendly with the usual standard of Irish hospitality. If you are looking for a reasonable quality hotel in central Dublin for a short stay then this place might suit your needs.

232,Wynn' s hotel,Lovely old world charm. Beautifully decorated spaces.  Right in the city .  Excellent accommodations and comfy beds. Friendly efficient staff.  Good rates gotten 3 weeks prior to trip. Fabulous breakfast included.,5,2018,05,20
232,Old fashioned very comfortable hotel,"The hotel is ideally situated in the city centre within easy walking distance of all the delights of Dublin. 
The hotel itself is old fashioned but very pleasant. The amenities are very good with all you might expect from a city centre hotel. The staff were remarkable for their pleasant outlook and were very helpful. Breakfast (included in room rate) was excellent....continental selection  and cooked breakfast selection to please anyone.
The bar was pleasant and the bar food was also very good. 
There was a little noise from the street in the room but only to be expected in a city centre. All quiet after 12 though.
All in all a very enjoyable couple of days in one of Europes fantastic cities.",5,2018,05,18
232,"Loud, hot, violent","I was physically accosted on the front step of the hotel by what the doorman (who witnessed but provided no assistance ) called ""travelers"". Immediately after this the unfriendly barman threw out a patron who decided that I was the one to arbitrate their disagreement.  Ok, so much for having a cigarette, I'll just turn in. NOPE! 10 o'clock is when the talentless busker starts his never ending version of stairway to heaven which resonates throughout the room, rendering sleep impossible. Oh, and the pillows reeked of someone elses BO. Breakfast was nice, if pretentious.",1,2018,05,17
232,Wynns hotel,"Our travel agent booked this hotel for a group of 4 women staying in Dublin.    the location was great, breakfast was very good and the accommodations were good.   
A bit noisy as it is on a busy street, but it was warm in the room and we needed to have the window open.",4,2018,05,16
232,Charming ,"Located in the center of the city.  Excellent service, great breakfast.  Best shower during our European trip.  Only criticism is the sounds from the tram on the street and the room needs blackout blinds.",4,2018,05,12
232,Charming and clean,"I booked this hotel after reading the reviews.  All the positive reviews are correct.
It is an old fashioned beautifully kept hotel with a friendly professional staff.  Excellent location just across the river from all the major attractions. The bus from the airport is a short walk away. Many restaurants and stores close by.
My single room was small and very clean and the bed comfortable.  The bathroom was also small and scrupulously clean.  The quirky old fashioned sink with separate hot and cold spigots added to the old world charm.
The staff was always cheerful and extremely helpful and accommodating.  Simon and Josh in the dining room anticipated your ever need. No request was denied.
It was very refreshing to stay in a warm cozy clean old fashioned hotel with warm friendly old fashioned service.",5,2018,05,06
232,Excellent for the solo traveller ...,"I stayed on the 5th floor with quietness all around.    Excellent comfortable room with exquisite bed and bathroom.    Hotel staff very attentive and looked after me extremely well  with my every need seen to immediately.  Reception staff kind and helpful with directions written down to various locations if necessary.  Certainly in the centre of Dublin if you wish to walk or use public transport and a marvellous good feeling and buzz about the hotel with nothing too much trouble and help at all times if needed.

A pleasure to stay and thank you to ALL the staff for such an enjoyable break.",5,2018,05,06
232,Great location,"Picked this hotel because of it's proximity to bars, restaurants.  Great spot.  Wifi worked well.  Nicer, old hotel.  Good inclusive breakfast.  Would stay here again.  The only issue was finding it using GPS.  There are one way streets, and my Garmin couldn't get me to the hotel.  I ended up parking in a lot and walking over, which happened to be the lot the hotel uses.  Were on the 4th floor, street side. No street noise.",4,2018,04,30
232,Great Location Great Breakfast,"Location is very central. Walking distance from the Center and also the very lively Temple Bar area.

Room was good and although it is an old hotel the rooms felt quite modern
Staff were very helpful and the breakfast was excellent",5,2018,04,30
232,Hotel with an old fashioned regal decadance.,"We often stay at modern type chain hotels (Premier Inn) and they always give good value for money but sometimes it is nice to step out of that comfort zone and the Wynns Hotel in Dubllin was definitely a good place to start.

I booked based on reviews and I have to say we were not disappointed.  

Wynn's is situated just off O Connell Street.......the tram runs right outside the hotel which might cause some noise depending on where your room is.

On arrival we were greeted very pleasantly by the receptionist who told us we had been upgraded...........no idea why but it was the first time that has ever happened to us so we gratefully accepted the offer.  So we ended up with a Deluxe room instead of the normal Classic room we had booked.   We came to the conclusion that we were upgraded because there was decorating work ongoing overnight in the stairwells......which we stumbled across due to an early morning trip out to Galway where we stumbled across the decorators .... so if we are right then fair play to the hotel for moving customers who had booked away from the on going maintenance.

Our room was on the fifth floor,  had a Queen size bed and a bathroom with a jacuzzi.....if I am honest,  worth paying the upgrade for.  It was a very quiet location,  the bed was really comfortable and it was probably the best nights sleep I have had in ages.

This hotel has a regal decadence about it.  There is a concierge on the door,  you leave your key with reception and reception know who you are when you return.  Breakfast again was not formal but it was very well organised,  waiting kept a minimun and over our 4 night stay we did turn up at busy times.  The head waiter (which I wish I had got his name) was excellent and remembered every day I had tomato sauce with my breakfast.....it wasn't OTT but it did make you feel you were a valued guest.  

We didn't have an evening meal at the hotel but the quality of the breakfast was excellent and a really good choice.  For those of us from the UK it did have an Irish twist to it (notably no baked beans) but instead White Pudding which was delicious (not to be confused with black pudding) and a Potato Cake which was lovely.  Our Poached eggs every morning were spot on....but that is just the Irish Breakfast.  You can choose from Eggs Benedict through to Fish and Pancakes.......if only I could have got past the Irish breakfast I could have tried it all!

Without a doubt when we return to Dublin we will definately stay at Wynn's again.",5,2018,04,29
232,Group Trip,"The location is excellent just off O'Connell street near the Quays. The Hotel and accommodation was excellent and the staff were pleasant, very friendly and helpful. The food was first class. Service in the restaurant and bar areas was great.  There was a group of 28 and everything went like clockwork to registering and checking out.
A lovely hotel.",5,2018,04,26
232,A bit old-fashioned,"Definitely great location, however, not only the hotel looks a bit old, it really is, including the furnishings. The street is noisy, but in the upper floor I could sleep normally. Everything was just ok and it is a good spot for a few nights. Breakfast was average. ",3,2018,04,24
232,Great Weekend,"A weekend away with 5 girls for our friends 40th birthday, we had a fantastic time, from the moment we arrived the staff were all super friendly and welcoming, the rooms were clean spacious and comfortable and breakfast was plentiful and tasty! The location was great with easy walking to all the major sights, I would definitely recommend to anyone travelling to Dublin!",5,2018,04,23
232,Wonderful stay at Wynns Hotel in Dublin!,"We had a wonderful stay at the Wynn - with high compliments to all of the staff including the manager, the housekeeping staff, the waiters, doormen, and everyone else who helped make our stay so great!  The hotel has an excellent location which was walking distance to most everything we wanted to see - and was right next to a hop-on-hop-off stop for any destinations that were further away.  Hotel was nice and clean and the complimentary breakfast each morning was our favorite meal of the day - with a great menu in an elegant dining room.  All employees were extremely helpful and polite.  We will recommend the Wynn to friends and family, and hope to come back for another visit someday.  We loved our stay!",5,2018,04,22
232,Do NOT stay here if you want to sleep.,"I just measured the noise in my room for 1 minute and the average volume was 60 dB with peaks of 68 dB. You can ask for earplugs at the reception but they don’t help since you can feel the intense bass vibrating. 

I stayed here 3 nights. Two of which was horrible since they have a party area/disco on floor 1 (which is rent out to private parties). I stayed on floor 3 and I cannot imagine what the volume is on floor 2. 

I asked how long the party would last and they told me until 12:30. Hence, only stay here if you yourself is out drinking late.

In addition to the noise, the rooms are very small, the bathroom has separate cold/warm water taps that are far from each other making it impossible to wash your hands in moderate temperature.

The breakfast does not open until 07:30 which I personally find too late. 

Each room has a rather heavy key (much heavier than a phone).

I am not coming back.",1,2018,04,20
232,No Regrets,"My husband and I stayed in the James Joyce Suite, and couldn't have been more pleased. The room was spacious and clean. The bed was very comfortable. The best part of this experience was the staff and location. Roberta met us at reception the day we arrived, jet lagged and weary. The room wasn't ready, as we arrived early in the morning, but she offered us the lounge to regroup and rest with a pot of hot coffee, which was excellent. We left our luggage with reception and went out to explore, but being so exhausted from the long flight, went back to the hotel after an early lunch to  rest in the lounge, which by this time was filled with luncheon customers. We had a pot of tea, and soon our room was ready, and we were overjoyed to find it so nice.

Roberta warned us that there would be an event on Friday night, but we didn't hear a thing on the 5th floor. 

I want to give David, the night bar tender, a huge praise! He went above and beyond, remembering us, talking to us, caring about our enjoyment, and giving us new drinks to try. He was the star of our evenings!

The breakfast, fantastic beyond anything I've ever experienced in a hotel, delighted us every morning. Simply delicious, served by an excellent staff.

I would never want to stay anywhere else if I ever get the chance to visit Dublin again. Well worth the money.

The staff was superb. ",5,2018,04,19
232,Old fashion/great location,"Beautiful hotel that has kept its history over the years with a doorman and ‘parlour style’ bar and breakfast lounge. It’s a nice hotel but hard to get to by cab from airport, transfers not available to airport but shuttle service available
down the street if you arE up to hauling your luggage a half a block= 7 Euro. The rooms are clean but not much room to move around with bed and desk. 

Our room overlooked O’Connell street which is busy. Woke up early to the sound of delivery trucks👍dropping off to the many restaurants down below.

IF you want to be in the heart of Dublin this is the place for you! Staff is friendly and helpful. 

Oh another fun fact: The old fashion key to your room is 5 lbs in weight but they hold onto it for you at the desk. 🤔
",3,2018,04,19
232,Traditional,"The hotel staff was incredibly nice, I've never encountered such friendly people at the reception! Their Irish breakfast was delicious and traditional. The rooms were fine, no remarks. Only the shower was a bit difficult to use.",5,2018,04,12
232,"I'm in shock, terrible!","I had the worst experience of my life in this hotel. I never ever had experienced such a rude person that treats so bad your staff. How can a person humiliate and shout out someone else for free?! This horrible situation happened in the lobby and in front of everyone. I honestly felt like the manager, Simon, was delighted with that, but I'm horrified. I can not let this situation pass for free.
Simon, if you read this, please think how you are treating people and how people should be treated better. 
About the rest of hotel, it is located in a good location, beautiful rooms, and great staff! Special from the barmen and the doormen who always had a smile and good chat.",1,2018,04,09
232,Great position,"This hotel is just off O'Connell Street and is ideally placed for a short trip to Dublin. You can explore the whole of the city centre on foot from here. It looks, when you arrive, like an old fashioned ""Grand"" hotel, but inside all is friendly and really comfortable . The staff can't do enough to help. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the bathrooms modern  and the breakfasts are wonderful",5,2018,04,08
232,"Location, location, location","An excellent hotel ideally situated just on the north side of the Liffy. Nice rooms, staff, and even a doorman. Old world charm! I would give it a 4 1/2  rating, but since there isn't one they get a four. My only concern was the bathroom. Not sure if all the rooms are the same but the shower was not enclose, rather two curtains that are drawn around you, and there was a fair amount of water sprayed on the floor. Also there is a bit on night noise from adjacent rooms and a bit of street noise. However that can easily be overlooked when everything else about the hotel is so good. Lovely breakfast room and terrific breakfast selection. We also ate in the hotel our first night and the food was delicious, ample, and reasonably priced.",4,2018,04,04
232,Brilliant Location!,Hotel is brilliant if you're looking for somewhere central in Dublin! Staff were friendly and couldn't enough for you. Only negative was the breakfast was a bit basic- not much choice. I would recommend!,5,2018,03,28
232,"First visit to Ireland, country festival","Don't stay in this hotel if you want to sleep before 1.00am.
When we arrived we were warned there was a private party on and there would be music until 1.00am, however as we were on the third floor we assumed we wouldn't hear it.
Not so, it was so loud we didn't sleep until after 1.00am  after it had stopped.
When we complained the next morning we were told there is usually a private function on at weekends. We advised that guests should be warned when they are booking not after they have arrived and paid!  Breakfast was very nice though.",3,2018,03,22
232,"Location great, rooms nice, breakfast wonderful","The location of this hotel was great- very convenient to many things. We were able to step off the bus from the airport and basically be right at the airport. The bathroom was clean, water pressure was good, the sink design was a little funky but it was fine (tray above sink sticks out a bit, which only matters for brushing teeth). We weren't aware of street noise (we were on an upper floor on back of hotel) in the room. The bed was a little small and not the most comfortable in the world but it wasn't horrible. Staff was very courteous and the gentleman who ran breakfast had it down to a science.",4,2018,03,21
232,Lovely historic hotel in great location ,"We were 4 friends visiting Dublin and this was the perfect hotel. Location is central and because of that you can expect some street noise (especially if Ireland win the 6 nations). We were also warned of a function on the Saturday night which did not affect us as we were enjoying the music ourselves in Temple Bar. I loved the decor of this hotel, rooms were charming and spotlessly clean and staff were welcoming and helpful. Best of all the breakfast which was served in lovely dining room, great staff and a wonderful choice of hot food and the best porridge I have ever tasted. Thanks, we will return to this hotel next time. 
",5,2018,03,13
232,Old Irish Charm,"Elegant, charming and historic. Our first night in Dublin could not have been a better choice. It's an older hotel but it's well maintained and rich in history. We felt absolutely pampered at breakfast. The service was excellent and the food was delicious to say the least - the ham, eggs, oh and the scones! The hotel's location is ideal as it's within walking distance to many popular sites, attractions and pubs.",5,2018,03,13
232,Poor Treatment of wheelchair users,"On visiting this hotel today to attend a function,i had in my care my colleague whom is a wheelchair user.On arriving at the hotel we were met on the steps by an employee who directed us to a side alleyway.He told us that the ramp was around the side.The surface of the alleyway was unbelievably rough and stank of beer and urine.As we went further in to the alleyway we were met by a heavily drunken man.As we got to the side gate of the hotel a beer truck blocked the entrance and gradually the door man let us in to a narrow alleyway blocked by wheelie bins and a slippery steel ramp.Turns out its used to stock the bar.During the day we found out that the wheelchair friendly toilets were locked and we had to abandon the wheel chair in the hall and transverse 2 doors so my colleague could use the toilet.At lunch time chairs had to be moved  just to enter the restaurant  and to get near enough to the table with the wheelchair.At the end of the day we had to use the same way to leave the hotel.Unbelievable in 2018 that this is how this hotel treats wheelchair users.SHAME ON YOU .",1,2018,03,12
232,Noisy! ,"Be sure to ask if there is an event going on in the hotel before you book. The noise is unbearable and you will get a “sorry, not sorry” from the desk if you ask about it, however politely. 
If no event, it’s a nice enough hotel with a good breakfast. ",2,2018,03,03
232,Dinner in the Restaurant,"Went back to my favorite Hotel in Dublin after the Wales v Ireland rugby match, had dinner in the restaurant, the food is of a very high standard,  the restaurant is tastefully decorated keeping with the old charm of the Hotel.  The staff are a credit to the Hotel, especially Claire on the reception desk, she is so helpful, polite and professional - it is nice to be remembered, considering all the guests they have every year.  Looking forward to my next visit.",5,2018,02,27
232,RIght in The Centre of Things,"I was back for my latest visit to Wynn's, and I must say I was as pleased as always. The location is brilliant, most especially because this time I was going to a play in the Abbey Theatre (literally right next door): ease of access to the train stations is a greater attraction for me as standard, however.
The only complaint I might have on this occasion is the meal we had in the bar the night of our arrival wasn't fantastic, but it was grand. Breakfast the next morning was as great as always, a fine selection and the service was wonderful.
What I really like about Wynn's is the character of the place: before Christmas I stayed at a four star in Dublin, and whilst lovely, it was all new. The decor of here, most especially of the dining room, is one that cannot simply be replicated, and that is what makes it unique. You are stepping back into another world, yet comfortable throughout.
The staff were all brilliant too! Totally capable, able and friendly.",4,2018,02,21
232,Fantastic old hotel,"This hotel had been tastefully decorated to the style it was built but it still has all the modern amenities. 
We booked into the James Joyce suite and it was lovely and spacious with a wonderful jacuzzi bath. Fire place and seating area with lots of books left by other travelers. 
It’s perfect location for all your needs if it’s shopping or sightseeing your in the heart of everything. 
The breakfast was beautiful and you will be full for the day. 
The staff are so friendly and helpful I would highly recommend this hotel. 
",5,2018,02,21
232,"Friendly, old fashioned charm. Breakfast was ""wow!""","Our room wasn’t quite as cozy looking as the photos on the Web depicted but it did have a very modern bathroom with upscale fixtures. A picture or two on the walls would be a nice touch as the walls looked a little bare. Very clean, quiet and well situated just off O’Connell Street, about 2-blocks to the river. Staff were very friendly & helpful. 

Outstanding breakfast (included) that included a continental setup with fresh cut fruit, toast, cereal, etc as well as a delicious hot choice (the eggs benny was so good!).",4,2018,02,17
232,Great Hotel in Dublin,"This hotel is great!!!  i really cannot say enough great things about this place  We booked two rooms Jan 28 - Jan 31. From when we arrived late Sunday night, we were greeted with a smile and a no problem check in. Very nice after a long bit of travel.   The rooms were beautiful, the hotel is immaculate and the people are great.  Sean at the bar was fabulous.  And...I learned a new drink!  Paul the Porter absolutely went above and beyond.   We had booked a tour to Kilkenny Castle, only to have it cancelled.  I was so disappointed, as that was going to be my highlight of the trip.  When the Maitre D (sorry I don't know his name) heard about his, he suggested that we talk to Paul who was from Kilkenny.  Sure enough, Paul found out when the next train was due to leave and put us on our way.  Just as he said, it was an easy train ride, and then a short (10min) walk to the Castle.  He definitely saved the day and I am so grateful that I did get to visit the Castle.  If you are looking for a great place to stay in Dublin the Wynn's is definitely the place.",5,2018,02,16
232,Best Hotel in Dublin,We just returned from a trip to Dublin where we stayed at the Wynns Hotel.  It is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.  It has been restored to it’s original beauty with ever detail thought of!  The staff was incredible!  The breakfast which is included in the room price was impecable.  Loved every monment.,5,2018,02,11
232,Perfect Hotel,"Really enjoyed our stay at Wynns Hotel, located perfectly just off O'Connell Street and 5 min walk to the Temple bar region.   Accommodation was clean and spacious - bed was really comfortable; staff were friendly, helpful and polite; breakfast was cooked to order and was delicious.  Would stay here again if travelling to Dublin and recommend to anyone thinking of staying.",5,2018,02,11
232,Great location and staff,"Stayed for one night with my daughter who is a wheelchair user. Staff could not have been nicer. Only downside was steps into the hotel! The ramp was quite steep but staff did all the pushing! On leaving, we used the back exit which was safer and easier. Our room was accessible with roll in shower. Breakfast was amazing (see attached photos). Nicest menu I have seen in a long time. Very clean hotel and so easy to get to from Heuston train station. Just 5 stops away (get off at Abbey St stop) and the hotel is right in front of you. It could not be easier.",5,2018,02,10
232,We'll be back!,"My Mum and I enjoyed one night at Wynn's Hotel in a twin room with breakfast. We felt it was a very nice hotel, really central to everything, friendly staff and a quality breakfast. The beds were comfy, the room not too warm, shower was good and a convivial atmosphere in the bar. Only slight negative was that the hairdryer was wall mounted of the type you find in swimming pools. Bring your own! Otherwise faultless - we'll definitely be back!",5,2018,02,10
232,Ideal location,"Four of us travelled for a weekend.  Fabulous hotel, rooms very clean and fantastic staff. The receptionists and bar staff were so helpful and friendly and made the experience even more enjoyable. 
Wonderful breakfasts served in a lovely grand dining room. This hotel will take some beating and if ever I return this will be the place to stay. Tram stop outside and even though our room was overlooking the road being 3 floors up we could barely hear anything. Would highly recommend ",5,2018,02,06
232,Lovely Hotel - Great Location,"Lovely hotel, great spacious double room with sleigh style bed. Very efficient friendly staff. Cooked breakfast was excellent. Bar was friendly and busy. Old hotel with great updates. Right in the city centre just a moments walk from trinity college and temple bar over the bridge and shopping. Was on the 3rd floor and quiet room. Would love to return and stay again.

Very easy for taxis (rank just round corner) and buses.",5,2018,02,03
232,Receptionist Saved the Day,"Stayed at Wynn's Hotel from 23rd January 2018, originally for 2 nights but had to stay an additional night requiring a flight change . Not a big deal you would have thought. Unfortunately, a certain Irish airline provided no help whatsoever. In desperation I spoke with Clare, one of the receptionists. Not only did she sort the whole problem out for me  and re-booked me on a later flight I noted she actually went as far as logging on to the airline using her own facebook info'.  It would have been so easy for Clare - she was pretty busy at the time -  to have said that there was nothing she could do. I genuinely cant't thank Clare enough. For that reason alone I wouldn't think of staying at another hotel next time I'm in Dublin",5,2018,01,28
232,Old world Charm,Wynns is a hotel you step back in time. Old world decor gives it a special feel. Keys stil on a big heavy brass kind of stopper. Rooms comfortable with solid wood furnishing. Staff all very friendly. Central in the city loved my short stay.,4,2018,01,26
232,Great staff,"Staff, central location and it's old world charm are Wynn's best selling points. Staff were so accommodating to any requests. I'm not a big fan of breakfast fare in most hotels but the Wynn's breakfast certainly won me over. Great attention to detail and delicious food",5,2018,01,23
232,Good hotel,Pleasent hotel in a convenient location beds a bit on the hard side but gave the place character kudos to Claire at reception very very helpful great staff next time in Dublin will definitely stay there,4,2018,01,22
232,Wonderful hotel with an amazing breakfast,This was our first stay in Dublin and we just loved this hotel. All the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was very nice and comfortable. The breakfast was the best we had in Ireland. The location was perfect to get to anything you want to do. I definitely would stay here again.,5,2018,01,20
232,Excellent,"Would highly recommend Wynn's Hotel to anyone, for us was just in the right location, very central and was literally only a 5 minutes walk away from Temple Bar.  The Hotel itself was spotlessly clean and the staff could not do enough for you.  Breakfast was delicious and the service of it was excellent too.  Thank you Wynn's Hotel for a lovely and comfortable stay.",5,2018,01,08
232,Elegant ,This is an old hotel in a very good location a stones throw from the Liffey.  The staff are great nothing to much trouble.  There is a luas (tram ) stop outside which is very convenient but does create some low level noise. The hotel exudes charm and although the room was not overly large it was very adequate.  Breakfast was plentiful piping hot and delicious.  Breakfast staff warm and welcoming.  Would definitely stay again! ,4,2018,01,07
232,"Great Location, Traditional feel","My sister and I stayed one night, we were attending a function there. The food on the night was excellent.  Our room was clean and equipped with everything you would expect. It has a lot of character and very friendly staff. Location is really great, a lot within walking distance, tram outside.  We got a taxi from Dublin airport, cost just under 20€. Would stay again",4,2017,12,31
232,Anniversary break ,"We stayed at wynns for our anniversary and we both had a great time the room was very cosy , warm and a very comfortable bed. The breakfast was great the location of the hotel is fantastic for anyone wanting to visit Dublin city would highly recommend a stay in this hotel ",5,2017,12,30
232,"Excellent hotel, great location and great staff","Thanks very much for an excellent stay. Staff were lovely from the moment we arrived, from reception to the restaurant. The open fire gives the bar a really cosy atmosphere. The hotel serves a really generous breakfast with a great selection of food and the scones are yummy. 

The location is great just off O’Connell Street and a 10 minute walk to Grafton Street. Despite the central location noise was not an issue. Our rooms were located on the 3rd and 5th floor facing Abbey Street. The Luas stops (Abbey Street) just outside the hotel door. Many thanks, David. ",5,2017,12,29
232,ABSOLUTE GEM,"We stayed on Saturday night... this hotel should is so amazing that if all hotels set their standards like Wynns well business would be permanently booming ❤
Staff were so friendly and helpful...efficent yet classy polite...really glad that a Hotel like this is still available and surviving while doing themselves so proud.  Thankyou Wynns... be seeing you soon!👍👍👍❤❤❤🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮",5,2017,12,18
232,"top class, across the board ,","from the second we booked in, we loved Wynn`s, it is`nt the first time we have stayed here, it`s always nice to come back here again, and again, people would say it`s perfect for the Luas, this hotel was always perfect long before the trams started, our room was warm, clean and comfortable, the bed you just dont want to get out off, we were in a room facing Abbey Street, and there was hardly any noise, except the luas, well the hotel is in the city center so you have to expect  some noise, it did`nt keep us awake, the breakfast was hot and tasty, and prepared fresh to order, it there was one person who stood out, it was the lovely lady on reception, she was under a small bit of pressure due to an awkward person on the phone, but still checked up in very professionally, and was lovely to us on check out, all the staff we met were courteous towards us, top marks to all, Pat Foley rm 249",5,2017,12,15
232,Fab hotel,"We only stayed at Wynns for one night, but it was fantastic. Our room was clean and tidy, with tea/coffee making facilities (there is a spar next door for milk) and a fridge to keep milk cold.
We arrived at 10.30am, and popped into the hotel to see if we could leave our luggage, only to be told our room was already ready, and we’d been upgraded!
The jacuzzi bath was a lovely surprise!
Breakfast was freshly made to order, with plenty of choice. Every staff member we met were lovely and polite, and spoke to us!
We checked out after breakfast, and still had a full day before our flight home, but we were able to again leave our luggage at the hotel. 
The hotel was perfectly situated, in the heart of the city, right next to the 747 bus stop, which went straight to the airport.
We couldn’t have wished for a better hotel, in a better position!
We will definitely stay again, as we had such a fab time in Dublin!
",5,2017,12,10
232,"Wonderful, enraptures all the charm of Dublin!","First of all if you want to stay here book directly with the hotel via their website, got the best deal doing it this way.

We were in Dublin for 2 days and made our way from the airport. When the bus got to the City Centre the bus stop is on O'Connell Street just outside the hotel!
We were allowed to check in at 10am and were upgraded which was a nice surprise. 

The hotel is a wonderfully charming hotel that looks like it was lifted from the 1950s and placed right in the middle of chic and modern Dublin.
There is character and charm at every turn from the old lift, to the decor and furnishings.
The room was spotlessly clean and very spacey.
Breakfast was amazing (white pudding??!!) and when we visited the bar the night before it was busy but pleasant.
Check in and out was swift and they offered to store our luggage until we left, free of charge.

Overall, you can have your choice of the modern brands but for a piece of Dublin choose Wynn's!

Oh and the tram stop is right outside too!",5,2017,12,09
232,Very nice hotel in Dublin!,"Really nice hotel, fantastic position to visit Dublin. In front of the hotel there is also a luas stop. The breakfast was tasty, expecially the irish breakfast! The only negative thing was the noise due to a party in the first floor during a night.",4,2017,12,09
232,Amazing stay ,Stayed here for one night and we loved every minute of it. The staff were all lovely and even were kind enough to upgrade our room which was a nice surprise. The room was clean and comfortable. The location is excellent and breakfast in the morning was just as good. Will definitely stay here anytime we visit Dublin. Thanks for a really enjoyable stay. ,5,2017,11,28
232,Excellent ,"First time staying here. It's a fabulous hotel with lots of quirky details of an older hotel. 
Arrived early and there was no problem checking in, and even gave us a complimentary superior room.  It was lovely, clean comfortable and warm. 
Breakfast was really good, I love the dining room decor.
When we arrived Robbie at the front door was very friendly and helpful. Later when we were waiting in reception with a lot of bags going to o'connell st, Andrew the as standard manager offered to help us bring them over. Such helpful staff.a very well run hotel.
We also had dinner earlier in the bar carvery which was delicious and very reasonable.

I will most definitely return here again.",5,2017,11,27
232,Cozy and Convenient,"This attractive and traditional historic hotel has small, cozy rooms with limited amenities. There is an small atrium in the middle of the building, so even though you may have windows you don't necessarily have a view. 

All that aside, the staff here is excellent and quite friendly for the city. The restaurant spaces on the first floor are gorgeous, classically appointed rooms. The food is great, particularly the breakfasts included with your stay. It's out of the way enough where foot traffic on the street is reasonable and it's quiet at night, but most of the sights around Dublin are easily walkable from here. Definitely recommended!",5,2017,11,26
232,Wynns a winner,"Stayed over the weekend and was not disappointed.  The room was fine, spotless and well maintained it was what I expected from an old hotel with plenty of character. The food and drinks were excellent as were all the staff. The only glitch on the screen was the lack of staff on Sunday evening.  The carvery is served until 8pm which was great but there was only one waitress on the floor, tables needed cleaning and the bar was full of empty glasses, one more staff member on the floor during the busy period would have sorted it. Having said that the staff that were on were working hard. We would certainly return.",4,2017,11,22
232,Reunion lunch,"We recently had a school reunion lunch at Wynns Hotel restaurant - excellent location for all public transport - food was lovely, very reasonably priced & staff helpful and friendly. Dining room is bright & spacious & you couldn't find a better city centre location",5,2017,11,17
232,Excellent value!,"This is a 3 star hotel with 5 star service and smack bang in the middle of the city, so walking distance to all tourist spots and shopping streets. So impressed with value for money compared to some of the 4 and even 5 star hotels I've stayed in! My friend and I stayed on a busy Saturday night, but nothing was too much trouble for the staff from check-in to bar and waiting staff. We didn't have dinner there, but breakfast the next morning was cooked to order and could not fault it. Lovely room, so cosy with fire place and plush bedding. Can't wait for my next visit to Dublin and definitely will return to this fantastic hotel.",5,2017,11,14
232,Gem of a hotel.,"Stayed at Wynns Hotel last weekend and had a fantastic stay from start to finish.

Could not ask for a better location in the city centre.  The hotel is located seconds from O'Connell Street, within 5-10 minutes walk of all the main shopping areas,restaurants and bars in Dublin. Great if you doing a bit of shopping as you can pop back to the hotel in minutes to drop bags and start again!  Luas stop just outside the hotel if you need to venture further out off the city.

From reception staff, bar staff to the waiting staff, the customer service was fantastic, everyone so polite and only to happy to help.  Was surprised that they seemed to remember peoples names...not usual in a city hotel!  Was lovely to see when customer service can be non-existent in some places. 

Rooms were great, very spacious with a double and single bed.  Spotlessly clean.  Beautiful bathroom with a nice strong shower. We were on the 4th floor overlooking the front of the hotel. 

We stayed on BB basis and I have to say the breakfast was fantastic, with a  continental  and cooked to order breakfast ( i had both) you are spoiled for choice.  
Fresh breads, fresh fruit and best of all proper orange juice, I would come back for the breakfast alone. 

This is definitely a city centre gem of a hotel that expect high standards from their staff and that is exactly what we received.  Would definitely recommend it to anyone.",5,2017,11,14
232,Lovely central old-fashioned Hotel,Spent one night B&B in Wynn's last weekend and it was lovely. Got a complimentary room upgrade which was amazing and the breakfast the next morning was divine. Definitely will recommend and stay again in the future.,5,2017,11,08
232,"Fantastic! A rare treat in Dublin (not cheap, but worth it)","Spent a week in Dublin staying at Wynn's for work, and then Fri-Sun with my wife for a great weekend treat. Can't fault Wynn's. It's perfect for all city centre attractions and the LUAS (red) is immediately outside the hotel. Only minor issue was that the mixer tap approach to the shower was hit and mass. My wife and I loved the breakfast, which was cooked to order. The bar area and restaurant is beautiful. This is a historic Dublin landmark hotel. Even if you can't afford a room, go there for a drink or meal just to add it to your list of best places to visit in Dublin.",5,2017,11,05
232,A Bit of Old-fashioned Charm Made for a Pleasant Stay,"This is an older hotel that has been nicely updated keeping a mix of the old-fashioned charm with modern amenities and comforts.  Our room and private bath were very large, clean and comfortable.  Our room had two window seats with large windows looking out to a charming street.  We had no street noise in our room.  The hallway had a slight smell of fresh paint, not bothersome, but rather a good sign that they were keeping things up.  The breakfast room was beautifully done and breakfast was delicious.  Desk staff and restaurant staff were very pleasant and accommodating.  Our only issue with the hotel was the difficulty we had finding it by car.  The hotel is surrounded by one way streets.  There is a trolly that runs in front of the hotel so it is not possible to drive right up in front of the hotel to unload bags or have valet service.  After literally 45 minutes of driving around and almost giving up for a more accessible hotel, we finally found a parking garage and walked to the hotel.  Upon expressing our difficulty, a very kind staff person told us we had actually parked in the right parking garage and they had assigned complimentary parking there.  He very kindly walked with us to the garage and got us settled in the right space.  I wish I had caught his name to recognize his extra efforts here.  The hotel would do well to improve signage out front on the opposite side of the street to create some kind of valet or drop off parking.  We seriously almost didn't stay here because we couldn't deal with the complexity of the traffic pattern.  Once finally checked in, everything is easily accessed by foot.",4,2017,11,04
232,"Central, Cosy and great Customer Care","This is a great hotel. Have stayed a few times now and it always delivers.  Fantastic breakfasts.  Lovely friendly staff in this hotel. Rooms are warm and have fridge, Jacuzzi Bath, Iron and Board and views to the street.
Lisa is right outside.  Handy hotel for 3Arena !!",5,2017,11,04
232,Charming Gem in Dublin!!,My best friend and I stayed at the Wynn’s hotel from October 27-November 1st 2017.  I must say the customer service here might be the best in the World.  The front desk clerks name was Roberta and she went out of her way to make our stay memorable.  The men at the door were wonderful and had no problem finding me some ice cream at midnight.  The hotel was in the perfect location to see all the sites in Dublin.  The room was clean comfortable and very charming.  The free breakfast had many options and was delicious.  I must say this hotel is amazing and defiantly the staff here play a huge part in how great this hotel is.  Thank you Roberta and the rest of staff for making our stay a memorable one.  I think you all deserve a raise!!!!,5,2017,11,03
232,Superb,"this is a super nice hotel, so pleased we chose to stay here. From the moment we arrived the staff were all so lovely, especially one lady in paticular whose name i did not get but she was so so friendly and cheerful and is certainly an asset to the hotel she was not irish so maybe its easy to find out her name, please try and find out who she is as she needs a big well done, the hotel is lovely and clean and the decor lovely to. the bar is nice and resteauant lovely too, food here is really good. Breakfast was amazing,the eggs benedict are worth a try, how the chef gets those eggs done, so so yummy never had a poached egg like them. Rooms are nice and perfect for what we needed, our only grumble was our room was pretty noisy in the evening, we were at the back looking onto an alley than ran between two streets, so many people coming up that street, including police cars, drunks, street cleaners and so on, also some place dumping empty bottles at stupid times, this would not stop us staying again, we just like having our window open for the fresh air, closing it stopped most of the noise, but think its worth a mention, we could have asked to be moved and im pretty sure they would have if we had asked, loved this hotel so we will be back at some point, also its so handy for everthing, and the tram stops right outside plus its just off the main street and handy for the aircoach stop.",5,2017,10,31
232,Great Location - Great Full Irish Breakfast,"The only reason I give it four stars is because the room showed its age a bit.  Other than that, everything was very good.  The included  full Irish breakfast was wonderful and the wait staff were amazing.  We walked to everything except the National Gallery and that was because it was raining that day.  Centrally located in the heart of the city right off O'Connell Street and two blocks to the river Liffey.  Five minutes to the GPO where the Irish Republic was declared in 1916 Easter Uprising.",4,2017,10,30
232,Decadent,"I stayed at the Wynns for 2 nights. The single room I was given was at the 5th floor, in the roof, was small, with old furniture and so so blankets with a window overlooking a wall and a small bathroom. Wifi was bad. 
The room was clean. The position of the hotel is very good, close to buses and shops.
Some time ago, this 3 star hotel must have been one of Dublin milestones. Unfortunately now its guests were mostly aged people.
Breakfast was ok. The staff was very kind.
I stayed in Dublin before and I personally prefer more modern hotels.",2,2017,10,28
232,Great Location,"This hotel is a great location, easily walkable to all the major landmarks. We even walked to the Guinness Factory (though it was a bit of a hike). Our flight got in at 5 am and they were great about holding our bags so we didn't have to drag them all around the city. The rooms are clean, the beds comfortable and the staff friendly.  I really enjoyed the free breakfast that came with our stay. Filled us up for pretty much the whole day. I would definitely stay there again!",5,2017,10,24
232,Perfect location,"This is a lovely old hotel in the perfect location. Close to all amenities and tourist attractions. Breakfast was included and was delicious. Staff very helpful and friendly. Will definitely book here again :) 
Thank you Wynn's hotel",4,2017,10,22
232,Enjoyed this hotel,"I stayed here in early October 2017 for 3 nights. All the employees were friendly and helpful. My room was somewhat updated. They reused the headboard but it was from a bigger bed. The switches look ancient. These things I noticed but had no effect on my stay. I slept well on the bed. I left the window open and was not woken up by any noise. The bathroom was mostly updated. The shower has nice tile and a rainfall shower head. There is a towel warmer behind the door as well. 

The restaurant staff was busy but always nice and served me pretty quickly. 

The front desk staff was friendly as well. My last night I hung out and talked with them for a bit and they were so nice.

The tram stopped almost at the front door. If you are going to Jameson the tram drops you a block away. 

I will stay here again for sure. ",4,2017,10,22
232,"Fabulous location, even better people,","Wynns is a gorgeous, historic hotel, perfectly located in central Dublin. It has a genuine charm and style. Its breakfast room and ‘Saints and Scholars’ bar are lovely places to eat their freshly prepared food. A rare find in a mass produced accommodation world. Family ownership and management has brought warmth and care to its visitors.",4,2017,10,21
232,Early Bird,Went for early bird after rugby match and the dinning room was closed for a private function and we were shown to the bar. It was very busy. We got a nice table and enjoyed our sea bass and desert. It was very good and I would recommend it.,4,2017,10,18
232,"Wynns Hotel, Dublin, Ireland","Extremely convenient to central Dublin and O'Connell St. yet still close to the River Liffey and Temple Bar area.  The food was excellent as was the service, especially for meals in the lounge.  There is always a doorman on duty to help with luggage or bags or any other needs.  The staff at reception are very friendly and helpful as well.  Our room was 
comfortable and very well cared for.  Wynns is only one block from the tourist office and the Hop On/Hop Off bus stop, also  the city trolley system stops right out front. The hotel is also in a very quiet area, which we appreciated, but still close to as much partying as one might desire.  Al in all a very nice place to stay.",5,2017,10,18
232,One Night Weekend Stay,"Loved our stay here, Room was good. No trouble with noise and we were located 2nd floor with front street view as requested.
Staff go above and beyond to help you. Cannot fault it. Bar staff on Saturday night very friendly and helpful about where to visit etc..
Breakfast 1st class. Well worth it :)",5,2017,10,18
232,"A Lovely Hotel, But !","We stayed for 2 nights in July for our wedding anniversary and loved just about everything about this Lovely old hotel, location is great, staff were amazing and couldn’t do enough for us, food was delicious, and the Guinness was to die for.  

But the only slight downside was our room looked and felt very tired, the mattress and pillows both need renewing, the shower was a bit hit a miss and I would have paid a Million Quid for some air conditioning which unfortunately there was none, being July the weather was very kind to us and we had to have the window wide open, and Dublin like London is very much a 24hr city.

But would we use this Hotel again? Absolutely  

Well Worth A Visit",4,2017,10,18
232,Stayed at Wynn's for 9 and a half years -& always good!,"For nearly a decade we have stayed at Wynn's when we visit Dublin- perfectly located at the heart of the capital & full of old fashion charm. 
Same staff for years who are polite, professional & aim to provide a first class service. Reasonably priced with probably the best breakfast around. Well worth a visit.

232,Very original old hotel with limitations on comfort,"The people working at the Wynn's without any exception are absolutely wonderful - they make all the difference. The location is great and we did like the genuine retro aspect of the place. But this entailed comfort limitations. Our room (387) had a window out to the back and we were awakened by the scent of the breakfast bacon being grilled and the sounds of the backstreet. The bathtub-shower was OK, but water temp hard to adjust and with too much water leaking onto the floor. The retro-styled mini-sink very cute, but unpractical. No dedicated light around the mirror for shaving or make-up. The bed's mattresses were quite decent, but the hotel had placed a waterproof sheet right under the bedsheet, which really made me sweat and wake up at night. Unpleasant experience. The should have at least placed a cotton topper between sheet and that membrane.",3,2017,10,15
232,Grace and Charm,"I spent three nights here and felt like being reacquainted with an old love. From the moment I arrived to the final farewell, this hotel provided warmth and comfort for the body and the soul.  The charm and grace that feels irretrievably lost from modern lives and now only viewed and experienced by most people through film comes alive at Wynn's. So many of the little gestures and things said and done by the staff here remind the guest that they are in a special place run by the proprietors and not just the staff of a large corporation. The ethos of the management flows through everyone I encountered at this hotel. This old building is very well maintained down to small details. In addition to the aesthetics, the accommodations were everything a traveler needs. The room was quiet, the bed comfortable and the bath clean and functional.  The WiFi worked perfectly! The included breakfast was also a ""real"" breakfast. The location was perfect for someone wanting to be in the heart of Dublin.",5,2017,10,15
232,Very comfortable,"Stayed here for one night in a standard double room. The hotel is older but has been modernized where appropriate to provide an up to date experience. It was NOT tired, just classic. 

Our room was small but entirely functional and the bathroom was larger than average and beautifully appointed. All very clean and crisp.

Breakfast definitely worth enjoying!

I’d go back, we paid ~$250 for a Friday night, which was way less than the ‘brand’ hotels and made for a good compromise on price and quality. 

Would go back without question.",4,2017,10,10
232,"Old world charm, great location, but a few drawbacks","Pros:
-Next to shopping, transport, cash points, and plenty of restaurants. Oh, and most importantly -COFFEE! Cafe Nero is steps around the corner on O'Connell, and Esquires run up and down the street
-I had two different rooms. The first was as perfect as I could ask for in the price range, with the second room nearly identical but less ergonomic layout in bathroom (TP behind and above your right shoulder) and less power outlets
-Zippy elevator
-Front desk staff friendly and helpful, and even let me in my room at 12:30pm the second stay
-I never saw a dirty spot in the entire hotel
Cons:
-Only negative I noticed was the loud noise from private functions on the first floor. This would be very loud until 11pm or 12am. I wasn't too bothered as I had to be up at 1am anyway for medications. Note: I didn't hear it from the 5th floor, only from the 3rd floor. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel for location, friendly staff, and the overall classic feel. A haven from the crowds of O'Connell Street.",4,2017,10,09
232,Anniversary Weekend,"Stayed here from Sunday to Wednesday for our wedding anniversary. Stayed for 1 night in June so knew what to expect. Fabulous location with Luas tram stop outside. We had the same room as in June. Comfortable,  with the addition of a safe and fridge. It is a little old fashioned which I like. Breakfast is included in the price and what a choice you get from full Irish to continental . Something to suit everyone. The only complaint I had was the breakfast I ordered on the three mornings I was there was never what I asked for even though the waiter wrote the order down. I did eventually get the one I ordered. The only other complaint was the White  bread to toast on Monday morning was mouldy ( this should never happen in a hotel of this standard). It was removed and replaced when this was pointed out to the restaurant manager. Would still use again as it is so central and easy to get all sorts of transport in and around Dublin . Also central for visiting local attractions.",4,2017,10,06
232,"Great location, helpful staff","Very nice room and very helpful staff. It was not clear that the hotel has some (limited) parking so we parked at a nearby garage. The next day, hotel staff went to the lot, picked up my car, and parked it in their garage. When it was time to leave, they drove the car to the front of the hotel and helped load my luggage.

The breakfast was quite good and cooked to order. Dining room staff was most efficient and accommodating.",5,2017,10,06
232,Charming old hotel with wonderful staff,"We arrived at before 9am.  Front desk said rooms were not ready before 2pm.  So, we agreed to have some breakfast at the hotel and wait.  We were really tired and my husband was disable and needed rest.  I asked front desk if we could use any room with additional day-use charge.  The lady saw our condition and talked to the manager and let us check into our room 4 hours earlier.   It was very nice of them to do that.   Room was very clean, European size, though.   The breakfast was excellent.  Nice courteous staff, elegant setting.  Full Irish breakfast was good to your eyes and stomach.   Vegetarian option was really delicious, too.    All over nice experience.",5,2017,10,05
232,Great old fashioned charm in excellent location ,"Very charming old style hotel in a really excellent central location. Pleasant, helpful staff and freshly cooked to order breakfasts. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and would definitely stay again. Give it a try. ",5,2017,10,03
232,Great location and pleasant stay,"My husband and I stayed here for only one night. The location is perfect - easy to access by bus from the airport and within walking distance to everything we wanted to see (St. Stephen's Green, Dublin Castle, Temple Bar, Trinity College, etc.). The room was very clean and breakfast was good. The only con for me was the price. I didn't feel like it was worth the cost we paid, but it looks like that's normal for hotels in Dublin close to the City Centre. No complaints on the room though.",4,2017,10,02
232,Pleasant stay,"I viewed this hotel online and was immediately impressed with its unspoilt historical architecture. In particular, I wanted to identify with the depiction of Dublin represented by James Joyce in his book 'Dubliners.' From that aspect, this hotel certainly didn't disappoint.  The chandeliers, mirrors etc., are stunningly beautiful and reflective of a bygone era. Again, the dining room creates an atmosphere that transports you back to a time when service was at its utmost, where waiters/waitresses attend your table. The full Irish breakfast is very tasty and starts the day well after a very comfortable sleep - enhanced by the quality guiines served in the hotel bar of course!
All of the staff were exceptional and a special mention to Roberta, front of house who made us feel so welcome. 
Well done to the General Manager who is to be congratulated on his excellent staff team.
I urge anyone thinking of a visit to Dublin to consider a stay at 'Wynns,' you wil not be disappointed.

232,Nice Place & Great Brekky,"Stayed here for a short 2 night business trip into Dublin and glad i did.  Rooms are decent size and nicely appointed.  Breakfast was excellent with very good service.

I only used taxi's and my feet but it is right no tram lines so access via public transport would be easy.  

Its not the upgrade massive room i am used to in Marriott's but appreciated this for what it is.",4,2017,09,28
232,Wonderful Landing Spot for Jet Lagged Americans,We were delighted with the gluten-free breakfast!  The staff took great care to understand our dietary restrictions for Celiac Disease and we never had a problem.  The hearty Irish breakfast kept us energized until late afternoon.  The coffee is delicious so we lingered in the beautiful dining room next to the enormous windows. The hotel was very clean and rooms were well equipped. The marble bathrooms were a luxurious treat as were the comfortable beds. ,5,2017,09,27
232,Very good stay,"Stayed in a twin room with my 23 year old son. Had limited expectations but have to say that we were really pleased with the hotel. Room and bathroom were on the small side but perfectly formed.  Very comfortable beds, smart bathroom and soft furnishings and absolutely spotlessly clean. 

Location is perfect too.

All the staff were great and very friendly; from checking-in, to breakfast, to the room staff to the bar.  Breakfast was very good. David and the other guys in the bar were very friendly and helpful.

The only strange thing was the large window in the bar with polystyrene behind it and very bright lighting - still, not really an issue.

It's hard to find that the hotel has a gym, but it does and its fine.

Also the a/c in the room was unexpected.

We'd definitely stay again. Thank you guys!",4,2017,09,27
232,Old fashioned luxury,Yes there are some areas that could do with a freshen up but the bedroom we stayed in was large clean. lovely Jacuzzi bath and a fridge in the room. Nice old style luxury and service. Eggs benedict for breakfast perfect and served with style. Would recommend and will be back hopefully,4,2017,09,27
232,"nice hotel, terrible room","Stayed in a single room with a brick wall 3ft from my windows. The extractor fan for the kitchen was right under the window so I couldn't leave it open. I came back late to my room and there was a strong smell of garlic in the room from the kitchen. It was so late I just went to bed. There were no tea or coffee facilities despite being advertised. The breakfast was a bit of a small effort, at Dublin prices I should at least get 2 sausages!!! I've stayed there before and I realise it's an old hotel but it seems like the quality is going downhill.",3,2017,09,26
232,Very good location and friendly staff,"Our room was very nice, except that it was very hot during the night. If I remember correctly, the room window does open, however the street outside was very noisy. So to let in the cool air from outside, we would have heard a lot of street noise. 
The location of this hotel is EXCELLENT! We spent most of our time on the other side of the river, but its literally a five minute walk to the other side. All of the staff at this hotel were extremely friendly, they will go above and beyond for anything you need. I am sure that if we had told them about our hot room they would have tried to do something about it. The breakfast is included in the room rate, so be sure to go down during breakfast time and fill up. The breakfast is very good, when we checked in they made sure to tell us that Wynn's has the #1 breakfast in Dublin and 3rd best in all of Ireland. 
In our room at least, the water pressure in the shower was so high that the shower head popped off the holder and flew across the bathroom, more than once. So be on the lookout for that!
I only gave it four out of five just because it was the most expensive hotel we stayed at during our time away. Unfortunately though it was about the average price for Dublin. We were charged $455 USD for two nights. Just be prepared for this when you are planning how many days to stay in Dublin, as it was a big dent in our budget for our trip. However, this was really good accommodation in Dublin, even if it did make my credit card cry a little bit!",4,2017,09,23
232,Tired hotel in a busy location,"Wynn's Hotel is an old hotel that needs a bit of refreshing.  Everything looks tired and worn, including the beds.  Be aware that a double room may be a double bed, not a queen.  The location is excellent BUT very noisy!  You cannot sleep without earplugs as you will hear the trains, cars and people all night long.

The breakfast is adequate but not spectacular.

However, the front desk staff are very friendly and helpful.

All in all, I would not choose this hotel again.",3,2017,09,20
232,"great, central dublin hotel","if it's your first time in dublin, i would definitely recommend this hotel. centrally located with a great staff. we arrived a little early and they held fast to their 3pm check-in time (down to the minute) but were more than happy to store our luggage while we explored the city until check-in. rooms are of average size but makes sense because the hotel itself appears to be older with beautiful architecture inside & out. almost has a museum feel to it. lovely restaurant with a great full breakfast. would def stay here again. ",5,2017,09,15
232,"Unbeatable location, good value for money","Stayed here for 3 nights, 2 nights in a single room, the remaining night in the James Joyce Suite. I normally stay at The Gresham, but found it to have become overly expensive since it changed ownership. So I was looking for a similar  hotel on O´Connell Street. Having never stayed at Wynn´s before, I wasn´t sure I would like it, as I always considered it to cater mainly for an older generation, and certainly most of the guests were a good deal older than me ( I´m a mere 46!).  The location is fantastic, right in the heart of Dublin, and very easily accessible by Airlink coach from Dublin Airport. You can walk everywhere. Obviously, there is going to be a certain amount of noise at night, given the location, with the Luas line right outside, but it didn´t spoil my stay; it is to be expected in such a central location.  The single room was compact, but cosy and comfortable. The James Joyce suite has bathrobes, an decorative electric fire, which to be honest was not really to my taste, and a large jacuzzi-style tub. A complementary minibar would have been nice. The staff are hardworking, friendly and conscientious. The hotel is spotlessly clean. The breakfast room oozes history. It is so elegant, with high ceilings and beautiful lamps. There is a basic continental buffet on the counter next to the open plan kitchen, where one got the feeling that some kitchen staff were not ´morning people´, and a choice of made-to -order hot dishes from the menu, served to your table with toast, tea/coffee. The breakfasts were very good, with a fine selection to choose from, and there was no problem making special requests .  An unfortunate aspect of breakfast dining at the hotel, which the staff cannot be faulted for, is the inevitable queue for tables, which stretched out into the lobby on all mornings. As the lobby area is small and quite cramped, and some of the waiting guests were doing their best to appear aggrieved and exasperated, this created a somewhat stressed atmosphere, which might be easily avoided if the hotel made use of the dining area  the bar. Even though I didn´t really feel that this hotel was ´my´kind of place, I would definitely stay here again, as I feel it is very good value for money.",5,2017,09,14
232,Worth a stay for its location and charm,"I stayed at Wynn’s Hotel for 2 nights. The hotel is easily reached from/to Dublin airport by bus. Has a historic charm and style. 
The hotel is situated in a central location, off the O’Connell Street and close to Abbey Theatre, which mean a degree of city noise. I recommend asking for a rear room. Although my room had no view, it was quiet. Room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was very good. 
A good base to explore Dublin, especially its Northside.  All touristic attractions are easily reachable by foot. 
I had a very comfortable stay.",5,2017,09,11
232,Excellent accomodation close to all ammenities,Excellent location rooms small but clean and comfortable but noisy if you left your window open we were on the 5th floor Staff very friendly and good selection for breakfast and well presented you could walk to everywhere about 10 minutes to ther temple area and only 5 minutes to shops,4,2017,09,11
232,Perfect Location Great Hotel,"Stayed at this wonderful hotel for 2 nights with my husband for his birthday. Staff are fantastic everyone was just as friendly as the next, lovely people. The food is amazing we eat one evening in the restaurant, I would highly recommend eating here, great value for money and the breakfast menu has a great variety of choice. The hotel is very clean. The Double room was a reasonable size, beds were comfy, great view also (thanks for meeting our request). You really are in the heart of Dublin when you stay in this hotel my husband and I would highly recommend this hotel, I will defiantly be back to stay here again",5,2017,08,31
232,Quality in the heart of Dublin,"We stayed at Wynnes for two nights and were happy with the hotel's amenities. The rooms,were a good size and bathrooms had a good strong shower. The staff were all friendly and very helpful. 
We ate in the lounge on both nights and the bistro-style meals were generous and well priced. Breakfast was a real treat with a good full breakfast menu and a very good continental breakfast option. The surrounding in the Playwright room, where we had breakfast, was a lovely room in which  to have our meal.
They parked our car for us in a near by multi-story car park and retrieved it for us. 
The hotel is right in the middle of Dublin, close to the hop on- hop off buses and just across the river from Temple Bar. However it can be noisy on the street below until very late at night.",4,2017,08,29
232,Code required for toilet access,"Having been recommended to the Wynn's Hotel, as a place to visit for pleasant surroundings and beautiful afternoon tea, we visited today.

Despite the staff being terribly busy, we were welcomed into a bright spacious room for afternoon tea and carvery. The food experience was lovely. However, before we left, we needed to use the 'little girls room'. 

The WC is not located at the same level. Having checked with reception the availability of a lift to take us to the lower ground to avail of the WC facilities (as we had luggage), we were advised that we could use the lift. 
We used the lift. However, as we tried to gain access to the WC, we were unable to gain entry!!!!
A SIGN DISPLAYED THAT A CODE MUST BE INSERTED WHICH COULD BE FOUND ON A RECEIPT.

At no time, were we advised that this was the case. We had not kept the receipts from our multiple food and drink purchases. We only gained access as another patron exited the WC.
A HUGE INCONVENIENCE!

Furthermore, out of only,two available WC, which serviced this communal area, only ONE was working. Needless to say, a queue formed ridiculously quickly. 

Having enjoyed such pleasurable surroundings in the room above, the WC area was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT, INCONVENIENCE AND QUITE BIZARRE!
Patrons should be advised on arrival should they require access to the WC,that they must have their RECEIPT, to ensure easy access to the bathroom.Maybe it's time to reevaluate this policy. In such a competitive economic climate, it seems rather strange to hinder or impede legitimate patrons from a necessary bodily function.",3,2017,08,26
232,In the Heart of Dublin,"Tastefully decorated older hotel, location perfect, staff very friendly and helpful, amenities in rooms good, breakfast very good. Small complaints: room small, twin beds hard, pillows even harder, super small shower, but all not that big of a deal. What was a big deal was the location of the room, which was right on Lower Abbey, which was really noisy all day AND all night. Window closed helped, but then no air, no A/C, so room stuffy and warm. They did supply fan, but had to leave window open to get air to circulate.",4,2017,08,25
232,Lovely place to meet,Being on a cruise which included Dublin we met my sister at Wynn's hotel for lunch. The staff were friendly and efficient. The food was of a good quality and considering it is the centre of Dublin the prices were very reasonable. We would definatly go there again,5,2017,08,24
232,Enjoyable one night hotel in the heart of Dublin.,"We arrived just after 2pm as the email we received(from Wynns website) said check-in was at 2pm but on arriving we was informed  that check-in wasn't until 3pm. The kind receptionist told us we could leave are bags with her come back at 3pm, after we was told this the receptionist told us are room was ready which was great.

The room we was put in was near the corner where they laus sounded it's horn which wasn't a nice wake call just after 6 am. 

Nice hotel would ask for a room at the back away from the laus if your a light sleeper. Room was very nice and clean,only drawback was the jacuzzi in the bathroom was hard to stand under the shower for me as I had to bend down  to get my hair wet.",4,2017,08,24
232,old time charm - and size,"After an initial blip over booking (my fault but reception was accommodating), got to our room.  double bed and still tight. the bathroom was tiny and the shower was not for taller folks.  still - the included breakfast was well organized and delicious (the black and white puddings were not well done). the hotel is really well located to walk everywhere.",4,2017,08,22
232,A staple of Dublin,Great breakfast served in a lovely room. Rooms are of a good size and always clean. Definitely an 'olde worlde' feel which I absolutely love. Very pleasant staff. I stay once or twice a year. Will continue to do so. ,5,2017,08,22
232,Enjoyable break,"We stopped here 2 nights in mid August.
The hotel was built in 1845  but has been updated / modernised  to meet modern day needs.
The room was clean and tidy (ours didn't have a view - didn't bother us as we spent most of the time touring the city)
Staff were friendly and helpful.
We were fortunate to utilise a nearby car park during our stay (2  mins down the road) - with whom the hotel have an agreement- so it cost us nothing.
Breakfasts served from 07.30. Got busier after 08.00.
A good variety of breakfasts available- cereals, fruit, pancakes, pastries, full Irish , eggs benedict.
The hotel is in the heart of the city - just off O'Connell st and is in easy walking distance of most of the city's attractions.
Definitely recommend this hotel. ",4,2017,08,21
232,super meeting place,"lovely old ""world hotel"" It's being there all my life. had a lovely carvery lunch there, and enjoyed the athmosphere of Wynns. prices good for city centre hotel. €13,99 for plated main course, lovely roast lamb, so tender. €18.50 for Restaurant two course, sorry we did not opt for service. good service, nice friendly staff, coffee served to your table, very easy location. always a great place to meet with friends, and easy access.",4,2017,08,17
232,Staff Excellent; Room Hot!,"Stayed in this hotel for only one night.  It is handy to the river and O'Connell Street.  The staff was exceptionally friendly and welcoming.  We also had a very nice breakfast with several cooked options.
The hotel is older, but charming in many ways.  Our room, however, was inexplicably hot.  It was much hotter than the hallway, other areas of the hotel, or even outside.  The hotel had a/c which seemed to work for a bit, but then didn't.  Unfortunately, the windows only opened a couple of inches.  It started out not too bad, but got progressively worse.  If we had been staying another night, I'm sure the hotel would have seen to the a/c, but we didn't want to call anyone in the middle of the night.",3,2017,08,16
232,Historic hotel,"Stayed 3 nights, breakfast fantastic choices for all. Room and bed very comfortable and easy to get around Dublin. Close to temple area and the river Liffey. Are hereby on evening, carvery excellent value. Our room had a jacuzzi bath, very welcome after a day's walking. Lot's of beautiful rooms from the 20's and centrally positioned. ",5,2017,08,15
232,Fantastic Hotel,"Absolutely loved this old hotel. We arrived at 5:15 in the morning and hotel personnel offered coffee and conversation. Every morning we had an early tour planned, they ensured we had a Continental breakfast each day no matter what time. On other mornings full breakfast was made fresh individually and was fantastic. People friendly, helpful and went above and beyond. Fantastic location. Definitely revisit this beautiful city of Dublin and Ireland",5,2017,08,12
232,Return to stay EVERY year,"Wynn's is an absolutely excellent hotel to stay in. My daughter and I stay there every summer for a few days when down in the city shopping. The staff are exceptionally helpful - a special mention must go to Roberta, the receptionist. She is absolutely superb. The rooms are always immaculate and the food is wonderful.
The location of the hotel is really quite perfect - The Luas stops just outside the front door.
I would award this hotel the full 5 stars.",5,2017,08,08
232,Great spot,"When I visit home with family I always pop into Madigans on Abbey street for a pint with wife as she insists on trying a guinness everytime we come over but alas we had a pram this time and Madigans was packed so we popped across the road to Wynns, pints were lush and service impeccable as was the hotel. Steeped in history the Irish Volunteers were formed here in 1913. ",5,2017,08,06
232,fantastic service and a warm welcome,"we spent one night in this lovely hotel, from the moment we entered, we were greeted with a warm and friendly welcome from the wonderful lady on reception. her name is Roberta, and she made us feel as if we were royalty !
what a lovely person, who is an asset to the hotel, we got a great room looking out onto Abbey street, it was furnished beautifully, and it was spotlessly clean. the whole hotel was so clean, we remarked about it to the staff at breakfast too, as I dont remember when I stayed in such a clean hotel ! the breakfast was fabulous, and the staff were second to none, I cant say enough good things about this gem of a hotel, right in the centre of Dublin !!!",5,2017,08,05
232,Very nice!,"Great location. I arrived with the train at Heuston Station and took the red line tram directly to the hotel. The next day I only had to walk a few hundred metres to the airport bus. Great! The staff was extremely nice. I had requested a bath, and the woman at reception had made sure I got one. Breakfast was really nice, and the waiters charming and funny. I will definitely stay here again.
On the downside: Wifi never worked, and there was quite a lot of noise from the street.",4,2017,08,05
232,Very Good Service. ,We had a one night stay in a very comfortable and clean room - at back so not a good view.  The hotel is well decorated and style befits its history. Staff very helpful and friendly. We enjoyed a lovely full breakfast from a wide range of choices.  Hotel could not be better located - ten yards from O'Connell Street and a tram stop just feet away from door of hotel. The Dining Room is lovely and bar has a good feel and serves good food. One negative point- there is no lounge to to sit around in other than the bar which can be busy. Overall a great hotel if a little expensive. ,4,2017,08,03
232,Really Good Hotel and Service,"The hotel has very high standards when it comes to premises and service. A special thanks goes to Claire, for helping us out with the bookings and check in. Even going the extra mile by supporting us with info related to Dublin.",5,2017,08,01
232,Wynn's Was Perfect for us,"My husband and I spent our first two  nights in Ireland at the Wynn's Hotel on Lower Abbey Street in Dublin.  The staff was wonderful, the bed was comfortable and the ""full  Irish breakfast"" delicious!  It is a lovely old hotel in a perfect location, with both a restaurant and bar.   No taxi is needed to get everywhere you would want to go!  Close to Trinity College and O'Connell street shopping, pubs and restaurants.",4,2017,08,01
232,Great location and old world charm,"Traditional hotel in a great location just off O'Connell St, by the LUAS (tram stop) and minutes from Connolly station (DART services out to Malahide/Bray/Howth etc).  Great bar, free Wi-Fi in rooms...traditionally serviced.  Nothing to dislike about the hotel at all.  Was expensive for the night EUR187, but I put this down to U2 playing in town and all hotels were charging high prices.  Nice traditional breakfast the next morning.  Tip for visitors to Dublin, buy a Leap card at Dublin Airport.  For EUR19 I got unlimited bus (including airport transfer), LUAS and DART services...well worth the money if you are travelling around using public transportation, though Dublin is a great walking city.  Recommend Malahide for a upmarket seaside village and Bray to the south of Dublin for a more traditional seaside resport",4,2017,07,31
232,Great city centre conference location,"Minutes from O'Connell Street, Wynn's Hotel is a great, city centre location for business meetings, conferences and training events. The historic hotel provides a charming and welcoming working environment. The friendly staff team are very accommodating and professional. Lunch is excellent and the venue is accessible by all forms of public transport.",5,2017,07,31
232,OLD AND QUIANT,from the moment we entered this grand old building we were welcomed efficiently by the reception staff the breakfast was 5 star in a beautiful dining area  the room was small and had a musky smell i think due to the age the location was perfect in walking distance to everywhere which you need as the traffic in the city was pretty hectic however tram stop right out front i would definitely stay again,4,2017,07,30
232,"""Great hotel with excellent staff!""",We recently stayed at the Wynn's Hotel and we were very pleased.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  Our room was clean and comfortable.  The free breakfast was delicious and there was lots to choose from- both hot and cold items were available.,4,2017,07,24
232,Lovely historic hotel wih excellent service and staff,"Wynn's Hotel never fails to please. This historic hotel is steeped in Irish history, yet the updated rooms are very comfortable. The breakfast which was unremarkable before has been revamped to a delicious spread. The fresh squeezed orange juice is delicious! The staff remember us from visit to visit and it certainly feels like a home away form home. A safe, comfortable, gracious place to stay in Dublin.",5,2017,07,19
232,Noisy and older clientele,"We stayed here for 2 nights in July - comfortable, friendly staff, good location. However, since there is no AC we had our windows open and I had to use earplugs for sleeping - our room faced the main street and there is a light rail train that stops right in front of the hotel. Breakfast was included which consisted of a continental breakfast AND order off the menu. We had to try the full Irish breakfast one of those days. They seem to be short staffed as we had to wait for a table to be cleaned both days. This seems to be a popular hotel for tour buses with older clientele. We are in our early 50's and we were the youngest people in the lounge one evening. It was our most expensive stay in Ireland but all hotels in Dublin seem to be pricey.",3,2017,07,16
232,Old World Hotel in the centre of Dublin City,"Location is excellent as the Luas stop is directly outside the door. The hotel is just off 
O'Connell St, ideal for shopping, sight seeing or business. The hotel is in existence since 1845 and retains many of its old world qualities. Its an ideal central location for social or business meetings. The double room was quiet and peaceful with a good shower and tea making facilities. The bar food was very good and good value. A most enjoyable stay.",5,2017,07,14
232,A very nice breakfast!,"It was only a 24 hour trip to Dublin for a concert and after reading various reviews for the Wynns Hotel decided to book and I wasn't disappointed. We had a double deluxe room which was clean and spacious, the bathroom was very nice too. The staff were all very friendly even when we wanted a beer after getting back late, the breakfast was excellent although didn't go for the full fry up but it looked very good. Nice place to stay.",4,2017,07,09
232,Great Hotel ,"Generally a fantastic hotel, great links to transport and fantastically friendly staff. Breakfast was lovely as was the evening meal. 

The only down points was having to chase staff for enough towels and to sort the safe. The safe didn't get sorted out, and the towels although sorted on the first night the second night they had removed them again.

Rooms were a decent size and the beds were reasonably comfortable.",4,2017,06,30
232,"Great location, helpful staff, but noisy!","Our room overlooked Abbey Street, which is noisy at any time of day or night. Since there is no air conditioning and fans are also non-existent, the only solution to the stuffiness of the room is to open the window, which lets in the noise of the street, including screaming late night revelers. The shower didn't work properly, but housekeeping staff sorted it out for me. Food in the dining room was good, and breakfast was excellent. Location is ideal, but I do wish there were fans in the room to cool it off without letting in street noise!",3,2017,06,27
232,"Good location, clean and friendly","We had a one night stay for a recent concert and like the idea of staying close to the centre, this is an ideal location. The hotel is old and maybe needs a little upgrade but nothing that would put me off coming back. No aircon would be my only concern in summer  but old sometimes work quite well, traditional key that opens the door unlike many cards that don't, light switch that turns the lights on nice and bright, I stayed in a London (very expensive) hotel recently and you needed a degree in electronics to light the room, then it was poor. The shower was easy to use and a nice size bathroom. They did listen to my request for a top floor and quiet room, glad as there was a function on and noise on lower floors was expected. Breakfast was great not a buffet but cooked for you, again something I prefer. Overall other than the price, but probably paid over the top with Phil Collins on that weekend very good.",4,2017,06,27
232,Style in the centre of the city,"The hotel has clearly been here for a long time and has retained old-style grandeur with many large mirrors and high ceilings. The regular clientelle seemed to be older, with many of them having afternoon tea and drinks in the large dining room. Breakfast was excellent, and made individually, rather than from a buffet. Room was spacious and quiet. We liked this hotel and will return soon.",4,2017,06,22
232,Good place,"We only stayed here one night. We love the location & the breakfast. It's close to everything an we walked to the castle, museums & library. The room was old but good too. If we come back, we'll stay here again. ",4,2017,06,18
232,Overnight Stay,Stayed here on Thursday night as we were in Dublin to meet a visiting relative for lunch. We had travelled from Coleraine by train. My husband and I were able to check our case in at 10am and  leave it on Friday to collect at 6pm. So on both days we were free of overnight baggage and could enjoy our time without trailing it with us. The hotel staff were lovely and extremely friendly. The room was clean and comfortable and the breakfast was amazing. So good was our stay that we booked another 4 day trip in a couple of months. Really looking forward to our return visit. Well done Wynns Hotel. 3* with 5* service.  Highly recommend and in a wonderful position in the City Centre with the Luas trap stop outside the front door.,5,2017,06,17
232,Fabulous Location,"Stayed one night in this Hotel as an early ""Fathers Day"" present from my daughter.
The location was excellent being literally only a stones throw from O'Connell Street.
The rooms contain all that is needed for the modern traveller ie Tea & Coffee making equipment, Iron and ironing board, hairdryer, flatscreen TV, free wifi, comfortable beds and modern en-suite facilities, with a really great shower.
Breakfast is included in the price of the room, and what a breakfast! 
I can honestly say that it beats, hands down, any breakfast that I have had in any hotel that I have visited.
The service was above reproach and the choices were incredible, it is small wonder that their breakfasts have won awards.

The location of the hotel is also hard to beat having a LUAS (tram) stop right on the doorstep, thus cutting down on the need for taxis to get about Dublin.

My wife and I enjoyed it so much I have just made another booking for our wedding anniversary later in the year, only this time we will be staying longer.

For location, service and comfort this hotel is fantastic and I would thoroughly recommend it.",5,2017,06,17
232,Great Breakfast!,"We can in to seek refuge from the cold and driving rain about 10:28am. Breakfast ends at 10:30 but the staff was so gracious and allowed us to stay!  Breakfast was terrific, especially the ham. And the coffee was served piping hot!!",4,2017,06,16
232,Great value at central location,I was a little weary staying at a 3 star rated hotel but I was very pleased with the Wynn. The price was fantastic and my room was SPOTLESSLY clean. The staff was wonderful and I was totally impressed at the job they did with helping us with car park and bags as we were not leaving Dublin until a few hours after checkout time. Our rooms came with a free breakfast in the beautiful dining room and it was not your average continental breakfast but a full homemade Irish breakfast. The bar at the Wynn is also fantastic and the bartender on staff was incredibly knowledgeable about the historic hotel and associated Irish culture. This is a place I highly recommend for budget travelers wanting to stay in city center but a far enough away from Temple Bar so you can relax and get sleep. Check it out!,4,2017,06,14
232,Awesome,Stayed for three nights with a friend. The room was clean and tidy. Awesome breakfast served to tables. Great service both in the reception and at breakfast. Excellent location; easy access from airport and within walking distance to the main sights. At times there was noise coming from the street at night but that didn't really bother me. I highly recommend this hotel.,5,2017,06,13
232,"Amazing hotel, service and staff. ","We stayed at this hotel for 6 days and every day was amazing. The staff was very helpful and friendly. 
The front desk staff, the bartenders, the doormen and the restaurant staff made us feel so much at room. We loved every day of our stay. The room was great. Clean and beds comfortable. Housekeeping did an amazing job. 
Stayed at 5 star hotels all over but this hotel gave me better service and 6 star love. 
They were all so informative on what to do and where to go in Dublin. 
Thank you all at the Wynn for an absolutely great time. ",5,2017,06,10
232,Cenral Location with Great Food,"I stayed here with a group of 25 students at the end of our 10 day tour. The students loved the location, which gave them easy access to downtown Dublin. The breakfast and dinners were included in our stay and both were exceptional. The service at meals was fantastic. The elevators are a bit small, so it takes a while to unload and get the the rooms if you have a group, but the students I was with used the stairs most of the time.",4,2017,06,06
232,No sleep ,"Starting with some positives this hotel is really well located right in the centre of Dublin within easy walking distance of trinity college and temple bar. So recommend for location 5*

Hotel is very dated,  no air con and dublin was in the middle of a heat wave. Not really suited for anyone who prefers modern hotels as decor was pretty tired. Not a problem for us as we were using it as a base and somewhere to sleep. 

Breakfast is ok choice of both hot and continental. 

The main issue we had was with a function which was on in the hotel on the Friday night - the function was on the first floor and our room was on the second floor. We may as well have been sleeping in the same room as the DJ it was so loud. Now we are early 30s pretty chilled out people and we run a bar and nightclub ourselves so we are pretty nocturnal. But this was ridiculous - we were told about the function after we had paid on arrival and were told it wouldn't be a problem. 

We aren't the kind of people to complain. Before going down to say anything we tried sleeping listening to headphones to drown out the music,  but we could hear wham as loud as if they were live in our room. Went down to the front desk to ask when it would finish (2 hours away) we asked for the possibility of a room change - nothing tonight. Then told to speak to the general manager. Person on the desk completely unhelpful. Party finished around 1am we had to get early to travel to slane castle the next day so probably got about 4 hours sleep. The next morning tried to speak to the manager who said because we had paid in advance he couldn't knock any discount off but to speak to the general manager later we explained we would be away from Dublin all day and had an early check out as we were flying at 5am the next day. He gave us a business card to email the GM. 

The next morning when we checked out the night manager / porter wouldn't call us a taxi to the airport (it was 4.30am) told us to go to the taxi rank and showed us where it was. There were no taxis there and had to wait ages to flag one down. Not great service.

We have emailed and I hope we get a response but was a shame that the only reason we needed this hotel - sleep - was not forthcoming. 

",1,2017,06,01
232,Great location ,"Me and my friend have just returned from a long weekend in Dublin, 
We booked Wynn hotel mainly due to the price being the most reasonable from other hotels we had found, due to the prices we had fairly low expectations of the hotel. 
The hotel was very easy to find and a short walk after arriving from the airport on the air coach, upon arrival we were greeted by very friendly staff (shout out to the younger girl on reception who wore the choker.. she really made us feel welcome and always greeted us with a smile). 
The location was fab, short walk from Temple bar and Grafton street, also a tram station is located just outside of the hotel which came in useful! 
The room was clean and tidy, could perhaps do with a refurb as it seems slightly out dated but this was not a problem, loved the jacuzzi bath too! 
Breakfast was lovely, the fresh scones and croissants were great along with the cooked breakfast. I would have perhaps liked a vegetarian option for a cooked breakfast. 
Anyone looking for a reasonably priced hotel in a great location should definitely stay here, I'm sure I'll be visiting again in the future :) ",4,2017,05,31
232,Charming and Central,"I stayed here on the advice of a co-worker who loves this place. The decor has been well cared for with lots of classic touches creating an understated elegance. Service was excellent and the food was good, other than the dull flavour-challenged buffet in the pub one night. The suite I was assigned was clean, with furnishings in good condition and an electric 'fireplace' that added to the pleasant ambiance. The bubble tub was an unexpected bonus and a real pleasure after a busy day of sight-seeing. Wynns compares favourably with other 4 and 5 star hotels in other international locations.",5,2017,05,28
232,"Great location, very traditional","We stayed here to meet some international friends in Dublin. Hotel location was great to walk to all main attractions, right close to the heart beat. Breakfast was very good, staff very helpful and friendly. Our room on third floor was a bit dark, with view on the back alley and we had a bit of noise in the early mornings due to waste collection and glass recycling.  The room was not very spacious and the bed was a standard double which was a bit too small. Luckily the weather was very good so no need to stay long in the room. Hotel kindly stored our luggage on arrival as rooms were not ready that early and also stored for the day before flying home - very helpful!
",4,2017,05,28
232,what a pity,"lovely hotel great food, lunches very good and reasonable full to the rafters every day
its very clean but there always is a but, i went for breakfast last week not after 10.30 fair enough i had slice toast and tea i was shocked €6.20 one can buy a sliced pan for 60 cent some of the lunches are €12 euro so why this price? none the less lovely hotel and luas outside door for all pensioners to come for lovely lunches",3,2017,05,26
232,A classic Dublin hotel,"Not old fashioned but classic understated elegance from an older era. The service was superb, the rooms comfortable, the food excellent. I was in Dublin for a busy thee days, and it was a joy to return to the hotel at the end of a frantic day, to experience the calm environment of a well-run hotel",5,2017,05,24
232,another wedding !!  but a couple nights here before going to wicklow,"WYNNS  is  central near oconnell      rooms are cozy, breakfast very good   small pub in hotel     if coming from dublin airport  take the 747 bus    which will take you right to the corner. cross the street and you are there .  very pleasant staff     get out and walk O'Connell street   follow the river [liffey]      ha penny bridge much to   see  take a hop on off tour bus     pick up  spot opposite hotel !       oh yes  directly across from hotel is a pub ""madigans""        nice spot       one of the bartenders ""sam""  lady,  very nice    enjoy!",4,2017,05,24
232,great stay,"Only stayed one night but it was lovely. Older hotel but full of character. Excellent staff, very friendly and helpful. The gentleman in charge of the parking even walked all the way up the block to where my husband had pulled over so he could direct him to the parking. Delicious and plentiful breakfast. Close to everything.",5,2017,05,23
232,Super hotel in city centre,"What a nice hotel in the very city centre of Dublin. Nicely decorated with old charm. Luxury bathroom with bubble bath. Nice sheets and towels. Very clean room with coffee facilities, iron, fridge, safe. Excellent breakfast served in the old fashioned breakfast room. A lot of choice for breakfast. All super! We can really recommend this hotel with very nice and helpful staff.",5,2017,05,20
232,Old world charm ,I stayed here in April with my wife and all I can say is it's old world charm in a modern era. The hotel manager is a gentleman who couldn't do enough to help any guest. The rooms I must are spotless clean a credit to the house keeping staff. Breakfast is also great with many choices. The location of the hotel couldn't be better for anyone that wants the hustle and bustle of a capital city. There is a bar but on this occasion I didn't go in. So overall all I can say is give it a try. ,5,2017,05,19
232,Business trip,"What a beautiful and very charming Hotel! My room was excellent, clean and nicely decorated. The room also had a safe, TV and tea/coffe facilities. I think i spotted and iron and ironin board too
Staff are lovely and very helpful. 
Breakfast was amazing.
Perfect location slap bang in the centre.",5,2017,05,17
232,Just one night unfortunately,"Super hotel. Old charm combined with tasteful and sympathetic modernisation.
Location second to none. Staff extremely efficient. Breakfast ten out of ten.  Can't wait to stay again.
Highly recommend staying here.",5,2017,05,16
232,An elegant experience,"Our second stay at Wynn's Hotel in Dublin was even better than our memories. Breakfast in the elegant dining room is not to be missed. My husband loves the Eggs Benedict. Wynn's is located in the heart of Dublin, steps from O'Connell Street and the Abbey Theatre. The Luas tram runs directly in front of the hotel. The service is impeccable. Can you tell I love Wynn's?",5,2017,05,11
232,Friendly and well located but poor value ( for this room at least),"Good location just off the top end of O'Connell Street. Helpful and friendly staff.' Old fashioned' in style with comfortable bar and restaurent areas. Breakfast was excellent. The big let down was the room (536) on the 5th floor. We may have been unlucky with the allocation although we had booked several weeks in advance. It was very small with barely enough room to accommodate 2 people. Definitely no space for the 'proverbial cat'.The location of the room in the eaves at the back of the hotel added to the claustraphobic feel. I suspect that the room may often be sold as a 'single'. The hotel was full on both nights we stayed but even in a city with expensive hotel prices, 398euro for 2 nights represents poor value for this accommodation. We visit Dublin regularly and are unlikely to stay again at this hotel.",3,2017,05,08
232,"Centrally located with views of the Spire, friendly staff","I stayed at Wynn's for the best part of the week for a business trip. 

The hotel is just located off O'Connell Street and the main shopping district in the city centre, and is served by the Red line of the LUAS (tram) where there's a stop just in front of the hotel. There are a number of restaurants, pubs, and small supermarkets just around the hotel, which is very handy. There are also many lovely spots for coffee in the neighbourhood for languid afternoons and the fabulous grounds of Trinity College are just a short walk from the hotel. 

I had a room that overlooks Abbey Street with a view of the Spire, which was relatively quiet despite where it's situated. The hotel is in a heritage building and its interior has a certain charm. This also means that certain amenities cannot be accommodated for; go elsewhere if you want a swimming pool, but certainly choose Wynn's if you value authenticity and want to connect spiritually with some important events in Dublin's history. 

Finally, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful at all hours of the day, from breakfast in the restaurant in the morning to later in the evening after the pub. Special thanks to Claire at the reception who offered many interesting tidbits of information and thoughtful advice.",5,2017,05,01
232,Home..,"We had hard time navigating to the hotel by car due to roadworks but as soon as we got in we are settled. All staffs were lovely and so nice, restaurant/pub has great food and nice Guinness pints. Great location as well, you don't need to ride cabbys or car because almost everything is just around. Comfortable bed and shower is powerful! If we are to visit Dublin again we will go back here. ",5,2017,04,30
232,"Great Staff and Location, needs a reurbishment","I chose this hotel due to its location. It was also reasonably priced for a center of Dublin. Rate included a very good full Irish breakfast. 

Rooms are a bit dated and in need of refurbishment. I was also surprised at the difference between the pictures of the fitness center on the website and the actual condition of the fitness center, which was unacceptable.

Staff at the hotel were very kind and considerate.",3,2017,04,30
232,lunch,the hotel was buzzing. l was impresses when l asked about my friends the receptionist was totally au fair with the situation. They are probably in the room at the left and they have checked out of their room. The large room on the left was divided by the bar. The room was packed. l ordered the soup and toasted sandwiches. The soup pepper and green peas was delicious and the toasted sandwiches were well presented and tasty. The service was good and pleasant. My friends found the front of house was noisy at night revellers and city cleaning service. But Wynnes can say that they are catering well for large numbers,4,2017,04,27
232,Great Location. Friendly services.,Great place to stay. Walking distances to almost all sights in Dublin.Good quiet rooms and nice breakfast. Prices could be a little lower. Old building but nicely mantained. Warm welcoming bar with good food and drinks. Breakfast may have some wating  as the restaurant is a bit small.,4,2017,04,26
232,Convenient but noisy,"This hotel has a great location. It's steps away from transit and easy walking distance to everything you want to see in Dublin. During the week days the noise isn't even noticeable. The weekends, another story. It's very loud and noisy. If you need peace and quiet you might want to find another spot. If noise isn't a problem for you then this spot is great. I heard the breakfast is amazing. Unfortunately my mornings were always earlier than the breakfast, but if you let the desk know what time you'll be up they'll have continental ready for you. The staff was friendly and helpful. ",4,2017,04,26
232,Always a pleasant stay,"Our favourite hotel for a break in the city centre & this was another nice stay at Wynn’s.
The usual quick, friendly & informative check in & we were in the lift & on our way to our room within minutes of entering the hotel.
A nice room, decent size, clean, comfortable, very much old style but in sync with the rest of the hotel. Non smoking with a carpet floor, good double bed, tv, wardrobe, iron & ironing board, safe, luggage rack, tea/coffee, smoke alarm & a few electrical sockets. Room temperature was ideal, enough natural light & no issues with noise from inside or outside of the hotel. Wifi was free, easy to connect to & reasonably quick but it did drop a few times during our stay.
Our bathroom was ok, clean, not huge but adequate with bath, bath/shower mixer with enough pressure & plenty of hot water, bath shower screen, shampoo, shower gel, hairdryer, shaving socket, towel heater & plenty of towels.
We popped in to the hotel bar for drinks & it was busy with a great atmosphere. The service was good & friendly.
Breakfast, as usual, was excellent. A great choice with full fry, cereals, porridge, pancakes, yoghurts, scones, croissants, toast, fruit slices, tea, coffee & fruit juices.
The foyer/reception area of the hotel is small so, no seating there or space to relax or have a conversation.
Location is everything with this hotel. Close to Busaras & Connolly train station, metres from O Connell Street, 2 or 3 minutes walk from the shops of Henry Street, 10 + minutes walk from Grafton street & with a Luas light rail/tram stop right outside the front door.",4,2017,04,25
232,Mobility impaired or wheelchair users beware.,"Brought my 86 year old Mum to this hotel to meet family for lunch. She broke hip last year, and uses a rollator. When we got to the entrance of hotel I realised we were facing about 8 steps at the entrance on Abbey Street , with no ramp or side entrance to accomodate, mobility impaired or wheelchair users. The doorman helped to take walker up the steps, but negotiating all these steps on a busy street was not a good experience for my Mum. We had to get a lift to toilets on first floor, but there was no disabled toilet in bathroom. We were later told there was a disabled toilet further down the hall, but we would have to get a key to use it. Given the age of the hotel and elderly clientelle, I expected better facilities for mobility impaired people. Pretty disappointed from this point of view.",3,2017,04,24
232,Exceptional!,"This is an exceptional hotel for the value - location, price, friendliness and comfort. We spent 7 nights in the center of the city and had a great time there. We could walk to everything and it is conveniently located near a tram stop. The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. The full Irish breakfast was included in our room rate and it was superb. They arranged for a continental breakfast on the mornings we had to leave early for day trips outside Dublin. The rooms were comfortable and included everything we could want. The only down side was that there was loud music one night (of which were informed when we checked in) but the ear plugs we always travel with made this not a problem. For anyone who doesn't travel with ear plugs for such use, shame on you! If you want a friendly, convenient and comfortable place to stay that is VERY affordable, this is it!",5,2017,04,17
232,"Great Location, Good Value","Wynn's is in a great spot in the centre of Dublin. If you're interested in theatre it is very close to the Abbey Theatre and a short walk to the Gate Theatre. Our room was clean and well maintained. The beds were comfortable.

Breakfasts were really good. There were several options for cooked food or a continental breakfast. The cooked options were prepared by a chef. As far as I could tell nothing (or at least not much) was precooked and reheated. The staff were great in the dining room. The dining room isn't very large so there was a wait one morning as we came down at a busy time.

There is no grand lobby, but the bar has a lot of space if you want to sit in a public area. The bar also serves food which looked pretty good.

The hotel has function rooms on the 1st floor that are evidently popular for parties on Friday and Saturday nights. This leads to a bit of noise. We checked in on a Saturday and the desk staff made sure we were aware of the party and let us know when it would end (I think it was 1am). From our room the noise wasn't a problem at all.

If you are staying over a weekend it might be worth requesting a room on an upper floor and away from the central stairwell and lift shaft.

Our stay was also very good value. The room rate was not far off a Travelodge but the hotel was much nicer and much more central.",4,2017,04,14
232,A wonderful wedding anniversary visit.,My wife and I stayed at Wynns in celebration of our 10th wedding anniversary. We were greeted warmly and the room on the 4th floor was well appointed and very comfortable. Breakfast was excellent with lots of choice of either traditional English breakfast or continental. Service was good and the staff friendly. The hotel is very central within walking distance of Temple Bar and Trinity College. We would most definitely stay here again. Thank you Wynns for a wonderful stay.,5,2017,04,12
232,Family stay in Dublin.,"We booked two rooms in Wynn's Hotel for Saturday night the 8th of April. The location of the hotel is excellent.  The rooms were a little on the small side but spotless. The breakfast was top class as it was cooked to order by very pleasant efficient staff. The staff in the bar were very helpful,  happy and obliging. However one member of the reception staff's manner left alot to be desired. She snapped at me and was downright rude. Unfortunately she was the first person we met on arrival. She seemed to get pleasure in keeping us waiting for our room. Thankfully a colleague of hers made up for her bad manners and apologised to us when she delivered our keys to us. Well done Claire.",3,2017,04,10
232,Great hotel in the heart off Dublin.,"This is our favourite hotel for staying in Dublin, the location is central with easy access to all off what Dublin has to offer. Rooms are a good size with tea and coffee making facilities, free safe in room, tv with limited channels, the staff are friendly especially the bar staff,good choice of breakfast in the morning. Definitely will return.",4,2017,03,31
232,Cosy and Central,"I stayed here for two nights the room was very clean and comfortable.  Of course it's not overly big, but why would you stay in a hotel room for the evening when you are right in the middle of Dublin? The staff were very friendly and efficient, breakfast was good. Do take ear plugs if you are a light sleeper, there is some tram noise, but the upside is a tram stop right outside the hotel. Straight run to Heuston Station. Will be back.",5,2017,03,28
232,Old Lady of Dublin,"Disappointed sadly with our first visit here. Bigget problem is there is no Residents Lounge so on a short trip in bad weather it was head out or sit in a pretty dreary room.
Had a suite booked but it had a view of flat roofs and noisy extractor fans.
Changed rooms but only a slight improvement and quite expensive.
location though is excellent as indeed are the staff who are both helpful and efficient.",3,2017,03,22
232,Fabulous weekend,"Fabulous weekend.
Bar staff very helpful and even provided table service, with crisps decanted in to a bowl.
Fabulous breakfast with good choice of cooked breakfast dishes,selection of breads.
Would certainly stay again.",5,2017,03,19
232,My favourite place to stay in Dublin,"A clean, comfortable hotel with a great location in the city centre.
The breakfast is cooked to order and is fantastic.
The rooms are small, but have everything you need.
The Luas stop is right outside the door- perfect for getting to the railway stations!!! ",5,2017,03,09
232,Wonderful stay - highly recommend,"We arrived at the hotel late Friday evening. The gentleman that welcomed us in was fantastically accommodating and ran through all that we needed to know about our stay.
There is a real traditional feel to the hotel, which I really enjoyed. We went up to the room and it was phenomenal. Loved the decor and colour scheme. Bathroom was brilliant and the bed was amazingly comfy. Everything that was provided (towels, loo roll, toothpaste, shampoo, etc.) to us was up to a high standard and there was no expense spared. Very impressed. 
The bar area is excellent. Great feel and vibe in there. Very comfortable and the bar staff were awesome.
Our breakfast was definitely a highlight of our stay. Great continental selection and a really high standard. The cooked breakfast was amazing. I couldn't praise it enough. Fantastic ingredients and really well cooked. Loved it.
The best thing of our stay was definitely the staff. They do everything they can for you. So accommodating, polite and they can't do enough for you. They provided us with some really good information so we got the most out of Dublin. We want to really thank all the staff members we came across at the Hotel. Thanks for an excellent time and you'll see us again.",5,2017,03,06
232,"Charming, comfortable, clean and central.","My mother and I stayed here for one night as we were going to a show, and I have to say this hotel blew us away. From booking to checkout and everything in between it was fantastic. The decor is elegant and deliberately echoes the past without being shabby or drab, it's just charming. The staff, especially Roberta at the front desk, were so friendly, courteous and helpful. The hotel emailed me ahead of time to ask whether we had any special requests or requirements, and if we did we just had to let them know and they would do our best to accommodate us. 
The room was immaculately clean and had an electric heater, which meant that if we were chilly we could warm up in no time. My mother often feels cold as a result of a medical condition and so having that in the room was great. I've stayed in other hotels around Ireland where one would not have such easy control over the room temperature. This was an unexpected nice touch.
The lounge and breakfast rooms are elegantly decorated with an historic feel and I really did enjoy having a glass of wine after our show at the residents bar which was so cosy and relaxed. The breakfast portions were generous and a wide selection is available to suit many tastes.

Overall I must say that we had a fantastic time at Wynn's and I'm looking forward to coming back!",5,2017,03,05
232,Brilliant ,"Stopped just one night in Dublin after a concert and had planned to go to a budget hotel, but this hotel with a central location,  excellent transport links, and breakfast included was brilliant value. The building is charming, the room was small but had everything we needed and was very clean, the staff were pleasant, food was good and less than a minute away from the shops, and about 7 minutes from the Academy venue, exactly what we wanted. I have to recommended it. ",5,2017,03,05
232,Weekend away,Brilliant historic hotel with great customer service. Comfortable rooms although a bit small.  Very clean bathroom. Breakfast was apsolutly fantastic. The location is good within walking distance of Temple Bar.,4,2017,03,05
232,Old fashioned ,"Central hotel & excellent service.
We stayed 2 nights, small room but very functional, very good breakfast, free parking, helpfull staff, friendly bar on the ground floor.
I think the average age of guests is above 50 which is not too bad if  you look for relaxed city stay.
We enjoyed our relaxed stay in the Wynns.",4,2017,03,01
232,Central Hotel with old fashioned hospatility,"Wynn's Hotel is very centrally located in Dublin city, within minutes of shopping, theaters, and  a great selection of restaurants.  The room was small but comfortable,  en-suite immaculate, and a wonderful eggs Benedict  for breakfast.",4,2017,02,23
232,Wonderful Stay,"The location is great! Half block off O'Connell St. The LUAS and the hop-on/hop off buses stop right outside the door. The breakfast room is lovely and you can choose from a continental or a hot breakfast.The best part about our experience was the staff. We stayed four nights, and every staff member - reception, housekeeping, wait staff in the pub and breakfast room - were unfailingly welcoming and extremely helpful.",5,2017,02,21
232,First stay in Dublin!,"Our lovely daughter treated us to a stay in Dublin and fortunately for my wife and I she chose Wynn's Hotel. Wynn's Hotel has old fashioned values and I mean that in the nicest possible way. The Hotel was extremely clean and our room was cleaned fro top to bottom after just our first night of a 2night stay. The breakfast choice was excellent and we opted for the ""Full Irish"" on both mornings. I watched a young lad who was working in the restaurant clear and clean a table after a couple left, the table was cleared and everything was meticulously cleaned and the table reset with care ready for the next guests. I do not want to single out any member of staff as everyone was extremely welcoming and friendly. If you decide to stay here I can recommend Room 499 as it has a Jacuzzi bath!",5,2017,02,17
232,Worthy of a repeat visit.,"On the plus side. Great service, friendly staff, clean room, hot shower and a wonderful breakfast.
A hotel with character and style, centrally located in the heart of the city.
The service extended to securing our luggage for the day, while we worked and shopped.
Now for the minus side, unfortunately our stay was limited to 48 hours, but I look forward to staying in Wynns hotel and would unreservedly recommend it.",5,2017,02,16
232,Called in for lunch,"Dropped in for some soup which was really good. It was carrot, potato and basil. 5.25 euros with wheaten bread.
Had good fun guessing Saints and Scholars drawing that are in bar.
Service and craic from Damien and Andrew was really excellent.
Would love to return to stay.",4,2017,02,15
232,Weekend Break,"Stayed for a two night break. Situated just a 5 minute walk over the bridge from Temple Bar. We arrived earlier than expected and staff went out of their way to get our room ready so that we could change for an appointment.  The room was immaculate and had lots of storage space, our bathroom even had a jacuzzi bath. Staff were extremely helpful and the breakfast choice was large and very tasty. We also had carvery in the bar on Sunday evening, again worth every euro. I highly recommend Wynn's and when I return to Dublin I shall be booking in again.",5,2017,02,14
232,mixed feelings,"i liked the hotel and location is great. staff are friendly and helpful too
HOWEVER, the room was like a disco with music and vibrations coming from the club/bar next door. Also could not get wifi in our room but ok in the rest of the hotel",3,2017,02,07
232,Another excellent stay.....,"Annual visit to my home city. With 4 male friends. 
Last year stayed in another hotel that failed to reach the standard of Wynns!
Always greeted by their excellent staff as an old friend.
Bedrooms,breakfast,bar excellent.
Nice calm ambiance.....",5,2017,02,07
232,Grand Hotel in a Great Location !!,"My wife and I travelled from Ennis, County Clare to Dublin for a three day visit. We chose the Wynn's because of it's location and it's history.. We have been to Dublin many times but have never stayed at this hotel.

The room was clean and spacious. The bathroom was large, all tile with plenty of towels and great water pressure. The mattress was very comfortable and the room was quiet even though we faced Abbey Street. The breakfast was delicious.

Now the staff was extraordinary. When you have wonderful people like Nika, Roberta, Ewelina, Paul, and Anna Maria and Trevor in the breakfast area who make your stay more enjoyable, you can't lose.

If you visit Dublin do yourselves a favor and stay at the Wynn's. It's a grand hotel.

232,Way too noisy,"Stayed here last night and we could not sleep due to the noise it was like a disco in the room. We rang to reception twice to complain and i even went down at 2am to complain , they said it was next door and they advised them to turn the music down , this didnt happen. I complained again to reception this morning but no apology from a member of management. Not impressed paying to be kept awake , will not be back.",1,2017,01,22
232,Pleasant getaway ,"Nice charm and atmosphere about the hotel. Staff very pleasant and helpful. It's not a five star and doesn't aim to be, but it is clean and comfortable, and couldn't fault it. Breakfast is good too, and it's spot on for a central city centre break. ",5,2017,01,22
232,Surprize dining in Wynns Hotel,"it had been some years since we were in this hotel and the impression we had was of an olde worlde place, not what we were used to.... however, the experience was fantastic.... their restaurant is beautiful with plenty of space between the tables, the menu was varied and cooked beautifully,  the service was excellent and the wine was also very acceptable......  the price was really reasonable for al carte food served in beautiful relaxed surroundings..... we were not rushed through the meal as in other restaurants and they were quite happy to let us chat over wine after the meal...  highly recommend this little gem in the centre of the city.... we will all be going back........",4,2017,01,18
232,Pleasant,Very central classic hotel. Recently renovated but in keeping with the old architecture. Staff friendly. Breakfast very good. It may not be the quietest as there is a busy street outside including a tram station.,4,2017,01,01
232,Relaxing break,Very helpful staff. Good location. Rooms are very clean with good selection of toiletries and tea and coffee. Some of the rooms do not have very nice out looks from bedroom windows. Breakfast is excellent sets you up for the day.,4,2016,12,31
232,Old World Charm,"I was dubious about this hotel before I arrived as I find old Dublin hotels are usually run down and stuck in the 70's but I can happily say not Wynn's Hotel. 
Beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin city centre which boasts history and charm in abundance. 

Staff were very curtious and helpful throughout my stay. Staying on the fifth floor you have great views of the city yet the alias line outside is not nessecarly loud but does cause a lot of vibrations. I can only assume it's worse on the lower floors. 
Also Wifi speed/connection was quite poor unfortunately. 

Breakfast was wonderful with a varied choice and waiting staff for all your needs in their beautiful dining room. 

I was happy to hear they had limited complimentary car spaces so I could move my car from the multi story for the second night at no charge which was great. I didn't see this while booking. 

Great value for money and highly recommended. ",4,2016,12,29
232,"Old fashioned, customer friendly with great food",Rooms are small but clean.  Breakfast offers great choice and served to your table.  Did not eat lunch just had goats cheese starter which was fantastic.  Bar was full with happy customers that were served with hugh portions of Roast Lamb or Turkey among other items.  Porters are extremely friendly and helpful.   We will be back as location is also good.,5,2016,12,19
232,Old world charm,"Wynnes is perfectly located for visiting Dublin. The hotel retains a lot of its old world charm whilst blending in many ways into the present. Our room featured a Jacuzzi tub which was really appreciated after a tiring days touring and shopping. As we ate lunch and dinner out we can not comment on dining standards other then to say if the crowds dining in the hotel especially at lunch time are any thing to go by the food must be good. We had early breakfast for the three days we were there and found it excellent each morning.
Reception staff are exceptional in there customer care standards. We arrived to hotel at 09am 6 hours ahead of check in time quite prepared to leave our bags but! we could not believe our good fortune when we were told that they had a room which they could check us into near enough immediately. The receptionist in question (alas I cannot recall her name) was wonderful. The same lady checked us in last year when she was equally as gracious.  
Our room was spacious and very comfortable. One very small thing was our safe was not working but for us it was not a real problem as could use safe in our daughters room as we could also have used reception to care for our valuables. 
We hope to return around the same time next year.",5,2016,12,19
232,"""Home away from home""","From the moment of arrival, we could feel their wish to be the home away from home.  The lobby staff really impressed me.  So welcoming and friendly, and remembered us for the rest of our stay - always adressing me with my name.  Great bed and the room as expected considering the age of the hotel.  The menu breakfast is really good.  Our second day the waiter excused himself for not remembering us from the 1st. morning.  Shows they really want to know their customers.

Overall - an excellent stay for a decent price.

Improvement opertunities: 1) Soundproof the windows towards the street. I am a very light sleeper and had some problems the first night (especially when Dubling was waking up on a Friday morning).  2) Needs increased internet capacity, especially during peek hours.  Good enough for e-mail and light browsing, but todays expectations are higher.",5,2016,12,18
232,Restaurant visit ,"Went with family here this evening - food was delicious and well presented - I had the goats cheese in spring roll for starters and had the vegetarian crepe for the main - very filling and delicious - had meringue for dessert - everyone happy with their food - waitress was very friendly and obliging - we didn't stay in Hotel , just had dinner here ",5,2016,12,14
232,Classic Old World Charm,"Stained glass windows adorn this classic old world charm hotel in historic Dublin. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff friendly. The location is perfect, just a step out to the many older pubs and River Liffey. The sitting room downstairs with the open fire and overstuffed armchairs just oozes relaxation. Do yourself a favour if you're ever in Dublin.",5,2016,12,10
232,Very Central,My husband and I stayed here for two nights.  The location is great as it is close to the bus and train stations and the Luas.  A few mins will have you in Henry Street in the heart of the shopping.  The staff were great and very helpful.  My only complaint is we were put in the front of the hotel and the noise during the evening and night was dreadful. Did not sleep a wink.,4,2016,12,08
232,Christmas party,Very welcoming hotel in a great setting in Dublin city centre. Meal was lovey with lots of choice great attention given to people with special diets. Everything very well organised and clean. Fabulous DJ keep the party going strong.,5,2016,12,07
232,Father/Daughter roots tour,"Wynn's Hotel is perfectly located if you intend to walk the city of Dublin. Rooms are spotless & the ladies at the desk are friendly & efficient. Everything you want to see is within walking distance. Trinity College with the Book of Kells, Temple Bar area, Parnell Square & the cathedrals are all nearby. Breakfast is outstanding & included with your stay. The choices are too numerous to list, but are delicious & the coffee is perfect black or with cream. The bar is more an old world sitting area than a ""bar"". A place to sit,relax & make plans for the rest of your visit. A Grand Old Dame Hotel.",4,2016,12,05
232,fantastic weekend,"What an amazing hotel. The BEST  location ever. Really lovely staff ,who made our stay .fantastic.Great breakfast and comfy bed. Cant wait to go again., a weekend wasnt long enough.The hotel is not ultra modern. but you are treated as special guests.",5,2016,12,04
232,Overnight stay,"Good central clean and tidy hotel although maybe ""old style"" but still to be recommended for a comfortable stay within close proximity to Northside or Dublin One - the main retail offer within Dublin. Close to Arnotts - a recently revamped super store that has almost everything.",4,2016,11,27
232,Truly shocking,"i have stayed in truly international hotels the world over and Wynns Hotel, Dublin is the most shocking.  Started off fairly well and deteriorated to a true shocker.  A private function event was being held on the 1st floor - it could be heard up on the top, 5th floor, where i was roomed.  The base beat was thudding for hours and by 11 I headed to bed as I was due up at 6 for a train to Waterford.  By 00.10 the base beat was still thudding and an inquiry at the reception intimated that the event would be over by 01.00 and apologies offered and could the base beat really be heard on the 5th floor?  Night manager Simon came to investigate and agreed that indeed it could be heard and he would ask for it to be turned down. Could the general manager call me in the morning was the question from Simon? Despite this and a further call to reception the base beat continued.  Left the 'hotel' at 01.15 to walk the streets of Dublin in search of a proper hotel where a proper room was available and some sort of sleep.  The checkout and 169 euros that was charged by Simon for the rooom was however very efficient, unlike his attention to the base beat.  Truly shocking experience from an establishment that is happy to take money for your room and also money for a private function that beats on until 01.00.  Depsite not being invited to the party, i centrainly attended the whole event.  Couldn't care less attitude from this so-called 4* hotel - The Westin is a stones throw away from this shocker and based on my previous experience is a proper hotel I shall take my money in the future. Avoid the Wynns Hotel at all costs.",1,2016,11,26
232,Lovely experience,"I stayed in Wynns hotel whilst in Dublin for a meeting .
I have stayed there several times before, and highly recommend it.
The receptionists are exceptionally  good and helpful. 
The bedroom lovely - I got a jacozzi bath this time-smashing! 
Breakfast, served in the charming dining room, was perfect. 
Although it is a little pricey, for the location, and the service, it is lovely.",5,2016,11,25
232,Family gathering,Excellent friendly and traditional hotel. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Provided brilliant service and good food at very reasonable rates.  If your looking for art deco charm the Abbey room is lovely for small gatherings. Wide selection of food served. The restaurant and bar food are also very good value. Can not recommend this hotel enough. One of Dublin city's old gems.,5,2016,11,23
232,great breakfast,"really enjoyed the breakfast, great service and food well done.
Room was ok, bit on the small size but no complaints. Hotel as expected is a little dated, but the room was clean and in good shape. Very central and convenient, if you want to be a bit away from the hubbub then not ideal. There is a tram that goes by regularly during the day and evening, its noisy and shakes the building a little.",4,2016,11,20
232,Quiet and relaxing? Not in this hotel!,"Not cheap, but perfect location, good breakfast, old but charming rooms, BUT: our stay ended up in the most exhausting, unrelaxed and unpleasant stay in a hotel we ever had! Two nights with party and loud music in a way that it felt like having the DJ lying in your own bed. Sorry, but never again...",2,2016,11,20
232,A lovely stay,"We spent a great 3 nights here recently. We booked late and were allocated small but adequate rooms. Yes, the decor is a bit tired but the attitude and great service provided by the staff more than made up for it!
Very good breakfasts set us up for the day and a good bar for a nightcap. Will certainly return to this historic hotel again...",4,2016,11,17
232,Nice eligant place. Great location. Staff couldn't be friendlier.,"Welcoming staff, nice bar, nice street view. My room was small but perfect for what I needed. Staff was great to hang and talk with. Safe area right by the river. Can walk around and check out the scene. Rooms were quite. Recommended",5,2016,11,14
232,.... chose another one!,"Hotel looks on internet but the reality is totally different. This old.not dirty . But too old. The style is old. The bathroom is uncomfortable. A lot of noise. There is a balroom with kind of party until one am... 
the only good point are location and breakfast. The rest is really not not confortable. Chose another one!! ",2,2016,11,13
232,Perfect location,"Stayed at Wynn's for a night, and it has been refurbished since the last time I stayed. It's clean and well decorated. Our room was on the 5th floor overlooking Abbey street. The bed was comfortable and room was spacious. The bathroom even had a hydro/jucuzzi bathtub. Perfect after a long days travelling. 
Breakfast was second to none, the menu was varied with plenty to choose from. At €143 for the room, including breakfast, it wasn't too bad. 
You are right in the centre of everything for shopping or sightseeing. Car parking is available on a first come basis. Thanks to the Porter for his assistance with my parking. A gentleman.",4,2016,11,11
232,Excellent ,"Lovely hotel from the staff to the great food couldn't rate this place highly enough , had a hearty breakfast both mornings , had a sandwich one evening to the room excellent price & beautifully presented . Would be a missed opportunity not to spend a night here , very relaxed lovely bar with carvery until late in the evening , lovely guy parked my car when I arrived and had it waiting on my departure , well done Wynns ",5,2016,11,09
232,Clean Bright and Great Value,"Beautiful old world hotel right in the heart of Dublin. 
Reception is friendly and helpful, even offering to hold our bag until our bus on check out. 
Rooms are bright and spotless, top marks to the cleaning staff. 
Wonderful breakfast on offer with a wide range to suit all tastes. 
Well done! ",5,2016,11,09
232,"Nice place, serious lack of parking","Above average price but a good location and a really pretty hotel. Has a bar and restaurant. They will park your car but you have to park across the street and bring your stuff in but the buses will try to run you down in the same area so that was stressful. Staff was attentive though and the rooms were quiet and clean, yet small. Breakfast was really tasty!",4,2016,11,03
232,Nice place for coffee and a chat.,"We called in here for coffee one evening while waiting for the theatre to open. It was a Saturday evening and the hotel was quite busy. It was warm and cosy inside and I noticed there were a lot of local Dublin people in having a drink; it seemed to attract the 40-70 age range. Staff were friendly.
We had lovely coffee and left after about 45 minutes for the nearby Peacock Stage.
The only downside is its location as the street it's on has a poor reputation and also the LUAS rumbles the area when passing.",4,2016,11,01
232,"Magnificent building, magnificent staff","We began our journey through Ireland in Dublin, staying at this beautiful hotel for three nights.  We chose it based on the many positive TripAdvisor reviews as well as its location, which could not have been more central: just a few steps east of O’Connell Street, close to the River Liffey; a 5-minute walk around the corner to the Airlink 747 bus, which took us to and from the airport; and an easy 10-minute walk directly up Lower Abbey Street to the Dublin Busaras bus station, our departure point for Cashel a few days later.  (We traveled for three weeks in Ireland without a car and were impressed by the convenient bus and train networks, which were on time and very comfortable.)  We found Dublin itself to be a walkable city, and we never took a bus or a cab from one place to another.  We found plenty of good pubs and restaurants within an easy walking radius of the hotel, and we felt safe anytime of the day or night.  Like New York City, Dublin is full of people who are out and about at all hours, so strolling around is a pleasure.

Wynn’s has a lot going for it.  It’s an architectural gem, retaining all the beautiful woodwork, mouldings, chandeliers, marbles, tiles, and stained glass from a century ago.  We opted for a bed-and-breakfast rate which enabled us to enjoy breakfast in the magnificent dining room, where attentive uniformed staff took our orders for hot breakfasts and directed us to help ourselves to anything we wanted, and as much as we wanted, from the extensive buffet of juices, fresh fruit, yogurts, and the most delicious scones and buttery croissants.  There was something for every taste and appetite, and the traditional full Irish breakfast was copious.  A breakfast at Wynn’s sets you up well for many hours of sightseeing.  Often we skipped lunch because we had enjoyed so much good food at breakfast.

We had requested a room on the topmost floor, away from any sources of potential noise, and this request was honored.  Our room on the third floor overlooked a quiet courtyard, and we appreciated the large window which we could open to let in fresh air at night.  The beds were comfortable, and we were surprised to find a Jacuzzi tub in the bathroom!  We never used it, but it could be a welcome retreat for anyone who would want a relaxing hot soak after a day of sightseeing.  The tea tray in the room was a nice touch, too.  The bedroom, the bathroom, the hallways, the public areas… EVERYTHING at Wynn’s is sparkling clean and carefully maintained.

Wynn’s is the only hotel/B&B we found in Ireland with computer access for guests.  There was a coin-operated computer terminal in the hotel’s lower level (a one-euro coin buys ten minutes of Internet access), and I had occasion to avail myself of this service.  I hope that other Irish hotels take note!

Our best memory of Wynn’s is the friendly staff, especially the men and women at the reception desk, who were always smiling, engaging, and helpful.  By Day Two, they were addressing me by name whenever they saw me: a very impressive personal touch!   After our three weeks of touring Ireland, we returned to Wynn’s to spend one night before our flight home the following morning.  When we notified the reception desk that we would have to leave the hotel at 6:15 in the morning, well before regular breakfast hours, the receptionist said that the night porter would open the dining room for us in the morning and that we could have a continental breakfast at whatever time we wished.  Hesitatingly, we asked for 5:45 AM.  “No problem!” she replied as she completed a form to notify the night porter to meet us then.  In the morning, he was standing outside the dining room door promptly at 5:45 and then seated us, brought us our pots of tea and coffee, and even made toast for us as we gathered the rest of our breakfast from the cold buffet.  We are grateful to Wynn’s for setting up this last breakfast for us and enabling us to leave for the airport with full stomachs and the energy to navigate a very busy Dublin Airport until our flight departed at 10 AM.

Thanks to everyone at Wynn’s for a memorable experience.  We hope to be back soon.

232,Did not enjoy this experience at all.,"We visited as a family. We had 2 rooms on the second floor-  albeit not interconnecting which is not ideal when travelling with children. We prefer to be able to access their room without the need for keys. It doesn't feel very secure otherwise. Not good. 

The kids' room with the twin beds ended up being one of the largest rooms on the floor, and had another double in it, albeit their bathroom was tiny. Our room was very small, the decor was incredibly dated. The bathroom was fine. The bed was another double, with a bad mattress. In this day and age, I don't think it's on for hotels to put couples in a room with a standard double bed - it's too small for two people to sleep well. 

I think the entire hotel could do with a gutting and refurb, because it's not up to scratch, particularly if you're spending over 200 euro per night. I wish I'd booked the Jury's Inn. 

The entrance is small, and very dated. Can see the kitchen from the breakfast room through a hatch - bit basic. The breakfast was fine - cooked food tasted quite cheap, but was plentiful and very speedy. The lounge/bar area is what it is; we didn't eat or drink there, so cannot comment on the food. 

The staff were absolutely fine - they all did their jobs well, were friendly and I cannot fault them. It's not their fault the hotel is shabby.

The other irritant was the constant smell of smoke every time you leave the hotel; I know with the smoking ban people need to smoke outside, but they need to remove the ashtray thing from the top of the stairs - maybe mount one to the building wall a few meters away from the entrance, because walking through a fog of second hand smoke, especially when staying with kids, it's just grim. 

All in all, I would avoid this place. I know Dublin is expensive, but this wasn't up to anything. Between the noise, the rubbish bed, and cramped accommodation, I didn't enjoy one moment of time spent in the hotel.",2,2016,10,27
232,"Could be better, staff pull this up to 4/5",Long weekend in Dublin with the husband and booked rather last minute. For price of room (worked out just over £100 per night) we may have expected more than a tired room and a birthday party directly underneath until 1am. We were warned about the party but not bass vibrating the bed and the feeling of being in the party itself. Reception were very good and gave us a different room on the other side of the hotel for the night. From other reviews from that weekend I think we were lucky. Good breakfast and tentative staff to all aspects of our stay. Would stay again but not at the prices we paid.,4,2016,10,23
232,Nice afternoon tea,"A step back in time in Central Dublin. I've had reason to visit this hotel after many many years. I had the carvery lunch the first time and afternoon tea the next. The carvery lunch was very good with a good choice and all of a high quality. Afternoon tea was simple enough affair as i had already had lunch elsewhere and just fancied a cup of tea with biscuits. All served by friendly and happy staff.
This hotel would mainly be frequented by an older generation (like meself!).
Highly recommended.",5,2016,10,21
232,Heritage and location overcome a confused reception,"In the 20 years since my last stay, I had forgotten the huge brass knobs to which Wynns attach their room keys.  As the receptionist dropped it into my hand it felt like assurance of this Dublin institution’s timeless qualities.

Two decades ago the bottom of O’Connell Street was on the skids.  Not so today.  The tram (not yet complete), the new pavements and the Spire all contribute to a central location that is on the up.  Modern Irish history is woven through Wynns; Yates, Connolly and De Velera are among the former habitués. And the resturant retains the grand feel of the 1926 rebuild – the original building disappeared in flames during the Rising.

My room was not large and had a slightly over-decorated feel – embossed gold wallpaper, tasseled lamps and a lavishly patterned carpet.  The reception took ten minutes to untangle my booking, during which time I was several times told that I ‘had no booking’.  And by the time I went looking for food on a Sunday night (around eight) there was none to be had.

Heritage, location and a good breakfast won my heart.  Hopefully it won’t be another two decades before I mingle again with the spirits of poets, scholars and revolutionaries that infuse the old place.  Fingers crossed the weighty key fobs will endure, however many years it takes.",4,2016,10,18
232,"Nice, but could be better","Positive:  hotel is very nice, room decor pleasant, buffet and order breakfast was delicious ( full Irish is excellent). Good location.
Negative:  night noise was awful, facing street and a BD party loud band till 1:30 am was horrible. Windows were filthy and security chain on door was broken.
Summary: this hotel has great potential, but needs better management",3,2016,10,18
232,City centre hotel,"Brilliant location. Excellent, friendly and efficient staff. Comfortable rooms and very good breakfast in period surroundings. Highly recommended. Easy access to main sights and top restaurants, walking distance to historical centre and good transport/taxi links to other areas. Hotel restored in 1926 after uprising and retains that art deco atmosphere.",5,2016,10,16
232,Ideal location,"The hotel is in a perfect city centre location. The staff was friendly, the breakfast was very good as well as the service. It`s nothing fancy and can be noisy on weekend nights. It could use some paint and updating but if you want to be in the heart of Dublin, it`s a good choice.",4,2016,10,13
232,City Centre Hotel,"Just got back after staying for 3 nights. Arrived in Dublin early morning so dropped our bags off until check in. Quite dated so don't expect a Modern Hotel. I can imagine in its day it would have been very grand. Staff very pleasant. We had a room at the front of the hotel on the 2nd floor. They have installed a window screen to keep out the noise which did work as it can be quite noisy BUT the room was so warm with these closed (I can't imagine what it would be like in the summer). Bathroom lovely, Some of the TV channels kept losing signal which was quite annoying, WIFI not bad. Breakfast lovely. Bar, a bit drab but many pubs and bars nearby, Ideal location, would we stay here again - yes we probably would! ",4,2016,10,12
232,"Lovely staff, perfect location","You can't beat the location of this hotel and the staff were incredibly friendly. We loved them! The room was a decent size, lovely decorations, super comfy bed. The bathroom is large and had a nice jazucci bath along with shower. It's worth noting that reception is not 24 hours, although they do have a really great night porter who lets you in after 11 pm. We had no issue with getting in and out late at night though, so it really was a non issue. There's a 24 hour shop around the corner and it's a quick walk to all major points in Dublin for tourism. I highly recommend it and would definitely stay there again.",5,2016,10,12
232,Disgraceful quality. Total rip off,"I realise that hotels in the centre of Dublin are expensive. No problem. But I do expect a minimum standard for this price, and at least comparable with other major cities across the world. So for £670 (€707) for three nights we got a tired, drab, tiny room at the back of the hotel. The windows looked out onto a brick wall. The decor sat somewhere in the 1970's - dark with nicotine stain coloured wallpaper. The bathroom was clean but ancient. Chipped tiles, peeling paint on the ceiling, radiator joints taped up with insulating tape, and a wash basin so small you could not actually fit the kettle under the tap to fill it. No bath sized towels. The lavatory plumbing made a huge clunking noise when flushed - I felt sorry for the room above us. Cheap coffee, and not even a packet of biscuits on the tea tray for our £670! Really?

I complained at reception to receive a very off hand response that they had another room where the occupants had not yet arrived and that we could swap with. I responded that we could not do it straight away as we had to keep an appointment shortly, but would be interested on our return or the next day. We were then completely ignored by the reception staff on our return and never offered and improvement. 

Yes this is an old hotel, and the breakfast room was lovely, but our bedroom was really sub standard. Breakfast was ok. Not much on the buffet but adequate. The Irish cooked breakfast suffered from cheap sausages, but the eggs benectine were really nice.

I cannot recommend this hotel.",1,2016,10,09
232,Business trip,"I had a one night stay in Dublin and all the hotels I usually stay at were booked out, so I tried this because of the good reviews and the reasonable price. 
The hotel itself is a bit dated, but has a very interesting history. My room was very clean and I was pleased to see that my bathroom was not in keeping with the period features of the hotel, but had been updated with a modern shower and tiles, with a build-in hairdryer. 
The TV has lots of channels and I was able to watch some of my own movies using the USB port at the back. The free wifi was not bad and seemed to have a constant connection.
The location of the hotel is very central with a Luas stop directly outside. I know most tourists will not have a car but I was concerned about where to park upon arrival. I was very impressed that the hotel offered a free service for parking and the porter drove my car to nearby safe indoor car park and collected it for me while I was having breakfast in the morning. I have stayed in Dublin many times and have never been offered this service before, and was even more surprised that it was free. 
The breakfast was superb, with a few options to choose from a menu. I went for Eggs Benedict which was cooked perfectly. 
All in all, do not expect the hotel to be ultra modern, but it is a very clean, comfortable stay at a reasonable price in the city centre",4,2016,10,07
232,Reputation is not everything,"Very convenient hotel to go for a drink or two after a good evening at the Abbey Theatre. We had heard it was good.
A great disappointment. The bar was spacious and well furnished but littered with used plates and glasses as was the bar itself. The hard-working barman clearly could not do it all himself. Two members of staff spent the time we were there moving chairs noisily around us presumably for the next function. We finished our drinks as quickly as possible and went out to a nearby pub. That rescued the evening.",2,2016,10,07
232,nice old hotel,stayed in this hotel a few times great history about this hotel friendly staff and great food lovely rooms and the best breakfast I ever tasted luas line just outside the hotel and close to the city centre,5,2016,10,06
232,Look no further!,"I have stayed in Dublin in many hotels and this is definitely the best option. In terms of location you will be in the heart of O´Connell street few steps away from Temple Bar, close enough to walk there but not too close to be disturbed by the lively atmosphere. Staff is extremely friendly and accommodating, few hours there are enough to feel at home. Breakfast is amazing! I do not how many places nowadays give you a breakfast a-la-carte include with your room rate, but not many for sure. Not only that, but the quality is superb, best breakfast ever! Rooms are updated and with all amenities needed, bed super comfy and bathroom spacious and nice. The bar by the front desk will give you the option of enjoying a drink or even a roast beef without leaving the hotel and also a very competitive price! As I said, look no further, best choice to stay in Dublin!",5,2016,10,05
232,This hotel has everything you need to make for a lovely stay in Dublin,"My boyfriend and I came and stayed here for just one night as we had a long layover in Dublin, but we wished we could have stayed longer! To begin, the hotel is right in the center of Dublin -- the ideal location. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, the staff was so friendly and welcoming. The hotel has all the charm of a bed and breakfast with all the amenities of a nice hotel. As for the room, it was spacious and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable, and we slept wonderfully after a long day traveling. Finally, and what really puts the icing on the cake for this lovely hotel, is the delicious, hearty breakfast that is included in your stay. I could not believe that such a nice breakfast was included. There were multiple options to choose from (we had the full Irish breakfast and the vegetables with focaccia bread, both delicious) plus a buffet. Highly recommended!",5,2016,10,05
232,A fantastic hotel   A pleasure to have stayed there,"All the staff were very professional and extremely helpful and very friendly.
The food was first class.  The breakfast was superb. 
Our room on the 2nd floor even though it was at the front of the hotel and right onto a busy street was very quiet and very clean
We were only at the hotel 2nights but I cannot recommend it enough.
Well done to all the management and staff the hotel is run like a well oiled machine.",5,2016,09,30
232,Well situated hotel with friendly staff,"Room was very good. We got a room at the 5th floor (top level). Room well equipped and maintained. Staff was very friendly and informative. Breakfast excellent. Location of hotel is very good, at walking distance of most of the interesting spots in Dublin. Only thing that is against the hotel is the fact that the tram generates a bumping noise when it passes the hotel.",4,2016,09,30
232,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed for 3 nights at this hotel on our ever first visit to Dublin. We were not disappointed. Staff and service, the best we have ever experienced. Super location in quieter area but just a short walk to all the shops and bars. Great traditional hotel. Would recommend.",5,2016,09,29
232,Cute hotel ,"The hotel is a bit dated, if you wish to stay a modern design hotel this will not be your cup of tea. It feels like being back at your grandma's house. The rooms are clean, nice breakfast. Food is good and for a very reasonable price. Staff friendly and helpful. I will definitely come back here when I'm in Dublin next.",4,2016,09,29
232,Great location,"If you want to be in the centre of Dublin near the shops then this is for you.
It could use a little updating ,the rooms especially but it's clean and has windows that open (old fashioned air con)in our room there was a small cupboard to hang your clothes and had tea and coffee with kettle and safe but could of done with the door being removed as making a cuppa takes some organising.
Not sure I'd returned as it was quite expensive for what you get but the breakfast is cooked to order and the staff were friendly and helpful.",4,2016,09,28
232,A Super Stay,"What a lovely experience it was to stay in this old style hotel. A fantastic city centre location with super service and an old style courtesy - and best of all, a wonderful breakfast that set us up for the day. The building is an historic one, dating to 1845, and it has wonderful features that are missing in other the bland 5 star hotels. A big thank you to Wynn's Hotel... we'll be back!!",5,2016,09,26
232,City Centre weekend stay,"An old fashioned gem in the city centre. Attentive friendly staff who remembered your name. The birthday card in my room was a lovely touch. Location very central for shopping, buses, trams and direct bus to airport. The food was of a very good standard and no rushing you out of the dining room.",5,2016,09,23
232,Would definitely stay here again!,"I stayed here for three nights whilst attending a conference. The majority of the staff could not have been more helpful, particularly the waiter at breakfast, who remembered what I had eaten on the first day, enquiring whether I would like the same on the subsequent days (which I did!). The other person who was particularly helpful was the receptionist who asked how I was in the morning and proceeded to change my room immediately when I said I had not been able to sleep - I think it was the smallest room in the hotel with very liitle air. It was an extremely warm day and I had to keep the fan going, that they provided earlier when I had mentioned the overpowering heat and lack of air, all night. The next two nights were very comfortable and I would definitely return to Wynn's if I was staying in Dublin again. It was lovely to find a family run hotel, which has so much history attached to it, retaining such great hospitality. Thank you.",4,2016,09,23
232,City Center,"Wynn's Hotel is centrally located in Dublin. Walking distance to many places of interests. Very busy city. Older hotel, smaller rooms, but nice. Reception was very friendly.  Nice Hotel bar and restaurant.",4,2016,09,19
232,Spotless ,"Was bought a surprise weekend away in Dublin and this was the hotel booked. 
I must admit, looking at pictures online beforehand i was a bit anxious of the dated interior but this made the experience all that more special.

STAFF 10/10
The staff here were unbelievably friendly, ensuring we had everything we needed when we arrived and made us feel very welcome. 
Due to the room keys being quite heavy (see attached pictures), they allow you to keep them behind the reception desk whilst you go out so you're not having to carry it round. 
We arrived at the hotel at approx. 8am but check in isn't till 2pm. They allowed us to leave our bags with them and gave us a map of the city to help get us started. 
Very friendly and high quality service at breakfast time. Felt as though we were in a 5 star restaurant the way they came to take your orders. 

ROOM 10/10
Although the rooms have a dated interior, this goes with the general 'old fashioned' theme of the hotel. However, the room has to be the best i have ever stayed in, in any hotel. Because of the age of the hotel, the walls were a lot thicker than modern hotels where you can hear the people next door. We couldn't hear anything.
The bed was extremely comfortable, making it very difficult to wake up! 
An iron and ironing board was provided, as well as a kettle, tea bags etc., a safe to use free of charge, free WIFI, and a flat screen TV on the wall. 
The room was spotless, as was the en suite. 
Good, powerful shower. Shampoo and conditioner provided.
Only thing i would say is that our room was constantly really warm, even on a cold day. There is no air conditioning and you can only open the window about 2 inches. Was too warm to sleep under the duvet so just used the thing cover at the bottom of the bed. 

LOCATION 10/10
Looking at maps showing the location of the hotel really does not do it any justice as it looks to be quite a walk from the main areas of the city (o'connell street and temple bar). Was really surprised that it was a really short walk to everything. Perfect location! 

FOOD 10/10
We only had breakfast here but it was lovely. There was a selection of cereals, yogurts, and pastries that you could help yourself to. There was also a hot food menu including the irish cooked breakfast, omlettes, and pancakes. 
The cooked breakfast was lovely and served really quickly. The best orange juice i have ever tasted!

Would recommend getting a dublin pass if you are wanting to see some attractions. It gets you free entry into most of them, free hop on hop off buses which stop at every attraction and give a great tour of the irish history. Also, the pass gets you discount in some restaurants and shops. A free transfer from the airport is included with the pass.

Attractions i recommend:
National Wax Museum Plus
Guinness Storehouse
Dublin Zoo
Kilmainham Gaol
Dublinia ",5,2016,09,17
232,Mr & Mrs,"Wynns Hotel is a winner!  If your looking for 5 star service, spotless cleanliness, and really good hot Irish breakfast at 3 star pricing.... you found the right place. Friendly staff, perfectly located to many sites, Temple Bar area, shopping, tours and transit outside the door. You won't be disappointed.",5,2016,09,13
232,A nice surprise!,"My family and I booked five rooms for a total of 33 nights for a get together for the first and second week of September.  We chose this hotel for its north side location, navigating to Fairview and Marion was much easier.  I was apprehensive about booking here because the rates averaged out to only a little more than €100.00 per night; however, this was about the best value for money I have experienced.  I had a large room on the fourth floor facing the street, my relatives had similar room sizes, one facing the back.  I enjoyed the front more than the back despite the warnings about noise, which never materialized.  You can hear the Luas tram outside and on weekends a few cheery revelers exiting the bars.  At check-in, I was warned about parties on Friday and Saturday and braced myself for the worst.  Perhaps it was the location of my room but I heard nothing and since the weather was warm I even slept with the window open.  Back to the hotel's value, the breakfast in the morning is superb, there are yogurts, croissants, bread and canned fruit, you can also order five or six options from a menu, each day I had the full Irish Breakfast or fried eggs.  Each morning I looked forward to it and after a day or two the staff started remembering us.  One waiter in particular, Jack went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and well looked after.  In fact, the entire hotel is staffed with friendly and competent workers.  Andrew in the bar was very friendly and looked after us while we ate lunch or had a drink.  There was a carving station at lunch and for about €14.00, you get enough food to feed two, the day I tried it I had leg of lamb, superb.  The Front Desk is helpful there is an Italian lady, who's name I missed.  She greeted us each day and made sure we were looked after.  There was another young lady from Croatia, who helped me with a Leap card I bought and even went across the street to Reynold's where I purchased it to make sure it was in order.  This kind of attentive service is rare nowadays but it was experienced in excess at Wynn's.  Keep in mind, the hotel is not for everyone, but for those looking for a clean, well situated hotel, Wynn's can't be beat.  Already, I look forward to my next visit.",5,2016,09,13
232,A good place to be,Great house with very kind staff. All rooms very clean and a wonderful breakfast. Take your time for it and enjoy the menue card !! Unfortunately there was no air-condition in the room so i had to keep the window open. Not a really good idea because it was out to the backyard where they bring the old glas and so on ... But anyhow: i would definetely go again there. Very short way to downtown and the Temple Bar District.,4,2016,09,13
232,Excellent central hotel in Dublin !!,"My wife and myself spent 5 nights in Dublin at the Wynn's.  We loved both the hotel and the impeccable service.   The location is superb as others have mentioned.  But, what we really loved about the hotel was the excellent service from the front desk, the porters  (Paul), the breakfast people and the bar people.  Very friendly and very professional.  Thank you very much, guys.  If we come back to Dublin, Wynn's will be our first choice. 

We were in room 499 facing the street.  There was noise but not too loud for us :-)
The bathroom was large, comfortable and had a huge jacuzzi.   The bedroom was large enough with a wardrobe, mini-bar, flat screen TV, luggage racks, sofas, chairs and plenty of storage space.  Old school and conservative, just the way we like it. 

One more thing.  Someone else has mentioned about the breakfast being good.  I second that view.  It was the best breakfast we had in Dublin and Ireland.  Tasty and hearty, the full Irish.  And, the manager working the breakfast tables was the most efficient, hardest working person that I have ever encountered working in a restaurant.  Truly amazing guy.  Pity I didn't ask him his name.  

Add to all these assets, the location of Wynn's and you have a winner all the way.  Ladbroke's is just across the road, btw, if you want to have a bit of a flutter :-) And, one can celebrate one's wins with a tipple at the aptly named ""Saints and Scholar's Bar"".  Thank you, Wynn's for a fabulous time.  Cheers, guys !!",5,2016,09,13
232,"Ripped me off
On cancellation fee . Avoid them","I had to cancell my reservation 24 hours in advance because of airline problems. I had to pay a one night cancellation fee , which is ok .. But they charged 289 euros  for the first night and  169 euros for the remaining nights.  So they front loaded the first night just to get a higher cancellation fee . Dirty pool in my book .  They should have charged the  same 169 euros  not 289! I'll never stay will them and would not recommend them at all .",1,2016,09,12
232,Wynn's fit the bill,Wife and I just spent three nights at Wynn's.  Great location--can walk to almost anywhere.  Breakfast included (and tasty) and the rooms were comfortable.  Only complaint was that the rooms that face the front can be noisy as there is a tram stop right in front of the hotel.,4,2016,09,11
232,Very good location,This place was great a little date within the rooms but overall nice. The location was awesome very local to everything and the staff were very helpful with finding things ! The breakfast was absolutely great and very well done ! ,4,2016,09,11
232,Wynns set's the bar pretty high,"After staying here at Christmas 2015, we knew we wanted to stay here again when we came back this summer.  No rooms available.  We were sad but the hotel is wonderful.  We often pop into the bar for drinks with friends.  The hotel rooms are ample but not a lot of extra space.  Bedding and towels are comfortable enough.  Breakfast is THE BEST in all of DUBLIN.  We came back just to have breakfast here!!  Great location (if you don't have a car), central to everything.   Love this place!",5,2016,09,09
232,Two thumbs up,"Staff was very accommodating and friendly. The location was ideal....it was right in the heart of Dublin, right off of O'Connel St. The tram stop was also right in front of the hotel in the case you had a distance to travel. Convenience all around. Surrounding area was very safe, even late night. Hotel itself was spotless. I highly recommend it.",5,2016,09,08
232,Great ambience a bit noisy,Lovely historic hotel located in the center of Dublin. Easy walking distance to all attractions. Cool old school keys. Nice bar and restaurant area with good food. The room had a vintage fireplace which was charming. The bathroom is small and the shower is tight but workable. We had a room in the front and had tons of street noise all night. If you need quiet to sleep ask for a a room away from the street.,5,2016,09,08
232,Enjoyable Stay,"We stayed two nights in Dublin. We asked for a room away from the bar and event rooms because of noise and had no problems with that or the construction.

Having two single beds was awesome for friends traveling together. 

They held our luggage before and after and even checked us in early which was a plus!

I would recommend this hotel to others.",4,2016,09,08
232,Cannot go wrong,"Stayed in this hotel 9 years ago. We returned expecting to find some inevitable sign of tiredness: we found none.
Hotel in pristine condition, very courteous and efficient staff, very high degree of cleanliness.
Tram stops just outside the front door and the airport bus stop literally across the road. A very short walking distance from the busy Temple Bar and most of the tourist attractions.
We would have rated it excellent had it not been for a couple of issues: size of room and minibar.
The room we were given was quite small (and consequently the bed) but very well supplied, clean and quiet.
The empty minibar was really a no-no. There is nothing more frustrating than coming back from a long day visiting or from a late night dinner and finding your fridge completely empty. Asked the receptionist when they were going to fill it but she looked  at me as if I was being abusive. She told me that it wasn't being filled. As we were not going to stock up with our own supply of Guinness or Jameson whisky, could it be that the hotel expects people to use their bar?",4,2016,09,02
232,Outstanding housekeeping,"This has to be the cleanest room I have stayed in. Everything was spotless. The hotel itself has a lovely old world charm. My grandfather used to stay there when he visited Dublin, I could imagine him there, there was no Luas then though. The noise of it could be annoying if you were a light sleeper but I found ear plugs did the trick. It was very convenient having the Luas stop outside the door. 
Breakfast was lovely, I went down at 8 it was fairly quite then. 
I booked directly with the hotel which was the cheapest deal. 
",4,2016,08,30
232,Excellent,"Wonderful service, lovely atmosphere, great food. Can't find any way it could be improved. 
The hotel is traditional and though not staying there as on a short business trip, we decided to lunch there. Service really couldn't be bettered. Ambience was relaxed and welcoming. Food really excellent. Would highly recommend.",5,2016,08,28
232,"Excellent position, courteous staff, elegance, and comfort ..at a reasonable price","The position is excellent, easy to reach by car as well (there is a public parking close to the hotel - fee apply). The reception staff was very kind and efficient. The room were spacious; though not modernly furnished, they were comfortable. The room where breakfast was served was not very big, but we never had to wait for a long time before being seated; service, in fact, was efficient and courteous. Breakfast was excellent, both for the variety and quality of the food.",4,2016,08,27
232,Great location & old world charm,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at Wynn's and it was great. The hotel is located right in the middle of the retail CBD and is surrounded by little pubs and restaurants. Staff were really friendly and helpful, especially the doorman who gave really good advice on tours, dining & entertainment. We had a front room that proved a little noisy since we left windows open since it was unseasonably warm and there is no air conditioning. Windows are effectively double glazed so noise wouldn't normally be a problem. So we give the propert top marks. ",5,2016,08,26
232,chill out,"great location, beside city transport luas, buses, taxis the cities night life is only walking distance from the front door. they are very friendly staff and couldn't do enough for me. rooms were spotless. a bit of noise from the streets but not too loud. highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,08,25
232,Great little hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights in the middle of August. We were on the 5th floor, and it was quiet as can be. As a Floridian, I wasn't used to no a/c and it got to the low 80's during our trip so a little fan would have been nice. The rooms are small but quaint, and the shower was amazing. 100% would recommend! Free breakfast was a nice perk and the location just couldn't be beat. ",5,2016,08,24
232,Size of room which was very quiet and comfortable.,"Huge room on fifth floorl ,perfect central location ,very
 Helpful staff ,lovely freshly cooked breakfast.Would certainly stay in this hotel again.Great location for any activities ,with easy access to all forms of transport.",5,2016,08,24
232,Weekend away,"The hotel is lovely the staff are so friendly and helpful, very pleasant stay. Central to all good pubs and restaurants. The hotel is very clean and the food is very good. Rooms have everything u need for a short stay.",5,2016,08,24
232,Disappointing breakfast experience,"For a twin room we paid 219 euros for one night. As we were booking fairly last minute for the middle of August it was one of the cheaper options especially given the hotel's fantastic location. Wynn's was a less than ten minutes walk from Busaras ( Dublin bus centre) and is within 5 minutes to O Connell street. It is one of the most convenient hotels we've stayed in in Dublin. From previous reviews we knew to expect a classic old fashioned hotel which is what it was. No electronic key card here you actually get a big heavy brass key. ( which I find quite nice) The reception area is small but staff were friendly and helpful. We arrived early and it was not a problem to leave our bags. We had a drink in the Saints and Scholar's bar within the hotel. The atmosphere was relaxed and casual. Our room was basic but clean . Bathroom seems re- furnished and the shower was excellent. Toiletries are provided. Hairdryer however was prehistoric so I regretted no bringing my own. We were told that due to an 80th birthday party to expect a bit of noise. We were on the third floor and the party was on the first but we could still hear the music clearly. Luckily it was good. I gave the hotel 3 stars as breakfast was chaotic. We came down at 9.30 and a small queue had already formed. We were offered to have our breakfast in the bar area but we declined as we watched others who had chosen this gong back and forward to collect cutlery, juice etc. We had to wait over 15minutes. When we finally got seated we got offered juice, tea and coffee but then were left to ourselves. We helped ourselves to the small selection of cereal and fruit and then waited and waited for someone to take our cooked order. We finally had to ask. Our order was taken, then forgotten and when we finally got our breakfast it was not what  we ordered. There was no apology for the appalling breakfast experience and even when we checked out I would have at least expected professional hotel staff to ask how we enjoyed our stay as is the norm for most hotels. Wynn's would not be anywhere near top of my list for places to stay in Dublin.",3,2016,08,23
232,I found the hotel to be outdated and noisy,"I found the hotel to be outdated and noisy. It appeared to be catering toward older crowd arriving on buses. 
At least when I stayed there – that was a majority of guests. They rent space on the second floor for private functions so it was extremely noisy.
On the plus side location was great.",2,2016,08,22
232,Very Irish hotel in a perfect location,"This was a return visit to this hotel.   I stayed here in 2011 and found the staff extremely helpful.   The location gives great access to places on both sides of the Liffey.   Actually if I had been unable to book here I would not have traveled to Ireland.   Upon my arrival, the young lady at the desk remembered me!  I had a fall at the airport so for several nights requested a bucket of ice which arrived in my room immediately!!! Imagine my surprise at checkout to find  they did change for the ice, as all Americans know, this would not happened in the U.S.....I heartily suggest you book at the Wynns.",5,2016,08,22
232,Classic hotel in the heart of Dublin,"This is a classic hotel that one would expect in Dublin. The rooms are comfortable and have what you need for a good stay. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I particularly enjoyed breakfast as it was served in the hotel's cafe which is very nice and ""European"" and the breakfast itself is good. The location is just downtown so meters away of most of the sites of the city and the tram stop is just by the door. One caveat is that the room I stayed in was quite noisy but being a hotel downtown, this might happen, it is more of a ""tourist"" hotel than a ""relax"" hotel...",4,2016,08,21
232,Got what we paid for,"This hotel was less than others so I didn't have high expectations. The room was hot and stuffy so we opened the windows but there was noise from the street all night. The room was tiny and the sink had 2 faucets and barely any plugs. It was an outdated hotel too, but the location was what we needed.

The staff was excellent though. All very nice.",3,2016,08,20
232,Mid week break,"Stayed here for 2 nights - basic hotel comfortable clean. we had room to front on 3 rd floor which included corner jacuzzi bath - it was a little noisy early morning with Luas outside but we expected this being in city centre. Breakfast choices good & service Buick - I did feel that dining room too small & we were rushed a bit. The barman from Prague was very entertaining & friendly & while the bar was very quiet we just wanted nightcap after busy day. Area around hotel is very neglected & rundown - their wasn't any decent bars or restaurants nearby.
Overall we enjoyed our stay & will return again as its so convenient for concerts matches etc",3,2016,08,19
232,Disappointed.. So noisy!!! ,"Positives: great location to city centre and luas line. The waiters at breakfast were fantastic and do a great job!! 

Negatives: a lot! When checking in we were told of a wedding going on that night but would quieten down at about midnight. That was perfect as we were going to a show so did not mind. When arriving back at the hotel there was a group of people from the wedding standing by the front door drinking and smoking. They would not move to allow us enter the hotel while a gentleman who worked in the hotel ignored what was happening! My wife was pregnant at the time and it was not a nice experience! Then there was teens in our hallway shouting! our room was located right above the wedding party so it felt as if we were in the same room it was so loud! The dj did stop when we were told it would but that did not mean there was no noise!! For the next few hours we lay in bed listening to shouting, screaming and fighting. Then the luas line starting in the early morning which is very noisy. Also the key had an awkward heavy key chain which was unnecessary to carry around. 

If you want a relaxing, quiet experience for your money don't waste your time here!! Very disappointed ",2,2016,08,12
232,Lovely place ,"We stayed here for 2 night, so convenient as it's central of town and easy to get around.....down side there is no bath tub in the hotel, the hotel old colonial style 😍😍beautiful and unique,the plus side of the hotel is the big shower head .",4,2016,08,11
232,Lovely friendly hotel,"This hotel is very conveniently situated for a sightseeing break in Dublin.  The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The staff are friendly and helpful. There is a wide selection for breakfast with a good choose for vegetarians. As they are all freshly prepared you can have any combination you fancy.  The only slight downside is that there is the noise of traffic at night, currently made worse by the road works for the new tram that seemed to go on quite late at night - but that did not stop us sleeping.",5,2016,08,09
232,"Perfect location, amazing hotel, history, outstanding staff and Dublin.","I have stayed in Wynn's for a number of years. Dublin is my favourite city and Wynn's always makes my stay extra special.  Perfect location, amazing hotel, history, outstanding staff and Dublin. 
Comfortable, clean rooms and a delicious breakfast. You won't regret booking Wynn's 😊",5,2016,08,08
232,Old school homely hotel,"I've stayed here on a number of occasions whilst in Dublin and it is exudes old school charm and class. Staff are so friendly, always go out of their way to help and food is good quality. Lovely hotel if you are looking to get away from the sterile look of many modern hotels",4,2016,08,06
232,Perfect location for sightseeing,"We stayed here for 2 nights while visiting Dublin. The location was perfect, just off O'Connell Street. The hotel is set in a classic style. Our room was at the front and was a good size. Very clean and light. There was tea/coffee making facilities, iron, ironing board, fridge and safe to use.
Bathroom had a lovely shower although a little too small. Toiletries included.
Breakfast was fantastic. Full Irish along with buffet of cereals, toast, fruit and fresh scones or croissants. Staff were very friendly.
The bar we found to be too light and not enough comfy seating to make it our evening venue, if this was changed it would be perfect.
The only downside to this hotel is the tram stops right outside and is therefore noisy and due to the location a lot of people around day and night. This did not affect us and I like the sound of city bustle. Would stay here again without a doubt.",5,2016,08,04
232,One of a kind,"This is a one of a kind hotel the does just about everything exceedingly well.  It's well over a century old and the  décor reflects that-- no up to date design choices here, just steady, old fashioned care.  It isn't fancy but it is like a favorite old sweater that fits just right. The rooms are maybe a bit small, but cosy. Everything is kept scrupulously clean. Excellent free wifi is high tech compared to the key attached to a heavy weight you'll gladly deposit at the front desk whenever you leave the hotel. The bedspreads are a holdover from an earlier era I think they could change.  The staff are friendly and efficient.  The included breakfast is made to order --gluten free bread for toast or for eggs benedict available if you ask. Dinner in the restaurant was excellent and the bar stays busy. The location is convienent.  It is like stepping back in time-- not necessarily back over a century but back a couple of decades to the kind of unique family owned mid level hotels in Europe I remember before chains changed everything.",5,2016,08,03
232,BIRTHDAY PRESENT,"This is a beautiful hotel and so central. A few minutes walk to the GPO Trinity college and all types of shops. The service is excellent all the staff are so friendly including room cleaners. The room was excellent, spotless and to the side/back. Very quite had a great sleep. Nothing bad could be said about this hotel. The carvery is second to none and the breakfast was fantastic.",5,2016,08,02
232,Perfect hotel at the heart of the city.,"Four of us stayed at Wynn's for three nights last week. The hotel is a five minute stroll from the centre of the city.The rooms were lovely, clean with a very nice en-suite shower room. Tea and coffee making facilities. Breakfast is amazing (try the eggs Benedict) DELICIOUS!!!!  The staff go out of their way to help, and are so friendly.We arrived very early in the morning, and left early evening. The receptionist was more than happy for us to leave our luggage until our room was ready, and again until we left for the airport. Would definitely stay here again, and would recommend to friends.",5,2016,07,31
232,"Great Location, good food,","This is a traditional older style hotel in a great location just off O'Connell Street near the River Liffe adjacent to tram and bus stops, it has very helpful friendly staff and the food is excellent especially the breakfast. We had a spacious room with a shower and it was clean and comfortable, we would stay again.",5,2016,07,29
232,Great location,Had a very nice visit here - breakfast is excellent. Bedroom was beuatiful with a little fireplace and sitting area. Highly recommend if staying in Dublin for any occasion. Great location just off O Connell Street too,5,2016,07,26
232,Excellent location,"Excellent location, near all public transport. Staff were very friendly and held our baggage after checkout without any extra charge while we went shopping. Only small issue was that our room was very warm and only one small window to open. Would recommend to a friend and will revisit.",5,2016,07,24
232,A traditional hotel,"Four of us spent a very pleasant three nights at Wynns. The bedrooms are traditional ; clean, good shower and plenty of storage space. The breakfast is great with lovely kippers as well as a choice of continental or traditional Irish. Although there was a lot of work going on outside the hotel, for some reason, we all slept like logs !!
All the staff are really helpful and we had a great time.",4,2016,07,24
232,Shoppers dream hotel,"This hotel is ideal for the shopping trip in Dublin easy excess with public transport on its doorstep, the staff are very helpful and polite, breakfast very good, would stay hear again and recommend anyone who likes to stay in the heart of Dublin to give it a look",5,2016,07,23
232,Very centrally located hotel! Save on travel and use your feet! :),"I needed somewhere to stay centrally as I had a ferry to catch very very early the next morning. I literally booked Wynn's Hotel (on 29th June) about 15 minutes before I walked up there from Trinity College. (Which is a very short walk, so if you want to stay centrally, it's a good choice).

ARRIVAL - I was pleasantly surprised that there wasn't any issues booking in (the wonders of modern technology, given I had only booked it a few minutes before!). 

RECEPTION - Also, I was very impressed by the hotel receptionist. I think she may have been Eastern European (I didn't catch her name), but she was extremely helpful. 
I wanted to order room service, and had a few questions about the fish on the menu, she got one of the kitchen staff to come and let me know what the fish of the day was. 
I also wanted to order a bottle of wine, and she was very helpful with that too. 
It's rare that when you book into a hotel that receptionists will go out of their way (especially when the hotel was busy), but I felt she did, and in a courteous manner, and after a long day of walking and travelling, I really appreciated it. 

ROOM  - When I arrived to my room (room service came soon after, which was great), it was absolutely what I was expecting, and perfectly functional, nicely decorated and clean. 
The room backed on to the back (or maybe side of the hotel), so no view, but I didn't mind, I just wanted to get a good nights sleep. And it was very quiet. I like quiet. 

BED - The bed was really, really comfortable. I was very sad to leave it to be honest. 

BREAKFAST - As I got up very early, it was just a continental breakfast, so I had tea, toast, and cereal. (Breakfast was free with the room, which was great).

OVERALL OPINION - If you want a centrally located hotel in Dublin. A good nights sleep (dependant on room of course). Free breakfast, and if you don't want to spend a fortune. Then it's perfectly functional for your needs. Would I stay again? Yes.",4,2016,07,15
232,A little gem- with fantastic staff,Having visited Wynns bar several times- we decided to stay for a short break. Rooms comfortable - whirlpool bath! Amazing - put a lush bath bar in it - wow! But what sets this place apart is the genuine friendliness of all the staff. Roberta on reception is a star. Dave the barman has a great sense of fun. Delighted - and that's only after night one. Bathed and ready for inclusive full Irish breakfast. Love it!,5,2016,07,14
232,Central location and comfortable,"Received a courteous welcome, found all staff friendly. Bedroom was a bit on the small side but bed comfortable. Had a room at the back of the hotel but needed to keep window closed because it was still noisy throughout the night. Had a good choice at breakfast and cooked to order. Step outside and you're straight in the city. Made a nice change to stay in a hotel with a bit of character. If we visited Dublin again would stay here!",4,2016,07,13
232,A trip to Dublin,"The room we had was small but the bathroom made up for it. Not all rooms are small as I seen very big rooms as I left. It is an old Hotel. Every where was so clean towels were lovely and soft plenty off hot water. We had a good choice for b/fast and freshly cooked, we stayed in the Hotel for dinner to relax having had a busy day out all over the city. It is a great place to stay if you are traveling to see the city the open top buses are around the corner and all other buses and the tram line stops just outside the door.",3,2016,07,12
232,Very kind service,"In beggining of June I was staying with husband in Wynns Hotel. From here you can reach everything important in City in every direction in 5-15 minutes. Breakfast is very good and our suite was completly renovated and clean. But what we appreciate most is that help you ask for is always there and served on most kind way. We communicate most of the time with Miss Nika and Miss Roberta. They are both absolutly awesome! Thank you!

232,Excellent Location,"Stayed in Wynns this past weekend.Great hotel in and even better location.Located just steps from OConnell Street and seconds from the Abbey Street Luas stop you couldn't be more central in Dublin City centre.Breakfast was included with our twin room rate and the choice was really good.I had a full Irish but there was choice of continental,eggs benedict/florentine,scones etc.Staff at reception and at the breakfast service were very friendly.Enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay again pending on price at the point of booking.My room rate this weekend was €169 which is a little expensive but considering the big concert weekend that it was in Dublin with Kodaline,Beyoncé and the Stone Roses all in town that was as good as I was going to get in such a great spot.I think under normal circumstances the twin room I had would be more reasonably priced at €120.
Overall very happy with my stay",4,2016,07,11
232,Great location ,"Hotel is in a great location. Very close to the abbey and Olympia. It's within the main thoroughfare for shopping in Dublin.
The bathroom facilities in the bedrooms were very new and updated . The fireplace provided interesting feature in the bedrooms.  Some of the decor is very tired looking through out the hotel. This can be forgiven though as it is spotlessly clean. ",4,2016,07,09
232,An oasis of calm in Dublin city centre,"Wynn's Hotel has had its home on Lower Abbey Street for 171 years. This hotel has seen and been part of history in the making.   
We lunched in the spacious Restaurant diningroom today (Monday) and while not particularly busy it presented a welcome and tranquil atmosphere from the busy street outside.
Chosen for starters were king prawns with rice, and a cocktail of mixed melon with mango sorbet. Main course was a more than generous sirloin steak garnished with mushroom, shallots, courgette and baby potatoes (delicious! Photo doesn't do it justice)   Also served were mixed vegetables and potato - hardly necessary but would fill the heartiest appetite.   A nice New Zealand Pinot Noir complimented the steak.  Main courses also on offer were salmon, lamb, duck and vegetarian options.   Desert was a lemon roulade with fruit couli and sorbet. Other options included cheese cake, apple tart, fresh fruit, ice cream. Coffee completed a very relaxing enjoyable delicious lunch served so effeciently by the capable Anna Maria who was so pleasant and welcoming.   There is a carvery menu also available in the Saints and Scholars Bar but so nice to try the Diningroom if your'e not rushed for time. 
Don't miss the gallery of old photographs and cards in Reception of Dublin in victorian times before you leave.",5,2016,07,04
232,Absolutely brilliant,"We stayed here for 3 nights and it was great. The room was really big and light and spotlessly clean. The bed was very comfortable and the staff where all lovely especially the waiter at breakfast. The breakfast was perfect. A fantastic continental selection and the Irish cooked breakfast was exceptional. The hotel is in a perfect position for night life, shops and restaurants.",5,2016,06,29
232,Good hotel,"Stayed here for the first two nights of our Ireland vacation. Good location, helpful staff, nice room. They warned us several times that loud parties were planned for the ballroom and gave us earplugs but there was no noise. The broken lift was a minor inconvenience and should be fixed by now. Great breakfast, free parking were nice bonuses.",4,2016,06,28
232,Great location & spacious rooms!,"This hotel is in a great location, easy to access the shuttle to/from the airport, and comes with a full irish breakfast. The room was spacious, clean & comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful.",4,2016,06,26
232,Hotel with character,"We have visited Dublin a few times in recent years but this was the first time we stayed at this hotel. On arrival you can't fail to notice that this place has character. We had a large double room at the front of the hotel. The bathroom was a wet room which was a first for us ! There was an old-fashioned feel to the room but it was in keeping with the hotel as a whole.The hotel is ideally located with the Temple Bar area being only a short walk away. Breakfast was included and you could help yourself to juice,toast,croissants. We sat down and ordered from the menu which included some lovely,tasty choices. I had the full Irish breakfast and my wife had Eggs Benedict one morning and a Goat's Cheese dish the next. The head waiter was very welcoming and friendly and all staff we encountered in the restaurant were very pleasant. There is a doorman who sees you in and out of the hotel. As with any centrally located hotel in a big city,they need to keep an eye on who comes in the door ! The only criticism of this hotel is that if you're in a room at the front,you're likely to be disturbed by the noise of the tram which runs until late and starts early in the morning. The line is right outside ! We were on a higher floor so it wasn't too bad although if we stay here again we will probably request a back room. Nice hotel with friendly staff.",4,2016,06,26
232,Lovely old style hotel in central dublin,"Wynns Hotel is truly delightful. Great value for money in a very central location. You are walking distance from temple bar, airport bus, shops, the river and other tourist attractions. The reception staff very very welcoming and had no problem with storing our luggage when we arrived at 8am to see if it was okay to leave our bags! They also stored our luggage when we checked out. The room was clean, tastefully decorated and quiet enough. The shower was the best shower I have ever had! The breakfast had everything you could want and the staff were very attentive and friendly. It was very busy when we arrived for breakfast and it was clear that staff were working very hard to ensure everyone was served quickly and efficiently. I would highly recommend this perfect hotel in central Dublin.Thank you!",4,2016,06,26
232,Great Staff and Location,"First off, the location of the hotel is excellent, just one block north of the Iffy and minutes walking to almost all major attractions and shopping in downtown Dublin.
The staff were very friendly and helpful. Claire and Niki on the front desk could not have been nicer. The breakfast was great and prepared to order. On days when we had to leave early (5:45 a.m.) the restaurant host came in early so we could have a continental breakfast. Wow - who else does that.
The rooms were well sized, clean and charming. Bathrooms appeared to be recently renovated. Bed was very comfortable.
As indicated in other reviews the lift was not working which was a minor inconvenience. It was necessary to walk to the second floor and use the service lift from the second floor. Not a problem. We were told lift would be fixed at end of month.
Would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,06,20
232,Innconsiderate,"I went to the dining room at this hotel with my family, during the course of the meal, a large group of people came into the dining room and were belligerently drunk.  Mind you it was about 5 in the evening.  These people started shouting and making a fool of themselves.  To make matters worse the children of these people were running around the dining room screaming and pretending to ""shoot"" each other with plastic cap guns.  Our family voiced our displeasure, saying it was a ""disgrace"" that the staff allowed these children to run through the dining room disrupting all the guests eating with their toy plastic cap guns that they pretended to shoot at them selves and at other guests, including myself and other members of my family.  It was clear the staff didn't care and didn't even acknowledge our concern with any words whatsoever.  The man at the front who we told simply shrugged his shoulders and said nothing.  Because of this I will never be back here and urge everyone reading to look for somewhere else to stay where the staff is more considerate.  AVOID this hotel and restaurant.",1,2016,06,18
232,old world charm,"Yes lift was out of order but there was the back elevator that was fine although had to access it one level up. The key to your room had a big weight attached so you naturally gave it in when you went out, felt very old school. The room was charming and large with 2 big windows and window seats. The narrow and deep bath was comfortable and the rest of the bathroom large and modern. The breakfasts were included and delicious with everything you could possibly want and a pleasant server each day who would get you whatever you would like even if not on the menu.",4,2016,06,16
232,I love this characterful hotel!! ,"Room was perfect, I added for a room with a bath cos I am pregnant and they gave me a jacuzzi bath, which was great. Room had lovely sash windows and faced out to abbey street. Bed was very comfortable.  Very relaxing environment, beautiful old hotel. 

Hotel is in a great location, only the Luas stop is no longer situated outside hotel while work on the Luas is being done. But it's an easy walk to anywhere. 

Breakfast was the highlight, lovely menu and cooked to order. Relaxing and characterful breakfast room, and attentive service from waiter. 

Lift wasn't working while I stayed but they had a staff and goods lift instead in use so it was ok. ",5,2016,06,15
232,Too bad,"We booked this hotel months ago for a very good rate and after that I did not do any more research, too bad. I found out about the tramline work a few days before our arrival, one of the reasons we booked because the tram stopped right in front of the hotel, too bad. The main lift at the hotel was not working, again I failed to read the previous reviews stating it had been out for several weeks, too bad. No business center to print boarding passes. The Hotel itself was very dignified, the Room well appointed, the Bed comfortable and the Bathroom adequate and clean. The air conditioner and the Wi-Fi worked  and the Breakfast included in the price was very good. Staff and service friendly and attentive. The Location is great. Too bad for all the negative points.",3,2016,06,10
232,Nightmare Stay,"Lift out of order.  Not sure when Nicole S posted, but may have been OOO for some time. The put us above the party room. Party went on until 1:00AM with LOUD MUSIC (something unheard of in the states). Ear plugs & pillow over my head did no good. The moved us the next day after my husband (caraddad) cornered the manager who was trying to avoid him and the mgr told us there was a wedding reception that night (until 1:00AM). Manager offered nothing - we had to ask, then demand. It seemed to be a new idea to him when my husband suggested they put the party guests in the rooms above (DUH!). 
Other comments: Hotel is really showing its age except for the bathrooms which had been renovated. The breakfast was good, service not so much. The cafeteria-style food in the bar area was awful - meat was all dried out. WiFi was hit & miss.",2,2016,06,09
232,Hotel Hell,Awful place!! Room over all nite Rager Party so no sleep. Lost out on next day's tour (wasted). No elevators and no sign of any workers. Long breakfast lines (30 min.). Awful expensive food in lounge (Leather like beef with overcooked Veggies). Staff not interested in customer satisfaction.  Just got back from Dublin so this is the latest info on the Hell Hotel or Hotel Hell.,1,2016,06,08
232,Stayed here for one night,whilst visiting Dublin .Had stayed there as a child  many years ago and little had changed. Full of character and it really was like stepping back in time.The entrance and reception area  have retained the olde world charm.Lift not working so  used the stairs to the 4th floor.There is a service lift that can be used  if mobility limited.Bedroom was old-fashioned but  part of its charm. Reminded us of a  bygone age.Beds really comfortable.Extremely noisy we had a  room facing  Abbey Street and there are major road works outside and infact all over Central Dublin due to new tramlines being laid. Drilling throughout the night Luckily we slept as we were  so tired from all the sightseeing.Breakfast was delicious attentive and pleasant staff both at reception and the  staff serving breakfast all exceptional.Paid £137 for a twin room with breakfast guess you are paying for the nostalgia and its very central position.,4,2016,06,07
232,Wynns Hotel,The hotel was alright and had a nice central location. Our room had no central air and the lift was out of order. There was also heavy construction just outside which was loud (the hotel did offer ear plugs but that didn't help much). These are things due to the hotel being an older building. The breakfast offered was good and the bar staff was friendly. Not sure if I'd stay there again if I were to visit Dublin again.,3,2016,06,07
232,"Professional, Clean and Grand Service ","From the moment we walked into the door we were treated with nothing but kindness. The staff were lovely to deal with and the room was clean and tidy. 
Bed was a little uncomfortable and the loft was not operating but what can ya do !!! Breakfast was also lovely so no major complaints here at all. Would recommend to my friends and family. ",5,2016,06,06
232,Wish I could be a bit kinder.,"So I really like Wynn's in general. Great staff and a nice central location, but this trip was not so much fun. First, and no fault at all of Wynn's, the streets of Dublin are currently being torn up for a light rail system and, yep, there is a whole lot of banging and hammering going on all day. The central elevator was out, but I didn't mind the schlep to the 2nd floor. More importantly, Wynn's has a popular venue for wedding receptions, birthday parties, etc., that is directly under the west-side rooms on the second floor. This venue is poorly insulated for sound. Again, great location, great staff, nice breakfast, but if you plan to stay at Wynn's on a weekend night, I strongly urge you to get a top floor room on the east side of the building.",3,2016,06,03
232,"Wynn's Hotel: Great location, great staff, problem with the lift","Wynn's in Dublin is a delightful hotel with many positive features.  The location is great, the rooms are clean and spacious, and the staff is most helpful and friendly.  The breakfast was great, especially the scones.  The one drawback was the lift was broken and has been so for some time, as I understand it.  Guests were asked to walk to the first floor and from there, if necessary, the lift went to upper floors.  They did make it possible to walk through a busy kitchen (which I doubt the kitchen staff appreciated) and from there take a service elevator. Hopefully they will get their act together and get the lift repaired.",4,2016,06,03
232,Old World Charm,"I finished my 17 day trip to Ireland with 4 days at Wynn's Hotel.  Built in 1845, it has all the old world charm.  It is on the north side of the Liffey, but there are plenty of places to eat and things to do in the area.  And the walk across the O'Connell Bridge is just a block away. The lift was broken, but Robbie, the bellman, took my luggage up to my room for me.  My room was really big with a Jacuzzi tub!  The WiFi is practically nonexistent, so after fighting with it for a while I just gave in and disconnected.  Kind of helped me enjoy my trip a little more.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly.  If I requested something, it was taken care of with no delay.  Breakfast was exceptional!  There is a set menu, but I ordered just what I wanted.  Full Irish was great, but mostly I just wanted bacon, hash browns and toast and the wait staff was very good about getting me fed.  it is an average sized dining room and there are very busy times.  Take the suggestions from the guest book in your room to avoid delays.  Overall, Wynn's Hotel was the perfect place for me to wind down from a long trip in Ireland.  I would love to go back and spend more time with my new friends at Wynn's.",4,2016,06,02
232,Our 'go-to' hotel in Dublin,"This is our regular hotel in Dublin, either together or with other friends and family.  Have stayed here several times since 1997. Location is perfect, rooms lovely, very good value for money in what can be an expensive city and the breakfasts are excellent. 

But what makes this hotel so special is the staff.  They always make us feel so welcome - a special mention should be given to the receptionist and breakfast bar manager.

Highly recommended. 

Gary & Heather Galbraith, Belfast ",5,2016,06,01
232,A Mixed Bag with Much Potential,"The Wynn's Hotel has a lot going for it, including a grand old building, a convenient location and very good breakfasts. Unfortunately, things don't seem to be running as smoothly as they should. 

The lift was broken during our two-night stay; the service elevator was provided as an alternative, requiring us to slink through the hot kitchen or walk up a flight of stairs first. I wouldn't make an issue of this except that it seemed to be broken in the weeks prior our stay too (judging by other reviews here) and the hotel was quite busy. Other things were a bit off as well - doors squeaked, the furniture in the dining room and pub looked tired.

That all being said, the breakfasts here are excellent (try the scones) and the rooms were clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly and very helpful throughout our visit. One just senses that the hotel's management needs to step up its game.",3,2016,06,01
232,Great Hotel great service ,"This was my first visit to Wynns and it won't be my last...I was in Dublin for business and a friend of mine recommended this hotel to me.The staff were very helpful,friendly and professional.The room was small but comfortable and very clean as was the bathroom. 
Had breakfast and it was first class and service was quick and professional. As I was checking out I commented on the service to the receptionist and the general  manager of the hotel was standing nearby who came over to me and we chatted about my stay.
The staff and the hotel are a credit to you...I'll recommend to all my family and friends to stay in Wynns Hotel.
I might also add....Wynns hotel has everything on its door step...Shopping,restaurants bars and night life.
If your looking for a place to stay in Dublin City....Wynns is the place to stay...I'll definitely be back.",5,2016,05,31
232,Really Just Awful,"Arrived hopeful, walked into a chaotic mess.  The lady at the front desk was frazzled (mind you for no reason, no one else was around) kept on saying over and over how busy she was and was really just a mess.  Shrugged it off and went out to explore the town.  Came back to our room, which was actually a decent size, but everything was just very old and tired looking.  Was informed of a party that would be going on until 1am, I stated I had an early morning flight and this was an issue.  I was assured I had a quite room and all of Dublin was sold out anyways so really what could I do.  I got ZERO sleep.  All I could hear was insanely loud music until 1am... had I not had an early morning flight this would not have been nearly as much of an issue.  The night manager did not care at all and simply told me ""other rooms have it worse"".  Keep in mind there were several other customers downstairs complaining to him as well. Upon check out I waited for the owner/manager who simply asked ""well did you get any sleep after 1""... completely unacceptable.  He gave us a slight discount but not nearly enough for the amount of little sleep we got in a crummy old room.  I would give this zero stars had it not been for the night porter who was the only person with any sympathy with the nightmare Wynn's had caused.  I would not recommend this location to anyone, needs a face lift and better service.

Only positive, in a great location.",1,2016,05,31
232,Fab hotel! 🏩 ,Staff were really friendly and helpful. Room was pleasant - room was small ish but bathroom was lovely. It had a jacuzzi bath which was really cool. Great location! Breakfast was delicious very traditonal excellent service in the restaurant.,5,2016,05,28
232,Traditional style hotel,"A traditional style hotel, in the centre of Dublin. Full of character and individuality.
The rooms were fairly large, with all facilities expected of a hotel of this category.
The staff were helpful too, and the restaurant was very good, especially the breakfasts.
Of course, being in the centre of Dublin, there is some noise at night, but nothing more than normal for a city of this size. Also, being a popular hotel, there can be a wait for breakfast at busy times.
Convenient for the city centre, with easy access to the buses for the airport, and has a tram stop almost outside, connecting the two main railway stations.
And yes, I certainly would go back again when staying in Dublin.",4,2016,05,21
232,Nice ,"Very nice hotel and the staff are really nice and always there to help 
The room was a bit small but then u don't spend mutchtime in there. The bathroom was nice and everything in there the only problam was the lift but lucky I was young enough  there was another lift provided. The breakfast was first class and the waitress was very good at her job and so nice. It's been 20 years since I went home and staying at the Wynn's reminded me with pride Ov my Irish history ",4,2016,05,21

The location is ideal for the purpose of our visit which was to do the '1916' thing. The family rooms were grand with two areas both with TV - we requested a DVD and was in room on arrival. Single rooms perfect for a short stay. Breakfast is served so real novelty for kids and staff were really nice and they felt welcome. its oldie worldly and has connections with 1916 - GPO practically across the road - which has a terrific interactive exhibition - if u do one 1916 thing do Wynn's and the GPO,",4,2016,05,21
232,Centrally located ,"Comfortable older hotel.  Lift out of order during our stay.  Walk to 3rd floor was not bad.  Room was comfortable but a little small.  Room was warm -- window marked out of order and what looked like the air conditioner would not turn on.  Breakfast included.  Very good Irish breakfast.
",3,2016,05,20
232,Only if your one and only lift was working!,"Your location is great and your staff is excellent. But, you should advise travelers at the time of booking that your one and only lift is not working. You will still get people to choose your hotel because of your location and service. But, travelers with weak knees can choose other hotels, which we could not. That made our week long stay very miserable. Also your breakfast room is small, so guests have to wait outside, as we had to one morning. But we would forget that if your lift works.",3,2016,05,18
232,Overnight history trip,"The location is unreal with LUAS actually outside the door (when not on strike) and the centre of the city just metres away. The hotel is very quaint and the rooms just acceptable, Excellent breakfast cooked individually ( which is a rare thing today ).
Reasonable price which matches the convenience.
Would stay there again.",5,2016,05,18
232,Chris's 30th,"This was my first visit to Dublin and the Wynns hotel. What a great choice. it was old fashioned but beautifully kept. The breakfasts were delicious ,we visited the bar most nights on our return, the staff were friendly and very efficient cannot wait to revisit",4,2016,05,17
232,good room,"when we arrived we were told that the main lift was being repaired, my wife has a bad knee, we climbed to the next floor and were able to use the service lift.  our bedroom was at the back of the hotel, it was a good room and the facilities were fine, the rear of the hotel is probably quieter than the front with the tram passing by the front door.  the hotel is excellently situated, the bar was fine and all the staff we met were very pleasant",4,2016,05,17
232,Excellent location and value,"We were in Ireland for 2 weeks, stayed in 6 different hotels.

They were all good, but this was better than the rest.

Excellent breakfast, extraordinary customer care. Quiet room and a really comfortable bed (firm).",5,2016,05,16
232,Nightmare on Abbey Street Lower,"Please be advised that the title is not a reflection of the Hotel. Just made an overnight stay in this property.This is a very old building going back over one hundred years. The ambience, decoration and atmosphere reflect this with retention of many characteristics of the period. The rooms some might contend are a little dated but are spotless, spacious and very well furnished to the point of having a fridge. Beds were very comfortable. En-suites are quite quirky with the use of different colours with the wash hand basin a light pink and the pedestal a light green   Breakfast room was quite spacious with plenty of space between tables. It was a little small for the size of the hotel and one had to wait albeit a short time to be seated. You are actually advised to avail of early breakfast in order to avoid this situation. There is a good selection of breakfast items. One of the issues is that the  lift was out of commission and residents had to use the service lift which quite frankly in terms of cleanliness left a lot to be desired with having to step over dirty bed linen, vegetables etc left lying on the floor. In order to use this lift residents still had to make their way to the first floor via the stairway and what appeared to be a kitchen storage area which may be a  potential problem for residents with mobility issues. The nightmare refers to the small matter of being awakened at 3am by the sound of what I initially believed to be the emptying of street waste bins by the City Council. It however continued to the point that it was lasting to long for such an operation. On checking I discovered that the culprit was in fact a generator together with construction work being carried out on the new tram line being laid on nearby O'connell Street. My nights sleep was over as were others. This hotel occupies a fantastic site very central for most activities, theatres etc. I would have no reservations whatsoever in returning to this property. However I will wait until this work is complete and ensure that the lift is fully operational before doing so.",3,2016,05,13
232,"A lot to like, but not without problems","I had read many reviews of Wynns, so let me preface mine with ""we were not disappointed"" because we were well informed.

Pros:  The location is really good.  Trams, shopping, restaurants, river and Temple Bar are all within easy reach of this location.  The service in the hotel was very good, from the front desk to the wait staff.  The breakfast (included) was top-notch and served in a really nice setting.  The room was small, but charming.  The bathroom nice.  

Cons:  Noisy in the front rooms (can't really be helped when located on a busy street with trams running by).  Bed configuration was a single with a double.  We (from US) found it odd that there were no ""queen only"" rooms.  Speaking of beds...  these were truly uncomfortable.  And that made for three nights of poor sleep, unfortunately.

Problems:  Day two, had no hot water for my shower.  Cool at best,  Front desk was apologetic, and next day had scalding hot.  Be forewarned.  The lifts were out of operation entire third day, and the morning of our checkout.  It's a long walk down the stairs with luggage.

As I said, we had done our research on this property.  Still, at a conversion rate equal to $175 per night, it wasn't the best that Dublin offers, but we still enjoyed our stay.",3,2016,05,13
232,Can't wait to arrive - pre trip planning a breeze with Wynn,"Searching for a hotel in Dublin was daunting,,, Wynn provided EXCELLENT help and reservation.   We cannot wait to arrive...  We do arrive early in the morning from the US.  And the Wynn has offered to accommodate if possible.  I called the hotel directly and they were so very kind.",5,2016,05,10
232,Maybe the oldest Dublyn's hotel,"Amazing location just near by Spire. The building is really old and make feel you on old way environment. Beautiful room, absoluty cleant and all on tidy. Very polite waitress (they speak also gaelic) and delicious breakfast in a big room. You can taste there really huge range of typical irish food but also multietnic. Delicious sweets, posh formitures. Romantic, i raconmended especially for couple :)",5,2016,05,09
232,"Great location, a bit pricey, unpredictable breakfast","The Wynn's hotel is in a great location one block north of the river. Close walk to Custom House, Trinity College, Temple Bar, etc... Rooms are nice, large bed. Tiny bathroom, but nothing out of the ordinary for European standards. The breakfast was good the first day and terrible the second. There is a basic buffet of breads, fruit and juice. You then order your entree off the menu.  Staff was friendly and helpful. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, but it was a bit overpriced for the overall experience. ",4,2016,05,06
232,"Nice Hotel, bad customer service :(","My Husband and I recently stayed in Wynns Hotel, as we have a special needs child a trip away is a rare thing for us and we were looking forward to our 2 night stay in the hotel and visiting the sights of Dublin. The Hotel itself has a very olde world charm, table service for breakfast, slow old lift and actual keys for the bedroom door, not a key card, very charming.
 When we arrived the receptionist asked if she could take my card details and I said I would pay the bill then to avoid delays on check out. So I paid my bill in full on arrival.
Sadly the next morning we had a phone call and had to return home immediately so I went to the desk and informed the receptionist, so they could sell the room again that night.
I asked if perhaps I could get a refund for the night we were not staying and she looked at her computer screen and said, ""oh, you have already paid in full"" I said ""yes I have"" to which she said ""sorry I cannot refund you, I f you had not paid yet I would only charge for 1 night but you have already paid, there is nothing I can do""
I asked to see a manager and of course he wasn't available but I was given a Hotel business card and told to ring or email him about it and he might give me a discount next time I stayed in the Hotel!
I tried to ring him several times since arriving home but he never seems to be at work, so I emailed 4 days ago, to which I have not had a reply.
I guess I wont be getting any of my €318 back. What a shame as the Hotel itself is charming and the Breakfast was quiet good, even though we did have to queue for 15 minutes outside the dining room.",3,2016,05,05
232,"Convenient location, quaint hotel, great bargain","This hotel is located within two blocks of a shuttle that takes you from the airport to the center of Dublin. (O'Connell Street stop). In terms of choices, the breakfast spread is more than ample -- scones, cereal, yogurt, porridge, but you can also order eggs, pancakes, and even the dreaded blood pudding. It is a short walk to the center of Dublin. The staff is extremely competent and friendly; departing at 4:30 AM, I was nonetheless offered a continental breakfast served by a delightful night porter. The rooms are lovely. The only downside: it is an older property, so the elevator is small and slow. And, in a very expensive city, the price was extremely reasonable.",5,2016,05,04
232,Lovely hotel,"Wynns is a lovely hotel. The staff were really helpful and pleasant, the room was great . breakfast was really good and not the usual buffet style. The hotel is so central to everything in Dublin city centre. We would stay here again.",5,2016,05,01
232,back again still fab,we returned to the wynns again from 18 until 21 of april staff brll rooms great food and service perfect  i cant find anything negative to say long may they continue its a great base for dublin it just feels like a hotel should its not ultra modern but it allways feels fresh and clean,5,2016,04,29
232,Almost Perfect!,Stayed here for a weekend recently. It was so busy with a first communion party I was a little out of my depth when I was checking in . Lift was chaotic and smelled of smoke. But the hotel was back to normal next day:-)  Our room was excellent!  Reception staff could be more friendly and helpfull as the dinning room staff were top class. The dinning room is delightful old world so it would be nice if  they could served  the toast as the self serving toaster & plastic cereal containers takes from the ambience!  Manager gave off a stressful aura maybe he needs extra help. Will stay again ;-),4,2016,04,28
232,"A classic oldie, but a good choice","Wynn's Hotel opened in 1845, and I bet much of the original hotel is still in place. Think of a stay here as nostalgic.
The hotel is in a very good location, about fifty steps from O'Connell Street, and a five minute walk to Temple Bar.
When you walk through the front door, you can't help but to feel like you have just stepped back in time. The lobby and front desk say, ""I'm old, but I'm proud of my age and appearance."" Off of the lobby on one side is a traditional looking bar and lounge area, and off the other side of the lobby is a small but grand dining room. There is one old, wood paneled elevator to service the hotel. It is a bit slow, so you have to have some patience. Even the room keys are old. They use actual keys with a heavy brass ball attached to it.
Our room was neat and clean, including the bathroom. The shower was the typical size by European standards. There was plenty hot water and good water pressure. We had a double room. The size was adequate, and not cramped. We had room to open large suitcases. The bed was comfortable with a heavy duvet.
Our room faced the front of the building, and sometimes at night an occasional siren or loud motorcycle could be heard. The tram passes by in the street in front of the building, and when it does, a faint rumble can be heard. For me, none of this noise was overwhelming, and none of it disturbed my sleep.
I liked the nostalgic feel of this hotel, and I liked the location. And although it is old, it seems to be well maintained. I would stay here again.",4,2016,04,28
232,"Small  room, but big on service","The room was small, well appointed and clean, but had no view.  Bed was comfortable.  The breakfast was great, cooked to order along with a small buffet.  The staff was wonderful.  I drove the wrong way down the one way street the hotel is located on and one of the staff came out and directed me to a parking place where he then took our car to their car park.  Even explained the predicament to the police for me!",5,2016,04,27
232,Outdated rooms but comfy ,"I stayed here for 2 days on my Ireland trip . The male receptionist was kinda rude (maybe because I arrived at 5am?) ; the room was nice but a bit outdated , the toilet handle had to be held down to flush for 5 seconds before it would work (there is a sticker on the actual toilet if you forget). All in all , a nice hotel in a great part of Dublin ",3,2016,04,27
232,Fabulous Weekend Within walking distance of Temple Bar Area,We visited Wynns this weekend 22nd - 24th April .... We were a party of 13 on a Hen Party .... When we arrived Friday early morning two of the rooms were ready and we were able to leave bags and head off for breakfast and the Temple bar area .... The Hotel was a little old fashioned with the oldest slowest lift ever but the rooms were clean and comfortable (cleaners were fab and fast) Check in was fab and only a couple of the younger girls were a bit miserable Majority were fab ... Breakfast was lovely service being excellent we felt really welcome and had a good chat both days ... Bar area is good although used by the general public too we received good service and were make to feel welcome again ....... check out is 12 which is fab for chilling as our flight was not till 4pm ..... I would definitely recommend this hotel to others ........ Oh and heads up the gates are shut at midnight and if your back after that it's a little bit of a hassle to get back in ... a key or fob for guests may be a good idea ...,4,2016,04,26
232,"""Easter Parade""","Brilliant spot for family overnight stay Easter weekend. Hotel was warm clean and comfortable and ;dated' decor  was just the ticket for our three generation clan. The staff were exceptional, friendly and very helpful as we were travelling with a wheelchair. The food especially  full Irish breakfast was fantastic and the buzz around the bar and building was very welcome. This was our first time in Wynns and will not be the last as it trumped our previous haunts.",5,2016,04,25
232,Perfect,Stay here if you want a great location and like to step back in time. This places had loads of history. Service was great from reception to breakfast by local staff. Nothing was to much trouble. Our room 525 was bit small but very clean and comfortable for our 1 night stay. Trams out front bit noisy but you are in a city so what do you expect.,5,2016,04,25
232,Excellent value,From the old school but elegant charm of this hotel to the exceptional service and breakfast which is free this hotel ticks all the boxes. It's central location makes it perfect for a place to stay for sightseeing and shopping in Dublin.  They also have a lunchtime check out.,4,2016,04,25
232,Long weekend in Dublin ,"Nice hotel, good location for getting around the area. Tram line is right outside which is useful. Nice rooms, good size bed. And clean. breakfast was nice, with a good choice, but asked restaurant manager for vegetarians sausage the day before  for breakfast the next. And they didn't have them for the next day. So what the point of asking for something.  All in all, nice hotel.",4,2016,04,25
232,Old school charm.,Old school charm at the Wynns. Just be aware the bar at the front of Wynns parties all night on the weekends. It's very loud but other than that. We had a great time. The breakfast that comes with your room is great.,4,2016,04,20
232,"Convenient, comfortable, friendly staff",We stayed 2 nights here on vacation.  It was easy to get to from the Dublin airport by the Airlink 747 with the stop at O'Connell St being less than a block away.  It is a short walk over the Ha'Penny bridge to reach Temple Bar or Trinity College.  Breakfast was yummy and quick served in a lovely dining room.  We had no wait either morning at 9.30.  check in was prompt and we got our room at 2.00.  The area is well lit and busy so we always felt safe.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The room was good sized by Dublin standards and the bed was very comfortable.  It was a bit chilly in the room in the evening but the bedding was so comfy it didn't matter.  It has an elevator - good news when have lot of luggage,5,2016,04,14
232,Old-time charm,"Great place to stay when visiting Dublin. Excellent service , clean rooms, lovely atmosphere .Full irish breakfast was absolutely stunning . The situation is one of best in Dublin, everything just behind the corner.",5,2016,04,12
232,Very convenient location,"Stayed Friday night past. Valet parking,spacious room and just off O'Connell Street. Very handy for some quick sight seeing and not too far from Temple Bar and the Olympia Theatre were we attended a concert that evening. ",4,2016,04,10
232,What a shamw,"The location, old world charm and service at this hotel are all great. What has completely spoilt our visit is the fact that the hotel holds functions (birthday parties) that go on until 1am at the earliest and it is impossible to go to bed before the end of the function as it sounds as if the DJ is sitting at the end of your bed. If you are happy to stay up until about 1.30 am then you will be fine, otherwise stay somewhere else. What a shamw but definitely not coming back.",2,2016,04,09
232,Afternoon tea,"Slow service, one waitress very polite and competent but run off her feet until belatedly joined by male colleague who gave instructions. Very limited selection of cakes. Nice coffee and tea at a reasonable price but strange to have table service and be asked to pay before anything else. Ambience and company good. Decor and furnishings not so good.",2,2016,04,08
232,Excellent customer service and location; shame about the room.,"Stayed for 1 night. The hotel is in an excellent location; close to all transport links and sightseeing locations.  The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and friendly.   Breakfast was nice with efficient and friendly service.  The hotel is old and traditional  but that didn't bother us, however the room was a let down. The room was tiny and cold but as we were only staying for 1 night we didn't ask to change. The room was clean  and it did include a safe, fridge and tea and coffee facilities  and the bathroom was nice but the room was so small for 2 people you couldn't really spend any time in there. The room should only be used for a single traveller.   It also only had a small heater  which took ages to heat the room as it was blocked by the window sill and curtains.  The stairs was also out of use during our stay due to decorating on the first floor and was only allowed to use the lift to get to the 5th floor. The problem was there was only 1 lift and it wasn't working when we first arrived. It didn't take long to fix it but I was very concerned about the safety if there was a fire. I would stay here again but only if I had a different larger room and the stairs were back in use. I would have given it 4 stars if the room had been better.",3,2016,04,07
232,Overnight Stay,"My wife and I spent a very enjoyable afternoon and night in Wynn's Hotel recently. We had booked two tickets for The Plough and the Stars play in the Abbey Theatre which is just a stones throw away. We had a lovely carvery meal there and a beautiful breakfast the next morning. The breakfast was particularly satisfying as it was freshly cooked and served piping hot to our table. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the room while a bit cramped was still comfortable.",4,2016,04,06
232,Charming & Elegant ,"Visited Wynns during 1916 centenary celebrations and it was very busy but the customer service was the same high standard as usual. We sat in the lounge and had coffee, tea and scones which were delicious and enjoyed the ambience and charm of a bygone era. Most of the staff were in period costume for the occasion as well as many of the patrons. Great occasion, great hotel, well done. ",5,2016,03,30
232,A gem in the heart of Dublin where custom isn't taken for granted!,"Past experience of hotels during holiday weekends and national events has usually been one where custom has been taken for granted. Not at Wynn's hotel! Despite a major historical event taking place in Dublin when business would be guaranteed, staff were extremely helpful, pleasant and accommodating. We had booked several rooms for a family weekend away and our request to have our rooms together and in a quiet location were accommodated. I'm normally a poor sleeper in hotel rooms, but I slept soundly every night. Although not the most modern of décor, this only lent itself to the charm and atmosphere of hotel. The food was good, the Guinness some of the best in Dublin, and I challenge anyone to find better eggs benedict! Wynn's has now become our accommodation of choice for Dublin.",5,2016,03,29
232,"Great staff, rooms and hotel",Great stay at Wynn's hotel. The staff was incredibly helpful and kind. The room was very nice and clean and the location was very nice. A higher end hotel then what I had been used to backpacking around Europe was a great change!,5,2016,03,29
232,Restaurant Review excellent,"We did not stay here, but we dined here for Easter Dinner.  The food, service and dining room ambience were all excellent.  Such nice staff making guests feel welcome and accomodating on the food items.

Our next stay in Dublin will be at Wynn.",5,2016,03,27
232,perfect city location,"i had lunch here and was very good value, the service was excellent the general decor was wark and dated. this hotel is very convenient for the luas. i found the service very friendly and efficient. i am looking forward to another visit soon",4,2016,03,21
232,Old fashioned service the way it should be,"For us this is the only place to stay in Dublin, everything about it exudes that feeling of wonderful service & hospitality. This is how all hotels should be run & so rarely are!
Everything from reception, the rooms, the Saints & Scholars Bar, breakfast...I could just go on....it is just wonderful & we are planning out 4th stay there already",5,2016,03,21
232,Nice Lunch,"Recently had lunch here while visiting Dublin city. This hotel is in a very convenient location, the Luas stops directly outside it. Had a three course lunch with tea here for €25.00, the food was lovely and the service was fantastic.",4,2016,03,20
232,Are 3rd Visit!,"Stayed here for the 3rd time during the St Patrick day festival. We sent the hotel an email a week before we where due stay requesting a bigger room then are previous visits. To the hotels credit they emailed back saying they would try thier best to accommodate are request and they delivered!
This is a great vintage looking hotel which is clean throughout! The rooms are spotless and tidy and the bathroom was  spacious.
Staff are faultless and try thier best to make your stay as pleasent and stress free as possible. Reception staff are friendly and helpful. The resturant staff get a 10/10 due service and quality of food. The Irish breakfasts are the best in the city and is one of the reasons we keep coming back. The hotel bar staff and cleaning staff are also fantastic and do a good job.
Overall this is a hotel I'd recommend to anyone of all ages. We will be definitely be returning next year for St Patrick day and wouldn't think of booking any where else in Dublin.",5,2016,03,19
232,Perfect hotel in a perfect location,What a fab stay we had here for The wednesday night before paddys. Room was perfect spotless and quiet at night. Rooms are a little dated but that dosnt bother me at all as they are in tip top shape hallways service everything on point. Had the most amazing breakfast next morning a freshly cooked fry and choice of other breakfast treats the man serving us had the best customer service and nothing to him was a bother you wouldnt get the service we had here in a 5 star I will be making a trip back here again for sure.,5,2016,03,18
232,Central location,"Stayed at this hotel whilst working on O'connell Street at the top of the road, this is a very well located hotel right in the centre of Dublin. Everything you will need to see is within easy walking distance and the hotel is full of old charm, staff are fantastic- nothing too much trouble, the guy on reception even hopped in car to show parking area. Rooms very comfortable with everything required for a good stay.Guiness in bar superb, breakfast next day excellent. Recommended!",4,2016,03,15
232,Excellent ,Great location. ..Central to everything with the luas passing it's door...couldn't be handier...The hotel itself is so professionally run..staff wer so helpful and friendly. ..rooms were spotless...I was with a group of 5 and each of us will return again no doubt ,5,2016,03,15
232,"""A Dublin delight in a great central location""","My friend and I spent a week at the Wynn's Hotel. The breakfasts, front desk personal, our room and the hotel's location was Perfect for our first Irish experience. A great shower too. We will return and will request a room away from the first floor meeting room where music at an event was rather loud til 1 am our first night, but this is the only complaint. The breakfast servers were so lovely and accommodating. Great historical hotel!",5,2016,03,14
232,"Relaxing, and comfortable!","I loved staying at the Wynn's Hotel.  The rooms are cozy, the bed is so comfortable (don't turn the heat on, the bedding is more than enough!!), the breakfast is delicious!  The location is ideal, and close to everything!",5,2016,03,14
232,Hotel prices Guest House standard,"This hotel was a bit of a let down considering the price. It's the 2nd time I have been to Dublin and wanted to stay in a proper hotel so went for what was rated as upmarket to ensure I didn't end up in something which was just catering for the stag and hen crowd. The hotel rooms were very small indeed. I have not stayed in anything this small which claims to be a Hotel. This was little more than a guest house and seemed to me we had the smallest room in the place. The bathroom was so small you could not sit straight whilst on the toilet and you could not stand straight in front of the bathroom sink because it was stuck in the corner and there was a box section for drainage under the sink which was almost half the size of the tiny sink. When you opened the wardrobe door you could not get into the bathroom as it blocked the doorway.  I'm not a tall individual at 5'7"" but the bed was tiny with my feet at the bottom of the bed I had to put pillows on the floor as there was no room for them. There was only about a foot of space either side of the bed and I doubt whether the bed was even a standard sized double to fit into the space. The air con unit didn't work and so an electric heater had been put in the room to compensate but that only made the place more cramped. The facade and the pictures from outside give the impression that this is a large hotel but it's not. The restaurant is small and the bar is of average size. This hotel clearly caters for older guests and is decorated in accordance with an old world feel which does not fit with modern hotel standards. 
The Saints and Scholars bar and restaurant provided a carvery lunch which was ok but a bit like a works canteen although it was reasonable value for money. There is obviously a demand for this hotel among the ageing travellers of this world but those of you who want a touch of luxury and space should look elsewhere. 
There were some positives for the hotel, the breakfast was of a good standard and the rooms were clean and tidy. Staff were pleasant and helpful but the size of the room did not justify the price paid. ",2,2016,03,08
232,Not worth the visit,"Stopped here for food before a play round the corner, ordered what was described as an oriental turkey stirfry with veg, nuts etc. What arrived can only be described as like a stew. Zero spice or oriental veg or nuts. Was very hungry so ate in. Unsatisfied I ordered a starter when I finished the main. A crab / salmon mix. Found plastic in it and informed the waiter, asked him to take it back also. Came back later to apologise and offered another choice, drink etc which I politely declined. Also informed me it wasn't the chef's fault for some reason?? Will not be returning. ",1,2016,03,06
232,Old fashioned  historical charm,"I love this quaint spot and have stayed several times for fun in the heart of Dublin 
Right next to O 'Connel street and the historic GPO.  This hotel is a little jewel in the city. I love the jaqussi bath tubs hmmmmmm I love the rooms too. So cozy. I'm from Dublin and recommend this hotel for lots of reasons.",4,2016,03,05
232,"Excellent friendly staff, very good hotel in brilliant position","Nothing was too much trouble for the staff at Wynns and everything they did was with a smile, from dropping off our cases 4 hrs early to re-opening our bedroom safe.and providing brilliant advice about Dublin itself. The central position of the hotel between the shopping district and Temple Bar was fantastic with everything close at hand, even a small supermarket next door.  The hotel was bright and airy and retains much of its charm  from the turn of last century. Visiting in Feb it was cold outside, but the hotel was lovely and warm throughout,and spotlessly clean. The bedroom was well equipped and the bed very, very comfortable so much so my wife enquired about the bed topper and she is looking to buy one this week. The only minor downside of the bedroom was the slight noise from outside air-conditioning units. The complimentary breakfast was unbelievable, and ranks amongst the best I have ever had. We had the full cooked breakfast and it was so expansive that I couldn't even manage any toast (and I was still nice and full until tea time) The vegetarian option  looked amazing too but the full cooked on the first morning kept us on the same path. It was also nice to see plenty of staff on hand, never obtrusive  and always willing to give you the time of day with a smile. All in all a fantastic place to stay and when we go back to Dublin, Wynns Hotel booking will be first on the itinery.. Thank you Wynn's",4,2016,03,01
232,First time to Dublin,"Well placed hotel close to everything you need. The shops, Temple Bar, Luas and walking distance to most sights of interest.

Hotel is clean and comfortable, decor is abit dated but hey who cares when everything else is top notch! The breakfast is a good spread and nothing is too much trouble!",4,2016,02,29
232,Simply a great weekend hotel,"Stayed here previously in 2000ish and as soon as I walked through the door I realised why I loved the place, friendly receiption, great bar, rooms perfect for a few nights away and located less than 10 mins walk from shopping and temple bar. Other bonuses was a cash point outside and a really good Spar Supermarket to pick bits up. And finally the breakfast yum yum.",5,2016,02,23
232,Old Fahioned Hospitality,Extremely courteous and knowledgeable staff. All meals were excellent; breakfast was plentiful and where appropriate served hot. Rooms clean and roomy! Evening in the bar were busy - this is a very popular hotel for travellers and locals alike!,4,2016,02,18
232,Enjoyable stay!,"Arrived on 13th February at 10.30 and to our delight our room was ready despite confirmation showing check in was not before 2pm. We were on 5th floor and our room was huge. It was very comfortable, cosy and warm. Breakfast was tasty with a varied menu and tastes to suit all. The staff are very welcoming and nothing too much trouble. We would definitely stay again. ",4,2016,02,15
232,Highly recommend this hotel for both position and great staff.,"Stayed for two nights Fri to Sun, with our family arriving on the Saturday to surprise my husband. They were extremely accommodating by letting them check into their room early in the morning. Hotel staff are excellent and so helpful. Hotel is in a great position and the breakfast was amazing. Highly recommend this hotel. Definitely stay here again.",5,2016,02,15
232,Six Nations Ireland v Wales weekend accommodation,"We (as in total  numbering 57!) were given our usual biennial warm welcome by all the staff I crossed paths with during my three night stay at the Wynns last weekend, Seeing so many familiar faces around on each visit goes without saying anything - and the atmosphere within for the match was as 'electrical' as ever. My personal room I would give loads of starts to and subsequently the room number I will  'store'  for my return in 2 years time! Provision of choice menus ,tasty snacks,  nibbles  or bar meals ,or the restaurant availability was great in catering for the differing needs of  visitors and individuals ,promptly delivered and available throughout the day.",5,2016,02,14
232,Evening meal with friends,"Met with a large group of friends for a reunion, had a lovely meal in the restaurant, food was very good and reasonably priced for Dublin City centre.  The dinning room was full  of old charm and tastefully decorated. The staff couldn't do enough for us all, considering the hotel was full, the night before the six nations rugby.
I would highly recommend this Hotel",5,2016,02,09
232,Lovely hotel and perfect location,"We stayed here for a night after flying into Dublin airport and it was the perfect location. Right off O'Connel street and right by tram lines and bus stops. Also only ten minutes from Houston train station. 
The hotel was really quaint and decorated really nicely. Bed was supercomfy. Room was a bit cold but then we figured how to turn on the radiator and it was cosy. 
The breakfast in the morning was really good. You could pick a main breakfast from the menu which was tasy and had good vegetarian options and then you could help yourself to toast, cereals and the continental foods. 
All in all, handy location and good value!",4,2016,02,05
232,Weekend success 😀,"Excellent hotel and excellent staff. 
Very clean and tidy hotel 
Location is perfect in the heart of Dublin 
Only a short walk to the main temple bar night life. 

Lovely breakfast to boot.  

Would recommend anytime 
Would be my first choice of hotel if visiting again 

Thanks wynns. ",5,2016,02,01
232,The Cold,"I love Wynns, a Dub myself I have been having a drink here for years... Lovely staff, very central, trad decor.... But bloody cold ...  Saw people( including myself) with coats scarfs and hats on whilst having a drink... Went elsewhere tonight, couldn't take the cold. Why not light the fire? Sort out the heating? ",5,2016,01,31
232,Quaint but nice,"I stayed here whilst travelling on business and after a long day I was glad to check in to Wynns. It has a fabulous location right next to a Luas stop which was handy for my heavy bags and also within walking distance of theatres and Temple Bar etc once you have dropped the bags off. Check in was smooth and I was allocated a room at the top of the hotel. When I went into my room it was spotless, very cosy and there was fresh fruit waiting for me. Some might consider the hotel a little old fashioned style wise but I loved it and considered it quaint. The customer service was old school too which was really nice as some hotels can be a bit impersonal (you also have to leave the key in when going out and collect it again on the way back). The bed was comfy and I had a great night's sleep. Breakfast the next day was lovely. I was a bit perturbed as there seemed to be a bit of a queue when I arrived but it moved quickly. Unlike most places these days there was table service rather than a buffet and the staff were good craic. The full Irish was great and I would consider myself a bit of a connisseur. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,01,30
232,Perfect location and great staff,I stayed here for 4 nights over New Years as a solo traveler and it was great. I arrived very early in the morning and I sent them an email to notify them and I was able to check in at that time. The staff were very warm and welcoming.  The gentleman at the bar was very friendly and there seemed to be a lot of regulars there. The rooms were old fashioned in a cozy way and the bathroom was newly renovated which looked great. Wifi was a little slow but not too bad.  I found the the location to be very convenient to walk just about anywhere. The breakfast and the breakfast room was wonderful! I would definitely stay again.,4,2016,01,26
232,Win for Wynn's!,"Not long return from a two night stay. Lovely hotel in a pretty unrivalled location. Staff were all very courteous. Our room was incredibly comfortable, packed with all the essentials.

I'll be back, I think!",5,2016,01,25
232,Great Location for a city centre jaunt,"You can do no wrong with staying at the Wynns if you are looking for a hotel on the city centre's doorstep.

I stayed in the hotel the Saturday before Christmas. I got a great rate on the room, which was surprising given it's location.The hotel is located right beside the Abbey Street Luas, right off O'Connell Street. The busy shopping area of Henry Street is a short walk from it as well. At the time of booking, anything at a lower cost was essentially a hostel.

Admittedly, the reception area is small enough. Luckily it wasn't too busy on the day but it could get rather crowded quickly on a busy day I reckon. Not a whole the hotel can do about that given the age of the building however. We were quickly seen to and to my amazement, I actually got a key for the room.

Not a keycard, an actual key. On that note, I have to say, the keyring was a tad excessive - pretty big and weighed quite a bit. On the bright side, there was no chance I was going to lose it!

The room itself made the most of the limited space it had (compared to modern hotels). Everything was neatly packed and the room easily fitted two beds. Our room faced out onto the Luas line, which had me concerned about noise. This didn't turn out to be an issue as when the windows were closed, there was ample noise dampening. However the blackout curtains were awkward, refusing the close over on one side. Given that it was just a one night stay, that wasn't an issue.

Breakfast was included in the rate, and this is where it definitely felt more upper class. Our orders were taken and served to us directly. Staff were attentive, always on hand in case we needed something. The breakfast was good, and as with most hotels, there is plenty of options available depending on your tastes.

In my experience, the hotel was very well kept. The decor is in keeping with its historic setting in the heart of Dublin. The main hall that was used for breakfast (to the right when you enter the building) particularly stood out. Staff were pleasant, from the servers to the night doorman who you will meet if you are returning in the early hours of the morning.

It is also worth mentioning that if there is no parking available, which isn't a surprise given it's location. I personally used the Q-Park at Clery's, which is about a five minute walk as they offered a flat 24-hour rate for parking. For those travelling in by public transport, I previously mentioned that the hotel is right beside the Luas stop. It's location beside O'Connell street also means a taxi or bus is never too far away.

I would definitely consider the Wynn if I was to have an overnight stay in Dublin. It has a fantastic location, a welcoming atmosphere and well worth the money compared to other nearby locations.",4,2016,01,24
232,Great Location & Service,"The Wynn is a great option that gives you the feel of historic Dublin with friendly service at an affordable price in the center of Dublin. Located just 2-3 blocks from Ha'penny Bridge, popular Temple Bar area and a great little restaurant, the Winding Stair.",4,2016,01,19
232,Best Location,"My Mum and I stayed for two nights 8 to 10 Jan. Staff on check in were friendly and had received our request for a quiet room. we were in a twin room 416 which was very clean and comfortable. 
The location of the hotel is excellent. Close to many nice places to eat. (Steak in Toddys,  Gresham hotel is recommended.) In addition you are close to all the shops so the hotel is convenient for nipping back with bags and refuelling. 
The hotel's decor is quite classic and adds to the charm. On the Saturday morning we had about a 15/20 minute wait for breakfast but on the Sunday morning we got a table immediately. Breakfast was plentiful with a cooked to order breakfast in addition to a selection of cereals, fruits and pastries, 

I only have two criticisms of the hotel. 1. the hairdryer in the bathroom is fine for someone with short hair but thats it. The handle also gets very very hot when it is in use. We called down to reception and a proper hairdryer was brought to our room. So this was resolved quickly. 

Our only other complaint was the shower. The shower head was completely drooped    so you had to put the shower on and attempt to position the shower head to be able to wash your hair. Pressure and temperature on the Saturday morning were awful with the pressure disappearing completely at one point. Didn't make for the nicest of experiences and did let the room down as everything else was perfect. 

In saying that for the price, location and cleanliness of the rooms we would probably return. However i would hope the showers are replaced soon.",4,2016,01,18
232,Beautiful hotel,"One of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in.  The atmosphere is terrific,  the decor is tasteful,  the temperature was spot on. Breakfast was gorgeous,  two of everything cooked, which was hugh. The cold breakfast buffet was help yourself and you can eat as much as you want. Also had a sandwich in the bar later, wonderful presentation,  fresh and filled very well. Rooms, small but  comfotable, and no noise to keep us awake all nught. Great location.",5,2016,01,16
232,Great Central Hotel,"The hotel is based in the city centre, within walking distance to many attractions and many transport links on the door step. The hotel was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was basic but plentiful. In the whole a great hotel and would stay again.",5,2016,01,12
232,As expected - excellent,"Our third visit to Wynn’s Hotel, our hotel of choice in the city centre. We arrived at around 13.00 & our room wasn’t ready so, we left our bags at reception & went for snacks in the hotel bar which was full to capacity with people having lunch. We waited for approx. five minutes & a table became available. We were attended to quickly & enjoyed coffees & the soup of the day. Back to reception & our room was ready, so a quick, friendly & informative check in & up the lift to our 5th floor room. Old style in shape & décor with carpet floor, panelled & wallpapered walls, not a massive room but still okay & with all the things needed for a weekend for two. Wardrobe, safe, iron & board, fridge, tea/coffee, wall mounted tv, luggage rack, work desk & chair, very comfortable double bed, bedside lockers, over bed reading lights & smoke alarm. A good sized window gave plenty of natural light & very good blackout blinds totally blocked that light out in the morning. No noise issues from inside or outside of the hotel which along with the great bed & blackout blinds, meant sleep quality was excellent. The room was heated by a wall mounted electric heater which, to be honest, we had to turn right down as the room was much too warm for us. Four spare electrical sockets in the room, handy for those guests with a lot of gadgets to keep charged.
The bathroom was a really good size, clean with tiled floor & part tiled/part painted walls. With a bath, bath/shower mixer, glass shower screen, small bottles of conditioning shampoo & bath/shower gel, large mirror, hairdryer, dual voltage shaving socket, towel heater, plenty of towels & ceiling vent. We had real issues with the shower, specifically the hot water which we couldn’t seem to regulate & which also was a problem at the wash hand basin were it took twenty to thirty seconds before any water appeared after turning the tap on. I reported this to reception on checking out where all was noted & I was assured that the issue would be addressed. 
Breakfast, as per our previous stays, was excellent. Served from 07.30 to 10.30, we went down at 09.50 & all tables were taken & another couple were also waiting to be seated. Within 5 minutes, both they & us were seated. With two or three staff on duty we were attended to very quickly for our choices from the made to order menu offering porridge, full fry, kippers, egg Benedictine, grilled goats cheese, pancakes, tea, coffee, café latte & cappuccino. From the self- service, orange, apple & grapefruit juices, cereals, yoghurts, grapefruit & orange segments, melon pieces, prunes, scones, croissants, toast & also, a choice for vegetarians.
We stopped off in the bar for night caps & it was quite busy but we managed to get seated immediately. Wifi was free with a password given when checking in. Very quick & consistent, we didn’t lose connection even once on our phones & laptop. All staff that we encountered were excellent, all were friendly, helpful & attentive. Since our last visit a gym has been installed. I didn’t visit it & so, I cannot comment on it. There is an internet station down one floor from reception. With a printer, handy for printing boarding passes etc, it cost one Euro for ten minutes but there was an out of order notice on it during our stay. Checking out was quick & friendly & as we had a few hours to kill, we left our luggage which was tagged & stored securely, free of charge. 
The location is a real plus for us, Bus Aras is hardly any more than a five minute straight line walk, Grafton Street ten to fifteen minute walk, oConnell Street just metres away & the shops of Henry Street a two to three minute walk away. I visited Kilmainham Jail using the Abbey Luas stop just metres from the hotel & getting off at Heuston. I returned using the Suir Rd stop which proved to be a much closer stop to the jail  than Heuston was or than James stop would have been. The return ticket cost was 4.10 Euros. Also & just short walks from the hotel, we ate excellent meals at Koh Asian/Thai Restaurant & had drinks in the excellent  Gin Palace Bar.
Funnily enough as I’m writing this review, Wynns has just appeared in a foot chase scene on tv, in a movie called Haywire, I didn’t expect that.",5,2016,01,10
232,Two nights December break,"This hotel is in a great location if visiting Dublin by train as the luas from hueston station stops right out side.
The lady  who checked us in was very friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for us even holding our luggage in a room after we checked out  ,she is a real asset to the hotel .
We stayed in room 374 which was a good size for a city centre hotel and was very comfortable.
The breakfast was a bit hit and miss, on the Tuesday morning after the bank holiday  it was very poor with the scrambled eggs well over done and the bacon swimming in a pool of water , saying that on the following morning it was excellent with fresh eggs crispy bacon and croissants that would melt in your mouth. Overall it was a very enjoyable stay",4,2016,01,06
232,Lovely hotel!!,"I loved this hotel and would definitely stay again. A lovely traditional feel with beautiful decor downstairs. The room was of a good standard, good bathroom & shower & toiletries. Hotel is in an excellent central location. Staff were very 'old school' in the best possible way- polite, accommodating, warm and friendly. I think what sets this apart from other hotels was the excellent staff. Breakfast was also plentiful and the cooked breakfast was delicious. Very happy! ",4,2016,01,02
232,Good reasonably-priced hotel,"Friendly, competent reception - finding booking, taking car for parking and returning at time arranged (we had an early-morning ferry to catch, so this mattered), checking that attractions open (this was the Christmas-New Year period).
Condition of room to a high standard. Bathroom extremely cramped. No hot water for several hours one morning when we wanted showers.
Breakfast hit-n-miss: we had to ask for new poached and fried eggs as both cooked rubber hard; this was done with good grace but the poached eggs had bits of eggshell in them the second time; my wife gave up on eggs at that stage...",3,2016,01,02
232,Slap Bang in the Centre!,"Unfortunately booking last minute for a peak weekend meant that I paid quite a high rate, but after that, the hotel fitted perfectly. Coming to Dublin by train meant we had the luas from Heuston right to the door, and attending a concert in the 3 Arena was an extension of this. Wynn's is located right in the middle of the city. We were right to the front on an upper floor, but noise was not an issue. Whilst quite a small room, it was furnished very nicely, perfectly clean and quite attractive. The bathroom was very spacious, and perfectly fitted. The only issues we had were with regard to the television - RTE (the Irish public broadcaster) didn't work - and the lighting in the vicinity of mirrors (or lack thereof): I found doing my makeup very awkward! Breakfast was lovely, in a very attractive old dining room, with quality food and very friendly staff. The bar too was a nice space. On the day we left, our bags were held for us, so all we had to do was call in the door and hop back on the luas! I will stay here again, but I will be more mindful of booking in advance.",4,2015,12,22
232,"spent 2 nights here,","lovely hotel, staff very good, food lovely, breakfast was great had a menu, really have what you want, bedrooms nice and clean, yes a little noisy but you are in the middle of the city, easy to get to from the air port, only thing that lets it down was no place to go and sit and relax, as it get busy in the evening's and only place to sit is in the bar area and as its very busy in there its wait for a seat, would return there again, enjoyed our stay, thank you Wynns hotel and staff,",4,2015,12,16
232,fresh and wholesome,Had the pleasure of dining with friends lately in the bar. food was delicious and the staff were friendly and very obliging. because there were a group of us the sat  us all up stairs in a meeting room which was beautiful.

232,Friends shopping,"No srating in foyer due 2 city centre Central location  Lisa outside front door  huge room for 3 two tv s  ornate cell ings old style hotel with character lovely breakfast great choice . Tasty dinner , friendly staff , good bar lively spot",4,2015,12,15
232,"Great hotel, excellent location, great staff","I booked this hotel based on the positive reviews of the hotel on tripadvisor and was glad that i did so,

the check in was smooth Ms. Andreea was very efficient and it was a hassle free check in, the room was good the bathroom was nice , the hotel has a olden charm which i love it has this high ceilings etc which makes it great,

the location was great right in the center and you can walk to several pubs and restaurants. lots of things to do.

Breakfast was great , they had one of the best breakfast i ever had in a 3 star hotel , hoeever the service could have been better in the breakfast but thats ok.

all in all for the price i paid it was more then what i expected , will surely come back here again when visiting Dublin again,

Thanks to Ms. Andreea and Ms. Roberta from front desk for their helpful nature they are brilliant.

great stay",5,2015,12,14
232,Never disappointed !!!!,"Stayed at Wynns end of November. This was the 9th time we had stayed at the hotel.

Great location just off OConnell St.

We flew into Dublin and got the Aircoach (return ticket €10) which stops outside the Gresham Hotel and it's a short walk along on that side to the hotel.

We arrived at just on 1000am and we were very lucky that our room was ready on the 3rd floor. Room is big enough with a double and single bed. Only a 14"" tv on the wall which the reception wasn't very good. Wifi was free throughout the hotel but signal is very poor.

Breakfast is lovely in the morning. Lots of choices hot food wise with various cereals.

Bar is good various drinks and very reasonable.

I would thoroughly recommend the hotel due to the locality and the breakfast. I think the wifi needs to be updated as does the tv to a larger one with modern features !!",5,2015,12,08
232,Comfortable Stay,"We arrived early one Friday afternoon and were greeted by pleasant receptionist, check in was quick and smooth. 

We had twin room on 3rd floor which was spacious, clean and had a great shower. Room had safe,which was a bonus and usual tea/coffee kit and iron and board. Whilst windows are double glazed we could hear some noise at night but wasn't an issue.

Breakfast, which was tasty and plenty full, was the only meal we ate due to evening commitments but the Hotel offers a full range of food.

3Arena (The Point) is 10 mins or 5 stops away by tram (Lucas) with Abbey Street station literary outside Hotel door. Alternatively you could take 30 min walk.

Residents bar is open late and would like to thank Dave the bar tender for great service, making us feel warm and welcome, whilst discussing the importance and influence U2.

Will defiantly stay again.",4,2015,12,07
232,"Great hotel , best location.","Just after returning home from a lovely, relaxing stay at this beautiful hotel. I love this hotel and I've stayed here many times because of its location, the comfort of the rooms, the extremely friendly staff and its wonderful old world charm. It ticks all the boxes for me when I stay in Dublin. So thank you to all the staff for the very friendly and warm welcome. I'll be back :)",5,2015,12,03
232,"Great hotel, old values, great location","Great room , not too hot which is so unusual...very comfortable. Great room service.clean modern shower room- no bath , but that was nota problem ,quiet hotel- no noise on corridors. Great dining room, breakfast cooked to order ,excellent service.",5,2015,12,02
232,Excellent,I stayed in wynns hotel with my husband for the weeken. The hotel is a good example of an old world experience in a cosmopolitan city. The room was spacious and very quiet high level and away from the bustle of the busy city. We had a fabulous dinner the first night and the service was friendly but efficient as was the ambiance in the bar.Well worth a visit.,5,2015,12,02
232,"Nice hotel, good location","Small rooms but clean, the rooms are not isolated from noises the room has a tea/coffee kit , breakfast is very good includes yogurt, fresh bread, scones and  fresh omlet , the staff are very kind and willing to assist",4,2015,12,01
232,A beautiful historical hotel,"A beautiful hotel near O'Connell Street. The breakfast room is particularly gorgeous, and the breakfast itself really good (try the full Irish breakfast). Without standing out, he room had all the necessary and was comfortable.",5,2015,12,01
232,ROBERTA SHOULD OWN IT,"I love this hotel, coz its right in the heart of dublin city centre, the luas stops outside the hotel, there is a shop next door and right across the road there is madigans pub if u wanted a change of scene. The hotel is basic, the rooms are sooooooooooooooo clean, thank u housekeeping. the man showing us to our tables was a true dublin man, great to hear the accent, he was so professional and pleasant. gentleman. the room was basic but had all we needed. tea and coffee and ironing facilities. now as for the reception, the girls were ok but on checking out the girl was amazing and soooooo happy, she would make u want to return, her name was roberta , a lovely happy girl i so hope wynns appreciates this lady, she would definately make you return. a man was in the lobby i dont really know what his title was. he wasnt a bell boy or anything like that but when my sister couldnt find the room he did not help her in any way, this i found unusual because in donegal , as a hotel worker myself i show a guest to their room no matter what i am doing, if they are lost or confused i think its only  polite. maybe he was a night porter. WHO KNOWS.",4,2015,11,30
232,"Great locaction, excellent breakfast","Old style hotel right in the city centre. Everything is walking distance. Public transport very close by. The room is a bit dated but not in a bad way. Beds comfortable, tea and coffee tray, ironing equipment in the room. Shower has very good water pressure and gets really hot. The full Irish breakfast was included in the rate and of excellent quality, the breakfast room is beautiful. There is also a bar which seems to be very popular, as well as a supermarket next door. Lots of restaurants and shopping in the area. Service was excellent, the lady at the reception (Italian?) was very helpful. The concierge will sort out parking for your car, should you need it. The only negative points are that it can be quite noisy from both the street and next door. Walls are on the thin side. Plus the free wifi signal is not great.
However, would go again as I had a very comfortable stay.",4,2015,11,29
232,Excellent!,"Just got back from very brief stay in Dublin and spent the night here.

All staff were really nice and friendly and the breakfast was excellent.As for the room I don't think I've slept in a more comfortable bed! 

The location is perfect,everything on your door step.

If I'm ever back to Dublin I will be staying here,cannot praise it enough and I only stayed 1 night!",4,2015,11,26
232,Fantastic 3 Night Stay,"My partner and I have just returned from an amazing 3 night stay at this hotel. Celebrating my partners 40th Birthday.  The hotel staff we ALL friendly (as have read some reviews that there were some miserable ones).  We checked in very quickly and we were looked after throughout our stay.
The breakfast is amazing and not to be missed.  The location is superb, easy access to Temple Bar and Grafton Street.
We will defintely stay again.",5,2015,11,24
232,Central Dublin location,"The location is great if you are needing to be close to a bus stop to go to the airport. The bus stop is around the corner on Eden Quay and is a couple of minutes walk to the hotel. The JJKavanaugh bus (from Waterford) will also stop at this Eden Quay bus stop. I had a couple of nights at this hotel, it has an olde world charm of a bygone era.
The bathroom was very clean and modern and my room overlooked the street and the trams weren't the quietest ones but it was the constant background 'gurgling' in possibly the central heating pipes that  had me intrigued.
The free breakfast that was offered with the booking was just fab - a full Irish. Unfortunately an early start the next morning meant I could only do one of those but the reception were very kind and offered a wake up call and a continentalbreakfast  in the dining room  before I took to the freezing cold of waiting for the airport bus on Eden Quay. There is no chance of you losing the key to this hotel's room as it is attached to a very substantial heavy brass engraved key stand.
The bar downstairs is handy for a drink but be aware that your choices of wine are red or white. During my stay, the clientele appeared to be mainly older (post pensioner) locals on holiday. Both the dining room and the old stylish rooms  makes it an atmospheric and central place to stay and I would definitely recommend. Note, I found the best rate to be booking directly through the hotels website (it offered that free breakfast).",5,2015,11,20
232,Well pleased,"My wife and myself have just spent an enjoyable few days at this hotel. We stayed in a 'standard' room which was a bit on the small side but spotless and comfortable.  A slight downside was the bed which was only 4' 6'' wide and could be classed as 'firm'.  
The breakfasts gave a good selection and the hot meals were cooked to order.  We also had one evening meal in the hotel during our stay and there was a good menu choice and was well priced.
The staff were all very helpful and pleasant.   
The hotel's central location was great and the LUAS tram stopped outside-a bonus.  It was on the Red route which meant Connolly Railway station could be reached in 5 minutes.  This tram was great for visiting the Guinness brew house.
All in all, an enjoyable stay and I would happily return.",4,2015,11,20
232,Great accomodations & location.,Great location...within walking distance to many attractions.  Quick walk from bus stop to/from airport.  Large rooms/bathrooms.  Very accommodating staff.  Many restaurants close by.  Great breakfast in the morning.,5,2015,11,14
232,Great location and restful stay,"After a busy week, it was nice to check into a room that was clean and comfortable. Fortunately I wasn't too bothered just having a brick wall as a view - at least it meant it would be quiet. The shower pressure was fine, coffee and tea was available, as was a safe. The TV was pretty limited and had few HD channels, but that's fine. The bar area was welcoming and friendly in the evening and the breakfast was great. A good start to the day. The location is very central - you can walk to most of the 'touristy' bits.The airport bus is very close and runs frequently. There is a screen in the Airlink bus that gives you the name of each stop so you know where you are. Overall a very nice stay. Thank you!",4,2015,11,13
232,Good location BUT,"Read trip advisor comments and decided that the location of the hotel outweighed a few negative comments about staff.  Well hotel is very central and all bar one member of staff efficient and polite. We went to the theatre and post theatre dinner.  When we returned to hotel at 11.45 gates in front of hotel locked???? We are in a capital city???? Night porter opened door but whilst he gave us our key nothing else was offered. We really fancied a night capand whilst we hinted and there were people in the bar but he ignored our conversation.

Room ok a little pokey and facing on to main road.  Double glazing effective but we wee unable to open a window to let air in to room. 

As for breakfast don't pay extra for it. The worst in all my years travelling to Ireland. Breakfast in ireland is generally a delightful something to enjoy for the rest of the day.  Well this was shockingly bad there was no remeeming feature none what so ever.  The dining room itself was charming, light and airy.

Overall I just felt that this is a hotel that could deliver much much more but to me it lacks direction. It's definitely no where near high end but with effort it could be up there and it is not low end (price dictates that 120 euro for night).  I suppose that is quite cheep for a central hotel. ",3,2015,11,10
232,Again and again and again.,"Stayed 7th September and had a wonderfull time again,having been there in July. Both times we were impressed by the friendly staff and their commitment to making our stay a wonderfull experience. We are returning 6th December to enjoy the Christmas lights,  some Christmas shopping and the whole hotel experience once again.",5,2015,11,08
232,Great Function and meal,"On 10/10/2015, the Dublin Branch of Manchester City Supporters Club celebrated our 40th Anniversary and we had our celebration in the Function room in Wynns Hotel. The Meal was fantastic, very tasty , hot and they catered for some members who had specific eating requirements. 
The staff were very helpful and the bar staff were were very efficient. Will come back again, Thanks to everyone at the Hotel. Reasonable price as well.",4,2015,11,08
232,Great hotel but...,"Upon checking out yesterday I was treated by the most unhelpful receptionist, a thin man in a suit, not sure of his name but i think it was along the lines Jerry. He was unpleasant to speak to and when I asked him a question, he grunted his response. I have a feeling this was because he was either drunk or extremely hungover due to the smell of booze off of him. Otherwise the hotel is in a great central location with very efficient staff (man in the black suit) with a gourmet breakfast. room was big and comfortable and had a great nights sleep after visiting the Guinness Storehouse, Kilmainham Gaol, and Dublin Castle. I will return to this hotel soon.",4,2015,11,08
232,Stay here every St Patricks Day!,"Chose the Wynns Hotel in 2014 for St Patricks Day. Was impressed by the location as it is situated right on O'Connell Street close to bars restaurants and also the river Liffey. Temple Bar is also a short walk from The Wynns. The hotel itself is very old fashioned but has a lot of character! The staff are very welcoming and friendly. Breakfast in the morning is superb! Traditional irish breakfast cooked to order and also a selection of cereals, fruit and pastries. Rooms are nice although the decor is pretty dated, the rooms have alot of character.",5,2015,11,05
232,Great hotel but poor customer service,"I'd previously stayed at Wynn's and had been very impressed by the service. The staff are nice and the location is excellent. They also cook breakfast to order. So why the one star review. We had booked 2 rooms to go to a concert in Dublin. Unfortunately a clash of events meant we had to cancel a week in advance. We knew that there was a no refund policy, and I was prepared to give our rooms to some friends of ours so as to not waste the money. However when my brother rang up he was told that they would keep the booking as credit for use at another time. So no problem. However they have now refused to honour this promise. I appreciate we haven't been very clever here, we should have got the commitment in writing but I feel that the hotel has behaved in a very poor way. We won't be staying there again.",1,2015,10,31
232,What a location!,"We chose Wynn's Hotel because of its proximity to the Abbey and Peacock Theatres, only a short block away.  Wynn's was also a great location for pubs, tour buses, and public transportation.  I loved the old world charm of the hotel and the lobby bar filled with people,night and day.  Breakfast in the hotel dining room looking out on the hustle and bustle of life in Dublin was memorable.  The Eggs Benedict are still lingering in my husband's memory.",5,2015,10,28
232,Excellent in 2015...can't afford it in 2016....very upset!,"Stayed at Wynn's Hotel for the last 7 years. An excellent value hotel. Rooms,staff,breakfast,bar all 1st class for a 3 star hotel.
Always reserve rooms for March the year before around this time.
2016 room prices are a massive increase of 50% on 2015 prices.
My friends and I cannot afford Wynn's next year.",5,2015,10,23
232,Greta location to see Dublin,"4 of us, men, spent 2 nights there for a days racing at Naas.
Staff, room, food and bar where all very good. Perfectly located to get to a great selection of bars, restaurants and local attractions, what more do you want.
We have visited Dublin on many occassions but this was the first time at Wynn's, it will not be that last.",4,2015,10,22
232,Dead Centre. ..dead handy,"Stayed one night in Wynns last week. Great old world hotel with everything you need in the centre of Dublin. Rooms are fine...not huge but comfy...and warm. Only one issue was my shower flipped between hot and cold. ..brrr...
Breakfast was very good.  Would I stay again...most definitely ",4,2015,10,21
232,Top class service,"Was at a function in the hotel . The staff ,service and food were all top class couldn't fault anything  . Would recommend the hotel for  your function whatever the occasion . It's  so central to the city centre also. ",5,2015,10,20
232,"Cosy  and a bit old, in central Dublin","HOTEL WYNN’S. DUBLIN. Perfect situation, in the corner of the O’Connell St., near the river, Trinity College, and Temple Bar. The tramway stops in front of the hotel, and also several buses. It looks old fashion out and inside. The girl in reception is really kind. Room normal size, with wifi (weak in our room 251) and freezer. A couple of things, breakdown, but they arrange it soon. Breakfast with some buffet (cereals, good croissants, and chemical fruit drinks), and a large choice, the best the Irish breakfast. An expensive rate, but no more than the others hotels. In my experience, the best option to enjoy the central Dublin.",4,2015,10,19
232,BRILLIANT HOTEL,"Excellent staff, good nicely furnished and clean rooms. Breakfast plenty of choice. Have stayed in this hotel many times and would not consider any other when visiting Dublin. Located just off  the main street so perfect for sightseeing,tram stop just down the street from hotel, train station is about 10 min walk from hotel, handy if wanting to visit some of the coastal area. Bus stops in main street to various locations, if using buses to get around the city (for example we went to The Casino at Marino) you can purchase ticket on bus but be aware you need to pay with coins, notes are not accepted!
Can't wait to return for another visit!",5,2015,10,19
232,Fantastic Food and Service,Held function for 121 people. 4 course meal served with minimum of fuss. Staff very friendly and helpful. Best of all price was more than reasonable. Fantastic location in heart of city centre close to all amenities,5,2015,10,14
232,Location location location location,"I only spent 2 nights in Dublin. Thats why the location was most important. This small hotell is just at the end of O'connel street towards city centre with the Luas just outside the door and buss stop about a minute walk. Also took me 5 minutes to walk down to the Temple Bar area. Rooms were clean and bathroom size was more then I expected. Beds were comfy which also was important to me due to a bad back. I also liked that the breakfast was served at my table freshly cooked! The bar was also well stocked with many different types of alcohol. I was also lucky to get a room on the 5th floor. A good bit up from the streets. Noise was no issue for me, and I even got a bit of a view of the rooftops :)

I would go here again, and would gladly recomend this place to others!",4,2015,10,13
232,Brillinat Hotel in the heart of Dublin.,"Wynn's is the best hotel I've ever stayed in. I've joined Trip Advisor just so I can leave them the 5 star review.
Firstly, the hotel is located right in the centre of Dublin around the corner from O'Connell Street so it's near all the major tourist spots. Most of the buses also stop on O'Connell Street  - including the express to the Airport. There's also a tram stop virtually outside the hotel
The hotel itself is full of character from the Art Deco façade to the old-fashioned yet charming décor of the rooms replete with good dark wood furniture and prints of historic Dublin views hung on the wall.. Mine was a twin with a double and single bed with a real wardrobe, a safe, a comfy chair, desk and chair, a fridge and TV. Windows are double glazed to cut out the noise from the sometimes busy road outside but the window can be opened if you like the fresh air
The bathroom had a modern basin,  loo and power shower with plenty of towels. there was also a hairdryer with integral shaver socket. The bathroom came with two complimentary soaps, shower gel, face cloth, shower cap - and a sewing kit.
Breakfast is served in the restaurant. There's a choice of yoghurts, pastries, cereals, and juice which you go and get yourself. However, for the hot breakfast, the staff take your order. There's porridge to start if you want followed by a Full Irish, kippers, pancakes and syrup or a veggie breakfast.
I also ate in the restaurant with friends and we all enjoyed a wonderful meal . The hotel bar also serves food and has a relaxing lounge area
However, what earned the five stars is the staff. From the moment we arrived, they were friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. I was even able to have a laugh and a joke. They remembered yo;. for example at breakfast, I was asked if I wished to be seated at the same table, I'd used the previous morning,  I did not feel like a customer, I felt at all times like a valued and welcome friend who was visiting",5,2015,10,11
232,Great value,"Good mid range Hotel which is clean, attractive and comfortable. Great central location with friendly staff who are willing to go out of their way to be helpful. Good quality breakfast and bar service excellent!",4,2015,10,11
232,Parents Anniversary ,"Booked Wynns for my parents who were going to a show in Bord Gais. Location is perfect, just beside the luas so as they were coming from Heuston they didn't have to worry about taxis. Room was v comfortable and they were v impressed with the breakfast !! The staff could not have been nicer. Have stayed there before and will be booking again. ",5,2015,10,09
232,Great hotel and great service in the heart of the city.,"Helpful and wellcome personnel, willing to go the extra mile for their clients. After one week here I can only say good things:

Good selection of breakfast, served on the table.
Good bar with reasonable prices.
Every single employee has been extra welcoming, and no bad faces even after losing my key twice in the same day :(, sorry about that.

Next time in Dublin WILL BE HERE

Big thanks!",5,2015,10,09
232,Fabulous,"The hotel is fabulous and steps back to the opulence of days gone by. No pretentious staff here, everyone was friendly, patient & attentive. The room we had was at the front on the 5th floor. It was spacious, had two window seats looking out into O'Connell street, the fixtures and furnishings were traditional but lovely. It even had a whirlpool bath! Breakfast was faultless with extensive choices and the residents bar a treat. So basically value 2nd to none. Location couldn't be any more central and an excellent base for touring Dublin. Would I.stay again? You couldn't stop me!
",5,2015,10,08
232,Great old hotel and perfect location,"We just returned from Ireland and spent the last 4 nights at Wynn's Hotel in Dublin and it couldn't have been better.  I researched many hotels in Dublin before deciding on Wynn's and I am so glad we booked there.  The location is right near the O'Connell Bridge and within a 10-15 minute walk to just about everything.  Our room was a Superior Double which was more like a Suite with lots of room, a jacuzzi bath tub, sitting area and comfortable bed.  Our reservations included the B&B option (which costs just a little more but very well worth it) and the breakfast each morning was great.  Trevor the dinning room morning manager makes sure everything runs smoothly and efficiently we only had to wait to be seated once and that was for about 2 minutes.  Lobby staff are very helpful and ready to answer any questions or concerns.  Our room was on the 5th floor in the back and we had absolutely no problem with noise.  Grand Central Bar just a few doors down has great food and a lovely decor inside as I think it was an old bank.  Highly recommend Wynn's Hotel!!",5,2015,10,08
232,BEST PRICE= BEST HOTEL,"I checked several hotels in the 100 plus USD range, including Jury's, Arlington, Ashling among others.  The other hotels have no ""curb appeal"" at all but Wynns is just down from the Abbey Theater and only steps away from O'Connell Street.  Reception staff are gracious and most helpful.  Housekeeping is outstanding and dinners are excellent.
The Irish breakfast included with the room rate is superb- you will not need lunch but maybe tea and pastry after midday is fine.  Try their carvery for dinner- don't pay outrageous Dublin prices while at the Wynns= their dinners are just as good and more sumptuous.
Rooms are a bit small but beds are comfortable.  Bathrooms have the best marble in a mid=priced hotel- old-world and durable!",5,2015,10,02
232,Stately hotel!,Great location for shopping and dining.   All kinds of choices within an easy walk.   Older hotel with plenty of class.  Rooms were nice and clean and the staff was very friendly.   The complimentary breakfast was quite good too!  We were their two nights and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and area.   ,5,2015,09,27
232,Great location old style hotel with history,"It doesn't get more central than the Wynn's Hotel  in Dublin. Located in the heart of Dunlin, this old fashioned style hotel is close to shopping, restaurants and a very easy 10 minute stroll to the Temple Bar entertainment district and Trinity College. The rooms & bathrooms are small but comfortable & clean & have the basic amenities. The staff are friendly and helpful and the bar and restuarant are good. If you are on a holiday and want to stay in a place that brings significant history and atmosphere to your visit then you can't go past the Wynn's. ",4,2015,09,27
232,"Great Hotel, good breakfast","Just returned from Dublin, 3 days of fun. The Hotel is located in a great spot, easy to get to the nearby Hop on and off tram, everything is within walking distance. The Lift was out of order the 1st 2 days we were there, and it was unpleasant to hike up to the 3rd floor after a day out or a night visit to Temple Bar area, also with walking distance. I felt sorry for the large group of tourist that were older folks as some were using canes to go up and down the stairs. They did let some use the service lift that you had to access via a walk through the kitchen. we had room 376, very nice & quite, 2 beds, bathroom was nice, water pressure on rain head shower was awesome, best ever! Hotel is beautiful!  The breakfast is not to be missed, served 8 to 9:30, it is included in your stay. Staff is very friendly and they have a lady in lobby who will book all your tour's for you. Right beside the hotel on the corner is a outstanding place to eat, the pork chops are not to be missed!  We loved our stay!",4,2015,09,26
232,"""Excellent hotel with character in the heart of dublin""","Excellent hotel with great helpful staff right in the heart of Dublin. Clean and affordable with great bar and restaurant service, very friendly. Stayed in the Jim Joyce suite and this is highly recommended as a great room (on the upper floors as we requested). This hotel was also notably affordable compared other Dublin hotels. Staff very helpful and helped with everything they could when asked. Next visit we will be staying at the Wynns again. If you arrive at lunch then the carvery in the Saints and Scholars bar is good value suggest the half plate unless your very hungry.",5,2015,09,26
232,Great hotel with character,"We just came back from a trip to Ireland, and our stay at Wynn's hotel in Dublin was a great part of the trip. Location is wonderful, right in the middle of everything, and across the street from the hop on hop off Dublin bus. That bus was a great way to see where else in Dublin you want to visit. Wynn's front desk and door man were second to none, and their breakfast service was excellent. We had 5 people and they always managed to accommodate us. The carvery was very good - make sure you are very hungry or ask for the half plate. We stayed in the James Joyce Suite and 2 other rooms - all excellent. The staff are what makes the difference here. We have stayed at 3 other places in Dublin but from now on Wynn's is our place!",5,2015,09,22
232,Excellent,"Wynn""s is strategically located in the centre of Dublin literally only a few steps from O'Connell St and within easy walking distance of very many attractions. The hotel has a very pleasant and helpful staff, the rooms are well appointed, the bar and dining room services are very good.",5,2015,09,22
232,"Very Convenient, friendly hotel","Centrally located hotel a few minutes walk from the Temple Bar area. Friendly staff, comfortable rooms, easy to use wifi. Clean but some décor a little tired - it is not the newest property. 
Car park full - valet parking available at a reasonable cost and no nonsense. 
Good breakfast, ample choice, Price reasonable for a hotel located centrally in a capital city.",4,2015,09,18
232,Spoilt by noise,"Excellent location, friendly helpful staff, beautifully appointed.
But noise from the rumble, whine and bell of the trams outside very intrusive, as was noise from a private function supposed to finish at 1pm, still going on at 2.
Then a carelessly or wilfully set off fire alarm at 0530.... Not at all  funny for anyone who has ever been in a real one.....
Nobody very interested in listening to complaints about the noise at check-out.
The breakfast was very good though.
Wish we had seen the other reviews about noise before we went.....",2,2015,09,18
232,Wonderful old hotel just off of OConnel street,Location wise is doesn't get better.  Add to that beautiful rooms and friendly staff and you have a wonderful place to stay.  There is a lovely bar and restaurant if you decide to stay in but it is also short walk to Temple Bar and all of Irelands other attraction.  They offer parking and even valet park your car for you.  A special mention to the porters who are friendly and full of information about the area.  I can highly recommend this place,5,2015,09,07
232,"Great location, price and staff","We stayed two nights in Dublin after arriving from London via Rail and Sail. The location was excellent! I was travelling with my father who is 60+ on his first trip outside the US. We had been managing our budget in other locations sharing twin rooms but due to the great price we booked separate  single rooms at Wynn's. This an older hotel with great character. When we arrived they advised us that there was a wedding and another party in the hotel that night so it would be a little noisy. I slept with my window open and did hear a truck come in and empty a glass bottle bin but I was so tired from traveling I did not care.  My room had a very large and nice bathroom with tub/shower. My fathers had very small bathroom with only a shower. The water pressure was fine, but the water temperature did fluctuate often. Breakfast was perfect with a continental style and additional options from the kitchen. I ordered Eggs Benedict which came out overcooked but I was in the mood for eggs anyway and we were first in the breakfast area so the chef was still getting set up. My only complaint was the Wifi in the rooms. The first night I was not able to connect possibly due a lot of activity in the hotel that night. The lady at the front desk gave me other options to try connect. The second night was a little better. Otherwise we had a great time and I would definitely recommend it to friends.",4,2015,09,06
232,"Charming, elegant and classy","Oodles of style and olde worlde charm without being stuffy. Great location not far from O'Connell Bridge. Room was great, 2nd floor at the front - and when the windows were closed we could hear no noise from the street. Modern bathroom with just the most amazing shower. Good atmosphere in the bar - but it was a rugby weekend so to be expected. Lovely carvery in the afternoon and an amazing Irish breakfast in the morning. Friendly staff who like to banter make the place very welcoming. Will be back for sure. ",5,2015,08,30
232,Historic hotel with old world charm but close to sites of Dublin,"This is a very old historic hotel and when you walk into the small quaint lobby, you feel as if you have been transported back in time.  The elevators are very old but remind you of times past.  It is very clean and the staff is very friendly as the Irish seem to be famous for.  We arrived too early to check in but the front desk was more than happy to store our luggage until the room was ready.  The rooms are very clean and the bathrooms seem updated and nice.  The rooms and bathrooms are very small but did not take away from the experience of this hotel.  The beds were fairly comfortable.  There is not any air conditioning in this hotel which was not a problem since the weather in July was not uncomfortably warm.  The only issue is that to keep somewhat cool at night, you will want your window open but there is a lot of street noise.  We were woken up many times to various noise of people below and an alarm going off at 3 am.  It was ok though since this hotel is right next to the River Liffy and close to the temple bar district without all the noise of the temple bar district.  Everything was within walking distance and the location could not have been better.  Again, comfortable hotel but with a bit of noise.  Small rooms but very historic feeling and a very nice hotel.  The breakfast was great and served as partially continental and partial order and served in a fine dining setting.  Breakfast was included with the room and we were happy with the choices.  I would stay here again if for no other reason than the location but it was a nice hotel.",4,2015,08,30
232,Beautiful old hotel in the city centre,"I stayed at Wynn's for 3 nights.  It is an old hotel, but beautifully maintained.  It felt ""comfortable.""  Location is good, one block from the river, a few meters from O'Connell St.  It is close to shops, restaurants and sights.  I had room 498, it faced Lower Abbey Street, there was some noise, but never loud enough to disturb me.  Room had high ceilings which made it seem larger.  The staff (reception desk, doorman, wait staff in the restaurant were polite and friendly.)  I liked the place, will definitely stay there on my next visit.  Thanks for making my stay enjoyable.",5,2015,08,27
232,Homely hotel in the centre of Dublin,"Stayed here recently while on business in Dublin City. I had requested a room at the back as I needed to do a bit of work. The girl on Reception remembered me when I arrived and said, I have a room at the back for you. Updated old world charm whilst still holding on to the charm. Nice touch that there was an evening herald hanging on my door on entry. And a facecloth n the room..a dying thing in most hotels..luv it:) Love the old fashioned key fob..no plastic cards here. My room was recently done up but there was no 'new' smell:) Breakfast was lovely..fab big open dining room looking out on to Abbey St. Staff were so friendly and efficient as it was very busy. Porridge was perfectly cooked and there was a great selection of yoghurt, scones, croissants. I also had scrambled egg and bacon..freshly cooked and great quality food. Just wanted to stay longer..like a home from home. I will def return soon again.",4,2015,08,23
232,Amazing location,This is a beautiful old hotel in the heart of the city.  Exactly where you want to be - you can walk to everything.  The rooms are quite nice - not huge but comfortable.  The bar and restaurant and good.  Great place to stay while seeing the city.,5,2015,08,17
232,Old favourite,"I have stayed at Wynn's twice now and it's old fashion charm doesn't fail.

As a child then teenager I would have lunch there with my Grandmother and older Irish relatives. They would always be Nuns and Priests having their lunch too so my relatives would say it must be a good place!

Arriving early it was a pleasant surprise to be given our room. The room was clean and had everything needed. The room was at the front so we could hear the Luas but this was ok.

Breakfast was amazing. Very good choice - great set up for the day.

The hotel is in a brilliant location just off O'Connell street.

Wifi free and a good connection.

Highly recommended.",4,2015,08,14
232,Great food,"Lovely old world hotel. Called in and had a drink. Friendly staff with lovely atmosphere. Went in for Sunday carvery. The lamb was to die for, nicest I have ever had. Healthy portions, will definately be back",5,2015,08,10
232,Good Location,Nice hotel in an excellent location. Very close to a number of the city centre attractions (and for the drop-off/pickup coach stop for the airport). The public areas are quite impressive and all staff are genuinely friendly and helpful. The cooked breakfast is excellent but there didn't appear to be an abundance of choice for other options; one good point though is that if you have an early check-out they will put a packed breakfast together for you. The room itself was on the small side; I had single occupancy of a double room and found it slightly cramped (if my wife had been travelling with me then...). Also it was a bit stuffy and warm; it doesn't get too hot too often in Ireland but on this occasion it was and there was a very noisy vent outside my window so I had the choice of being too hot or kept awake.,4,2015,08,03
232,Returning and why not.,Arrived on 23rd July for a one night stay while we celebrated my wife's birthday in Dublin. From the minute we entered to leaving we were treated as guests to an hotel would wish to be treated. Our only complaint was the heat in the room at night ( no a.c.)   We enjoyed stay so much that we are returning for my birthday in September. Keep up the good work.,5,2015,08,02
232,"Lovely place, great location.","Lovely, charming, old world place. The staff was amazing! Best location ever. Amazing breakfast, great pub. Yes the rooms could use some sprucing (the bathroom was spacious/modern, but the room was small and felt old/musty/mushy bed). Maybe the upper level/no smoking would smell better. Would be MUCH BETTER if whole place was no-smoking. Also our room faced courtyard where we heard and smelled garbage trucks.",4,2015,08,01
232,Wynns,"Old world hotel with up to date facilities located right in the centre of town It represents what hotel stays used to be about ,attentive staff good facilities and exceptional breakfast. An oasis of calm in the mayhem of what is Dublin city centre.Keep up the good work and it will be around for another 150 years.",5,2015,07,31
232,Lovely historical hotel,"The hotel is very central just off O'Connell street.  The staff are lovely, very friendly and courteous each and every one of them.   Our room was lovely with a big Jacuzzi bath which unfortunately I didn't have time to try.  Breakfast was gorgeous with a lovely selection.  I would definitely return to this hotel in future. We stayed there for the Ed Sheeran concert so the hotel was obviously very very busy but they took it in their stride.",5,2015,07,31
232,Very loud,"Great location but that's it. The noise from pub downstairs was awful. At 1:30am I complained but I was told what did I expect it was ed sheeran weekend. The walls are like paper. Complained again at check out, very poor customer service. Happy to take our money and ignore our complaints. Don't expect any sleep if your staying here.",2,2015,07,26
232,Wonderful and Welcoming,"We found Wynn's Hotel by chance after searching through LOTS of other accommodations for our stay in Dublin - and we are so glad that we did. Staying at Wynn's was a real treat and the hospitality is top notch. Everyone that we encountered at Wynn's were so genuinely lovely; and I give my thanks to them all for making our stay so nice. The receptionist (I should have caught her name!) was amazing and went out of her way to inform of us of all the tourist information we requested; and the bar and dining room staff were just excellent in every way. Our room as well was great - large, clean and has everything you could need. We were faced to the street side but noise was no issue and the proximity of the hotel to everything you'd hope to see in Dublin is perfect. Also, my mother in law had arranged to send a surprise to us at the hotel (champagne, chocolate and a fruit basket) and you could really tell that the hotel put some effort into this (they even included a personalized card with her message to us) and it was so lovely of everyone involved. Also, as a travellers side note, we arrived early (about 10am) and our bags were looked after and were waiting for us in our room on return; but Wynn's also offers a large, clean, general use bathroom as an area to freshen up, get changed etc. on arrival if your room isn't available - and after such a long flight we really appreciated this. I'd sum up our Wynn's hotel experience as warm and friendly and we wouldn't hesitate to come back again. Thank you Wynn's - you deserve to be at the top of the TripAdvisor list :)",5,2015,07,25
232,What a fabulous hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Being a  native of Dublin now living in England I have stayed in many hotels there.
I can say without reservation that Wynns hotel is the best one there is and I have
stayed in the Gresham on many occasions.
The food from the excellent breakfast to the wonderful carvery and the restaurant
a la carte menu was a joy to behold.I could not believe the value for money of all our meals.To get this in the heart of Dublin was unbelievable.
I must say the friendliness of all the staff was second to none.They could not have
been more helpful to myself and my party.From the reception,bar staff,restaurant staff,
door staff and chambermaids nothing was too much trouble for them. I must also
mention the hotel manager for his help in organising my 70th birthday party for when
my family and friends visited the hotel.I stayed at Wynns for 5 days and could not 
find a single fault with anything.",5,2015,07,21
232,Noisy Room,I stayed one night at this hotel (10th July 2015).  There is an adjourning bar/club which is very noisy. I asked for a quiet room and was given room 532 and after check-in this seemed to be the case.  However when I returned around 11.15pm the noise coming from the adjoining premises was unbearable. I asked to see the manager but he said he could do nothing about it and that the hotel was full.  The noise continued until 1pm. If you are a pensioner like me and want an early night then look elsewhere! This is not the place for you.,2,2015,07,19
232,Great!!,"Very very nice place!! It is't modern, but in this it's feature. The reception is very polite and responsive. Bar with wonderful short menu, the breakfasts are delicious. It was the best hotel during my long journey through Ireland!",5,2015,07,18
232,Dinner a la carte was ok but definite room for improven,We had meal in city centre hotel. The menu was a la Carte. The children's options were the usual rubbish like nuggets and chips etc which we abhor. We asked for half portion of roast which we got and this was sizeable if somewhat lacking in freshness-the cabbage looked like it was recycled over 3 days so we didn't sample...our dinner was fine roast beef if again veg were uninviting. The waitress was extremely helpful and friendly. The atmosphere was nostalgic and older clients seemed to frequent it. It's nice to see this clean hotel in this location and was a welcome time out from hustle and bustle of city centre and not the usual fast food restaurants unfortunately everywhere these days in city centre locations. If food was but more reasonably priced for children-€8 for half portion was a bit pricey and 12 for ours was ok-and freshness of food improved I would return. The hotel was clean which is good to see. ,3,2015,07,18
232,"First rate hotel, right in the city centre","Stayed 1 night at Wynn's. Arrived at 11am just to see if we could drop our bags. We were checked in immediately, no fuss, no dramas. Very professional and helpful.
The room was spacious, well appointed and very clean, as was the bathroom.
Breakfast was cooked fresh to order, not the usual buffet style.
Cannot fault the premises, staff or service. Our 2nd floor room overlooked the main street, but there was no discernible traffic noise.
Would definitely recommend this establishment.",5,2015,07,16
232,One night in Dublin,"Spent the first night of our Ireland trip at Wynns. Loved it. Great location. Easy access for airport bus and hop on/ hop off bus. Easy walk to Temple Bar area. Helpful friendly staff. Nice, clean rooms. Felt like we had stepped back in time. Bar and breakfast rooms very elegant.",4,2015,07,15
232,Great way to experience the past (sort of),"This hotel was built more than 150 years ago allegedly, which is quite rare phenomenon nowadays and this brings the biggest value to the hotel, i.e. having concrete/brick walls everywhere. So as a result the sound insulation is great and you can't hear people coughing next room (although you might hear street noise if your room is facing the street). 
The room was't great; it was ok. The best things is that there is an electric fireplace present in the room which not only heats up the room effectively but also introduces cozy atmosphere if you turn off most of the lamps. But then there are mediocre things like - mini TV, tiny bed where you have to be cautious not to fall out during your sleep, bathroom with ""sub-zero"" temperature and occasionally full of cigarette smoke, and electric kettle with a bit of rust inside.
Breakfast was good, but can have small queues for the tables sometimes.
Location is pretty good and during the day it's all fine, but after eleven they close the metal gates, which means something.",4,2015,07,10
232,"""nice building, friendly staff""","Wynn's Hotel is located in a historic building on a major street ( name?). For us, the location north of the Leiffe was a little out of the center of where we spent most of our time. The room was comfortable, but the WiFi was spotty. Breakfast was one of the best and the elegant room made it even more tasty. The door man parked our car for us, making what we thought might be a big hassle, no problem at all.",3,2015,07,10
232,True Irish ambiance in the heart of the city!,"Location, location, location.  You cannot beat this location.  You are in front of tram junction and around the corner from all of the hop-on/hop-off bus tours.  The Wynn is basically in the heart of the city center.  You also cannot beat the friendliness of the staff and their willingness to go out of their way to accommodate your needs. This is an older hotel with charm and personality but with that comes a lack of A/C.  Not a huge issue for us but just be aware you may want to pack your lightest pajamas.  There was a doorman present at all times we entered or exited. The breakfast was out of this world!  Our room was spacious, to say the least.  Our bathroom was also very nice.  The mattresses were not the greatest but I was so tired from all my touring that I was just happy to have a place to sleep.  The elevator was not the fastest in the world but that gave me a great opportunity to work off my over indulging on their amazing breakfast.  Each time you leave, you must leave your room key with the attendant, who was always nice and aware of exactly what room you were in.  There are multiple restaurants nearby as well as a couple of small markets.  There is a small, friendly bar in the hotel lobby.",4,2015,07,08
232,Excellent City Centre Location,"I stayed at Wynn's Hotel on a recent overnight trip to Dublin.  I had business in the City Centre, so the hotel was perfectly located for me - a short stroll for an early appointment.  My single room was very clean and comfortable, and had everything I needed.  Not the most spacious, but enough room for one person on their own. Noise levels about what you'd expect for a city centre location. I loved the old-fashionedness of this hotel, (including an actual key and fob for accessing the room). The dining room was absolutely delightful, and the breakfast itself was the tastiest I've ever had in a hotel. Overall, the staff were friendly, the hotel clean, and it was reasonably priced. The hotel staff were happy to look after my case after checkout while I went to my appointment.  Saved me a lot of effort on a busy, hot day in Dublin.  Thanks Wynn's.",4,2015,07,03
232,"Perfect location, nice and comfortable rooms","Very good value for the money. Friendly staff, nice bar. Very comfortable rooms. The location is perfect. Can only recommend. The breakfast is not great, probably more ok when you prefer tee. I will go again next time I visit Dublin. ",5,2015,07,03
232,Real nice hotel with that old feel to it,"This hotel is really nice to visit and the best thing about is the Light rail systems stops right. outside the door, the food is really good as well ,and the breakfast is massive enough for the whole day....",4,2015,07,01
232,Lovely Traditional Hotel,"We stayed here last weekend for The Script Concert.  The hotel is very will situated just off O'Connell's Street, very hand to the shops and Temple Bar. Even though it was on a busy street the noise levels were not high at all.   Hotel rooms were a good size and the bathrooms were really clean and well kept.  Hotel staff was really helpful and the Breakfast & Breakfast Staff were both excellent.  Will be returning to this lovely hotel.",5,2015,06,30
232,Perfect time travel,"The hotel is right in the middle of everything. For me it was the perfect location, every sight and important spot was within an arms reach. No public transportation was needed. The airport bus drops you off/picks you up on the corner (10 meters from the entrance). You check in, and your time travel begins. There is one elevator and it's slow as a snail. But the atmosphere of the hotel is just lovely. The room was neat, tidy, really made me feel like a lady on the turn of the 20th century. If you are looking for a great location, very polite staff and good Irish breakfast, this is the hotel for you.",5,2015,06,30
232,Class Hotel,"Just back from Wynnes hotel stayed there for 2 days absolutely Brillant All Staff
Very Courteous  Service Excellant 
Bedrooms Beatiful will be back Wouldn't Stay anywhere else and there are a lot of great Hotels in Dublin",5,2015,06,30
232,Wynns hotel Dublin,"Stayed here many times. Staff always helpful. Nice rooms and good breakfast. Brilliant location in the centre of Dublin city  near the Abbey Theatre and just off O'Connell Street, minutes walk to Trinity College.",5,2015,06,30
232,Issues abound,"There was one front desk person who was really nice. Luckily, she was there for most of our stay. The breakfast was always great! The maitre d'hotel was amazing! Sadly, these couldn't make up for other things related to the stay. We had gotten a room with 2 single beds for my husband, his son and me (my husband and I are small so we could fit in a single). We checked in OK. The room we were assigned reeked like cigarette smoke! Ick! When we went to turn in the key for the first time, we were informed that there is a supplement for a 3rd person in that room and that we MUST have a foldout bed delivered. We were not told of either of these requirements ahead of time or when we checked in. The rooms are very small and the foldout bed was continually in the way. In return for these added requirements on their side, we mentioned the smoke smell. The lady shrugged and ignored us. While the location and breakfast were great, reserve this hotel at your own risk.",2,2015,06,28
232,Great  hotel,"Very friendly receptionist on arrival. Staff were really nice. It's the perfect location; just off O'Connell's street. The only reason I took away points was because we couldn't get internet in our room. That was the second floor so if you want to go online, you'll probably have to go to the lounge. But overall we really enjoyed our stay.",3,2015,06,28
232,Good and not so good,"Pros:
*Location-close to most sightseeing locations and if not- the public light rail stops right in front of the hotel. 
*friendly staff
*pretty good breakfast included
*inside of hotel is quiet
*very clean

Cons:
*If you're on the street side of the hotel, there is lots of noise from the street. 
*bedspreads are a little shabby
*plumbing is noisy
*there is no a/c, which doesn't sound like a big deal in Ireland, but believe me it's hot in here.
*not enough outlets
*very spotty Internet

It's not terrible, but if I come back to Dublin, I might try a different hotel.",3,2015,06,26
232,Elegant hotel at its best,"Myself and daughter stayed here for a couple of nights this week and chose one of the mid week offers  which gave us breakfast plus lunch or dinner
From exchanging emails before we travelled to walking through  the door including checking out, it is one  of  the  best  City hotels I have  stayed at. The staff are wonderful from check in, bar staff and the warmest welcome I have ever experienced from the breakfast staff. The accommodation  was lovely spacious rooms and the food especially breakfast is outstanding. The location is spot on for exploring the city. If you choose to get the city pass for hop on hop off buses which includes travel from airport then the stops are on the corner of street from hotel a couple on minutes  walk. I would not hesitate  to recommend  and definitely  stay there again.",5,2015,06,25
232,Brilliant Stay,Excellent Hotel. Excellent Location.. Excellent Breakfast..Jacuzzi bath was a big plus..Stayed up for the weekend and the staff could not do enough for us thanks so much .. I would go back if I go the change and I cant recommend this Hotel Enough ,5,2015,06,21
232,quaint,"Stayed here for a weekend break in early May, we really enjoyed our stay although there is in our view some points to improve upon. The reception and bar staff are very friendly and efficient however the bar food was just about average. The creaky lift let a lot to be desired and the arrival of a large tour bus had the front hall crowded as people waited to catch the only elevator as the stairs were under repair. Patience and professionalism of the staff kept things calm. This a very central and secure location to plan  your visit , and you will receive a wealth of charm and good advice from the staff.The the bar area is a great place to unwind after a busy day exploring the city. A totally quaint Dublin experience from a hotel which continues to improve",4,2015,06,17
232,Stellar 3 Night Stay!,"What a lovely, old-world charm brought into the 21st century - from the moment we arrived, our stay at this hotel was delightful.  The location, amenities, daily breakfast, staff and cleanliness were top-notch!  This has been my 3rd visit to Dublin and Wynn's is my new favorite and one I would heartily recommend to any traveller.",5,2015,06,17
232,Caring & Gracious Hotel Management!,"After a long 13.5 hours flight into London, we took Air Lingus shuttle flight into Dublin, our very first visit to Ireland. From the Airport, we boarded the Aircoach bus to the Gresham Hotel, and arrivied some 25 minutes later. The Wynn's Hotel was merely a 300-400m easy walk from this bus stop. 

Having requested for an early check in, we arrived at 1.15pm but was told that check in was usually at 2pm. However, when the timing is up, our room was still not ready. Luckily we had travelled on Business class and managed a few hours of good sleep on the long flight, otherwise, it must have been quite dreadful with all that jet lag.

In all fairness, we were offered free tea while we waited in the Hotel's restaurant. And we even took the opportunity to buy some titbits and groceries nearby.  

Finally, we managed to get into our room 416 at 2.55pm - not too happy initially but our room was indeed very spacious, with two or three huge windows, facing the back of the Hotel as requested. Maybe it was due to my special requests, that it was harder to allocate such a room earlier ... well, understandable. 

We then wash up, unpack a little and took a nap. After waking up, I then realized that the whole room smelled of smoke, something seemed to be burning but I was not too sure. While going out for a walk, mentioned this to Hotel reception and they did a check on our room ...

Upon our return, we were told by a senior Management gentleman that our room's extractor or ceiling lights had caught fire - he then go on to say our clothes would be dry washed, our belongings shifted to another room, and they would offer us a complimentary dinner. 

Needless to say, we had a rude shock because something like this just never happened to us in our years of frequent travels. But, hey, things do happen sometimes but most importantly, the Management had apologised profusely ... 

Yet, we got another rude shock - our second room was much smaller, though it has a corner jacuzzi (quite nice), but we would very much prefer our first room. Worst was to come - we soon realised that this second room number 269 was facing some airconditioner compressor - it starts and stops on a certain frequency, making opening the windows impossible ...

Though we were staying 3 nights, we did not bother to ask for a room change. What we did was simple - before we leave the room, we would open all windows to cool down the room. Then just before sleeping, we would then close the windows for total silence. 

However, the superb location of this Hotel, its charming old world ambiance, caring and gracious Hotel Management, reasonable rates, makes this a great hotel to stay. Every morning, we would be blown away by its quality breakfasts and served by a very charming Gentleman server who seems to be really enjoying his work. 

And the complimentary dinner? Easily one of our best meals in Ireland I must say - a big thank you indeed, Wynn's Hotel. After a great 3 nights stay here, we walk some 300m to find Airlink 747 bus for our ride to the Airport - very easy indeed. 

Other small niggles of staying here are - 
1. no tooth paste nor tooth brush was offered here 
2. very limited counter space in the bathroom
3. poorer sound proofing in between rooms 
4. the carpeted floor here squeaks very badly 
5. with no aircon in most rooms here, other than family rooms, it may be too hot for us in the summer ...But winter and spring would be fine. 
6. check in was certainly too late at around 3pm, after we have travelling for some 17 hours ...  

Great characterful hotel with a caring and very gracious hotel management. Well done, Wynn's Hotel.",4,2015,06,16
232,Great stay,"I requested a 2-twin bed quiet room, but we were given a larger room with 2-twin beds plus a double bed, which faced the back and was quiet.  Room was very clean, beds were comfortable and wifi worked well. Staff was pleasant, breakfast was good.  Loved the location, and very convenient for airlink & hop on/hop off bus.  Only issue was water temperature in the shower -- went from warm to icy cold to blistering hot -- randomly. Would stay here again.",4,2015,06,16
232,Handy and functional,Visited the hotel on a recent trip to Dublin...2 minutes from mc connel street and next to the halfpenny bridge...tram on doorstep...nice friendly bar and staff..traditional style ..pleasant and user friendly..,4,2015,06,14
232,Great hotel,"Great tradiitional hotel in Dublin city centre with properly trained staff, each one as pleasant and professional as the next. You are made feel welcome and not that you are on a conveyor belt like some of the big chains. The restaurant is pleasant and airy, the food is great and good value for money. Location is fantastic and though you are right in the city centre the hotel is safe and very secure. I couldn't recommend it highly enough!",5,2015,06,14
232,Great hotel ,Myself and my partner recently stayed in Wynn's hotel in the centre of Dublin. It was amazing great service rooms were immaculate and spotless. The breakfast was excellent with more than a touch of class about it. I can honestly say I could not fault anything would highly recommend it ,5,2015,06,13
232,Brilliant location with fabulous staff,"Stayed at the Wynn's hotel for 3nights. Just as a hotel should be, lots of character, comfy beds, large bathroom with Jacuzzi bath, not just a box with painted walls.  Arrived at 9.30 after an early flight and as would expect our rooms were not available but this was not a problem as the staff took care of out luggage so that we could get on with the site seeing and not lose a day. On our return some many hours later our cases had been put in our room ready for us to unpack.  Throughout the stay the staff were so very friendly and helpful nothing was to much trouble, at breakfast you were greeted in a politely, friendly manner with interest being shown on how your previous day had gone.  Fabulous hotel would recommend to anyone and cannot praise the staff enough....as said, always helpful, always pleasant, nothing was to much trouble.  Don't let the  City transport passing by the front put you off...you can't hear it once inside the hotel",5,2015,06,06
232,Brilliant Location and Comfortable Hotel,"Stayed at Wynn's Hotel over June Bank Holiday.   We were greeted by a very friendly, courteous and efficient Receptionist.   The hotel was very comfortable and though you would think it would be noisy due to street noise, this was not the case even on the 2nd floor.   Our room was clean, comfortable and warm with a good shower.   Breakfast was excellent with a good range of food, and extensive menu and the service was very good.  All staff were pleasant, helpful and friendly. The luas stops directly outside and this is a bonus also. This hotel provides a good level of service and has plenty of character.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",4,2015,06,01
232,perfect,"Stayed for 3 nights, checked in at 10 am and our rooms were available, fantastic room with jacuzzi bath. All hotel staff were so friendly and the breakfasts were amazing with so much choice. Great location close to the river, shopping and temple bar. Next time we are in Dublin this will be my first choice, cant wait to return. Thank you Wynn's Hotel.",5,2015,05,31
232,"""Made our stay special"".","Stayed here for three nights , while in Dublin great location for all the attractions ,tram stop near hotel, Airbus stop very near by, staff very helpful , helping with directions ,arranging airport taxi , early morning wake up call and a early breakfast for our early morning flight. The room was very spacious with tea and coffee which was topped up daily, the bathroom was of a good size with a hot powerful shower. The breakfast  offered lots of choices of cold and hot food and the service was outstanding . I loved the old character and charm of this hotel and the wifi connection was very good in our room. We didn't eat a evening meal  in the hotel but did have a drink in the bar most evenings prior to going out and it was a warm , friendly place that  even had Irish dancing on on our last evening, if I return to Dublin I would certainly stay here again.",5,2015,05,30
232,"Charming, old fashioned hotel","Stayed here for one night while in Dublin for a concert. We came down from Sligo on the train and the hotel is close to Conolly station and there is a Luas stop right outside the hotel. The hotel is just off O Connell street and near Temple Bar.  It is an old iconic hotel and has a lovely charm to it.  The room was large and well equipped.  The windows opened and there were tea and coffee facilities and a safe.  The bathroom was a good size with good quality toiletries.  The bar was friendly and the prices were not too expensive.  The highlight was the breakfast.  Fresh juices, breads and cereals and a freshly cooked breakfast from a substantial menu.  The staff were friendly and helpful.",5,2015,05,29
232,Relax in the Heart of Dublin,"This hotel is very reasonably priced for the location and quality of the facilities. The wifi is reliable (not true in many other places I've stayed at in Ireland), and the hotel has a nice old-fashioned atmosphere. The breakfast is so-so in quality, but ample in quantity. The staff is all very friendly and hospitable.",5,2015,05,29
232,Very poor customer service offered by the Manager!,"Was in Wynn's yesterday for soup and sandwiches after a family funeral. First problem was that the room was booked for 50 people and was only set up for 40 (8 per table) but we managed. We arrived at 1:15 and agreed that soup would be served when everyone had arrived at 1:30. The amount of sandwiches was poor, I didn't count them but I only had a quarter of a round and there didn't seem to to be much to go around. None of the staff asked if we needed or wanted any more or indeed anything else. Another issue was that though we had the room until 5pm at 2:30 the staff cleared everything away including the tea and coffee so no one could have more. 
It all felt rushed and unwelcoming and guests started leaving.
I complained at the front desk and they advised they would call the manager. When he arrived I told him I was unhappy with the room being cleared completely at 2:30 when we had the room up to 5pm and his attitude was that this is what they do and tough luck to you! 
For a place that is just one of many hotels in Dublin city centre you would expect better service and customer focus, an apology maybe? Something that would make you feel heard, but no, not in Wynn's. Any one of the guests could have brought new business to the hotel but after the way they were rushed I suspect none will be back, including me.",1,2015,05,27
232,Love it,Beautiful hotel for my honeymoon. Very good position and very clean. Staff really professional and nice. Excellent choice for a holiday in Dublin. Near Henry st. for shopping and temple bar Tor fun and beer.,5,2015,05,26
232,Irish hospitality in a centrally located hotel with typical Irish breakfast servings,"We were received in a very hospitable manner, which was confirmed several times during our stay. The rooms were small but fully accommodated. The staff was very friendly and courteous. At breakfast, it was possible to combine continental and English breakfast. Continental breakfast was not entirely satisfying, but the Irish breakfast was good. Staff passed at our table to take our order for the Irish breakfast which we found quite original. Quite pricy (compared to what we are used to), but good value. We certainly enjoyed the central location. We would surely recommend this hotel!",4,2015,05,26
232,Matching expectations,"Good location, fine staff, in line with the comfort you would get in similar establishments in Ireland or in the UK.
If you want modern bathroom (with a single faucet mixer, not separate hot/cold), a TV witha screen larget than a notebook, better WiFi or fresh vegetables for breakfast - you should search for other hotel.",4,2015,05,26
232,9/10,"Nice hotel, with good standard and very tasteful breakfast (incl.)
Good service and nice personal.
Bus Airlink 747 from the Airport stopped right outside the hotel. (10 euro/ return ticket)
The location is very good, easy walking distance to most places of interest.
In the neighborhood: (The Celt with Irish Music and JW Sweetman, with their own brewery)",4,2015,05,26
232,Disappointing response to a noise problem,"We have just left the Wynn after a four night stay. The location is very good easy walking distance to most places of interest. The air coach does stop within 5 mins easy walk, also very close to the hop on hop off bus.

Receptionist was very friendly and organised an early check in.

Room was clean and of reasonable size, decor in keeping with the age of hotel.

Tablet sized safe in room plus mini fridge. The room would have benefited from a mirror over the fireplace.
WiFi access variable but it is free.

Bathroom size ok but shower small with poor water flow. Hairdryer not very effective so take your own if you like to style your hair.
Breakfast very good, staff very welcoming and friendly.

Bar service good. we did not try the restaurant but we were disappointed with the carvery, whilst the meat was tender the vegetables were overcooked.

The reason for the average review was the poor customer service offered by the manager when we had a problem with excessive building works on the day of arrival. A masonry drill was being used next door until 8.30 in the evening; when I went to reception to discuss the situation I was offered a room to go and sit in until the drilling stopped. The duty manager stated that we could have requested a quiet room on booking; at the time of booking I did not consider that drilling would have been an issue!  There was no real apology or attempt to make amends such as a complimentary drink/meal for the inconvenience caused; even a note of apology in the room could have given some sense of customer care. I fully appreciated that the building works were not in the control of the management but his response could have demonstrated more empathy.",3,2015,05,25
232,Close to the downtown area,"This hotel is one of the oldest hotels in Ireland, centrally located to everything.   Very comfortable room and the food in the restaurant is excellent.  A must stay if you are looking for a place in the Dublin area.",5,2015,05,24
232,From the old days :),"Nice hotel, quite old and lots of eldery people. But rooms are cleans, the staff very friendly and the breakfast is also good. So for a weekend stay, perfect. Near center en public transport including aircoach to the airport.",3,2015,05,23
232,Nice Dublin Hotel near Everything,"I have stayed in different Dublin hotels over the years, and Wynn's Hotel is definitely on my list as one of the best.

This hotel may not be the most modern, but it has a lot of class and charm. One of the most charming bits was the room key, which is on a brass fob that you will not easily lose. You also can leave your key at reception when you venture out into Dublin.

The room I had was spacious, decorated nicely and clean. The tub/shower had a rain shower which was very nice to wake up to.

The bar at the Wynn's is worth a visit. The bartender was friendly and service was quick. You can tell this is a Dublin favorite with all the people stopping into the bar for food and drinks.

As for location, Wynn's Hotel can't be beat. A short walk away are the major attractions in Dublin. The Luas tram is just outside the door and the airport bus is close by.

When staying in Dublin, definitely consider Wynn's Hotel.",5,2015,05,17
232,Nice hotel in good location,"This was our second stay here and once again we were well pleased with our visit. Just off O'Connell Street, near the river bridge, it is convenient for shops, restaurants and transport. The rooms are comfortable and the staff friendly. We were with a party and the efficiency in serving freshly cooked breakfast was remarkable. We would always stay here when we go to Dublin.",4,2015,05,16
232,Traditional and Welcoming,"An old fashioned establishment, comfortable with its place in Dublin life, its welcoming staff and its little touches that make staying there easy, and a pleasure.

Some may call it old fashioned as in no way will it compare to more modern glitzy establishments, but with its long established architectural features, even fitting new lifts would be difficult.

We did not use the bars or the main dining room, but breakfast was fresh, well served and the choice quality and fresh cooked.

As a city centre hotel it was both convenient and quiet and eminently suitable for purpose - our only gripe - weak Wi-Fi.",4,2015,05,14
232,"""A little gem in the heart of dublin""","We have not long returned from a short break to Dublin where we stayed at Wynn's
Hotel. We first discovered this place last December when we called in for a quick drink 
whilst Christmas shopping and thought the atmosphere was just great and would be a
nice place to stay, we were spot on.
We had a great room on the third floor with the most comfortable beds and beautiful bedding and décor which is totally in keeping with the character of the building.
A really powerful shower, plenty of toiletries and really good quality towels. We even had a fireplace in the room with an electric glow fire which was so cosy on a wet night.
We had one evening meal in the bar which was a very good carvery but the breakfasts, well they fabulous. I can honestly say it was the tastiest and hottest breakfast I have ever had in a hotel, all freshly cooked (not lying about in those big steam trays) and served up on piping hot plates which makes all the difference.
The selection of food for this meal alone was excellent, it certainly set us up for the day.The Italian girl on reception (Rebecca I think) was so informative and pleasant and the porter who parked our car was so helpful.
For all those reviewers who say this is a noisy hotel I say what on earth do you expect when you book a city centre hotel, we were on the third floor at the front of the building and the trams were directly below us but we slept fine, they are not that noisy at all.
Also to the reviewers who say the hotel is dated I say it is a fabulous old historic hotel
in the centre of the capital of Ireland with character, warmth and hospitality which you certainly don't get in those modern minimulistic lego block hotels that seem to appear from nowhere.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely return.",5,2015,05,04
232,From another Era,"We had avoided Wynns for years because of it's reputation as the hotel for upcountry (Culchie) hospitality in Dublin. The experience was better than expected and worth it for the sheer timewarp. The whole place is 'creaking' in the nicest possible way, very clean but 1960's meets celtic tiger!
The staff are all very very friendly and a visit to the bar is worth it for the historical aspect as the Irish Volunteers were set up here in 1913.
The Carvery in the bar is actually a bargain and again like something from the last century!
We had the James Joyce Suite which was clean but very dated but again good value!",4,2015,05,04
232,The Wynn traditional charm and first rate standards,We booked The Wynn after checking out the reviews on Tripadvisor. These are full of repeat visitors who would look no further when staying in Dublin. This hotel is privately owned and has an amazing history as it was burnt to the ground in the 1916 uprising to be rebuilt in 1926 to its original splendour. From the moment we were greated by the Italian lady who was front of house we felt like valued guests. The hotel is old and traditional with a busy bar serving guests and locals drinking and eating alongside each other. Our room was on the 5th floor at our request and was spacious with a jacuzzi bath and 2 window seats. It had all the facilities you expect and was quiet and most importantly a very comfy bed. Everywhere was clean and all staff were really helpful. The breakfast was served in the dining room which is bright and spacious. The waiters and chefs were exceptional all catering for very specific diets I overheard an order being made for gluten free toast. I can recommend the eggs benedict and they swapped the ham for smoked salmon as I don't eat meat. I've stayed in Dublin 4 times and will from now on stay at The Wynn. The location is perfect for getting off and on the Aircoach on O'Connell street and literally one block from the Liffey and the South side. If you plan to do the Dublin City bike tour it's about a 3 minute walk away. Best of all it's 1 minute from Clery's and if you like tradition then what better than several shopping trips and a quick drop off at your hotel across the road.,5,2015,05,03
232,a great hotel near to the city centre,"we arrived at 10am on saturday morning for a quick weekend break of shopping and seeing family. we were welcomed warmly and our bags left in the hotel till the room was ready at 2 letting us do some shopping.
the room was great and even though we were on the front of the 3rd floor we could not hear any noise through the windows. we were also warned about a party downstairs but we did not hear that either.
the breakfast was great with lots to choose from and all the staff could not do enough to help, nothing was any trouble
even the chap working in the bar gave me some great banter while serving my drinks
its a great place to stay as everything is in walking distance, the Luas stops just outside, your 2 seconds from a taxi and the same from the aircoach back to the airport, and the bus station is 4 minutes away
the room was very tidy, the bathroom immaculate and the T.V. was great, the beds were very comfy 
i am heading back to dublin in august and i will be staying at wynns again 
thoroughly enjoyed my stay",5,2015,05,02
232,Well located and friendly,"Just stayed here for 3 nights and the hotel is very well located in the heart of Dublin a very short walk from the 747 airport bus stop, the hop on hop off bus tours and the tram stop. The night life of Temple Bar is only about a ten minute walk away over the other side of the river and there are plenty of pubs and restaurants closer by.
The hotel is very old fasioned and makes a nice change to some of the more modern chain hotels. The room (381) was at the front of the hotel and could be a little noisy at night but the reception do provide ear plugs, the room was very clean and funcional and the cooked breakfast in the morning was fantastic.
Staff were always very friendly and helpful and you were always made to feel welcome.",5,2015,05,02
232,City break,Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and loved it the staff wear great friendly the room was clean & well dressed and  had everything you could want. Breakfast was great and felt that I was well looked after. After reading other comments on hear I found that some of the things that wear said are true yes it is a bit tired in places.and it can be a bit noises but you would expect that being in the centre of dublin & a tram stoping out side. but over all I would still recommend hotel & would stay hear again ,4,2015,05,01
232,"Tired, Tired, Tired","This hotel is a decent enough place to put your head down for the night, but its really a very tired hotel in need of renovation.
It is well located just off O'Connell Street, and a ten minute walk to Temple Bar, and with easy access to Dublin's other attractions. The tram runs right outside the hotel, with a stop just outside the front entrance, and the open top tour buses are just a 5 minute walk away. There are bars and restaurants everywhere in Dublin, so it goes without saying that there is plenty of choice nearby!
The staff are very friendly and helpful, from the doorman to receptionist, and staff in the breakfast room.
The only meal that we had at the hotel was breakfast, and this was very good. A nice selection of cereals, yogurts, bread and croissants, with tea or coffee and juices, and a choice of cooked breakfasts, all well prepared and plentiful.
The room itself was fine, but somewhat dated in appearance and style. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom was also in need of a facelift, with a rather small shower cubicle by modern standards. However everything was clean and presentable.
All in all, not a bad place to stay if you just want a bed for the night, and a reasonable breakfast.....",3,2015,04,30
232,"So friendly, so central.","Very friendly and helpful staff. Having read that the hotel could be noisy when its function room was being used for evening/night events, I phoned up 2 days before arrival to ask for a quiet room. This request was granted with a room at the rear of the building. The view from the room was of the back walls and passages of other buildings but this was just fine in order to have a quieter stay. The beds were very comfortable and though the bathroom was small the shower itself was large and powerful! The breakfast was excellent. A great choice of hot dishes served piping hot on very hot plates! A real treat. Also, an adequate selection of cereals, fruits, yoghurts...plus croissants and scones. The scones are made on the premises and are very good. Location excellent. 200 yards from O'Connell Street and just a couple of minutes walk over the bridge into Temple Bar and 5 to 10 minutes to Grafton St. A major plus for us was that the tram stops right outside the hotel and this provided us with direct transport to 3 of the attractions we visited; Guinness Storehouse, Jameson Distillery and Kilmainham Gaol. The gaol is about 10 minutes walk from its nearest tram station. The hotel does have an old fashioned feel but this provides its character, particularly charming for breakfast and for drinks and meals at the bar. Reception and porter staff very welcoming and helpful.",4,2015,04,24
232,very friendly and accomodating hotel,"A very elderly lady and her daughters stayed here in April . It is a very central hotel. We found it to have an old fashioned feel which was very nice and it was very clean and comfortable to stay in. The food in the restaurant was very good as was the breakfast, The selection of food was excellent.Even though our room was at the front of the hotel the noise from traffic/luas was not intrusive. The staff were very accomodating and friendly. We will stay here again.",4,2015,04,16
232,Love this hotel!!,Stayed here July 2014 and again April 2015.  Excellent location in the heart of Dublin City. Friendly warm welcoming staff. Delicious breakfast. Will definitely stay here again.  Lovely old style busy bar nice to have a drink in too.,5,2015,04,14
232,A friendly hotel in a very convenient location,My daughter and I stayed in this hotel this week. From the moment we walked in we could sense the friendly atmosphere. Our room had everything we needed and a quaint touch was a fireplace. Lovely. Had a great meal that evening and very reasonably priced. Will definitely stay here again,5,2015,04,11
232,A Lovely Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,"We had an excellent stay at Wynn's. The hotel itself is beautifully appointed, the room I had was very quiet and the bed just right. Nice amenities, including a bathrobe and coffee in the room.  The staff were always friendly and helpful, and the restaurant and bar both serve excellent fare. I recommend Wynn's highly.",5,2015,04,10
232,A perfect place for shopping and theatres...,"I have stayed here many times and am never disappointed. It's clean,  comfortable and perfectly positioned for shopping, theatres, cinema and airport bus. A fifteen minute walk from Templebar and the vibrant life there. This hotel is on the side of the city which  is definitely more 'real Dublin' and less touristy but with everything literally just a stroll away. Quiet rooms even if facing the street. Excellent breakfast. Just one lift which can mean a bit of a wait at times. Very good staff and HONEST! Have forgotten a couple of items in the room in the past and the staff have been always super helpful. Rooms can sometimes be on the small side but there are bigger ones for longer stays. I love the place. ",5,2015,04,07
232,Friendly and welcoming staff - Lovely hotel,"The title really does say it all - I have stayed in Wynn's on numerous occasions and have always enjoyed my stay. As have my family. The breakfasts really are fantastic and keep you going all day. 
The staff are very friendly and so helpful.

              ",5,2015,04,02
232,Not for a quiet night at weekends,"My friend and I stayed at this hotel on a weekend Sat/Sun to do some shopping. This hotel is really central. We were on the 4th floor. We didn't get any WiFi, even after mentioning it at the reception. On the Saturday there was a birthday party on the first floor and, oh my god, it was so loud that we couldn't cover the noise with the TV. At around 11pm the music finally was turned down. So if you want some quiet nights, go during the week. The beds are comfortable. As for breakfast, dry and too salty. Not really worth the price paid. 
Overall, I would suggest a different hotel like the Double Tree by Hilton.",2,2015,03,22
232,Hotel with charm.,"I have stayed in Wynns Hotel on several occasions, location is amazing, just off O Connell Street. The Receptionist Roberta gave me a big welcome each time, very polite, friendly and most helpful. Delicious Irish breakfast served. Highly recommended. A. Westre. Norway",4,2015,03,21
232,St Patrick's Stay,"We stayed here at one of the busiest times, but were made to feel that nothing was too much trouble.
Loved this hotel, fantastic location, friendly helpful staff. 
Great room, comfy bed, all the facilities you need. Excellent breakfast.
Definitely worth the money, would recommend and return.",5,2015,03,20
232,Disappointing,Visited Wynn's 3/7/15. Had requested a back quiet room due to recent surgery and was given room 374 I believe which faced main street. Not too bad on street noise but there was a 60th birthday party that we were assured would be quiet after 10pm. It was very noisy till like 1am and we had an early airport trip and did not appreciate this event being allowed to be so loud so late. The staff at the hotel and the facility itself were very nice but  the noisy party really ruined our night. I was asked for review and gave one but have not gotten a response.,2,2015,03,17
232,Wynns,"Really lovely old fashion hotel in centre of Dublin

Very clean hotel both rooms and all communal areas 

Great breakfast and fantastic choice on the menu

Perfect location in centre of town

For about £100 for a double it was a great choice for us and I'd definitely return to this hotel 
",4,2015,03,09
232,Nice,"The location is great, so cloose to O'connel strevet and shooping. Ok rooms with free wifi. Lovely brekfast. The staff was ok, some Very Nice, some could smile moore. Nice lounge and bar. Clean rooms.",4,2015,03,01
232,very welcoming hotel,"We 've been staying in this hotel several times , for business and for leisure , and we have always been warmly welcomed by the staff .On top of it all , the hotel is ideally located in the city . The decoration ( especially the restaurants ) takes us back in time and it's very pleasant . A very special thank you to Roberta ( reception) and to Trevor ( breakfast)  who definitely make us think we are unique .

232,A GREAT HOTEL IN THE MIDDLE OF DUBLIN CITY,"My wife and 8 stayed for 2 nights in Wynns.
It was a pleasure to stay there.......the Receptionist, the waiters,everyone there was very welcoming.
The breakfasts, which are served, are wonderful.
The room was very satisfactory, bright, clean and modern.
Carmel and I swore we would stay in Wynns the next time we visit Dublin.",4,2015,02,22
232,Central location,"For our final night in Ireland we stayed one night in this hotel.  We had to drop off our rental car but decided to check in first. This was a challenge since the hotel does not have temporary parking as the main entrance is on a busy Dublin street where the trams run.  We had to find a park in a back street and pull our luggage to the front, the area was smelly when we came out of the car. Finally we checked in, reaching our room (on the upper floors), it was somewhat run down and cramped.  Two people can barely move around since the bed occupied almost all of the space and there was a small sitting area to the side.

The hotel itself was in the perfect location, walking distance to almost everything you can see and do in the city. 

Hotel is in the perfect location for visiting Dublin but the quality of room for the price paid is understated.",3,2015,02,19
232,Unpretentious hospitality in the city center,"My wife and I stayed at Wynn's and had a lovely time. Lovely room, great staff, nice bar, delicious breakfast. An oasis of old-fashioned hospitality and warmth in the city center. Just a lovely, old-world alternative to the rash of cool and impersonal hotels around the city center.",5,2015,02,10
232,Another very pleasant and comfortable stay,"This was my fifth time staying at Wynn's Hotel, and once again the comfortable rooms and convenient location were topped off with exemplary customer service. Was particularly grateful for the extra blankets.",5,2015,02,01
232,clean and central,This is a very central hotel. The breakfast is one of the best in the city. I have stayed here many times for all sorts of reasons and I  haven't had a bad experience yet. The hotel can be a little pricey at times especially during the summer or if there is a popular concert on in Dublin that's the only down side.,5,2015,01,30
232,Perfect situated!,"We stayed for 2 night in room 525 which was great. Loved the window part, where one could sit and read, while watching out the window (oh, and it has a heater underneath!). The only draw back for me, was the room temperature. A bit hotter would have been grant!
The personal working there are amazing. We got checked in by a lovely lady. Unfortunately I can't remember her name, very bad of me. She checked us in in literarily 30seconds. She knew that we only were in Dublin for 37 hours, so it was no fuss. The keys, and up you go. We we're very impress. Paul the doorman, quite a character, walked us to our car, and drove it to the hotel's, pre-booked garage spot. They then took the car out at 1am, as it closes from 1-6am, and we were leaving a 5am., and left it across the street. Is that service or what!!!! 
Breakfast was ok. Not to brag about, but it has a good variety of foods. Oh, by the way, they actually opened up the restaurant just for us, at 4:45am, so we could grab a bite before leaving for the airport.",4,2015,01,28
232,Lovely historic hotel in the heart of Dublin,"My partner and I shared a Deluxe Double room with bath. It was a really lovely room beautifully furnished and the bathroom was very well kept and spotless. Although the bath went unused, it was a great pity as it looked really good, a nice size with inbuilt jets.

The only issue with the room was that the heaters on the wall left the air very dry. It was a cold evening so we left them on and woke up from the dryness in the air. The windows only opened half way which would have been fine but for how dry the room had gotten.

The breakfast was very good with a nice choice. Though my hollandaise was a little over done it was still very tasty and the poached eggs were perfectly cooked. The dining room is very nice. A very tasteful and expert refurbishing of the classic style of the hotel must have take place as I have been in the hotel (not staying) years before and it was not as nice.

One problem, though it did not cause me any difficulty is that the hotel does not really advertise the rooms it has on offer. The rooms page on its website gives no detail as to what is available and what seperates a standard from a deluxe or otherwise.

The bar is also lovely in its classic style and staff were helpful and friendly.",4,2015,01,16
232,"Return visit, probably not our last","Our second stay in this hotel as we stayed here previously in 2011. 
We arrived  before 13.00 & took a chance that  our room might be ready & it was. Check in was quick, friendly & informative. Our room, 531, was perfect for a weekend break. Located at the end of a corridor, size wise it was ok & was decorated & furnished in an old style that fitted well with the rest of the building with carpet floor, wallpapered walls & mahogany furniture. Clean & comfortable with a great double bed, bedside lockers, overhead reading lights, radio/alarm clock, armchair, dresser, fridge, tea/coffee, wall mounted tv, large wardrobe, luggage rack, safe, iron & ironing board, dressing gowns, full length & smaller mirror. Room temperature was perfect from the 2 fan assisted electric radiators. Two windows gave plenty of natural light. We had no issues with noise from within the hotel & even though our room was at the front of the hotel & faced over the busy street below, the fact that we were on the fifth floor meant that we had no noise issues from outside of the hotel either.
Our bathroom was a nice size, clean & bright & looked as if it had been renovated fairly recently. With tiled floor, half tiled walls, 8 jet bath, bath shower mixer, shower head on hose & rail, bath screen, toiletries, plenty of towels, hairdryer, shaving socket, ceiling vent & heated towel rad. We had issues with the shower which was easy to control but left a mini flood on the bathroom floor after usage. The bracket for the shower head appeared to be broken/loose & it was not possible to control where the water was spraying. Added to the that, the shower head protruded too far out from the wall that it was fixed to which more or left the shower screen obsolete. Both my wife & I had to remove the shower head from the bracket & hold it by hand to rinse off, in order to minimise the amount of water on the floor. Another difficulty was that, though I am a fairly average height of 5’10”, I had to stoop under the shower head to get the use of it. I reported the issue of the shower to reception when checking out & the receptionist did seem to be shocked & genuinely unaware of any problem having been reported previously & she promised to have it checked before any other guests occupied the room.
Breakfast was very good. We went down at 10.35 & were expecting to have to wait for a table but, we were seated immediately & there were several tables free. We were served by a very friendly & attentive waitress who told us that breakfast was part self service/ part order from a menu. Self service had fruit juices, tea, coffee, latte, cappuccino, cereals, yoghurts, grapefruit segments, orange slices, melon pieces, prunes, croissants, scones & toast. From the menu were porridge, full fry, grilled kippers, eggs benedictine, grilled goats cheese, pancakes & a vegetarian option.
We went  to the hotel  bar for drinks in the evening  & as we were seated at a table & the place was quite busy with a nice atmosphere & was obviously popular with the locals, we decided to try the menu there for our meals. It turned out to be a good call as we enjoyed our food, served by a very friendly & attentive waitress who appeared to be working on her own but who managed it admirably. Our food arrived very quickly after ordering but did appear to be freshly cooked. Sea bass costing 14.95 Euros & homemade beefburger also costing 14.95, served with generous portions of veg, potatoes, fries & side salad. Pints of smithwicks ale cost 4.95 Euros & quarter bottles of wine, 5.75.
Wifi was free of charge & open, with no password required. Using my phone, it was very quick to connect to in our room & was very consistent as I didn’t drop the service even once. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get connected at all when in the hotel bar.
Check out was quick & friendly & left luggage was actually behind the reception desk, so was secure. 
Location wise, the hotel is perfect for city centre shopping, sightseeing or entertainment. OConnell Street is literally just metres from the front door of the hotel & the shops of Henry Street are 2 to 3 minutes walk away. Temple Bar is less than 10 minutes walk & the central bus station, Busaras, is also within several minutes walk & easy to find from the hotel. There is a Luas tram stop just metres from the hotel which I used to get to the Guinness Hop Store. Cost was 2.20 Euros single journey or 4.00 for return with the journey taking approx 12 minutes to the stop at James’ (6 stops from Wynns) which was then just a short walk to Guinness. I walked back to the hotel from Guinness & at a fairly brisk pace, it took me approx. 20-25 minutes to do so. For your info, entrance to Guinness was 18.00 Euros at the door.
We don’t have any plans to be back in Dublin any time soon for a leisure or weekend break but if we did, Wynns would probably be our hotel of choice for our stay.",4,2015,01,13
232,Great hotel,A lovely old style hotel in the heart of the city. Breakfast is fab in the beautiful dining room. You do need to be vigilant in the area late at night because unfortunately there are a lot of drug addicts in the area but it seems to be a common problem all over Dublin and is certainly not Wynnes fault!  Front facing windows have a lovely view of the bustling city.,5,2015,01,11
232,Location for the vacation,Wynn's Hotel is in the centre of O'Connell Street with the Luas line stop outside the door. It is within walking distance of Grafton Street and Temple Bar area. The hotel has a dining area inside the main entrance with an adjoining bar and staff are very friendly and helpful. The bedrooms are great.  A lovely hotel to stay in and great value and a fine breakfast.  ,5,2015,01,06
232,Perfect Location ,"I've stayed in the Wynn a few times and the plus for me has always been the location. Can't get more in the heart of Dublin than this. Easy walking distance to all the major attractions.
My other half loves their eggs benedict and says of other places ""they aren't as good as the Wynn""",4,2014,12,28
232,Lucky Choice,"We first ""found"" this hotel when we popped in for lunch on a previous visit to Dublin,and were very impressed by the quality of the food ,and the service.When we were looking for a place to stay,centrally,for a pre-Christmas visit,Wynn's was the obvious choice. Central it is - 100 yards from O'Connell Street.five mins walk from Henry Street and the shopping area,and two mins walk from the Abbey Theatre.The Luas stops outside so you are not far from the rail network,and Bus Aras is 400 yds away..Great rooms,great food and wonderful people. We will certainly stay there again,and again",5,2014,12,20
232,Old world charm,"This was a fairly last minute booking, for a business related trip, chosen mainly for location and price.  So I honestly wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Staff at check in and out were very friendly and helpful.   My room was cosy and homely.  It was spacious enough and more than I'd hoped for.  I had asked for a high floor or quiet room and was conveniently located on the 5th floor, end of corridor.  This was great as I'd imagine any rooms lower down might have some noise issues with the Luas line and busy street below.  

As a tourist, you couldn't really go wrong here, just off O'Connell St, Luas line outside the front door, Connolly Station within walking distance and generally most areas of interest in the city centre too.  There was a decent breakfast on offer, despite the small dining room staff did their upmost to accommodate everyone.  And even though they were very busy, they kept a smile on their face.  This really is a little gem of a hotel.  A throwback to times when you were made feel a little bit special as a guest.  The creaky stairs wrapped around the old elevator shaft and traditional treatment all made it a very comfortable experience.",4,2014,12,20
232,Old fashioned hotel with dated bathroom,"My daughter and I had a nice stay at Wynns Hotel for 4 days.  The staff were VERY friendly.  We got a quiet room placed facing  the courtyard.  Our room had a bathroom that was very dated with a washbasin with one cold and one hot tap.  You had to stand in the bathtub to shower and the water was sometimes too cold or too hot.  The tiles were beige with brown decor, so I think it was last refurbished 40-50 years ago.   The room was very clean, but the floor was carpeted.  We had great shopping because the hotel is very central with lots of shops nearby.",3,2014,12,20
232,Respect- Cleanliness-Location-Value.,"I stayed here for one night as part of a weekend break. It came recommended by a friend and I will pass on that recommendation to the readers.

From the very outset, the staff were very professional, polite and friendly. the service was brilliant in all the departments. I was advised that there would be a late night seasonal party and this may cause some disturbance, but it didn't.

The decor is quirky and old fashioned, but has that individual charm which sets it aside from the rest, yet is in keeping with the location, it worked for me anyway.

My room (250) was more than ample for a solo traveler. It was clean, well decorated and functional in the en-suite. Lashings of hot water to shower with and spotlessly clean throughout the room.

I had an early flight ,so missed the cooked breakfast, but was still able to enjoy continental from the very polite and capable staff.

This is one hotel which will remain on my list of places to stay - Highly recommend !",5,2014,12,08
232,Delightful,"Fabulous old fashioned hotel in the center of Dublin.  Luas right outside the door, O'Connell Street around the corner.  The rooms are small but delightfully old fashioned, some even have a fireplace in the room and are spotlessly clean.  The staff were very friendly and the breakfast was lovely.  It was so nice to order and be served breakfast, rather than the modern way of the breakfast buffet.  Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,12,07
232,An ideal base,"Wynn's has a genuinely old Dublin hotel atmosphere which gives it its warm unique character. It is so central, convenient to shopping, theatres and the transport link from Connelly St train station couldn't be better. Just 2 stops away, the LUAS tram link stops right at the door which means no hassle with taxis and luggage.The food is first class with multi choice breakfasts and really hearty buffet meals available - if you could even tackle them after breakfast! The staff are well trained, helpful and courteous. It is difficult to fault Wynn's if you want a comfortable convenient base for a break in Dublin.",4,2014,12,06
232,Such a pleasent stay,Stayed her for one night. Lovely room on the third floor. Very clean and surprisingly quiet considering its on a busy street right beside the Luas. Absolutely lovely staff so pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was one of the best ive had. This hotels location is ideal for anyone attending an event in the o2 and is centrally based so makes it ideal for shopping. Will definitely stay again in the future. ,5,2014,12,05
232,Old Time Hospitality,"Just off O'connell and Abbey st. in the heart of Dublin. The Hotel is old school ,not much has
changed in decades. The hotel's pub is a proper Irish pub with a varied clientele, the total
opposite of Temple Bar ,which basically is ignored by real Dubs. The rooms are a good size and
very comfortable. The T.V. is brutal but you are in Dublin. Within 50 M. of the front door are some
of the best Pubs in Dublin. The breakfast is fabulous with a full array of cereals , yogurt , fruit
and if you feel like fattening up for the day a full Irish breakfast is doable. Slainte.",4,2014,12,03
232,Faultless experience in a charming and friendly establishment,"Our stay in Wynns was faultless, from the excellent welcome at check in, the comfort, cleanliness and decor of our room, the ambience of the 'Saints and Sinners' lounge bar and the fulfilling breakfast each morning, we can have no complaints. 
Our room was on the fifth floor and front facing so any street noise was non existent which is something any light sleepers or early bedders might wish to consider.
Situated just off O'Connell Street in Dublin City centre means that every amenity is on your doorstep and well within walking distance. For those wishing to venture further, the Lewis tram stop is outside the front door and the Dart trains are only a short walk to Tara Street station.
As frequent visitors to dublin, we have stayed in many city hotels, some good, some not so good. We are so pleased to have found Wynns and we will definitely be making this fine, historical establishment our hotel of choice for all future visits.
We cannot recommend Wynns highly enough nor praise the staff and management for making our stay so enjoyable.",5,2014,12,02
232,It costs nothing to say sorry,"This is an unusual review for me as it has a negative slant to it. The management of the hotel Neil and Rory accused myself or my wife of spilling red wine on my new laptop.The laptop happened to be damaged by water at the same time as a significant water leak from the bathroom while my wife was showering.On the day there was no concern about the possibility of slipping in the pool of water. We were delayed an extra 3 hrs in checking out.At no time during this point were we ever given an apology for inconvenience.This costs nothing.Being the paying customer should demand some sort of service under the situation which never appeared only accusation and deception.
On a more positive note the hotel is well situated, the food is lovely and all the other staff are very pleasant and professional. The room was spacious and well decorated, toilet had a jaccuzzi bath ( with leak)which was a nice touch.",4,2014,12,02
232,What a great location,"We were visiting Dublin for just the one Saturday night and wanted somewhere very central and ""nice"" but not too expensive - quite and ask in Dublin!  We struck it lucky with Wynn's and a great deal on the booking.com.  The location is brilliant - 10 minutes walk from Connollly railway station and just off O'Connell Street with a luas tram stop just outside the front door.  The rooms were fine but be warned that those at the front can be quite noisy, although apparently you can get ear plugs from the reception desk!  One of our rooms was at the back and faced onto a wall but we weren't there for the view.  One criticism was that the was quite a smell of food wafting up from the kitchen into this room so I did prefer the front even with some noise.  Breakfast was fantastic with a great choice of items.  It was really lovely to have my full Irish served fresh to me at the table instead of the nowadays more usual lukewarm buffet.  Overall a great hotel, in a brilliant location - although only for a couple of nights.  I would definitely return again.",4,2014,12,01
232,Earthly charm,"We had a very comfortable stay at Wynn's. The staff are great and very accommodating. The ambience is like the way things used to be, a glimpse into a vibrant past, steeped in history and stories that resonate down the ages. Traditionally a place where people met in Dublin from the country you get a sense of the generational attachment that people have. We also had the pleasure of meeting Stephen Ferris at the Hotel, a rugby legend, prior to Ireland's match with Australia! Very decent bloke! This hotel is a welcome change from some of the modern dross, is well located and recommended.",4,2014,11,28
232,A real old word experience!,"Was attending a conference here last week and thoroughly enjoyed my visit. Was lovely to see old Dublin couples enjoying lunch and a few drinks midweek in an old historic hotel closely associated to our revolutionary past! The waitress in the bar was most kind and helpful when I arrived a couple of minutes late for the lunch carvery, bringing me a fine lunch.

Central and convenient, loved the olde world feel but can offer no thoughts on the accomodation.",4,2014,11,25
232,Ace,Super hotel staff wonderful could not do enough . Would certainly recommend. Breakfast yummy with lots of choice. 737 bus from airport to hotel. The hotel was full but still service was ok. Would return to this hotel on next trip to Dublin,5,2014,11,22
232,Nice hotel,Excellent location close to shops and nightlife! Check was very quick and staff were very nice! Rooms were nice but small! The hotel is generally nice bit could do with some updating! Would stay here again! ,3,2014,11,12
232,Historic Wonderful Wynn's,"Easy friendly check in, historic elegance, wonderful breakfast, perfect Dublin location, a good nights sleep, knowable efficient staff; who could ask for more? Convenient taxi stand just around the corner. This was my 4th visit and I will be back!",5,2014,11,11
232,Art Deco space with chintzy feel. Central.,"
Dated but clean, faded but characterful.  Excellent service from staff and filling breakfast, but they need toast racks to avoid the sogginess!   Room  532 is one to avoid.  Tiny.  That's me warned off single occupancy deals!   I got moved to 534 which is a mini suite. Spacious in comparison. Very comfy bed. Iron, hair dryer, kettle and safe included in the room. Chintzy.  Shower looked like it was from the 80s but was hot and powerful.  Only one very slow and quite small lift in the hotel. Interesting bar with local life made it feel more real than a chain hotel might have. On the night I stayed we were warned of a party which would last til 1am.  It did. Though it stopped on the dot. Other pluses - Great central location and handy for airport bus as well as trams. 
",3,2014,11,10
232,Overnight in Wynns,"This was my first time to stay at Wynns Hotel, based on the excellent reviews and rating on Tripadvisor.  Check-in was hassle free and speedy, room was very clean, comfortable and suitable for my needs.  First impressions of the Hotel reminded me of Bertrams's in the Agatha Christie's Miss Marple, it is has certainly not lost any of it's old-world charm, great to see in Ireland nowadays.  Bar staff were friendly and efficient.  I will certainly return to Wynns (I'm still calling it Bertrams!), my biggest memory and discovery was to meet the night porter, Patsy (excellent at his job and a credit to the Hotel), and to discover he was a long-lost relation of mine!  The rate for B&B was very good, location is second to none and the Luas Tram, stops just outside the door, all very convenient.  Hope to see you all soon again and I will certainly be recommending you to others.",5,2014,11,04
232,Too much noise,Location good for shopping but not a good nights sleep on both nights. First night there was a 21st birthday function and the noise was appalling. Second night road works outside kept us awake. Rooms comfortable if you get to sleep.  Food not great. Ate in the hotel first night - ordered a risotto which arrived in minutes of ordering and tasted like it had been precooked and left under a warming plate. Main meal wasn't much to talk about.  Very much doubt I would go back. ,3,2014,11,04
232,Comfortable like your favorite slippers...,"We are three baby-boomers in two rooms--- admittedly, from NYC, so the busy street sounds are like a lullaby. Charming older hotel, well-priced (including excellent hot and buffet breakfast), steps from the Abbey Theatre. Friendly, speedy check-in, even though we were here at 10am. Very accommodating staff, eager to help. We decided to stay two nights longer, and even though the city's hotels are full due to a convention, our stay was quickly extending, after some artful juggling.",4,2014,11,04
232,Excellent staff,"Nicely located, just off the bottom of O'Connell Street, Wynn's gives easy access to the city centre. The staff are first class - every one of them friendly and helpful. The building is late nineteenth century in style - lots of wood paneling, with furniture to match, so the overall impression is dated, not contemporary - you may like this consistency of style or you may feel it's a bit faded. The bathroom in our fifth floor room was quite new - and spotless. But why oh why don't hotels fit thermostatic showers?... getting the balance between scalding and arctic was sometimes a tricky exercise on our bath-mixer-type shower arrangement. Our room had a fridge and a safe. We didn't try the food, other than breakfast which was reasonable but not exceptional.",3,2014,11,04
232,"Lovely,friendly, relaxing hotel","Spent three nights recently here and have to say that the staff are all very helpful ad friendly. The breakfast each morning was excellent. We also ate in the bar one evening and the food was very tasty. 
As the hotel is so central it is in easy reach of all the shops, buses and tram service.",4,2014,10,30
232,Saints and scholar's lounge. Dublin's best kept secret!,My mother had her wedding reception in Wynne's Hotel over 50 years ago so for good reason  Saints and scholars lounge is her favourite venue for meeting friends for a quiet drink or lunch in town. Wynne's is a very civilised elegant place with lots of history and charm. There are 2 places for lunch: the posh a la carte restaurant to the right and the Lounge to the left as you go in which serves a very popular carvery served from 12pm it seems. The mushroom soup was thick and to die for served with 2 slices of wheaten bread. The seafood quiche was also exceptional both very well priced at €4.95. There is a need for a proper till area to pay for food as there is nowhere to balance trays while you pay and get water. A great meeting place in Central Dublin.,5,2014,10,29
232,Brilliant stay!!,"As we presented ourselves at the Hotel And our car was taking off us by a lovely Porter? Robbie.. It was a great start! ...Very professional Friendly Courteous and nothing was too much trouble for the staff 
 As a local Have always wanted to stay in Wynns And my partner is from belfast But no stranger to Dublin As we have stayed in plenty of hotels in the Capital 

This hotel wins hands down It may not be ultra modern But from the lobby to the lift.. And on and on its class .. Breakfast was plentiful and wide choice of same And!! Served to your table 

Will be back",5,2014,10,28
232,Old style hotel perfect for a weekend trip,"I stayed here on a weekend trip to Dublin together with good old friends. 

The hotel is very central with walking distance to everything. Friendly staff, good bedrooms, nice hotel bar and excellent breakfast. Overall, I got a very good impression.

The only thing on the minus side was the really slow hotel elevator. No big issue though.",5,2014,10,22
232,And at last my wife knows why I always try to stay at Wynn's.,"Virtually all my trips to Dublin are to give Tutorials, so are therefore on business.  Some years ago I managed to educate my colleagues to the charms of Wynn's, with the result that they now stay there as well, but it is several years since my wife last accompanied me to Dublin.  The welcome as we walked into reception was enough on its own to justify in her eyes the praise that I always heap on the hotel whenever I get back home after a visit.  As always, the staff were incredibly welcoming, the dinner was excellent, our room as comfortable as ever, and the location impressed my wife.

One hint for visitors to Dublin - at long last there is one ticket to cover suburban rail, 'buses - including the Dublin Bus 747 service to and from the airport - and Luas (the tram system).  But - it can only be bought at the airport (from the Dublin Bus desk or the Spar shops) and there is only a version valid for 72 hours.  But as a return ticket on the 747 is 10 Euro the cost of the ticket at 19.50 Euro is not unreasonable.",5,2014,10,16
232,Lovely Old Stlye Hotel,"Stayed here our last 2 nights in Dublin.  We arrived by rental car, and I can tell you it was a nightmare trying to find a space in front of the Hotel so the porter could take the car to the parking lot!  It took us 4 tries around the block, and in Dublin traffic, we needed the bar as soon as we arrived.
Breakfast each day was lovely. The staff was very helpful, they suggested 2 amazing restaurants for dinner.. There was no air conditioning, so the room was a bit hot during the day & early evening. May choose something on the newer side of town next time, but all in all a very nice stay.",4,2014,10,14
232,"Location, location, location","Stayed overnight while attending a concert in the o2.  Fantastic location for the o2 & shopping - I have stayed in various other hotels near the o2 but there is nothing else down there & next day you have to carry your bags around the shops!  Got the luas down & back to concert, it was so handy as didn't want to be walking around at night. The room was spotless, had a lovely breakfast & would return again.",5,2014,10,14
232,Excellent hotel,"A group of 16 of us stayed at Wynn's from the 4th October for 4 nights.  It's a charming, traditional hotel, extremely handy for the shops, buses, sight-seeing buses and trams.  The staff were very helpful and friendly (as was everyone we came across in Ireland), and the breakfasts excellent.  I had a lovely room, with all the facilities I could wish for.  Highly recommended.",5,2014,10,12
232,Friendly staff and a relaxed atmosphere,"I stayed at the Wynns hotel on a business trip recently and found the hotel to be comfortable and with a friendly atmosphere. The staff are helpful and efficient even when the hotel is very busy. The food is reasonably priced, as is the hotel and service is excellent. My single room was comfortable with free wifi and the location is excellent just a short walk from the main shopping street and the Aircoach from the airport. For Families and Business trips at a reasonable price I think this Hotel is well worth considering.",4,2014,10,11
232,Really old style hotel,"I have visited this hotel on a few occasions for drinks with a friend who likes this hotel. However, it is not really my cup of tea. It's an old style atmosphere but is lacking something. In saying that, they seem to get a lot of customers so suppose it's just a case of what each person likes.",2,2014,10,10
232,Average Hotel for a decent price,Stayed here for a couple days for St Patrick's day.  It was a great location about 50 feet from the parade route.  The hotel itself was clean and in good shape.  Nothing overly special but a good place to sleep for a couple nights.,3,2014,10,08
232,Lovely,"Quiet room with a lovely view of Dublin :) very helpful and friendly staff. Comfortable beds, clean room. Breakfast was very nice and dinner was fantastic value with great choice. It is lovely sitting in the testaurant or the bar.  The location is ideal for the city centre and I really enjoyed a short walk to wherever I wanted to go.I will def stay here again. ",5,2014,10,07
232,25 years later,"We had a very relaxing couple nights at this comfy well appointed Hotel.  Our mini suite was on the top floor at the back with plenty of privacy, very clean and quiet.   Breakfasts were great and we loved sitting down in the Saints and Scholars Lounge for a pint and watching your typical Dubliner come in for the great value lunch.  Close to shopping, hop on hop off buses and A beautiful walk to St. Stephens Green.  If you like the hustle and bustle of the city and that comfortable feel with great friendly staff for great value this place is for you.  A perfect start to our silver anniversary trip to Ireland and Denmark.  Fondly,  Irene & Patrick. Xoxo",5,2014,10,05
232,Wynn's picture says it all.,"We stayed 3 nights in this hotel and could not sleep even with ear plugs for the noise.  If you look at their picture, you see that it is essentially on the street with a light rail stop in front.  All night long, people are yelling and the traffic and train are noisy so that it is very hard to sleep.  In addition, the beds are like rocks.  
So if noise and very firm beds are to your liking, this is your place to stay.",2,2014,10,03
232,"Ok, but can be noisy, and probably rates itself a bit too highly","The rooms are OK (I was in two), with a comfy bed, well-laid out ensuite and good facilities (desk/plugs/wardrobe). Rooms on the lower floors at the front will probably suffer from road noise, and if there is an event in the function room on the first floor you will hear it all if you are just above it. I suffered from this, and was moved to a 'quiet' room at the back, only to find the ventilation shaft had a very noisy fan running all night in it. Not great, so I moved back to the intermittent noise of the trams! I guess that not all rooms are like that, but if you are a light sleeper think about it. Breakfasts are great - individually cooked, but this can mean it is slow.",3,2014,10,02
232,Classic Irish hotel right in the heart of Dublin,"A wonderful old hotel located right in the heart of Dublin, just a short walk from many of Dublin's main attractions.  Easy access to the Hop on-Hop off bus tour and the Luas trams stop right in front of the building providing access to both train stations.  This makes an excellent overnight base for hitting Railtours Ireland.

The Hotel itself is old in a Classic Irish style which is just what we were looking for to get the feel of actually staying in Dublin.  The staff was very friendly and was happy to provide us with a late evening desert and Irish coffee in the Saints and Scholars bar after the kitchen was closed.  We found the street noise to be more of a muffled urban background sound and was not a problem; we slept with the window open each night.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin who is looking for a laidback stay in a quaint establishment with a good location.",5,2014,10,01
232,Excellent value right in the centre of Dublin,"The big attraction is the very central location in Dublin. On top of this the room price is good and everything clean and friendly. Do try the dining room lunch; for €25pp you get 3 enormous courses with coffee or tea included. Food well presented and served and good quality.

There are signs of wear and tear but we felt the value was still good. For the disabled, access and facilities need improving.",4,2014,09,28
232,lovely stay,"Had a lovely stay here, arrived at 7.30am and was ok to check in! Staff were very helpful, the room wwas spotless, and really nice decor. The bar was busy but staff were friendly and courteous, will stay here again.",5,2014,09,22
232,Not for me!,"Tiny tiny room facing onto the street, no table in room for room service, abrupt staff, overpriced... Location good but rooms seriously need upgrading.Bathrooms also need attention ..if staying there request a room at the back
Of the hotel if you are a light sleeper..... Not for me :(",3,2014,09,22
232,"Great location, rooms need renovation","Great central location, just off O'Connell street. Both the hotel and the breakfast staff are very friendly. The bathrooms and rooms are on the small side and they need renovating but are clean overall.",4,2014,09,17
232,Perfect Location!,"Central Dublin at Abbey Road LAUS tram station. 1 block from bus stop on Connell Street. Great bar, restaurant and full hot breakfast. No air. Nice rooms. Will stay again. Very healthful. Walk to Temple Bar area ",5,2014,09,17
232,Very good location for a Dublin holiday,"I can highly recommend the venerable Wynn's Hotel, in the heart of the city center, located steps from historic O'Connell Street and just a block from the River Liffey. Breakfast is included in a nice ground floor restaurant (we had a pleasant dinner there as well). We stayed in the James Joyce Suite, which is a lovely room with queen bed, an electric fireplace and is in a very quiet corner of the hotel. Within easy walking distance of Trinity College (Book of Kells), the General Post Office, Temple Bar area, shopping, and on the route of the Dublin Green Hop On/Off bus. Friendly staff. They had an issue with the elevator (it squealed for a couple of days, which was annoying) but had it fixed and gave us a discount for our trouble.",4,2014,09,16
232,Perfect hotel experience for family city break.,"I have stayed in Wynns many times over the years right from when my children were tiny babies up to recently now that they are school age. The first time I brought a travel cot I got chatting with the mananger and recommended a company who had custom made a mattress for my travel cot beccause I. found everyone slept like logs when belittle one had a comfy travel mattress and it made travelling with the kids so much easier. Wellvthe next time we came back they had had lovely deep mattresses made by that company for their their travel cots in the room. I am continually impressed by the great service at Wynns. Lovely old world charm, comfy sleigh beds in room with heavy curtains that meet in the middle and actually keep the morning light out, a great breakfast with lovely waiting staff whom my kids adore. All bang smack in the centre of the city. What more could you ask for.",5,2014,09,15
232,Great for a night in Dublin,"This place is right in the heart of the city centre, a few minutes walk from all the main shops. It's slightly old fashioned and I'm not going to lie the corridors were a bit creepy. We found the place was full of elderly people (we're in our 20s) but we were only there at night to sleep! 
When you arrive you park in the loading bay across the road and a porter parks your car in an available spot in the city, saves you having to find parking, they keep your key and fetch your car when you need it. Our twin room was fine, not a tiny box but not huge either, we had a fab view of other buildings and a roof haha, I suppose the view depends on which side of the hotel you're on. The amenities in the room was great - fridge, tv, iron, electric fire etc. for the price it's a nice little place to stay if you're planning a day of shopping. The bar next door to the hotel was lovely as well. The bar in the hotel was again full of elderly people.",4,2014,09,15
232,A definite yes!,"Very well located, walking distance from center and Temple bar. Our room was clean but not very large (something otherwise to be expected in a lot of Ireland/UK hotels). As a minus, the bed was quite narrow, suitable maybe for 2 slim persons. The staff was friendly, polite and professional. The food at the bar is recommended as well as a chat with the bartenders. They were really nice fellows. Breakfast has several options to choose from and is plentiful. We definitely consider staying here again when next in Dublin.",5,2014,09,14
232,A great place to stay,We have been going to the Wynns hotel for many years but it just seems to be getting better and better the hotel itself has a feel of tradition and comfort staff ar e very friendly and helpful you wont find them standing around its a very busy place excellent rooms very clean the food is first class central location for the city try it you wont be disappointed.,5,2014,09,13
232,Fantastic,Stayed at Wynns for two nights and had a great experience. All the staff are so helpful and kind. Rooms are lovely as well as the food! Great location for shopping and going out at night! Nice quiet hotel even with the luas outside you do not hear anything at all. Would highly recommend!,5,2014,09,08
232,Great place,My wife and I stayed here and loved the place. It was very well located for a stay in Dublin. We enjoined the room. We had a room in the front of the building and we're not bothered by the road noise or anything. We would both come back. Great place,4,2014,09,06
232,Warm and welcoming,"I recently traveled with a group to Dublin and stayed at the Wynn's.  The hotel has history and character, is centrally located and convenient to all the major sights of Dublin.  Walking distance to Trinity College, shopping, Temple Hill area with all of its restaurants and bars.  The hotel has a nice bar and restaurant.  Lovely cooked Irish breakfast with delicious scones.  Also offered fanciful lunch and dinner menus, including game. The hotel rooms were what you typically find throughout Europe; upgraded bathrooms and very clean.   The staff were very nice,  accommodating and worked very hard to serve our group. Everyone was delighted with their level of service. The hotel is moderately priced.  If the opportunity presents itself, I will stay here again.",4,2014,09,03
232,Perfect location and excellent service,"Stayed here before 2 years ago and just got back from another stay. This is the first time I've ever written a review and Wynns has prompted me to do it!
Amazing location within walking distance from Temple Bar, main shopping areas and other areas of interest, also good transport links, tram stops right outside and short walk from your bus stops.
We also walked to the natural history museum which took about 15 minutes.
Short taxi journey or bus ride to airport, about 20-30 mins depending on traffic. 20-25 euros in a taxi.

I can't praise the staff enough, so helpful and so friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. We had breakfast every day and the choice and service was faultless.

Rooms are spacious, very clean and has everything you need. Cleaned daily to a high standard.

Dublin is a great city, it has something for everyone and I would definitely stay here again!",5,2014,09,02
232,Very Nice Hotel,"We stayed in Wynns Hotel on the 18th August 2014 and had a very enjoyable stay. The hotel is in a good location, handy for everything, it is clean and comfortable and the breakfast was excellent. There appeared to be some work going on during the day and you could here the sound of drills, but all the noise stopped about 4.30. The staff were friendly and we had no complaints. We had 2 enjoyable nights there and could recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a break in Dublin.",4,2014,09,02
232,More than expected Wynns Hotel,"Wynns Hotel is clean, comfortable and in a great location.  At night the streets are lively, but you are safe in Wynns.  Breakfast was OK.  The waiter nipped to the shop to buy us some beans too.  Nice touch.",5,2014,09,01
232,value for money,"Just back from a two day trip to Dublin.  Chose to stay at this hotel due to price offered and location.  Its location is a major plus point, located in the city centre near to everything - shops, buses, sites etc.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  The lift was out of order during our stay and its quite a big hotel so that wasn't ideal but our bags were delivered up by a porter on arrival.  The hotel is old fashioned, the rooms are plain and a bit small/stuffy and the breakfast is about 7/10 of 10.

Overall I rate this as a good budget Dublin hotel and had an enjoyable stay.",4,2014,08,29
232,You Win At Wynn's!,"This is the place to stay while visiting Dublin. The price and location are the best. You are really at an Irish, instead of a cookie cutter, hotel. The staff is the best I've ever experienced; they are quality people who really see to your positive stay and do so effortlessly - there is nothing undone or overdone to insure that your stay is comfortable. Kudos to Neal Loftus who owns the place.
The food is a credit to a great staff and the selection is wide.   
The rooms are very clean and spacious.  

Book it.",5,2014,08,28
232,What a gem!,"I stayed at the Wynn's upon recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed.  The price and location were both excellent, so I was not expecting much from the hotel, but I was pleasingly wrong.  The staff really made the experience lovely.  They are all so kind!  They really go out of their way to get to know you and are very helpful.  The best staff of any hotel I've ever stayed in.  The rooms were nice and clean.  Toiletries were provided and replenished daily.  The breakfast was included and very good--several menu choices and a wait staff.  They also have a nice relaxing bar, which many choices.  The hotel offered free wifi in the rooms, which is nice for international travelers.  On the day of our departure, we ran the half marathon in the city and asked for a late checkout, which was granted, even though the hotel was fully booked for that evening.  When we were still running a little behind in order to get out at the late checkout time, they told us it was fine to take our time in finishing getting ready.  I know this caused the staff to rush to get the room ready after we left, so this is just another example of how wonderful the customer service is at this hotel.",5,2014,08,15
232,thank you wynns,"just had a week visit to this hotel 
thank you all for making my visit so memorial
from the door porter/recepton/ cleaning ladies i recieved nothing short of 5 star service
great hotel great staff and the guinness is to die for lol
thank you all once again 
if you will have me i will stay in your hotel once again",5,2014,08,13
232,Boiled Alive,"I wanted to love this hotel, but couldn't manage it. The staff were charming and the location is great, but the room was tiny, the plumbing was so loud that it woke me and my partner in the night, and the room itself was sweltering. The mattresses are not good and the place generally seems to be mouldering with good grace. I wouldn't recommend it for any trip and was relieved that I only had to spend one night. However, the location is perfect for getting around, and the staff are so kind and friendly that if you're not choosy, this could be great.",2,2014,08,11
232,Ideal location,"I love going to wynns hotel. 
My bus stop is outside the front door, staff very helpful. Rooms very comfortable and clean. No real luxuries but still high standard. 
Breakfast is always brilliant and waiter service too notch. 
So handy for buses, Lucas, taxi, shopping, restaurants, etc

Bar is a little dismal, but we didn't use it.",4,2014,08,10
232,Great Location,I stayed here in May. The hotel is right in the city centre and just off O'Connell street. The staff here are so lovely and helpful. The breakfast  is  very good with plenty to choose from and your fry is cooked fresh when ordered.,4,2014,08,09
232,Decent,"Decent option in Dublin, with parking service (the doorman parks the car somewhere for you and brings it back whenever one needs it) and very good location. The mattresses in our room needed to be replaced. Breakfast was fine.",3,2014,08,06
232,Location,Very central hotel right on the Luas Line. Staff friendly and helpful. Twin room was very small but clean and comfortable lovely bathroom. Only downside room was very warm no a/c and window would not open so it hampered a good nights sleep.,4,2014,08,05
232,"Great hotel, central location","I stayed here for 1 night for business. The hotel is very centrally located & really easy to get to from the airport using the air coach. The rooms aren't huge but perfectly formed & very clean with all the necessary facilities. My only criticism about the room was that being at the back of the hotel I was opposite a generator & so it was particularly noisy & not very conducive for a great nights sleep. All of the staff were great, very polite & professional & nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast was nice with a good variety with home made scones, fresh fruit & juice. Overall a fantastic stay & I look forward to going back there again.",4,2014,08,04
232,Charming,"We stayed here three nights. The location is absolutely fabulous. We arrived via bus from Belfast. walked about five minutes and we were at our hotel. We arrived an hour early and our room was not ready (although often they will call housekeeping to double check bu this didn't occur)  I have a feeling they just don't like/do the early arrival but an hour isn't really that early  and if the room is ready, why not? Anyway, I guess I should trust them ;)  ... So we wandered the streets for a bit after leaving our luggage

our room on the second floor was comfortable and small but clean. We looked out onto 4 other windows- the room faced into the hotel so no view whatsoever, the bathroom sink was tiny- no room to put toiletries on the counter.( there was a cabinet above, however) I saw the room across from us when it was being cleaned and it was easily twice the size .  However, what did we need a bigger room for? We were in Dublin so we spent all our waking hours exploring. The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet- no outside noises to contend with!!

The only small issue we had was the toilet. There was a sign that asked we keep the handle down for five seconds. Sometimes this worked: sometimes it did not. We reported this to the front desk and they sent someone to check while we were out. When we returned we were told everything worked perfectly. It did not. Eventually, the toilet would flush so it was not a big problem but was a bit frustrating as it did not work 

The breakfast was amazing, served in a beautiful room facing the front. I think the waiters were a little overworked- no self serve coffee or tea so a lot of running back and forth for them- but I got a smile from our waiter the last day. Cold options were available buffet style then lots to choose from the hot menu. Fruit selection could have been varied a bit but really no complaints about the quality and quantity of the food!

So we paid a decent amount for a room and overall, it was  good value especially if you factor  in location and breakfast. Prices are always high in the summer- what can you do?! 

 Front desk were helpful, especially one night when we were trying to print our boarding passes- they went above and beyond to assist us.

I would definitely stay there again",4,2014,08,04
232,Great Stay,"Central Hotel, very friendly staff rooms rather old fashiones but have everything that you want and clean.  Good nights sleep. Looked after our bags after checkout.  Breakfast was very nice and lots of it.  Would stay here again without hesitation.",4,2014,08,04
232,Best place I've stayed in Dublin!,"Fabulous cosy quiet nights sleep! This is the nicest hotel I have stayed in dublin. Away from the noise of grafton street and temple bar hotels. Great location on abbey street, located beside the luas and near shops. Lovely staff, we were able to leave our bags there while we went shopping after checking out. Fabulous breakfast.",5,2014,08,03
232,Wynn's is a winner!,"Wynn's Hotel, Dublin is a wonderful hotel.  It is conveniently located on Abbey St. just steps from the Abbey Theatre, and O'Connell St. shopping.  Also convenient to Temple Bar, Trinity, And St. Stephen's Green.  The hotel is a modernized old Dublin Hotel - best of both worlds.  It retains its elegant, historic architectural features, yet has modern, crisp rooms with beautiful bathrooms and small refrigerators.
We have stayed here on two occasions.  Our first trip was lovely, but our second stay far surpassed the first.  We were given a room on the 5th floor that was bright and airy with two large windows with window seats.  The marble bathroom had a whirlpool tub and the Armoire had two thick terry cloth robes. The staff is very sweet and attentive.  They are serious about providing quality service.  The breakfast is delicious with fresh squeezed orange juice, fresh fruit, and a variety of breakfast choices. and and lightening service.
I feel the room rates are extremely reasonable for the room, food, and service you receive.",5,2014,07,30
232,Good stay,The rooms are comfortable and really large. It is clean especially the bathroom. The staff is kind and the location is just perfect: few steps from O'Connel Street. Prices are quite high unfortunately. ,4,2014,07,28
232,Pressie,"My children gave me  a night  in Wynn's for my birthday and it was great, met all the people I wanted to meet and the lunch was super and fast, the room was very comfortable and it is  slap dam in the centre of Dublin and everybody new where to meet me. It was full of people eating and drinking from the time I arrived till I went to bed",5,2014,07,26
232,A good nights sleep,"I stayed here for two nights and liked the hotel due to the great location right in the middle of Dublin center and the good sleep I got in my old fashion but ok room. It was very easy to reach the hotel from the airport. Take the Airlink bus and get of at stop number 8. Walk 100 meter and then you find Wynns. Smooth check in and nice welcoming. 
Most guess seem to be 70+. The room had everything I needed but a tip to the management: it would be great to have something to put your suitcase on ( there are wooden foldable things to get) and please fix the broken tiles in the bathroom. It does not look good. The wi-fi in my room was sloow.
The breakfast was really good with friendly service.

I would recommend this hotel to my friends.",4,2014,07,25
232,"Good Price, Great Location, Friendly Staff (Birthday Break)","I've read reviews on here that this hotel is noisy, that the rooms are small and so on. 
The hotel is a little noisy, but no louder than any other city centre hotel. we had the window open both nights we stayed and the noise didn't bother us at all. You want to be in the centre, you're going to have noise. 
The room was a decent size, more than big enough for what you need. Bed was comfy, bathroom had the most amazing bath I've ever had in a hotel!!! 
The breakfast was good. Cooked to order for hot food which is nice.
the staff were all friendly. the lady who checked us in (I'm sorry, I can't remember her name) was really helpful and gave us some local info and placed to go while we waited for our room to be ready (we arrived at 12 and check in is 2). Our bags were stored for us both on arrival and departure, no problems there either. All in all, it was a nice hotel, and the location is top notch. Would stay here again!",4,2014,07,24
232,Another Great visit,I once again stayed here with some friends when we first arrived in Dublin. It was great to meet up with them with all coming in on different flights. I like using the Luas (tram) that stops right outside the hotel. It is a great location right off O'Connell Street near the GPO. Staff is great and they have a great breakfast.,5,2014,07,23
232,"Excellent service, great location","We stayed at the Wynn's hotel in Dublin for our honeymoon - they really treated us so warmly - they staff were all so nice and helpful, and the location is extremely central and close to everything, right off O'Connell street and near the river.  They upgraded us to a nicer room since it was our honeymoon, and the room itself was a tad small, but the bathroom was awesome - the spa shower was so great!  The breakfast was really nice as well.  We really appreciated the care that the staff here took of us.  Thanks Wynn's!  Everyone was so nice!",5,2014,07,22
232,A find in Dublin,Lovely old world hotel in central Dublin.  Don't stay here if you are into modern.  This place ooses charm.  On the tramline so super convenient.  A walk over the bridge to temple bar.  Shopping on the doorstep.  Lovely room and we had one with a spa.  Fantastic breakfast served quickly by great waiters.  Really friendly check in staff and porters were superb.  Free parking if arrive early otherwise a small charge which is really convenient.  Slow lift is the only thing I didn't like.  Would stay here on any trip to Dublin.,5,2014,07,10
232,CONSTRUCTION in hotel,"I was booked into a room directly above where a room was being refurbished. My jetlag was met with horrible construction noises that rattled the room for 3 of my 4 night stay. When I contacted the front reception, they offered me earplugs which I thought was a joke as that was not going to stifle that noise. The second day I talked to the manager who was extremely RUDE, DISMISSIVE and when I told him I thought there was construction going on above.. he simply just wanted me to know it was going on below. In addition, the room smelled horribly and the front desk / doorman was not friendly. When I stay somewhere for 4 nights... they staff are not only friendly, but usually start to recognize you. For my complaints to the front desk they gave me a 9 Euro discount on my 350 euro bill... what an insult. Glad they were able to reconstruct their hotel at my sleeping expense. Isn't that why you book a hotel.. to sleep!!!!",1,2014,07,08
232,"Great location, super breakfast!","We stayed in Wynn's Hotel for one night as we were going to a concert in Marlay Park.
The location is perfect for the city, being so close to O'Connell St, and we didn't notice any noise at all as we were on the 4th floor. 

The reception staff were excellent and the room was large with a very comfy bed.

The best part of our stay was the breakfast. There is a cold food buffet but a menu for your hot choice which is lovely and there is a good selection.

We enjoyed our short stay and will definitely stay here again.",4,2014,07,02
232,Excellent base for a trip to Dublin,"Just returned from 3 nights here. Overall this hotel is very good. Check in was quick. The receptionist team were excellent helpful and friendly. Our room was a good size, well equipped and had a jacuzzi bath. It was clean and towels were changed each day, only thing I would say towels were a little shabby and small some larger fluffy ones would have been wonderful! 
Breakfast was lovely plenty of choice a combination of self service and cooked brought to the table. Staff were lovely and friendly. 
Lovely place to stay made better by the staff.",4,2014,06,29
232,great but non-smokers check your room,"Everything was great except  our first hour.  We booked with non smoking request.  First challenge was finding a way to pull car in to drop off cases.  The poorly marked loading bays over the road were invisible to us, as was the reportedly helpful valet we had read about.  After driving 3 times round the block we parked at public car park down the road for an hour. Not sure where the free parking was as Noone mentioned it when we checked in.  Next our second floor room was intolerably affected by smoking despite a token sign on the room desk to suggest otherwise.   We would have walked out and gone elsewhere but we're offered a room shift and complimentary upgrade.   We were later led to believe the second floor was a smokers floor hence we suggest sensitive guests check their allocated room. Hence we found the initial welcome missed the mark completely.   

However there after our new room did meet all expectations, as did the reception staff, the spot on location and the dining fare for breakfast and evening meals.  We felt the 'valet' guys could have offered more smile and welcome or promoted their role as the first face of the hotel but we had read how helpful they were to other guests.

We would stay again if Dublin but would want to check our room first and a way of flagging help from the valet or acreserved drop off spot on driving up would be useful",5,2014,06,28
232,Superb Hotel,"Stayed at Wynns Hotel for 2 nights in May, Lovely rooms, very clean & excellent service from staff.  The breakfasts were excellent, will definately return to this hotel very soon. We were made very welcome.",5,2014,06,23
232,Old world charm,We stayed for one night midweek when going to a concert in the O2. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was smallish but clean and comfortable. Breakfast was included and was superb. A delightful hotel in the centre of Dublin.,4,2014,06,21
232,One night stay,The hotel was convenient to the Hop On Hop Off route and attractions.  Only downside would be that there was no air conditioning or fan in the room. The breakfast was included and i was glad they were serving earlier than I was told due to my flight time.,3,2014,06,16
232,Lovely one night stay......,"Had a great night at this conveniently placed hotel. Staff extremely helpful throughout our stay (especially the reception staff). Beautiful hotel, full of character. Lovely room, great breakfast.....couldn,t fault the place.
Well done to the Wynn,s!",5,2014,06,15
232,one man show,"Four of us stayed for two nights,reception staff extremely helpful especially Ann Marie,who helped us with our tour of Dublin.Breakfast was included and service and food was very good on both mornings but.the second morning of our stay we arrived down early in the middle of a large group,There was only one waiter on in a black suit,and how he served the amount of people is beyond believe.He greeted everybody re set tables,took orders,all with a smile and all the time the que at front door for breakfast was getting bigger.The only other person that appeared was a man in another suit who only seemed concerned people had there juice poured by him ?This hotel is lovely old style decor,nice rooms ,central location to everything....but very few staff!!!",4,2014,06,15
232,Not a FAN,"Wynns Hotel.....The first thing to say is that it is well located in the heart of Dublin, just off O'Connell Street. That is a major plus. The exterior is lovely, and the interior (foyer etc) is old style, but lovely. Checking in was fast and efficient and the receptionist was very friendly. My room was on the second floor, so I decided to take the lift...... this must be the slowest life in Dublin. In the end , I walked up to the second floor. The Room.... was tiny, no airconditioning and rather gloomy. It was clean, with fresh linen on the bed. Certainly a room for one person ONLY, as it was as stated , TINY. To freshen the room, I pulled the curtains to see a BRICK Wall. As it was a short stay, I'd live with it.  That evening, there was an annoying noise from some mechanical devices outside my window, which made it hard to work (business trip). The second night, quite late, there was a 20 minute plus, NOISE, like an engine running. On complaining to reception, it was Turn Off and I was told it was the FANS in the kitchen which was just below me. 
It was so loud that I could NOT hear the television. On leaving, the next day, I was asked about my stay and I told the receptionist about the FAN and she said it was from ANOTHER BUILDING ??! Funny that, as I was told the night before it was THEIR FAN from THEIR KITCHEN ! She  said she'd inform the Duty Manager of my complaint and unhappy stay. This was over two weeks ago and despite having my e-mail address and telephone number, NO duty manager has come back to me. This isnt good enough folks. To summerise, Wynns is a fine old hotel well located with an excellent breakfast and some staff (kudos to the Dining Room staff - Excellent). They are the PLUSES. The MINUSES are - Tiny Room in my case (Room 257 - avoid), generally noisy from some sort of machinery at the back of the building and then the incident with the KITCHEN FAN at 10PM at night.....has not been dealt with satisfactorily. The very least Wynns can do, is contact the customer about a written complaint.",2,2014,06,15
232,Don't understand why they get good reviews,"I stayed here for 3 days based on reviews I saw on this site. It surprises me that this hotel got such great reviews. 
Pros: great location, front desk staff very helpful, airlink airport bus drops you off around the corner. 
That's all the pros I have for this hotel. The room was extremely small, there was no air conditioning and it got very hot. I couldn't sleep under the covers because there was hair on my sheets. I would never stay here again ",2,2014,06,14
232,Wynn's - your team do you proud!,"Incredibly helpful staff (special mention to Robbie, who leapt in my SUV and drove it like a pro to the bay opposite the hotel to unload) were encountered throughout my 3-day stay at Wynn's, a stylish old hotel in the heart of Dublin. Nothing was too much trouble. The breakfasts are also very good. Something worth considering, although more due the hotel's positioning and not a criticism of the hotel, is that front facing rooms can be noisy as there are tram lines right outside. Also, I was travelling with my dad in a wheelchair and there are 4 steps up to the hotel entrance - although the staff did offer to put a ramp out.
So, if you want a slice of history in the centre of Dublin with excellent service, Wynn's is the place to stay!",5,2014,06,09
232,Two Nights in Dublin at Wynn's,"This was my second trip to Dublin, the first being in 2005 with a group of college students. My reason for going to Ireland this time is that Dublin is the only city I'd seen before, and the brunt of my time was spent in the west and the south.  

Wynn's is a very nice hotel, and VERY well located, just a bit north of the River Liffey, at the intersection of Lower Abbey Street and O'Connell, with a LUAS stop adjacent to it (LUAS is the very efficient trolley system in Dublin, and the ONLY way to get around this traffic-clogged city. If you're looking to see the only the center (Grafton St, Temple Bar, Parnell Square etc) you won't even need the LUAS if you stay at Wynn's as it's an easy walk to those and other locations. I found LUAS particularly convenient and very inexpensive in getting myself to Heuston Rail Station for the next leg of my journey.  

I must confess I don't remember much about the room - that's probably a good thing, as most of us remember only the bad parts. It had a safe which just fit my 13 inch laptop, and of course passport etc - the view was out of Lower Abbey St which was not spectacular - you might ask for a room (I think these are available) facing the river and up a few floors. Given that Lower Abbey St is a busy place I was very impressed that I heard NO noise at night from my second floor room, and I'm a light sleeper.  

There is a rather nice restaurant in the hotel, which serves as a breakfast room for guests, and unlike most hotels I checked out in central Dublin, breakfast here comes with the room, a plus, as many charge a ridiculous number of Euros! There is also a bar, Saints and Scholars, which I found quite pleasant both nights of my stay.  

About breakfast - it drove me a little nuts, as It is very formal - my first morning there I saw several older men in tweeds and tie - a bit too like a private British club for my taste. You are seated, and must wait for the waiter to return to order coffee or tea and any hot food. The second morning i was there this was no problem as the place was almost empty (I always get down at the earliest possible time for breakfast - and in fact the hotel directory wisely advises that). But the first morning I got down at the beginning of the prescribed hour and the place was nearly full. I wanted only continental, which except for the coffee is serve yourself, but had to wait a very long time for any service. I think this was exceptional, as there was a large group of older men, mostly (one of the waiters thought I was one of their party) who were heading out on an antique train journey. But just thought I'd let you know what can happen, even at an early hour in the breakfast room.  

In general however the hotel was fine - as already noted excellently located - with a very friendlly, engaging and helpful staff - I certainly recommend it.
Room Tip:",4,2014,06,09
232,perfect for Dublin city break,"Hotel is just off O'Connell St with a Luas stop right outside the front door, and close to the Temple Bar area. Very comfortable and clean with pleasant helpful staff. The food was lovely with a great selection. Would recommend it to anyone interested in staying in the centre of Dublin.",5,2014,06,05
232,"Great spot, with old world charm.","Often we find hotels that have old fashioned rooms and say that they need updating, however wynns hotel manage to make it charming. The rooms are quite small, but Due to the age of the hotel, this is understandable. This hotel was in operation prior to the 1916 rising, so it is steeped in history and one can well picture the ladies from that time having their cumman na ban meetings.   The bar, and dining room are lovely,  and it has a lovely calming  atmosphere. The ladies in reception are really lovely, helpful and eager to please.  I drove to the hotel, which is difficult, it has the luas line stopping right outside the front door, so while there is valet parking, it is hard to know where to stop to enter the hotel, you have to park across the street in a bus area. ( and  worry about being clamped). However the Valet  is a lovely friendly man who is fast at retrieving and parking your car.
 The only downside was that we had a room facing the back of the hotel, so to open the windows  we got a view of the backs of othe buildings and an alley.  Also while all the staff we met were lovely, there was one girl who was serving breakfast who made it very obvious she would rather be anywhere else.  She didn't smile or speak , and undermined the wonderful job the two male servers were doing. Both with friendly attitudes. All in all I would recommend this hotel, it is in a city centre spot, and is very near to croke park.",4,2014,06,01
232,Last minute,"Centrally located in Dublin City Centre on the Red Luas Line, clean, reception staff very friendly (especially the girl who greeted us on our arrival - black hair and glasses), dining room old worlde and pleasant.

Room was very small (on the 5th floor) but maneagable.

Only real complaint is that there was a private function on the first floor and the people attending it choked up the reception area and were smoking on the entrance steps to the hotel which did not create a good impression at all.   There were kids playing on the lift and getting out on upper floors and knocking on doors.  Reported to porter but nothing appeared to be done about it, not satisfactory at all.",3,2014,05,27
232,Great central location near O'Connell Street and Temple Bar area,"This hotel is centrally located near O'Connell Street and just across the river from the Temple Bar area. The staff were all very friendly and efficient. The room and en-suite bathroom were very spacious and there were great breakfast choices, including full Irish, to keep us going all day.",5,2014,05,24
232,Welcoming,We had pre- theatre dinner in Wynn's hotel during the week.  Of course location is so important here and to just hop off the Luas and in.  The dining room is fresh; airy and there is ample space between tables which is a welcome gift.  The menu was generous and the lady who served us was attentive.  The brown bread was mature; my fish starter was pleasant yet not warm enough.  The main course redeemed everything with a very tasty generous portion of lamb with limp vegetables.  The lamb was delicious.  On the whole good value for money yet the improvement with the small details would enhance the whole experience.,3,2014,05,24
232,"Very Good Hotel, Great Breakfast","Very nice, centrally located hotel, convenient for the Luas (tram system in Dublin). The excellent breakfast is cooked to order which appears to be a bit of a rarity in Ireland where most hotels prefer to use the buffet system. WiFi is good in the hotel and all staff were efficient and friendly. The value was very good, the only issue I had was that car parking is limited. As we checked in at 7pm we were directed to a a commercial car park that cost us €23 overnight 7pm to 3pm the next day.",4,2014,05,23
232,Weekend break,"Just returned from a weekend away in Dublin. Stayed at Wynn's hotel which was very good. Car was parked for us by valet. Checking in was easy. Room was excellent, bathroom great with plenty toiletries, loads of hot water and towels. Breakfast was excellent, staff really friendly and helpful.Will definately visit again.",5,2014,05,20
232,So many reasons to stay here,"Great location near O'Connel St and the river but on a road dedicated to trams so not much other traffic. Lovely old building tastefully brought up to date. We had a nice room with fabulous bathroom. Lots of hot water. We were booked in as part of a group so everyone wanted breakfast at the same time. Staff coped efficiently and the original dining room is converted to retain it,s charm whilst adding a modern open kitchen. All staff were friendly and helpful. We shall stay here whenever we comments to Dublin.",5,2014,05,19
232,Hotel with old world charm,"Wynn’s Hotel was the last accommodation on our 18 days’ tour in Ireland. When we walked in, our immediate impression was that we had done a very good choice. We were heartily welcomed, our double on 5th floor was furnished with bright shades of red and gave views of the Spire and over the roofs of Dublin. In the bathroom we found all modern conceniences, including shower with proper water pressure. The bed was large and soft enough.  Next morning a lady at the reception kindly booked us a last minute day tour to Wicklow hills and Glendalough. The service overall was very friendly and polite. We absolutely can recommend Wynn’ Hotel to everyone.",5,2014,05,12
232,Old Hotel Needs Updating,"My family and I stayed at Wynn's Hotel in March 2014.  The hotel location is good but the rooms are old, cramped, and the beds were horrible.  We had spent 10 days in Ireland at some really nice hotels with good experiences.  I still can't believe the amount we paid for Wynn's.  Beware - they charge you for breakfast even if you inform them that you have no intention of eating breakfast at the hotel.  The staff were very unaccommodating and just stood behind ""rules"" and ""we cannot make adjustments.""  There are many hotel options in Dublin, I encourage you to stay somewhere else than Wynn's.",1,2014,05,10
232,Exceptional staff,"For 3 days my cousin and I, two Australians of a certain age, enjoyed the comfort, friendliness and central location of Wynn's Hotel. We were delighted with all aspects of our stay. However, upon leaving we were overwhelmed by the efforts the staff made to help me find my watch which I had foolishly misplaced. Soon after we left it was found. Email and phone contacts followed and the watch posted to our next address. No fuss, just efficiency and kindness. Thank you. Wynns is the ideal place for a Dublin stay. Fantastic breakfasts too.",5,2014,05,09
232,Old fashioned - but none the worse for that!,"I've really enjoyed my stay at Wynn's. I'm a frequent business traveller, so regularly stay at most of the major chain hotels, so it's somewhat refreshing to get a more personal service at this grand old lady of Dublin (over 150 years old now).

The staff are a credit to the hotel. Everyone from the concierge (yes, it even has one of those!) to the reception and restaurant staff are friendly, warm and helpful - a really welcome change from the likes of the Maldron chain (in Ireland) and Premier Inn (in the UK).

My bedroom was warm and comfortable, and my bathroom (though a little on the small side) was well equipped with ample clean, white towels, complimentary toiletries and copious hot water.

WiFi was free throughout the hotel with no need for those annoying vouchers that other chains seem to feel necessary.

I didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening, but I did have breakfast which (aside from cereals) was table service. Again, a really refreshing change. If there was any criticism it was that the coffee wasn't that great, but I'm struggling to find fault here.

I would be very happy to stay at Wynn's again and would have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending it.",5,2014,05,08
232,Nice hotel and great staff,Hotel is very central. Staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel itself was clean with a charming old world feel. We didn't eat in the hotel although the food looked good and seemed good value also. Overall a very pleasant hotel for a short break in right in the heart of Dublin. ,4,2014,05,07
232,Wynn's Hotel Abu!,"My husband and I returned to Wynn's Hotel for a night's stay on Wednesday 16 April 2014, as we were going to the theatre to see 'Warhorse'.  As always, the front desk welcome was warm, efficient and extremely friendly, our room was clean and comfortable, and both dinner and breakfast eaten on the premises were exactly what we had hoped for.  There's a special  warmth about this old but incredibly well-kept hotel which can be accredited very much to a really super friendly, helpful and VERY caring staff.  And oh the convenience for getting around Dublin and accessing the Luas and other public transport!  We wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else while in Dublin. Many thanks to all concerned and we'll see you again next time we're in Dublin",5,2014,04,26
232,Family Short Break,"Well located, mid way between Temple Bar and Shopping districts.  Excellent service, welcoming and helpful.   Prices OK for Dublin.  Food and Drink very good (excellent pint of guiness). Independent Hotel with Character and Charm.   Some may find old fashioned, with updating in some areas needed.  Accommodation, although wouldn't describe as spacious was comfortable enough for 3 at time of year (April)   Trams run past door (minor noise from these in some rooms).  Overall would recommend this Hotel for couples or Families.  Friendly staff, very customer focussed.  We would definitely stay again.",4,2014,04,26
232,Great location. Brilliant service. Fantastic breakfast.,"Stayed 1 night at Wynn's Hotel, Dublin. I was a bit nervous about what to expect after booking if I'm honest. But my nervousness was soon allayed after almost immediate reply to my email query. Right outside a tram stop so no excuse not to see the delights the city has to offer; plus just off Dublin's main shopping streets so I expect those cards will be 'smoking' from frequent use if you like a bargain or two 😝
Above all, stay for the delectable breakfast!",4,2014,04,20
232,windows need sound proofing,"we stayed at wynns last week for 4 days.we have stayed there before at the rear of the hotel but this time we had a front facing room.If you want a quiet room you will need a rear room but these are smaller and tend to be darker as not much light from window.If you have a front facing room it is much noisier the windows are double glazed but the frames are not sealed it is still the old wooden sash frame so the sound from the outside still gets in ie lucas tram and people below outside,we could hear people outside we thought we had left a window open but no.wynns is a great hotel to stay they really look after you nothing is too much trouble they really should get a grant from the lucas operators to instal sealed double glazed frames at the front of the hotel.Like i said it is a great place to stay and we would go back if only for the characters they get in and the history of the hotel.",5,2014,04,19
232,How nice to be back at Wynn's.,"On my last trip to Dublin Wynn's was full, so I had to go elsewhere.  I was therefore even more pleased to be back in this excellent and old-fashioned (in the very best sense) hotel on this occasion.  Even though it was a year since my last visit I was greeted as an old friend, which reinforces my previous comments about the extraordinarily low turnover of staff at this hotel.  It remains a gem in the City Centre, incredibly conveniently placed for public transport.  Although my colleagues and I usually eat at Wynn's we had been invited out on this occasion.  My next visit is already booked!",5,2014,04,13
232,Perfect Stay,"Myself and my sister booked a twin room b and b for one night only. The location was perfect, just right in the city centre. the girl on reception checked us in within 2minutes. the room was small but it was sufficient, there was an iron and ironing board, blow dry, safe and coffee/tea facilities. The bathroom was basic but immaculately clean as was the beds. Well done to housekeeping, i could not fault a thing. Someone also had put on the fire( electric) in our bedroom so it was just cosy when we landed as it was a cold day.. 
it was room 416, no view but very peaceful. The breakfast was lovely and the staff there was so polite and friendly. 
Well done wynns, on what i saw the reception girls, the housekeeping and the dining room staff made our night in dublin such a happy one. Were planning our nxt trip to wynns now. thanks so much",5,2014,04,05
232,Insult to injury,"Went to Wynn's Hotel with my wife to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. Hotel was excellent and staff brillant and flawless. We dined in hotel restaurant where I had Sirloin steak garnished with mushrooms arrived hail and hearty Saturday afternoon left early on Sunday having been ill all night, ruined the weekend but the duty manager insisted would be hard to prove.......Thank you so much",3,2014,03,31
232,Short stay in Dublin for 50th Golden Anniversary,Lovely clean hotel - loads of character.  Superb Irish breakfast with plenty to choose from. Would definitely stay again and recommend.  The staff were also helpful and obliging.  Nice bar area to get a drink.,5,2014,03,31
232,Lovely old fashioned charm,"Just simply a great nights stay, very comfy room, staff brill and we will stay again next visit to Dublin. Hotel situated in amongst shops and ""entertainment"". We ate at the hotel food fab and very reasonably priced. Thoroughly recommend.",5,2014,03,23
232,Weekend in Dublin,"We stayed here for 1 night, check in was very quick and pleasant, we were given a map and what's on guide along with our key,
The room was very nice and warm, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was also very clean, small soaps, shower gel, shampoo, and also shower cap and sewing kit.  The towels were ample.
We did not dine in the restaurant, however, we did have breakfast, again this was very nice and plenty of it, help yourself to cereals, breads, yoghurts, fruits, croissants and juices, cooked breakfast was table service along with toast, tea/coffee.
We had a night cap in the bar and prices were reasonable compared to pubs in the area. 
This Hotel is conveniently placed, warm, friendly and clean, the only downside is reception area is small and does not have seating. I would recommend this Hotel and would definitely stay here again.  We hopped on the airbus which is outside the airport at a cost of €7 each, this took us to O'Connell Street, which is a stones throw from Wynns. We pre ordered a taxi for our return to the airport  which was €27 ... it was also convenient being ale to book and pay for this prior to our stay in Dublin.",5,2014,03,23
232,Great Value,Last minute work trip to Dublin booked Wynns @89 b&b great value. Hotel old world around corner Abbey Theatre and O Connell Street. Staff lovely and helpful excellent breakfast and dining area. Great buzz in bar area full people eating before show . Bedroom spotless bathroom all done up. Was worried initially as it was front of hotel looking onto Street with Luas from a noise perspective but absolutely not an issue slept like a log. Definitely for location price and staff will stay again. Also very good wifi coverage which is complimentary,5,2014,03,06
232,Very Neat Historical Building,"The hotel was very nice! The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the location was excellent. Our room was tiny, which is pretty typical, but it was very nice. Our AC didn't work and it was unusually hot, so that made sleeping a little miserable. We really liked it, but I think I'll try something else in the future. I remembered seeing this hotel around the corner from my Hostel on my first trip to Dublin, and I really wanted to stay there some day. I'm glad we did, but I didn't like it enough to not want to try other hotels.",4,2014,03,05
232,Excellent Hotel in the heart of Dublin City,"We recently returned from our eagerly anticipated biennial visit to Dublin ahead of the 6 Nations Rugby Ireland v Wales clash, staying as usual at Wynn`s Hotel in Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1.

As a group [40 adults] we were all hugely impressed with all aspects of our stay – from check in on the Thursday until check out on the following Sunday.

It is now 40 years that we have used Wynn`s Hotel – excellent location in the city centre – and look forward to visiting Anne Marie and staff for many years to come. Highly recommended!!
                  David & Carys McCarter",5,2014,03,03
232,Brill hotel to stay in,Took my partner here for weekend for his birthday lovely hotel staff very friendly and helpful and had dinner in restaurant on Saturday night food was great loved every minute close to town for shopping really enjoyed our stay can't wait to go back again ,5,2014,03,03
232,Old Style hotel in the city centre,"This is a lovely old fashioned hotel, superb breakfast and nice bar area. You get the feeling that the more mature person stays here and enjoys the excellent customer service.

The room was a bit noisy with the air conditioning  but the receptionist made a note for housekeeping to look at that.

Also, the parking is a little off putting. You can't always get parking in the hotel as its quite limited and if you pull into the parking area opposite the hotel waiting for the lovely porter to park it for you the bus can come along and move you on from your space. Would i recommend this hotel, absolutely, next time we will take the train or bus up and not have the bother of the car with us. A lovely Irish hotel, i would imagine tourists from abroad will have a lovely experience here.",4,2014,03,01
232,"Very relaxed, easy going.","Just called in for a drink in the main bar. Really friendly, good decor and very relaxing. I'm Irish and from the country, it has great appeal for country people. If you're in town and all the bars are full of young ones this is the place to go! ",4,2014,02,23
232,Brilliant place to stay in right in the city centre.,Stayed for valentines night. Food in the restaurant was absolutely beautiful. Service in the restaurant was brilliant and the room was gorgeous. Its right in the city centre so its near all the shopping centres and abt 10/15 min walk from temple bar and grafton street.,5,2014,02,17
232,First Class Service,"We stayed in Wynn's over Valentine's day weekend.  It was our third return visit and won't be the last because I just can't think of a better place to stay in the City Centre, particularly if you are visiting the Abbey Theatre as we tend to be.  I've stayed in ritzier places in Dublin - the Shelbourne, the Four Seasons etc and any time I've stayed anywhere else I just think I'd rather have gone to Wynn's.  It isn't the place to be if you set any store on modern style or trendiness - in fact I'd describe it like going to visit your grandparents house but it is clean, warm, wholesome and the customer service is excellent.  It is thoroughly recommended and excellent value for money.",5,2014,02,16
232,Valentines weekend,"I had often passed by the hotel walking around Dublin city and was always interested to see what it was like to stay in. 

Myself and my Girlfriend got a very good deal for Valentines night which included chocolate and champagne upon arrival with both dinner that evening and breakfast the next morning included also. The lady at reception genuinely could not have been more helpful and pleasant to speak to while also telling me everything I needed to know from the lift to dinner and breakfast times. The room was very spacious and clean, a very nice touch was the rose petals which had been placed on our bed ( which I later took credit for :) ) 

The shower had lovely hot water and jacuzzi jets in the bath which were a very nice and unexpected bonus! We had dinner that evening included in the deal and the food was of a very high standard, my main course was a chicken supreme in a wild mushroom sauce, there was leek included in the description and I asked for it to be left out of the meal expecting to be told that it wouldn't be possible but the chef was very accommodating and left the leek out for me which I really appreciated. We woke up the next morning to a lovely hot shower once again, we went down for breakfast which was made to order, the food was very nicely cooked without being drenched in cooking oil. The service staff were very helpful and friendly. 

We checked out at 12 o clock. I walked away from having stayed in the hotel thinking to myself based on the service ' how is it a 3 star hotel and not higher' to anyone unsure about where to stay I would definitely recommend staying in Wynn's.",5,2014,02,15
232,Great little hotel in centre of Dublin,Great comfortable rooms. Cosy. Good breakfast. Very central. Tram outside front door. Five minute walk to Henry Street shopping area.  Most efficient receptionist we have ever come across!! Can't recall her name but she was from Europe??,4,2014,01,21
232,Centrally Located,"Centrally located hotel in Dublin.

Cars are parked by the staff after unloading which is a big headache removed.

Old world feel hotel, lots of character. 

Breakfast was good and cooked to order.

Only down side was over zealous night porter who would not let me out to ""get some fresh air"" and wanted me to stay behind the railings that they have on the door at night.",4,2014,01,11
232,Dublin,"An old world feel. Mahogany and wood panelling. I booked in advance. Reception was friendly and efficient. Great location near enough to centre but far enough to be quiet. Room very well appointed, although initially struggled with the non-working curtains until I saw the sign about using the blind.",5,2014,01,03
232,"Nice Hotel, Good Location, Room wasn't great","Stayed in this hotel for one night for New Years Eve, the hotel itself is nice. All staff from the receptionist, bar staff, porter and dining room staff were pleasant and more then helpful. The room I received wasn't great, The room had absolutely no view through the window, i was less then 1 meter away from a brick wall, this meant there was no daylight during the day, it may aswell have been an internal room. The room itself was quite small, although adequate for one night.The fixtures and fitting were dated, but everything was clean, the toilet roll holder was broken and the cold tap was loose on the whb. The shower was fine, but I would have liked the water temperature to be hotter then it was. The breakfast was nice, with a full list of breakfast menu options available. Checkout was slow, as everyone was checking out at the same time, and there was only one person on at reception. Overllall the hotel was nice but for me the room wasn't up to standrad due to having no daylight or no view, I should have been informed of this on booking, and the room should have been cheaper in my opinion.",3,2014,01,02
232,One Night Stand,"Stayed at Wynns Hotel in Dublin on an overnight stay for my 65th birthday 28/12 and to see a show.(Wicked). My wife and I arrived at the hotel a little before check in, it is just about 6 mins. walk from Connelly St. train station, we were greeted by a very pleasant and smiling receptionist who explained that our room was not ready but if we gave them an hour it would be sorted. She took our bag and placed it behind the reception area so as we could walk around the shops or have coffee in the hotel. On returning I asked if we could have a room at the front of the hotel, this was not a problem and we were wished an enjoyable stay. The room was off a good size with a good size bath/shower room, was warm, which was good on a pretty cold day, very clean and had all that was required for our stay. Then hotel overall was very clean and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. Prices for food and drinks were compatible with outside bars and restaurants.The city shopping areas were within two mins. walk away. I would recommend this hotel to anyone for a short stay in Dublin.  (Local transport stops right outside the hotel)",5,2013,12,31
232,Practicality wins,"We picked the Wynn's for its historic features and prime connections to the airport (via Airlink bus, stop around the corner) and Heuston station (via the Luas tramline stopping right in front of the hotel). We also wanted to take advantage of its proximity to all the shops in the O'Connell Street corridor. From all these points of view, we were satisfied with our choice.

Based on other Tripadvisor reviews, we requested a bright room on a higher floor so as to not be bothered by the noise from the street and party revelers and avoid looking at a wall. The hotel accommodated our request, and we were happy with our room. It was quiet, clean and spacious, had warm colors, and featured a cute electric fireplace and a nicely appointed bathroom. But we had to wait for the room at check-in, as it was not yet ready, even when we came back from shopping at the time we were told the room would be ready. Elevator service was very slow.

Breakfast was commendable; we arrived early in the gorgeous dining room and almost had it to ourselves. Our table was near the large windows facing Lower Abbey Street, table service prompt, and food quality good.",4,2013,12,30
232,"has a lot of history, clean but rather basic","this hotel fell below my expectation considering its star rating.
it was clean and most things that were available for the most part.

its has a quaint charm about it. rooms were clean and staff were polite.

It is bang in the middle of everything which makes its location ideal, 
but i found it rather outdated in in keeping with times.
nothing special in fact somewhat disappointing unless you care a great deal the history of the building.",3,2013,12,25
232,"Great hotel, location & breakfast","I have stayed in Wynn's multiple times and it never disappoints. It is good value for money; the location is excellent; staff are very professional and friendly; the breakfast is 1st class. 
I informed the hotel that I would arrive early and they ensured that the room was ready. They even had the fire(electric) on in my room for my arrival. 
I fully recommend Wynn's Hotel.",5,2013,12,24
232,A gem for Solo Travellers,"This hotel is brilliant for all travellers but for Solo's it ticks all the boxes , with special prices for singles. This included a full Irish waitress served breakfast in the lovely historic dining room, a delightful quiet clean well appointed single/double room, and helpful smiley staff. I was within walking distance of all the main sights and also close to tour buses, public transport,pedestrian shoping areas and the Abbey Theatre. Perfect.
      ",4,2013,12,23
232,Old Fashioned and past it's sell by date,"We stayed here overnight on business, so costs are not something I am aware of.

An old Dublin hotel just off O'Connel Street, with an imposing frontage, with a LUAS stop right outside.

Despite the wide front the hotel lobby was surprisingly small and the receptionists area was tucked away in a corner. The key card system prevalent in most hotels these days has not found it's way to Wynn's and an old fashioned key on a big brass key ring was handed over, charming in it's way but a bit time consuming having to ask for the kety every time.

We were on the fifth floor and this was reached either by stair or by the single lift, the lift is possibly the slowest I have ever come across and quite small, it's actually quicker to walk.

We had a double room which was more than acceptable, clean spacious, a well made bed and good sized bathroom, wif-fi was free.

After a late night with colleagues we had breakfast in the late morning. The buffet system of breakfast  again prevalent in most modern hotels has not made it's way here. We had to wait some time to be seated and our order take. The staff seemed under immense pressure and unable too keep up and we were told by the floor manager that there was only one cook on. We ordered the full Irish and the menus and order were taken before we were able to say how we wanted our eggs done, coffee arrived without teaspoons or milk which we had to ask for twice as the first request had been met by a surly silence, toast arrived without butter.

The breakfast when it eventually arrived nearly 30 minutes after we first showed up was adequate, nothing particularly special but not bad either.

With a bit of modernisation this could be a really great hotel it has the potential, but at the moment it's an innefficient relic of a bygone age.",3,2013,12,09
232,Wynn's Hotel - Great option when staying in Dublin,"After staying at the Wynn's Hotel when in Dublin two years ago, I did not hesitate to re-book again for 7 nights during my recent trip to Ireland. 

I am delighted to now offer feedback that similar to my previous stay at the Wynn's Hotel, my overall experience proved to be pleasant and satisfied all my guest needs.

I find the Wynn's Hotel rooms are a good size.  The room rates are are good value and not 'over the top' for an inner city hotel.  The daily room rate also includes a varied selection from their 'Irish breakfast' menu.

The reception, breakfast and bar staff are professional, friendly and always provide excellent customer service. 

The hotel location is ideal for either walking or catching public transport to see Dublin's many attractions.

I have no hesitation in recommending the Wynn's Hotel.",5,2013,11,26
232,Group visit to Wynn's Hotel Dublin,"I have just taken 54 of my theatre club to Dublin for the Dublin Theatre festival (highly recommended). We stayed at Wynn's Hotel. It was an excellent choice for all, with my three disabled people being catered for very well. The food, service, facilities (only slight problem is the small lift - only one), and particularly the central location. I can recommend it highly.",4,2013,11,08
232,'The Heart of Dublin'!,"My husband and I stayed overnight in Wynn's Hotel, Dublin, on Sunday 27 and again on Thursday 31 October and had the most enjoyable of hotel experiences.  From the moment one enters the hotel, you're made to feel extremely welcome.  The staff are incredibly efficient, friendly and happy to go that extra mile to make guests feel comfortable.  The rooms are spotless, tastefully furnished and well equipped, and the food in both restaurants was really first class - not to mention the excellent service in both bar and restaurant.  The absolute convenience of staying right in the centre of Dublin in an affordable hotel of such high standard, is certainly a bonus not to be missed.  Sincere thanks to management and staff of a very special hotel that we're proud to call Irish.",5,2013,11,06
232,Great hotel,"I always stays at Wynn's Hotel, when I visit Dublin. I have always found it to be very good value for money. Very helpful staff, nice clean rooms. The breakfast is great. I have never found noise to be a problem and I always ask for a room facing the street. 
",5,2013,11,04
232,This hotel has a wonderful staff!,We were in Ireland for a wedding and we stayed 4 total nights at the Wynn. The staff is remarkable at this hotel. Every request was met with a cheerful response. They made you feel like they were very glad you were staying with them. I can't say enough good things about the employees.,5,2013,10,29
232,Good value for money,"I stayed for two nights in twin room with adult daughter.  The room was clean & the beds comfortable.  Breakfast was included in the price & I couldn't fault the service.   Lots of power points in room which is always a bonus for travelers & free wifi.  The airport shuttle bus stops 5 mins away on O'connell street and we had no problem moving our bags from stop to hotel.  Airport transfer bus is only €7 per person so much cheaper than taxi.  Another bonus was I booked on line & paid when I checked out & they didnt take extra off my card in advance like some hotels do (& then you have to wait days to get it back).  I cannot comment on other meals as we only had the breakfasts.   We had a room at the front & stayed on a Thursday & Friday night & with the double glazing I didnt think the street noise was too bad.  I would definitely stay there again.
",4,2013,10,26
232,A wonderful place to stay in Dublin City,"From its website  Wynn's looked to be a lovely place to stay - and it lived up to that promise in every way.
Our room was clean, comfortable and near to the lifts (always a bonus).
The staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful.
Always willing to help with enquiries and local information.
I used the bar for a coffee and scone - priced as expected for Dublin - no rip-off there.
The breakfast was just superb - the choice was from simple cereal to full Irish - with lots of additional ""stops"" along the way - pastries/toast/breads all with accompanying preserves.
Breakfast was included in the price and that is appreciated- no long list of ""extras"" on the bill.
I can heartily recommend Wynn's to any mature couple - US/UK based or wherever.
My wife is American and I am British so we truly looked at it from an international angle - and both of us were delighted with what we found there.
Wynn's transformed our stay in the beautiful and fascinating city of Dublin into a truly magical experience and we can't thank them enough for that - try it and you'll see what I mean...",5,2013,10,25
232,Perfect location for American tourists,Wynn's was the perfect venue for our family trip from the states to Dublin. All the major sites are an easy walk. The staff was so friendly and polished. The included full Irish breakfast was tasty and beautifully prepared. We will definitely book this hotel again.,5,2013,10,24
232,Ticks all the boxes,"Stayed for one night in October, firstly I will say that the service was fantastic. Fast and efficient staff throughout my stay which made me feel very welcome.

The room was an adequate size with comfy bed, clean bathroom and a nice hot powerful shower. 

The location is excellent if you wanting a city break in Dublin, easy to find coming from the airport by coach. Also you only walking distance from all the main attractions in the city.

The breakfast was one of the highlights, a wide range of choice and table served by experienced staff. A very enjoyable morning.

For 70 euros a night this place is a steal which offers quality and an old school charm.",5,2013,10,23
232,"Welcoming, clean, comfortable and friendly",Very clean and comfortable. Not a big room but more than adequate unless you are extremely tall or wide of girth as the bed was small and the shower opening quite narrow. (I'm a little under 6 foot and average build and it was fine for me but I wouldn't want to have been much larger). Good location. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Had a great stay. - Asked for a quiet room and it was. Breakfast was great. Service great. Would stay again without hesitation..,5,2013,10,20
232,Disappointment at Wynns,"I have been going to Wynns for many years and I felt I had to write this reviews, as it has become so disappointing these days that I don't even like to go in for a coffee.  

Over two or three visits, I had lunch and other times coffee. There is no effort at the Carvery whatsoever and the food has gone right down in standard  .Christmas week before last, I got processed turkey for Roast Turkey, which I brought home for the cat.  The vegetlotables are usually a mish mesh of lots of stuff, including stir fried veggies, as if all the leftovers were slung in to use them up ... yuckkkk ... then they appear to be covered in butter, or oil ... not good.  

I waited almost half an hour one day for a white coffee ... when there was hardly anyone in the bar, yet the staff did seem to be busy .. so, is it a question of not enough staff?  I don't know.  
If you order a dessert at the carvery, with tea or coffee, the waitress doesn't bring it down to your table ... which is not a nice touch, for a hotel of Wynn's reputation.  

Overall ... I have been experiencing this for some years now ... as it has always been a good place to rest and refresh.  But each time I go in now, I decide no, I shall have to find somewhere else ... and in Dublin, honestly, there are not many as nice as what Wynns used to be.  

I can only summarise and say that the standards all round at Wynns are down.  As to why, I don't know and perhaps, and indeed, probably, they still do a roaring trade.  However, I think its a shame that it has gone down so badly.",3,2013,10,18
232,Location is the only good thing about this place,"We stayed 1 night at Wynn's on October 14th.  The room was very small compared to our other rooms around Ireland and faced the Luas which we heard run the entire time.  The bed was very uncomfortable, the pillow almost non-existent, and the shower was terrible.  The only plus side of the hotel is it is located in the central part of the city.",1,2013,10,17
232,Red and gold,"I very recently stayed here with a friend. We have tried out other Dublin hotels in the same price range, and found Wynns to be superior in every respect. The place was in good repair with smart furniture, new wallpaper, good service, a fine breakfast in a lovely dining room, and a bedroom with excellent space for what we had paid. It was decorated in red and gold (my favourite colours, in fact the ones I have at home), and there was a comfortable en suite bathroom with a Jacuzzi in the bath. Downstairs, there is a bar with buzz which the locals were clearly enjoying. It is very well located for all the main sights of Dublin city centre. We recommend it strongly. Staff were very helpful. We'll be back soon.",5,2013,10,09
232,"Central hotel, but service??","Very central hotel just off O'Connel street. Somewhat old and tired interior, but quiet being in the busiest part of Dublin and good breakfast. But when having got a room, I discovered that the bed was to short. I went to reception and ask to get a new room with a longer bed. At the reception I was told that all beds were the same. I knew that was wrong having seen pictures of the rooms on internet. After a night with very bad sleep, one of my collegues told me that her room had a longer bed, so we arranged a roomswitch ourselfes. Doesn't staff know the hotelrooms, or didn't they bother to help me?",3,2013,10,08
232,Fantastic Dublin City Hotel,"My husband & I have just returned from a fabulous 4 night stay at Wynns hotel.  Wynns is a traditional small 65 room  hotel situated in the heart of Dublin city centre just off O 'Connell street.  This is our second stay at Wynns hotel due to its fab location and great customer service. The staff are really helpful , friendly and will endeavour to help you as much as they can. For instance on our arrival day we were way ahead of the 2pm check in due to an early flight and we were expecting an offer to secure our bags only . However we were immediately offered complimentary tea and coffee whilst they checked to see if our room was ready, this resulted in a check in much earlier than planned which was excellent enabling us to freshen up before our first day of sightseeing. our room was fabulous we were on the top floor facing the city centre, rooms have a traditional decor,  spacious and we had a jacuzzi bath also. There is free Wifi available in the rooms which is a bonus not just the lobby area as is offered in other hotels. The dining room is a grand room with an Art Deco feel to it, waiter service provides a sense of luxury and we enjoyed the relaxing peaceful vibe, no clashing of plates or scrum tackle to get your breakfast of a morning and the choice is plentiful and the food is lovely. If your room is at the front of the building and your windows are open you will here the noise of central city hustle and bustle which is no different to any other city noise such as London or New York. Our room was the last one on the top floor attached to the Grand Central Bar building, they play music until the early hours which can affect your sleep if the windows are open none of which bothered either of us personally. Transport links are fabulous, tram stop just outside and bus stop is on the corner, here you can get the Dublin hop on & off tour bus which is ideal for access to all the main tourist attractions. Basically if you want a traditional hotel with a great city centre location and friendly service this is the place for you, we certainly will be revisiting.",5,2013,10,06
232,Issues,"Good staff,& breakfast,housekeeping,central city location.BUT-bathroom tiny, & we had a room facing downtown street with TERRIBLE noise level-bells ringing,engines idling,music playing,people shouting in street,cars running,streetcar noise. This went on loudly all night-worst was VERY loud sound of apparently an industrial strength pressure washer cleanind the rails -AT 2 AM !!!",2,2013,10,05
232,AN EXCELLENT DUBLIN HOTEL.,"I stayed at Wynns a couple of weeks ago for the fourth time and really love this place. Have tried a few others in Dublin but this is by far the best. the location is perfect for exploring Dublin. The staff are always polite,friendly and helpful and the rooms very clean and comfortable. I always get a good nights sleep in a quiet room facing the back of the Hotel, and the beds and pillows are really comfortable.  
Breakfast is served by waiters in the beautiful Victorian dining room. There is a selection of hot breakfasts all cooked fresh and piping hot.as well as juices, cereals and toast.
well done to Wynns for providing an excellent and consistent good old fashioned level of service.
Have already booked my room for December for a spot of Christmas shopping in Dublin.
 
.",5,2013,10,01
232,Wynns a winner........almost,"Wynn's website is good and that is what drew us to the hotel but the pub next door was constantly noisy, loud music nightly. They even have speakers attached to the outside of the building.
Breakfast was great, staff was great. But here is the big downside....only one elevator and no mention on the website. We were booked in for 12 days but left after 7. At nearly 70 I am too old to climb the stairs and we had too..frequently... when bus loads of tourists would check-in {in a very tiny lobby}. Would we stay there again.....NO.",3,2013,10,01
232,Everything a Hotel should be,"Often passed by Wynns never had even been inside the door stayed there for 1 night this week how i wished i could have stayed for much longer ,every thing about this Hotel is perfect Rooms ,Staff and most of all the Breakfast .great location Luas (Tram) stops at the door",5,2013,09,27
232,Traditional Irish charm,"Whenever the  family return to Dublin we always try to stay here...

The staff are always attentive and the breakfasts are the best in Dublin.
The restaurant is amazing and the steaks to die for :)

The hotel is wonderfully situated with 'The Lucas' tram within very easy reach outside giving easy access to 'The O2' for concerts among many other attractions . Everything is within easy walking distance of the hotel.including 'Connolly station' where you can travel to pretty much all over Ireland.",5,2013,09,25
232,a little gem in the city,"went to the city for a show. the pre show menu was lovely. everyone was very friendly. the room was small but it had everything I needed. breakfast was a treat and the service was silver, the breakfast room was very charming. The bar service was also excellent. The hotel's location is ideal,especially with the luas outside the door.",4,2013,09,25
232,"Great hotel, center of town!","We drove to the hotel and were concerned about parking- we didn't need to be!  They valet parked our car for free!  The hotel already had a baby cot set up for us in our room, and the room was spacious and comfortable.  Breakfast was also very nice in their charming historic dining room.  The best part of all was the location- central Dublin!  We were on the top (5th) floor, and noise was not a problem at all for us.  I was very happy with the hotel and would gladly stay there again.",5,2013,09,23
232,"Old-fashioned charm, in a superb location","Wynn's will never suit everyone, but I always stay there when possible during my business trips to Dublin.  Its location is excellent, close to the Aercoach stop in O'Connell Street, within walking distance of Connolly station and with the LUAS stop right outside.  The turnover of staff is extremely low for the hotel world, and they are universally helpful.  The bar is always lively and one can either eat there or have a very reasonable meal (for Central Dublin) in the restaurant.  The lift is slow (but immaculately polished), so is the service of cooked breakfast, but those are small sacrifices for everything else that the hotel offers.  I'm just sorry that Wynn's was fully booked when I had to plan next week's trip to Dublin.",5,2013,09,16
232,Quite a Place,"Booked this after having read some reviews on Trip Advisor, all of which were very positive.  I concur.  If you want a cookie-cutter, McDonald's (Holiday Inn?)  style hotel experience, don't stay here.  However, if you want a quaint, authentically Dublin stay, choose Wynn's.  It is like a place out of time, showing its age and filled with an assortment of odd and memorable characters, both staff and guests.  Historic as Dublin itself (established 1845).  Great location in the center of town (just north of the River Liffy off O'Connell Street), a five minute walk from the AirLink shuttle to and from the airport.  Good value too, and a really nice breakfast with a cross between self-service (cold things) and table service (hot breakfast).  Sure, the elevator is slow and the carpets are thin, but when we needed a bulb changed in the room, it was done cheerfully and before we could even turn around.  Maybe the best endorsement - it was completely sold out the three days we were there.",4,2013,09,12
232,Nice Stay At Wynn's,"We stayed at the Wynn's the first 2 nights of our recent trip to Ireland.  The location really couldn't be better.  The AirCoach from Dublin airport drops you right on O'Connel St. a block or 2 away from the hotel.  Our room wasn't quite ready when we arrived there at 1PM, but the front desk attendant was helpful and held onto our bags while we walked around the town for a while.  

The hotel is very convenient to O'Connel St, Green HOHO bus, Temple Bar, Trinity College, and all of city center really.  I didn't know that breakfast was included with our room, so that was a nice surprise.  It was one of the best breakfasts that I had the whole trip, and the eggs benedict were great.

The hotel is a little bit dated, but charming.  The room was on the small side, but there were window benches which provided room to lay out our bags.  The bed was comfortable, but like others have said it can be a bit noisy if you are on the front side of the hotel.  It wasn't a big issue for us though.  Overall, I would definitely recommend the Wynn's Hotel.",4,2013,09,12
232,Very nice hotel,"Very olde worlde charme Hotel right in the centre of Dublin.  

Excellent service and staff are so helpful.We had a room on the 5th floor at the front of the Hotel.  It's on a busy road and very noisy ALL the time, as in 24 hours, garbage trucks, street cleaners and the tram which is right outside the front door. The noises didn't bother me, but if you were a light sleeper they might.

Breakfast was excellent. We never ate there for any other meals so cannot comment on those.

The tram line is right in front of the Hotel, so there is no drop off access in front of the Hotel,  you have to cross the road, which is no problem.

I loved the Hotel, it has an old world charm which I liked.  I am in my 50's and I think I was the youngest person at the front bar when we went down for a drink lol",4,2013,09,06
232,Old hotel but nice,"The rooms are small no air con
But It's a nice hotel right in the heart of town. The breakfast is good and there is a good pub across the road.
The lifts are slow, we were at the back of the hotel so noise was not a problem. But you are next to the tram System so I don't know what the other rooms are like.",3,2013,09,02
232,Excellent location. Great breakfast. Small rooms though,"Wynn's location can't be more strategic. It is very close to the Abbey Theatre, 10 mins walk from Trinity College and Temple Bar. Breakfast selection is good too. 

The room I've got was the smallest on Level 5. The space between the bed and the bathroom door is only about the width of my luggage (about 1 to 2 ft I think). So was the space between the bed and the table.

But the location and the breakfast kind of make up for it.",4,2013,09,02
232,"Great location, very friendly staff","Wynn's Hotel August 21-26, 2013.  Great location, very friendly staff. Room was clean but rather small and the shower compartment door is not for fat people. Great breakfast. There was a problem with the water and it was shut off 24 hours, but the staff took care of everything in a nice way. I would stay there again.",4,2013,08,30
232,Great location,"This is not a luxury hotel, but is clean & comfortable and in a wonderful location -- you can walk to almost everything you would want to see.  The Luas stops in front of the door and the airport bus stops are very nearby.  I requested a quiet room & was given one away from the street (other reviewers have said that the rooms at the front of the hotel are nicer, but mine was perfectly acceptable).  There was a little street noise on the weekend, but I think that is inevitable in central Dublin.  The included breakfast was excellent.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  All in all I felt this was a great value for the money.",5,2013,08,29
232,As central as you can get.,"Great location in Dublin, within walking distance of pretty much everything you need to see. Only a 5 minute walk to Temple bar. The Arlington on Bachelors walk (just around the corner from Wynn's) is a fantastic place to go for Live Irish music and dancing. Wynn's itself is a wonderful hotel full of old school charm and tradition (I think the hotel is around 150 years old) the staff are very pleasant and their full Irish breakfast really starts the day off well. As well as the hotel being very central, the Luas (Tram) stops right outside the hotel making the hotel even easier to get too.",5,2013,08,28
232,Good location but noisey,"We stayed one night at Wynns during August.

The hotel is centrally located & so its quite easy to walk to most of the areas that would be of interest to tourists - Temple Bar and Trinity College are a few minutes away, the Guiness Store house about 15 to 20 minute walk. We found the reception staf to be very helpful and friendly. We had booked a superior room, which we found to be very comfortable with plenty of room. The breakfasts had a good choice & set us up for the day.
The only disadvanatge was the noise from the street below. All superior rooms are front facing & although we were on the top floor we were disturbed by nosie from the street - trams, dust carts, people celebrating. We would say there agin but would make sure that we had a room at the back of the hotel",3,2013,08,28
232,Really enjoyable,"Great location for luas/city tram and city centre in general. We had a quadruple room for myself and 2 young girls - loads of space, very clean, nice comfy beds and bathroom was small but well equipped. Breakfast was waiter service and food was really good. It was quiet on the night we stayed there although it can be noisy when they have functions (check when booking). Good value, really friendly reception staff and good size bedroom. We were very happy and would definitely return for a city break (when no car required).",4,2013,08,26
232,Great:),"Stayed here a couple of times. Beautiful hotel, lovely friendly staff. Absolutely lovely breakfast with cereals, croissants and fruit to start with and then you can order full Irish breakfasts, Eggs Benedict (delicious), etc. The rooms are very nice, clean and cosy. Also very useful that they hold onto your luggage until you are ready to leave the city. Fantastic location.

Would definitely recommend to anyone.",5,2013,08,25
232,Fantastic location,"Fantastic location, right in the middle of everything.  Beautiful old world hotel. Standard room more than adequate.  Only draw back, no air conditioning and tends to be stuffy. Could only open windows slightly, and noise from outside would disturb a light sleeper. Staff is outstanding, could not be friendlier or more accommodating. The restaurant & bar snacks were excellent and good value for money. If we ever return to Dublin would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,08,24
232,"Excellent location, a bit pricy","This hotel is very well located, just around the corner from O'Connell Street and ten minutes' walk from Temple Bar. It has a tram stop just in front and you can get the bus to and from the airport just on the opposite side of O'Connell street.

The hotel has an old-style feeling: it looks as if it hasn't been renovated for a while. It's clean and comfortable, but doesn't look up-to-date. The room was just big enough and so was the bed.

Breakfast was good, but not excellent, not as generous as a full Irish breakfast is supposed to be. 

The worst part of our stay in the hotel happened when we got back from Temple Bar at night: the door was closed and there was a strange looking receptionist there, with a stained shirt, smoking and talking with some friends. He looked at us as if we were trespassers and asked too many questions too inquisitorialy. I don't know if he was drunk or if he was just weird, but he made us feel quite uncomfortable and insecure.

All in all I found that this hotel was too pricy: it is probably living from its previous fame, but I don't think it's up to current standards.",3,2013,08,21
232,A wonderful hotel!,"We stayed here in Mid-August with a family of four in the Quad room. The room wasn’t large but it did sleep all of us just fine. We had one queen and two twin beds. Having an air conditioner was nice as was the heated towel rack. The key was a regular brass type (remember those?).

The hotel is well located for both the Airlink 747 airport bus and the Ireland rail service along the coast. It's about 4 blocks to either. The Luus Red line tram in front of the hotel is a commuter line that runs out to the suburbs. Taxis are everywhere as is just about any kind of food you want.

Some other tips:

1. Ask for a room off the street if you want quietness. The windows thin and there is a pub right across the street. Groups of young guys just love to sing at the top of their lungs after a few Guinness’. Fun to watch but, I wouldn’t want to try and sleep through it. 

2. The room had a great rain type shower. Plenty of hot water. The hair dryer is pretty weak though.

3. The bar serves up draught Guinness (and has a nice looking buffet). Skip all other beers. You won't get Guinness like this again until you come back! 

4. There’s an ATM just outside the hotel. It took a USA magnetic swipe type, (non-chip and pin) credit card just fine. A+ for my credit card for not having a cash fee for Europe.

5. Walking time from the hotel to Grafton Street is about 10 mins at best.

6. The hop-on-hop-off green bus leaves from the corner. 

7. If you’re leaving early, tell the front desk and they’ll open the kitchen up early for you. 

8. Tell the porter when you want a taxi. He had one waiting for us when we came downstairs at 6AM. Taxi time to the airport is about 15 mins on a Sunday morning. 

Great service from everyone!",5,2013,08,20
232,Very Central,"i stayed in Wynns for 1 night midweek - price was reasonable enough, the room i stayed in was quite small (but maybe because i asked for smoking room).  The receptionist was quite welcoming, bar staff were very friendly.    Breakfast was good and served very fast and staff again very friendly, location is excellent right in the centre of town.",3,2013,08,16
232,Nice midweek dublin break,"We knew what to expect and were not disappointed.we went for a quiet midweek break and got it
THE hotel is old and has a history which we liked.Free parking was a bonus and only 40yds from 
O Connell street .The breakfasts were delightfull and freshly cooked .The restaurant is old fashioned but quite elegant and the lounge bar is also similar,and our evening meal was as good as you will get .
Rory the barman and Roberta the receptionist(and the other recptionist also) were friendly and helpfull on advice as was head porter superman.The menu and quality and quantity of food  was a good 9 outta 10,the hotel was fully booked which also is a good sign.Overall 2 nights B & B and one evening meal was euro 250 total for 2 persons,free parkin ,not at all bad for central dublin.Indeed we priced a 5 star very near grafton street as 520 euro (jus reverse first two digits easy) must mention the LUAS line runs immediately outside the front door and is great for a run thru the city.  so overall Good value and yes we will return.",4,2013,08,16
232,getting better,Arrived at wynns with what turned out to be kidney stones at there painfully worst.didn't want to to be anywhere but home in bed.instead of the worst  couple of days ahead of me I had a real Irish welcome .the comfortable bar sold the perfect  guinness just the tonic with a mix of  tourists also enjoying the surrounding .the bedroom was like home with the extra of a hydro bath to ease away my blues.the breakfast was better than I had enjoyed anywhere for years even my early departure back to John Lennon airport the next morning  the night porter made a proper continental breakfast at 4 30am.if you want to be in right spot in dublin  this has got be an affordable and pleasant  hotel to settle down in .bill hislop ellesmere port.,5,2013,08,12
232,Very reasonable rates in central location,"I wanted to be near Trinity College. Wynn's is just north of the river and close to the big department stores and airport shuttle.  Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was very good, especially the Egg Benedictine!:) There was a heatwave on and most rooms did not have air conditioning.  But they made up for it with a table fan after I raised the issue with reception.",4,2013,08,10
232,Dublin Trip,"A great hotel as long as you get a room at the back of the hotel, not one facing Lower Abbey Street.  The night time and early morning (5.00am) street noise will wake you.
We stayed early August 2013 when the weather was pleasantly warm.  There is no air conditioning so the room temperature was high and uncomfortable for sleeping.
On the positive side, the staff were great, the food excellent, the history of the building amazing.  A very traditional Irish hotel with downsides.",3,2013,08,08
232,Great starting point for our tour,"We stayed at Wynn's recently for the start and end of our backroads tour of Ireland, about 25 minutes from the Dublin airport.  It is convenient and friendly.  We enjoyed sitting in the bar, talking to the locals and having a Guiness.  Wynn's is right across the river from the Trinity College neighborhood with lots of good bars and restaurants.  We went from there to the  GO WEST and GO NORTH tours with Inroads Ireland - really enjoyed it!  Very small group in a nimble van with an excellent guide - we hit the back roads, mountain passes, secluded beaches and interesting sights others never visit.  We stayed in small, unique hotels and enjoyed the pubs and local music.  Our guide, Phil, was chock-full of information and went out of his way to be kind and helpful.  Go with Inroads - you will love it!",4,2013,07,30
232,Second time around and still as good as ever!,"Well we went back again this summer and I'm happy to say Wynn's Hotel is as good as ever!  Unfortunately it was just for a week this time :-(

The majority of the staff were the same and many of them remembered us from last year.  Even the little things like where we'd been and the things we had done.

I'm not going to repeat the description of the rooms, service etc from last year.. because really it was all excellent as usually and you could not fault them for anything.  What I am going to highlight though is the staff.  Without exception every single member of staff we encountered during the week from the chamber maid to management were very friendly and attentive.

You are really made to feel at home in Wynns and I think it rubs of on the guests, sitting in the Saints and Scholars bar of an evening it was very easy to fall in to conversation with other guests and bar patrons on all kinds of topics from travel, to politics and football.

We'll definitely plan to be back for more next year.",5,2013,07,23
232,city trip hotel great location,"small 65 bedroom hotel in city centre .
Ideal location for The O2 for concerts as Luas transport  stops just outside the door .So we were able to get red line from Heuston train station to the door of hotel.
O Connell street and  main shopping area just around the corner. So handy if you wanted to go sight seeing eg. hop on hop off bus etc
Rooms comfortable - decor of times past with modern facilities- there was a fridge in our room and tea making facilities.Free newspaper delivered in evening.
wi fi free in all areas
Breakfast - very good selection of buffet and table service.Staff were so friendly.
Did not have dinner  there so cannot comment.t nearby.
If you like an old style decor hotel can recommend.",4,2013,07,19
232,Downtown Dublin Hotel - Great Location!,"Great central location in Downtown Dublin! We took the Airlink bus from the airport straight to O'Connell street and were dropped off right on the corner near the hotel. Very friendly staff. Easy to check in. Nice accommodations. Excellent breakfast options!

Pros: 
- Within walking distance to Temple Bar and other major attractions. 
- Central location with easy access to LUAS, buses, Airlink, etc. 
- Great breakfast (included with stay). 
- Very friendly hotel staff. 

Cons:
- The LUAS light rail metro runs right near the hotel. We were there during the first week of July and it was unusually warm, meaning we had to keep the windows open, so we heard the light rail until about 12:30 AM. 
- General noise from being in the heart of Downtown Dublin - loud people, pub scene, etc.",4,2013,07,18
232,Special Event at Wynns,"Most pleasant stay at Wynns in July, from arrival to departure. Staff very welcoming. Breakfast excellent. Rooms ready on arrival. Upgrade given to one couple in party as it was a special celebration for them. Have stayed here in the past and it continues to be a lovely place to stay, at reasonable price. Great location, just off O'Connell St.",4,2013,07,13
232,Too hot!,"I stayed in this hotel in July 2013. I was in Dublin for a pre-season football match and chose this hotel due to its location and good price. 

It is located right in the centre of Dublin, just off O'Connell street and next door to the Abbey Street Luas station (tram), which was perfect for me as the football match was outside the city. The hotel was very cheap for the centre of Dublin and looks a nice hotel on pictures. 

The hotel is quite old, hasn't been renovated in years. The room was quite small and basic but it was clean and served its purpose. Unfortunately Dublin was in the middle of a heat wave when I was there. There is no air conditioning in the room and just one window that you could open, however the curtains don't shut properly so there is a black out blind which covers the window and blocks any fresh air coming in. My 2nd night there was the most uncomfortable nights sleep I've ever had, the heat was unbearable. 

Overall, a decent hotel but I would only advise staying here between October and April!",3,2013,07,11
232,"Forget Jury's Inn, this is far superior in amenities and style","Breeze to check in. Our room was not available as we arrived at 11 a.m.  This hotel provided us with a 2nd floor area to pull ourselves together after a long drive and check our bags.  The 3 bedroom suite we had, had a jacuzzi in it which was an unexpected treat. The breakfast room is really nice, sit by the window if you can.  Didn't really enjoy the pancakes, but the eggs benedict and eggs with bacon looked quite appetizing. Full Irish breakfast is well priced and lovely service.

We didn't stay long, as we had previously booked at another hotel which was woeful in comparison.  

Location is excellent.",5,2013,07,09
232,Great value in Expensive city,I have stayed at this Particular hotel many times before ... For value it can not be beaten Dublin is so Expensive but this hotel offers class right in the centre of town ... The Breakfast is second to none and is included in the price ... Yeah the hotel is old but has loads of style and class try it you will not be Disappointed ... ,5,2013,07,08
232,Good location to see Dublin,"This hotel is very well situated to visit Dublin.  The staff are very nice, the breakfast is quite good with both cold and hot choices but the rooms are somewhat dated.  They do have updated bathrooms and overall I would say it was fair for the price, a moderate hotel for a moderate price.",3,2013,07,07
232,BEING CLOSE TO EVERYTHING HAS A PRICE,"But I'm very, very glad we stayed here.  I came prepared.  I brought my own earplugs.

If you're lucky, you'll get an interior room on a high floor with a tub/shower arrangement.  These rooms tend to be quiet.  

We were traveling with a small tour group, and some of our group got rooms that only had a shower.  There were complaints that the shower was tiny as was the room they were assigned to.  I had called earlier and requested a tub.  It was a good call.  Our room was delightful.  Large, renovated, good lighting, a very comfortable king bed.  

I can give you one good hint, however.  Bring hangers if you're a couple staying for a few days.  There are no drawers.  Just a few shelves and limited hanging space.  We moved the bulky bathrobes which helped.

Breakfast was delicious, but if you're having eggs or anything hot, its made to order.  Stick with the Continental Breakfast if you're in a hurry.  You can ask them to heat up the scones which were yummy.  You'll also have to ask your waiter for water.  They don't just bring it.

If you like good theatre, order tickets online for whatever's playing at The Abbey Theater.  We did and loved it.  As I said before, this hotel is close to almost everything.  That's a real plus.  The service is great.  Food in the bar was simple but good.  We had a pre-theatre dinner there, and they made every effort to get us out in time for the curtain even though they were very busy.  

If you get the right room, you'll love this hotel.",5,2013,07,03
232,"""Home away from home""","Wynn`s hotel in Dublin is my home when I visit Dublin. It`s a lovely, small hotel in the centre of the city. Very convenient to come from the airport by bus or to take the Luas to the train station. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The rooms have everything you need. Highly recommend the hotel.",4,2013,07,01
232,Great stay spoilt slightly by noisy cleaners!!!,"My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary weekend and chose this hotel for its central location, which was perfect as it was a stones throw from everything, including the tram station outside the hotel which was perfect for us to get to the O2 as we were seeing a show.
Our room was on the 5th floor and was of a really good size. Everything in the room and bathroom felt clean and fresh and the bed was really comfy. We could hear a bit of noise from the street but you kind of expect that when staying in the middle of a city. It didn't really disturb us though and the hotel do offer ear plugs for the lighter sleepers!!
The barman and bar manager were both really friendly and we were made to feel really welcome, as was the lady at the check in desk.
Our only gripe was the fact that the bed was pretty close to the door, which wasn't in anyway soundproof. We had put a do not disturb sign on the door however on both mornings we were woken around 9ish by the cleaners, who were crashing about and talking loudly right outside our door, waking us up. On the 1st morning I opened the door just as they were walking down the hallway and was greeted by an employee asking if everything was ok. When I explained that we had been woken up and continually disturbed by the cleaners all she did was look at her watch and mutter ""well it is nearly 10 o clock"" before walking off!! That really put a dampner on our stay but to the supervisors credit when we feedback to her on our departure she was very apologetic and assured us she would feed our concerns back to the maintenance manager.
All in all, we had a very nice stay and would probably stay again as it was really good value for how central the hotel was. Just hope they can learn from our feedback and understand that when people put a do not disturb sign out they don't want to be disturbed, no matter what time of the morning it is!!!!",4,2013,06,29
232,Great Stay,After our plane arrived at 4:45am and we took the bus to O'Connell Street we went around the corner to Wynn's Hotel and knocked on door and the night door man came out and we told he we could come in and rest in lounge until 7am when we could check in and they would lock up luggage. He brought us some free Tea and toast with jams. It hit the spot. After we check in we then went out and had breakfast and saw some sights and came back to check in our rooms and they already had our luggage in room. The whole staff treated us great. Will return here again.,5,2013,06,29
232,Excellent!,"We stayed last night at Wynn's Hotel - I was going to a play in the nearby Abbey Theatre and my fiancé was out at a work event.  I knew Wynn's from years ago when I attended meetings held in one of the upstairs meeting rooms but had nevers dined there or stayed overnight.  It is, doubtless, charmingly old-fashioned.  The welcome at check-in was genuinely warm and welcoming.  Our double room actually had a double and a single bed.  It was adequate in size and the bed was comfortable though the room is quite old-fashioned and the key was one of those old style keys on the weighted key-ring (quity a novelty actually!).  We were in a room at the front meaning lots of street noise but I'm used to Dublin city centre hotels and always arrive armed with good-quality ear plugs.  The bathroom was small but the shower was good - very powerful.  Toiletries were just so-so.  I had a quick snack in the bar before going to the theatre. - that is the reason I've given 4 instead of 5 stars.  One waitress in the bar kept passing me by and simply failed to notice that I was trying to get her attention (or ignored me?).  Anyway, when I did order the food arrived promptly - it was just a toasted special and was perfectly fine.  Breakfast was excellent - cooked to order with friendly and attentive waiting staff.  Freshly squeezed orange juice as well.  As is always the case in Irish hotels (and most guesthouses) the coffee was not good - it had that ""stewed"" taste.  Check-out was efficient and, again, the receptionist was very warm and friendly.  We got a good rate for this hotel via booking.com and we would definitely stay again.",4,2013,06,28
232,Excellent service and convenient location,"Stayed here for 2 nights.  The hotel was conveniently located to see all the things that we wanted, but it was the staff's attention to detail and frienliness that made our stay special.  They were very friendly and helpful and when we reported that the fridge in the room did not work, it was immediately replaced.  i would add that the breakfast was fantastic with the cooked breakfast cooked to order.  Everything was fresh and tasty. The hotel is an older hotel, but the rooms were a good size and very clean.  i would definately return if i went back to Dublin!",5,2013,06,26
232,A city-centre joke,"Room size: too amall for a suitcase and a person at the same time; couldn't fully open the bathroom door as the bed was in the way; at least clean
Service: non-existing
Breakfast: a cold-served joke
Luggage hold-room: wouldn't use it again, they misplaced my luggage during the morning of my departure and it took them 10 minutes to find it
Nickname of the hotel in Dublin: The Vatican or The Nun's Hotel",1,2013,06,25
232,Handy location for everything,"We stayed at Wynn's for 3 nights in May & whilst a bit tricky for the GPS to find, we ended up in the laneway behind, it is a nice hotel in an excellent location. Our hire car was whisked away before we knew it, which was a bit of a concern, but it reappeared on checking out without any issues and no cost. Check-in was efficent without being what you would discribe as friendly.
Nice big room which was a surprise although a refurbishment can't be too far away. Whilst there were issues with a humming noise from the electrical unit within the room, after looking at the hotel plan, we decided any alternative room would have been much smaller & it wasn't that big an issue. We also worked out the other noise we could hear was not the lift, but the trams out front so a move closer to the front would have made this worse.
Breakfast was excellent and prompt. We also ate in one night and were more than happy with this experience. A good base to explore Dublin with an easy walk to and from Temple Bar.",4,2013,06,25
232,Excellent service and location,Stayed here on last night in Dublin after touring in a car. The location of the hotel was very convenient.  Although this is an older hotel it was well appointed and the rooms very  comfortable. The staff were excellent and very helpful and I found this to be the major influence in making our stay so pleasant. I would recommend this hotel to any staying in Dublin.,4,2013,06,24
232,Visiting city for a concert.,"I booked a twin room, got a double room, I found the bed very lumpy and uncomfortable. TV too small for the room. bathroom very uninviting. the room very dated. supposedly it got a revamp they must have forgotten this room. I left a comment card on my departure, it was followed up with an email and I was informed I booked a double room, to which I replied with all my concerns on the room to which I was told the would take my points on board. The restaurant was not up to standard food wise and the female at front desk when checking out was more interested in giving out to another colleague than asking me how my stay was totally ignored on this. I would NOT recommend anyone staying here check out other hotels in the area. It would be worth it in the long run.",2,2013,06,24
232,excellent old fashioned personal friendly service,Overnight stay at the wynn hotel. Steeped in Irish history and staff that couldn't help enough. Great value for money. Room was a little small and decor a little dated but clean and comfortable. I will be back and i will be recommending it. ,4,2013,06,24
232,Wonderful Stay,"Spent one night here whilst attending a Josh Groban concert in the O2. Choose it primarily because it had parking & I knew the Luas was right outside to take us to The O2. When we arrived check in was prompt & the receptionist lovely. The porter whisked our car away & parked it for us - we were lucky to obtain one of the free spaces (others are available at a reasonable charge of 8euro). Our room -380 - was a good size, had a double & a single bed with a small but adequate en suite. The bed as comfortable & the room was immaculate - not even a speck of dust, kudos to the housekeeping staff! We had one drink In the bar before skipping out to the Luas. Breakfast the next morning was for me, perfect. I had 2 poached eggs & toast, there was plenty more on offer, my husband had the fry & said it was 'grand'. The room it was served in was lovely - in fact, to me the who,e old world charm of the hotel as lovely. I personally like a place with a bit of character & Wynns is definitely not a generic beech & chrome beast. Will be adding it to my favourites list & next time we are in Dublin will stay here :) ",5,2013,06,24
232,So Central,"Picked this hotel for its convenient location just of O Connell Street, The Luas stop is just outside hotel, handy for travel. Rooms may need a bit of updating but are clean and the beds were very comfortable. Very good quick check in and staff very pleasant, hotel closes it front gate over very early 11ish but just ring bell and lovely smiling gent opens up. Breakfast was good, quick service but I was disappointed the second morning when I ordered porridge only to get the microwaved type which I couldn't eat. Please home cook the porridge it takes a few minutes more but so nicer.
Would stay here again for its location.",5,2013,06,23
232,"Nice base camp, rooms a little tired","This hotel is in a very convenient location - airport shuttle stops right around the corner, and Luas station is right outside. Staff was very friendly, but the rooms were a little more dated than what I was expecting. Our bathroom was clearly recently renovated, which actually made the rest of the room feel a little drab. Staff was very friendly. It was more of a value play for us -- convenient location in the heart of Dublin that wasn't too expensive or in the middle of Temple Bar.",3,2013,06,23
232,Good location for exploring Dublin on foot,"A group of us stayed at Wynn's while attending a conference. We had rooms on various floors and of various sizes, and everyone seemed content. The street is less busy than many, being away from the main night-life locations. There is a comfortable hotel bar, with both draft beer and Guinness available.  I had a double room which was fine as a single but would have been cramped with two occupants. The thick duvet and heavy coverlet were much too hot for June - a folded sheet was enough. The bathroom was small but well fitted, with an excellent shower. Room 246 faces on to the main stairwell, so there is little natural light and the air conditioning machines outside the window work all night. However, after the first night I was too tired with the amount of walking we'd done to notice the noise. The hotel advises arriving early for breakfast to avoid later crowding and delays. We ate at 7.30 and had excellent swift service. There is plenty of choice, both hot and cold dishes, of a good standard. The staff were very helpful in getting us taxis to the airport and storing our luggage on the last day before our evening departure. The room charge was quite high, but compares favourably with other Dublin hotels. I would stay there again.",4,2013,06,23
232,Good Location,"The hotel is located close to major sites, and bus station / train station. The hotel itself is old fashioned, rooms a little dated, but fine for just 1 or 2 nights, can be noisy so take earplugs, breakfast was lovely, chohce of full Irish breakfast, or things like grilled goats cheese on toast, plus all the usual cereals.",3,2013,06,21
232,Worth Avoiding,"The hotel is an imposing building conveniently located just off O’Connell Street and that is its highlight.
You need to park illegally to be able to unload your car in a loading bay to enable to check in the hotel after running across the tram lines. In fairness the bell hop is quickly out of the hotel and parks your car somewhere secure. The receptionist who dealt with my checking -in had a poor command of the spoken English language and her manner was offhand. I ended up in room 382 which is a dark and dingy box room with a double bed that meant you couldn’t walk round the room but had to sidle round. There was a single wardrobe and a desk with a chair with not enough room to use, additionally no extra cupboard space to put clothes. The bathroom was reasonably well appointed so was OK. The really big problem with the assigned room other than lack of space was it’s lack of natural light due to a large adjacent building 3 or 4M away from the bedroom wall that shaded the majority of natural light which necessitated having the electric light on in the room  all hours. There was also a large and noisy extraction fan below the window running continuously that pumped up air extracted from a kitchen so the room smelt of extraneous cooking smells even with the window shut. It's continuous droning noise was also unacceptable.
After complaining the under manager / duty manager he kindly assigned me another room that was better but still slightly affected by the extraction fan noise and food smells but it wasn't worth another complaint. The bathroom had just been recently re-decorated since there was masking tape still on the joint between tiles and painted surfaces. It also had an unusual colour mix of porcelain and the fittings were a mix of chrome, gold tint and worn gold tint. The shower performance is best left unsaid.
 For an evening meal the restaurant managed to stew my meal vegetables to a tasteless mess and one cooked breakfast was hot and the next day it was lukewarm. It was good that there were restaurants close by that knew how to cook and serve quality food.
With the exception of a couple of staff members service in general was sub-standard. 
All in all, the place is abysmal and needs complete renovation and re-staffing with people who understand customer service..  
Dublin itself has plenty to occupy a tourist from historical buildings, parks, museums, castle (currently shut), Guinness storehouse, Jamesons ‘distillery etc so there is plenty to do over a couple of days if you like walking around so you cannot get bored. A couple of good bars for some nightlife are around even for old folks like me.
About 40 km from Dublin is a quaint and pretty town called Trim with its star attraction a lovely castle and walks close by so it is worth a visit. If you like walking then the evocative Hills of Tara are close by that is part of Ireland’s 
folk law and history",1,2013,06,20
232,Very Pleasant Stay & Great Location,"I hiked portions of the Kerry Way and then visited Dublin. The tour company, Go Visit Ireland, booked Wynn's for me, so I really don't know whether my room was good value or not. But the hotel staff were very pleasant, the dining room breakfasts quite posh, the bar full of elderly folks (like me) and fun to watch, the Guinness very good, and the location, well, perfect. You're just steps from O'Connell Street, close to the Liffey, and the Luas red line stops right in front of the hotel. I chatted with one guest whose room faced the street, and she barely got a minute of sleep because of the noise. I had a small but perfectly fine room (number 496) that opened to an interior light shaft, and I only heard gulls and an occasional siren. If this says anything, I'd stay at Wynn's again.",4,2013,06,15
232,"Convenient, Historic and Grand","We got an excellent price for this hotel by booking online and paying in advance. Not only that, the quality of the room was excellent. Spacious bathroom with spa, fluffy huge towells and full bathroom toileteries. We were in the James Joyce room. Most of this historic hotel has been refurbished and the grand dining room is something to behold.  There is also a comfortable bar serving food.
We had to leave early the next day, but a continental breakfast was ready for us at the time we requested. The hotel is well located north of the Liffey, close to where we dropped our hire car off and a convenient taxi drive to/from the ferry. You can walk to most attractions in the centre of Dublin. Would definitely stay there again. Great location and value.",4,2013,06,14
232,"Quite, Clean, Affordable...","This hotel is excellent. The staff is very friendly, the rooms are clean and modern, and the location is perfect. Within walking distance to most Dublin attractions. I booked the bed and breakfast option and was glad I did. The irish breakfast was EXCELLENT!!! My room was adequate for 2 people sizewise, and the bed was great!! I will stay there again when I go to Dublin.",5,2013,06,09
232,"Small room, but great location and great service","The Wynn Hotel was the perfect hotel for 1 night in Dublin. We arrived at the hotel at 7am and miraculously they had a room for us. And the hotel receptionist was almost as excited about it as we were! The room was small, but the bed was comfortable, the wifi worked great, and the shower had great pressure. Breakfast the next day was delicious and, again, service was wonderful. We found the location to be very good. Even though it's on the ""other"" side of the LIffey, the bus stop from one of the airport buses stopped 10 feet away from our door, and it's a 5 minute walk to cross the Liffey. The bar downstairs in the hotel looked very welcoming, although we sadly didn't try a Guinness there. Would definitely stay here again on a return trip to Dublin.",4,2013,06,07
232,Wynn's Hotel - Dublin,"This hotel is exactly where you want to be when staying in Dublin. Close to the O' Connell bridge from Temple Bar - Grafton Street for shopping and the Dublin Bus 747 stops right at the corner of Abbey street and where you can get the hop on hop off bus.
The service is fantastic and must compliment Roberta at reception for her assistance with everything.   The breakfasts where the best I had in Ireland and would recommend The Wynn's if going to Dublin.  I would not stay anywhere else.
thanks again - Jenny Mowat",5,2013,06,06
232,Old fashioned but endearing,"This is a very old fashioned hotel which attracts mostly elderly guests and tour groups. The location is very central, off lower O'Connell Street, a ten-minute walk to the city centre. There was a delay with the check-in and my room was not ready until 14:25h, almost 30 minutes later than the advertised check-in time of 14:00h. The double room for single use was rather tiny but cosy. The sink in the bathroom was too small to even brush one's teeth or clean one's face; it has two different taps for cold and hot water and it takes some time until water actually comes out. Important to know: no buffet breakfast is served; only cereals and yoghurt are available from the buffet; a choice of five hot breakfasts needs to be ordered at the table and is delivered by waters after a 15-30 minute wait. All options are high in calories and carbohydrates: no healthy breakfast options besides the yoghurt and cereal. Altogether, this was probably the most old fashioned hotel I have stayed in during he last ten years,",3,2013,05,29
232,Wonderful old style hotel in the center of Dublin,It's right in the middle of the city so perfect for exploring the city. Roberta on the reception was excellent as was the doorman and the other staff in the dining room. It's a busy place but they were very attentive. My room was at the back so it was quite. I'd definately stay here again.,5,2013,05,28
232,Wynn's hotel,"Had a long week end break in Dublin and stayed at Wynn's hotel, wh have stayed there before, and i like the homely and warm atmosphere and polite staff, and the spa bath was a real plus, not to mention the home made scones which were the best i have tasted in a long time! not bad breakfat either!",4,2013,05,28
232,"Perfectly Fine, Great Location",It's not the flashiest hotel but it's perfectly fine. The rooms are quiet and the location is right beside one of the busiest streets (O' Connell St) in Dublin. Not very noisy. Did get a visitation from a cleaner at about 10am while sleeping but you can't be too fussy in life. Very good overall.,4,2013,05,28
232,Very good location,"Winn´s has the perfct location if you are going to walk on foot. Near Temple Bar -just  three blocks, across the bridge and you can drink and eat and drink!!!
O'Connell Street is just at the corner!.
The hotel is clean and has a very good breakfast - you won´t need any lunch :-) It has a very good restaurant / bar alos. Perfect for a tourist stay!",4,2013,05,22
232,"Location, Location","This was our third time staying in Wynn's for a short break. It is in a great location,just off O'Connell Street;the LUAS stops directly outside the door.It is a short distance from the centre city bus stops,the Main Bus Depot for national routes, and Connolly Rail Station.It is also very near the Abbey Theatre.The accomodation is very comfortable and the meals are good,particularly breakfast.All staff are friendly and efficient.It is the ideal starting point for visiting most places of interest around the city.",4,2013,05,18
232,"Excellent location, but the smallest room I've ever been in","The location could have been better, all the tourist attractions and the best pubs are within walking distance. The staff is very friendly and the room was very cousie and clean. Although the smallest one ever... it was like 8 m2, including the bathroom. There was no place for my stuff at all and I felt a bit claustrophobic. For one night and for one person it was okay - but I do not recommend it for a longer stay or for couples.",3,2013,05,18
232,"""So happy we stayed at Wynns""","This was my first trip to Ireland and we spent two nights in Dublin before renting a car and taking off for the countryside.  We loved the hotel...it is completely charming, exceptionally clean, and had a most gracious and helpful staff.  It was so easy to get to from the airport--and so close to all the main areas of the city.  We walked everywhere.  Rooms were fine--not fancy, but exceptionally clean.  The breakfast was very good--always appreciate having a tablecloth for breakfast!  We  were on a B&B package and one night's dinner, with a glass of wine.  The dinner was fine--not great, but fine.  All in all, a great value, safe, clean, exceptional location and service.  I would stay here again!!!",4,2013,05,18
232,right smack in the middle of the city centre! can accomodate four per room,"LOVE! The staff is super nice and helpful.

We stayed with Wynn's sporadically throughout our 9 day trip. While we traveled to other cities, they had no issue with storing and retrieving our ginormous suitcases several times.

Rooms - the hotel itself is more old-fashioned looking. Rooms are not modern but we chose this hotel because there were four of us, we all wanted to be in the same room and apparently four-person rooms are hard to come by in Dublin. But I'm glad we stumbled upon this one. Oh and since we stayed for St. Paddy's day, there were real shamrocks in the room when we checked in! Wish I could have brought them home.

Food - We had breakfast here everyday, which is included in the price of your room. They have hot breakfast items (such as a full Irish breakfast, eggs benedict, etc.) but it wasn't anything fantastic. They also have a help yourself continental breakfast which was fruits, yogurts, cereals and scones.

Location - Right in the city centre. It's less than a ten minute walk to Temple Bar. You can catch the train right out in front. It's a block away from the GPO. The only scary thing - there's an ATM right outside the hotel and on our last night, we saw someone getting mugged! But other than that incident, I did feel pretty safe. I guess :x

If I ever come back to Dublin, I would definitely stay here.",4,2013,05,14
232,Home away from hotel,"This is perhaps the most underrated hotel in Dublin.  I have been doing to the Wynn's for two years now. it is my favourite hotel in Dublin. Walking distance from train/bus stTion and very close to Airbus coach from/to airport.  Ideally located for sight seeing and, in my case, from Trinity Vollege University. What's more you have the Luas at the door.  it is an old style hotel and offers the best breakfast (and best baked in the premises scones!) in Dublin.  The reception staff is among the best I have ever encountered anywhere in the world.  Stay there once, and at your next stay they will great you by name and ask things are.  I recently stayed at hotel just before an important oral exam and they took such good care of me (not to mention the words of encouragement).  I have only used the single rooms but I absolutely love 'my' room on the 5th floor. there is a popular yet quiet bar on ground floor.  The only drawback is that there are a few steps to get into hotel; no wheelchir ramp or button that would open doors automatically. hopefully this will be addressed in the ner future.  the staff is quick to respond to e-mail inquiries as well. BREAKFAST is included and they take personalised service very seriously!",5,2013,05,11
232,Great location and a stylish hotel,"We stayed for five nights during our holiday in Dublin and found our stay at Wynn's pleasant.

The location cannot be better. Close to O'Connell street lower, easy access and walking distance to major Dublins sights, shopping streets, bus stops and train stations, etc. Airlink 747 from airport has a stop (I think is no.8) on O'Connell lower, just 2 min away from the hotel.

It is an old and stylish hotel with about a century history. Everything inside the hotel reminds you of its old and elegant feature. Lift is small and extremely slow. Walking up and downstairs if no luggage is far easier. The room is not big, but clean and comfortable. Cold and hot water taps are separated in the wash basin in toilet, which I found common in old European buildings but very unacceptable. Shower is okay but not great. 

Some may think Rooms facing the Abbey street are a bit noisy during the night due to the road traffic, but I found it not a problem to sleep.

Breakfast is sufficient and is in a nice decorated dinning room. There's a small pub on the ground floor as well. Most visitors to the pub are quite old thogh.

The staff is friendly. (Some were too friendly???) Easy check-in and out. ",5,2013,05,05
232,No Hot Water!!! ROOM 525,"Stayed here with husband and 2 friends for 3 nights last week. Firstly parking situation not clear. Luckily we phoned on our way from ferry and were able to secure last 2 parking places. Not made clear though that cars are parked some distance away so make sure you can unpack your car fairly quickly and you don't have easy access to it during stay. It is brought round if you request it. No charge though - good for city centre. Lovely welcome. Room on 5th floor quite dated. Tiny wardrobe with an ironing board taking up all the hanging space. Plastic glasses but so far OK. Our room 525 was a bit dodgy from the start. Shower had little power and hot water spluttered a lot before coming through. We should have been grateful because on the second morning the hot water stopped completely!! We reported it and went out without showers. Came back late afternoon and told that housekeeper had 'twiddled something' and it was fine. It wasn't but short of time so went to theatre without shower. Still nothing when we got back but late so reported again the following morning. Told someone would be right up. Had to phone 3 times to get someone there. Housekeeper arrived with robes to take us to another room for showers. Already late and holding  up friends so my husband didn't bother but I did. Taken to one of the executive rooms. Shower there functioning but still not much pressure. Did the job however. Room itself had peeling paint and was very tatty. Housekeeper said that they knew plumbing was a problem in our room so after breakfast-a late one-I talked to Duty manager. On being asked why they used the room he said the fault was 'intermittent' and agreed that it should not have been used. He also said that we should not have been told that the fault had been fixed. No compensation was offered although he agreed that they were at fault. Instead he asked me what I wanted him to do. I said I would pay half the bill because we had a bed but no washing facilities and he agreed that was reasonable.     However when we checked out he had only removed one night from the bill not 1.5 as agreed. The receptionist had then to track him down again causing more delay for ourselves and other guests waiting to check out. The whole situation was a fiasco. The Duty Manager agreed that it was very bad PR and our visit to Dublin was ruined since I have an illness which causes me to get very hot and I was uncomfortable for much of the time. Also on the second day the bed was not made properly. Bottom sheet untouched and I had to remake it myself and dirty water glasses were left sitting on the chest.
On the plus side the hotel obviously has a lot of history. The service in the bar and restaurant were very good and the breakfasts were excellent.
However we would certainly not consider staying here again or recommending it in spite of the good location. Because the problem was known to the staff we should have been offered another room as soon as the hot water stopped. Instead we were told blatant lies. Hardly the way to get repeat custom.  We both felt that we were treated badly and problem, which should never have occurred was badly handled.",2,2013,05,04
232,Brilliant location - very nice victorian Hotel,"We visited Dublin for a 5 night stay and choose Wynns Hotel because of the good ratings given at several hotel portals. 
Location: The location is ideal - it cannot be better !
30 min from by Taxi the airport in the middle of the center of Dublin. (approx. 20 Euro)
5min walk to the central busstation Busaras , where the airport bus would stop and 10 min to the Connolly Station Dublin.
Just opposite of the hotel entrance is the Luas tram station and a Hopon/Hopoff bus stop.
20 sec walk to O'Connell street
5 min walk and just across the river is Temple Bar,Trinity college and Crafton street.
=> You stay here exactly inside the city center, but just off the crowds and the accompanying noise.
Room (Standard double): We asked on our reservation for a silent room and so we got one. It was on the fifth floor with the window facing the backyard. We heard no noise from the street.
The room itself was very small for 2 persons/ perfect as a single room.The bed was a little to small for two adults to sleep confortable, but ok after some arrangements.Two windows, which could stay open during the night w/o disturbance. 
There is a toilet, wash basin, hairdryer, towel heater and shower in the wetroom. Safe,TV, coffee/teamaking facility and free WIFI is available, even though the WIFI worked only in one corner of the room successfully. 
Restaurant: We used it  just for breakfast and it was very good. There you have a buffet for muesli, fruits, cerreals, cakes, bread, croissants and several juices.Toast, butter and jam are served automatically, while the hot breakfast parts can be ordered from a menu card.Full irish breakfast is also available. Tea and coffee of course, whereas the coffee is filter coffee and depending on the time ,you come to eat breakfast, it might not taste anymore like real strong coffee. A seperate coffee machine would be good here to provide freshly brewed stuff.
Staff: Nice, Experienced, incredible friendly and efficient .
Hotel itself: Has a restaurant and a bar, which we did not visit.
The whole Hotel looks like fresh refurbished, but kept the old character.
.....and so is also the lift a little bit slow :-)
Conclusion:
If i come to Dublin again, i will for sure stay again here in this lovely place !",4,2013,05,03
232,"Nice Hotel, ideal location",Unfortunately the room was facing onto the street so I was awake most of the night with noise from the streets. When I did eventually fall asleep the fire alarm went off at about 2am but there was no fire. However the hotel was very handy for shops etc. I would stay again but definitely request a room in the back of the hotel. Breakfast was good and staff were very nice.,4,2013,04,20
232,Perfect Location,"Lovely boutique hotel, great service and fab location. In particular I was blown away by the level of attentiveness of the staff in the restaurant for breakfast. Would recommend this hotel to friends and family in a heartbeat. Thanks Wynns for a memorable stay. See you next time.",5,2013,04,20
232,comfortable bed for quick stay..,Friendly and welcoming upon arrival.Room warm but bit stuffy so opened window right away.Good shower-no bath.The free wi-fi only worked when i sat next to the door.Maybe as was on 3rd floor?Was not in the room for long as was going out.When i returned to the hotel that night i needed to charge my phone.Did so after finding a plug that worked.Not all did and there was not any beside bed but at back of a dresser.Unfortunately in my haste to catch a train home i forget phone charger.Rang hotel but they say no one came across charger and sorry about that.So at 89 euro for the night and having now to replace my phone charger was an expensive stay for ok surroundings.,3,2013,04,15
232,"Great stay, fantastic staff and even better Guinness!","I stayed here for an evening whilst on business in Dublin on the 11th April 2013. My room was spotless, bed comfortable and my evening meal in the restaurant was fantastic. 

I highly recommend this hotel for city breaks, business travellers and couples.",5,2013,04,15
232,Central hotel with lovely service,We loved the charm and history related to this central building. The location is excellent and easy to find. The bar downstairs is quaint and the bar staff always friendly and welcoming with plenty of stories to tell. It was cold outside but but inside this hotel was warm and cosy. We were keen to return at night to our toasty bar for a nightcap before snuggling up in our comfortable rooms.,4,2013,04,11
232,Nice Hotel in Central Location,This is a nice hotel very centrally located in the heart of Dublin's City Centre. The staff are friendly and efficient and the food is of a good standard.My room was booked as a single and was in fact a twin. In these circumstances it might make more sense to offer a solo guest a room with a double bed which would be more comfortable. Nonetheless I enjoyed my stay in this hotel as I have on any occasion I've stayed here.,4,2013,04,08
232,wynns hotel,"After just returning from wynns hotel with a group of 35 pax, we had a great time and staff and hotel were excellent - Nothing was a problem for any request - Hotel is great location for all major sites of  Dublin and if you are bringing your car reception will arrange and park car for you.
I have stayed many times at this hotel and would recommend to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2013,04,08
232,Great weekend stay,"We have spent a great weekend in Wynn´s hotel! The hotel has great location, in walking distance to all important sight seeing places in Dublin and shopping areas! We have stayed in nice room with view and all hotel staff was very friendly and more than helpful with all our questions and requests. The breakfast was very good and we had also spent a great evening in the hotel bar where the staff was also amazing. We loved this place and we will definitely come back very soon!",5,2013,03,29
232,"Great location, very good hotel- Highly recommend","Situated in the heart of Dublin off O'Connel Street, the hotel is within walking distance of Dublin Castle, Trinity College, Temple Bar area

Extremely polite and helpful staff. I had a problem with heating system in my room. The housekeeping and Reception staff changed my room immediately upon my request. The hotel even organises continental breakfast for guests needing an early check out. Would highly recommend",5,2013,03,26
232,Mostly V Good,"Great location almost on the corner of O'Connell street and with the LUAR (tram) stop right outside. A nice place with excellent staff - and quality breakfasts. The Eggs Benedictine (that's what was on the menu!) slightly too mustardy but great - and they sure know how to poach an egg - a disappearing skill these days. Maybe I was unlucky with my room but, whilst it was comfortable enough, and had a fridge, the fit-out hadn't been thought through. Only one small drawer and no shelves so very little space to store clothes. there was a walk-in cupboard with a clothes rail and a small unit could have been included for 'smalls', but wasn't. That room was also quite small but then it was fairly cheap.",4,2013,03,22
232,Fabulous place for St. Patrick's Weekend,"We loved this hotel.  Staff was amazing.  This was our second stay.  On our first stay our son left his Passport.  Hotel staff found it and put it in the safe for us.  Could not have been nicer!  

Great location for parade and other events.  Beautiful shamrock gift in room.  Hotel food very, very good and wait staff excellent.  

This is the place to same in Dublin for a warm Irish experience in a central historical hotel.",5,2013,03,21
232,"Great location, good price!","I reccomend this hotel for people who looks for good quality in a good price. Location is great and staff is VERY friendly and helpful. The building has a nice style and atmosphere.

The only two things which I didn't like much were:
- cold room
- not big choice for breakfast",4,2013,03,19
232,Wonderful Hotel and Staff.,"My daughter and I stayed in Wynn`s last Friday night and loved everything about it,It was spotless we had a lovely room,the Staff were so helpful.We would certainly stay there in future.
Well done to all.",5,2013,03,04
232,"There is only one real hotel in Dublin ""WYNN'S""","Even the weather wasn't good, there is always sunny in the hotel. The staff smiles at you, atmosphere is warm and food is great. Me and my wife had a lovely room with jacuzzi bath and decor is in natural colors which makes me relax. Also prices are reasonable compare to area around.
I will always come back I felt great after holidays and that's what everybody wants.",5,2013,03,03
232,Great Location!,"Great Location, very large room with Jacuzzi bath. We had a very quiet room on the 4th floor. Right beside Luas Line.
Very old building with lots of charm. Older clientele.
Breakfast very poor, no selection of fruit or breads. Cooked breakfast overdone.

Staff very friendly. Good Value",4,2013,03,02
232,Lovely Central Hotel with friendly staff,"My wife and I stayed in Wynn's Hotel in Dublin for one night  in late february for a concert in the O2 and found it so convenient to everything. The luas, light rail system, stops just outside the door and you can get straight to the O2 in a few minutes and the train stations can also be accessed by this  .The main shopping areas are just a couple minutes walk. We drove to Dublin and as there is valet parking there it was so easy to just leave the car and the porter parked it for us. It is also free to park which was an extra bonus. The room was lovely and clean and the bed comfy. It had evrthing like iron and tea coffee making stuff and also a safe. Our room had a whirlpool bath too. The breakfast was very good with plenty to eat and all freshly cooked. All the staff from when we checked in till we checked out were very efficient and so nice and friendly. A lot of the customers were older but a few younger ones too. Overall we had a very pleasent stay. We will certainly stay in this hotel again.",5,2013,02,24
232,Second stay was better than the first.,"I stayed here for the second time in February 2013 with my husband. We booked and the first time or stay was pleasant and the price is good for the area, but mainly as we where attending a concert at the academy only 500 meters away. But this time we had a much better large room. We will most likely return.",5,2013,02,18
232,Central hotel,Stayed 19 feb. perfect location for city. Breakfast was plentiful and great service. Car parked and returned. Brilliant. Older clientele.  Staff very formal but really nice. Unfortunately room was facing abbey street. Not much sleep with singers passing at 4 a.m. And traffic from 6.30. Be sure to ask for room at back of hotel   Tv too small. Couldn't see scoreboard for a soccer game. Old fashioned but location fab. 99 with breakfast. Good value. Will be back ,4,2013,02,18
232,Brilliant little hotel but don't tell your friends,"Location is fantastic, the staff are excellent, free parking and a cracking breakfast.
the rooms are lovely and very clean but beware the shower if your waist is more than 36"" as it is a bit of a tight squeeze and manoeuvring once inside is an art.
I cannot recommend this hotel enough and will return. The noise from the street trams can be a nuisance if you have a room at the front. the bar is reasonably priced and the bar staff are friendly. Great hotel highly recommended.",5,2013,02,11
232,Lovely but needs to move with the times,I have being dining and staying at this hotel for the past 26 years. I had dinner today and for the first time felt it needs the Brennan Brothers advice.  I was there at about 1.30pm and was on average 20 years younger than the rest of the clientel. What happens to Wynnes when they depart this earth? The staff are excellent but the place needs cheering up. I love the Dubliners and its ethos isgreat,4,2013,01,29
232,Good enough.. 3+,"I spent only one night in the Wynns for a very short stay in Dublin, buit it was a pleasant enough stay. If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel in the heart of Dublin with the necessary services -that is, clean, enjoyable room with good bed, TV/telephone, internet, lift, clean bathroom, toiletries, coffee in the room and breakfast included- this is your hotel. Even if I didnt use the gym they do have it. This is what I was looking for and I got it.

I will tell you what could be improved: the gym access is under notice, so you have to tell them you intend to use it before getting access. The room serves its purpose but it is old, could be renewed a bit. The TV is flat screen but has only 15 channels, and not very good ones, 2 of them news, one radio and some shopping channels. Coffee is drinkable but instant... toiletries are middle quality, ok. Breakfast is good, not the most variated but good quality of food. Maybe the one thing of breakfast that goes toward below is their coffee, but the rest is yummy.

The one con I actually found was their receptionist. I arrived to checkin with a colleague that chose another hotel, and when she saw me with her she inmediately remarked: ""this room is only for one person, no more are allowed there"". That was so rude. I am not used to impertinent remarks like these when I get into a hotel, more than offended I felt shame for her and even if I needed assistance during my stay, I didnt want to contact reception at all. The fact that she thought someone like me neede to cheat somebody else in is the one thing -but meaningful one- to make me think I was in a hotel of less quality than I deserved.",3,2013,01,23
232,Another great stay at Wynn's,"A wee bit late reviewing, as my latest stay here was over Christmas. 

What can I say? - Excellent as always, hot mulled wine reception on Christmas evening, transport to mass on Christmas morning if needed, Excellent food as usual, entertainment in the afternoon and trip to Leopardstown races on St. Stephens day if wanted. 

The staff cannot be helpful enough, and the Hotel itself was, as usual pristine.

If you've nothing on next Christmas - this is well worth a look - see you there in December???",5,2013,01,18
232,Celebration in Wynn's Hotel,"Our hill-walking club returns here year after year for our annual lunch party not merely because of its central location but because the staff are courteous, helpful and efficient; nothing ever seems to be too much trouble.  This year was just the same and the food was, if anything, better than ever, especially the beef!",4,2013,01,17
232,Irish Gem,"Me, my partner and our 11 month old daughter stayed for 3 nights. When booking we requested a cot in the room, this was all set up and ready when we arrived, the staff were very friendly and helpful and we couldn't believe how quickly all our requests were met. The location is fantastic, 30 yards away just off the Liffey and maybe 200 yards from Temple bar. O'Connell Street is literally around the corner for shopping and the theatre. All in all would definitely stay here again. ",5,2013,01,15
232,Burldoor,"Wynns is a brilliant hotel.  It is one of the older hotels in Dublin and as such is full of old world charm.  From the moment you arrive in reception, where you are greeted with warmth and courtesy, to the waiting staff and housekeeping nothing was too much trouble.  The room was very comfortable and as I had requested a quite room they were able to accommodate me.  Also included was a delicious breakfast.   I would consider Wynns Hotel to be great value for money from its central location - just a stones throw from O'Connell Street and a ten minute walk from Trinity College and the museums.",5,2013,01,15
232,"Great location, a touch old fashioned","The best thing about this hotel is the location, just off O'Connell St and with the LUAS tram right outside the door. The staff are friendly and helpful and there is a great little old school bar. Downsides- rooms are a bit small (but thats to be expected in the city centre) and a bit old fashioned but I'm still in my 20's so like the more modern look. The food in the restaurant was sub standard- you really shouldn't be serving up bottled sweet chili sauce with lemon sole. I might not book again but that's more about my own personal taste.",3,2013,01,10
232,Good two-night base for quick Dublin visit.,"I flew from UK, and stayed here two nights for long-sought visit to the city and the Abbey Theatre, almost next door. My purpose was met more than adequately, with a clean and comfortable room (double at singles rate), and an excellent if rather noisy breakfast. Be warned that, like other hotels, they do not serve after-theatre meals. That situation is easily remedied by a short taxi-ride across the Liffey. O'Connell Street, with its large shops, is just around the corner",4,2013,01,06
232,fantastic in all regards,"i myself am staff in a hotel and i have to say that david, (bar staff), willie(night porter) and rory (agm)  were absolutely fantastic and incredibly welcoming. were great to be around and would recomend to anyone going to dublin to stay in the hotel... if not for the night than just for the evening for those three lads... legends",5,2012,12,30
232,Excellent Service,"I stayed at this hotel in early December , the rooms are small but clean.  At night I could hear noise coming from a party somewhere in the hotel but it was in the background and not loud enough to bother me but this might vary depending on your room location.  The hotel is very well located a few minutes walk from the busy centre but what makes this hotel for me is the excellent and friendly service of all the staff.",4,2012,12,20
232,"Nothing that bad, just okay, but stuck in the 1930's.","Room whilst a little snug and sparce had comfy beds and pillows.  Shower is a bit lame. Room and bathrooms all nicely clean.

Staff very good.

The lounges during the day were absolutely rammed with pensioners, is this an alternative day care for the elderly!  The old fashioned oak paneling is also a bit of a turn off.

Breakfast was cooked to perfection, although I don't like the skinny sausages.  I had fried eggs cooked perfectly and my friends poached eggs were also spot on.

However, this is where another ""tradition"" lets the place down.  NO BAKED BEANS OR BROWN SAUCE, as ""we don't so it.""  This I have come across before in establishments that consider themselves to be a cut above.  Seems beans are a bit ""common"".

Lastly, they took £50 deposit per room on booking, AND the cancellation policy is about a week before you've booked, as long as you phone on the last Tuesday before the Popes birthday.  (It's effectively 3 days, surely this place is not that in demand!)

I'll probably try elsewhere next time.",3,2012,12,19
232,andre rieu,"had a lovely stay in this hotel, went to a concert in the 02 where the luas picked us up and droped us off right outside the hotel. The rates for a hotel in such a great location are fantastic too. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. 
      ",4,2012,12,10
232,Clean and friendly (but a bit noisy),"We had a wonderful room on the 5th floor which was only spoiled by the noise coming from the party downstairs and the street noise. To be totally fair we were told about the possibility of noise when we checked in, but I guess by then its too late to change your mind if you've booked and pre paid online. The restaurant staff at breakfast were overworked, and did not take time to listen to and check that they had correctly understood your order. Was surprised to see the waiter blew on the table cloth to remove the crumbs - hardly hygenic!
The location of the hotel was great, ideally situated for bus and tram.",4,2012,12,10
232,Nice old hotel,"This is a 19th century hotel which is frequented mainly by old people. The furniture and all the equipment suites the needs of this group. The atmosphere is really old fashioned, you can see the memorial tablet of the Officers Club and the Fire Brigade.
The staff is very nice, the breakfast was good. The elevator is beautifully renovated.
The single room looked a bit better on the photos than in the real world.
There can be noise in the lower floor rooms because of the LUAS tram and the large street nearby.",4,2012,12,07
232,"Slow paced, old fashioned, comfortable cozy and cheery.","After spending 2 weeks here, I can definitely say this hotel has its ups and downs.

It seems targeted at the over-60 crowd who love buffet breakfasts and roast carvery dinners at 5:30. 

The beds are comfortable, the staff are friendly and very courteous, the corridors have been repainted and are cleaned spotlessly, and there is a great fitness centre in the basement.

The free wi-fi works quite well, but there seems to be some outages or interruptions if you stay connected for a while.

The bathrooms are large and clean, with towel heaters and fresh linen every day.

The location is superb for exploring Dublin. 15 seconds walk to O'Connell street and another 30 seconds to the River Liffy.

The breakfasts are generous and terrific too.

Having said all that there are definitely ways this hotel can improve. It really needs to modernise a few key things.

The single elevator is painfully slow and I often found myself running up the stairs instead of waiting 3 minutes.

The tiny lobby can get very busy and crowded on weekends, and the staff are often in the back office behind the tiny desk, so you need to be patient.

The door keys are not electronic cards like most modern hotels, but instead a key attached to a ridiculous massive bronze keyring that you leave at the front desk every time.

The TVs in the room are tiny 22"" screens, and they ought to be upgraded.

Also, at 8am when other people are using the bathrooms, the hot water supply is not even and keeps cutting out.",3,2012,12,07
232,"Location, Location and Service","Wynn's Hotel has a long and honourable history - it has been modernised over the years but not desecrated.  It is, as they say, a relic of 'ould dacency' but it has a great deal going for it.  It is very well staffed with friendly and helpful staff, it is located in the heart of Dublin only metres from O'Connell Street.  The rooms are clean and comfortable, we had a jacuzzi bath which was ideal after trekking around the city.  The Luas stops almost outside the door. The bar was comfortable and well stocked and the bar staff were very attentive. The breakfast was excellent - we were only sorry we weren't staying another night...but we will be back.  A real find which gives many of the more modern 'luxury' Dublin hotels a good run for their money...and the b & b rates were excellent.  Altogether two very happy new customers.",4,2012,12,07
232,Excellent Staff!,"Even before I entered this hotel, the staff were excellent! I hadn't stayed here for about four years and needed to get directions to bring the car to the hotel. I spoke to Robbie, one of the porters and he couldn't have been more helpful. On the way, due to roadworks, I had to take a detour and a really nice Lady on reception, Annemarie, I think was her name, stayed on the phone with me until I got to the hotel. I was checked in by another really nice Lady and during my stay, everyone I met, from the reception staff to the porters to the house keeping staff, was so nice and friendly (without being obtrusive or OTT.) The hotel is old fashioned but in a nice way, and is spotlessly clean. A previous reviewer spoke about the noise but it is probably the most central hotel in Dublin, so it comes with the territory and you can always request a room at the back for quietness. The Management in Wynn's should be very proud of their team!",4,2012,12,02
232,"Old-fashion, in a good way","I would call this place an ""old-fashion"" one, in a good way. I liked the room and service was good, I would say very traditional, again, in a good way. Breakfast was just excellent. The service at the breakfast was superb. The only thing that I did not like was a room key (very old-fashion) with a heavy knob that forces you to leave the key at reception when you go out.  Be aware, this is a noisy place due to the hotel is located right in downtown on a busy street with heavy traffic and trams. I grew up in a big city so I actually enjoyed the street noise. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay and I would stay at Wynn's again, no doubts.",5,2012,11,26
232,Noisy city centre,"Was disappointed with the hotel as it was not as described by booking.com.
Facilities listed were not available  eg restaurent closed on tuesday evenings.
The hotel fronts on to a LUAS line an as such makes it very noisy.
The room I occupied was on the front of the hotel an would have benefited from secondry double glazing to absorb some of the traffic noise.
The bar was also used as a carvary and its ambience was destroyed by the smell of food and the
bustle of serving staff.
I will not stay in this hotel again",2,2012,11,22
232,"Nice hotel in a central location with lovely, helpful staff.","My husband and I stayed at the wynns hotel. It is simply 5 minutes walk from the train and bus station and the local luaz runs right outside the front door. Plenty of shopping on o'connell street and a 5 minute walk from grafton street. We arrived early for check in but we were able to leave our bags at the hotel reception. Our room was clean and had tea and coffee facilities. It also had a small fridge. Breakfast was nice with a selection of cereal, yogurt, bread, fruit juice, etc and then a waiter took your order for a cooked breakfast. Check out was at 12 and again we were able to leave our bags at reception. We will go again when we return to Dublin.",5,2012,11,20
232,What no beans ??,"I've been to Dublin many times (both parents are from Dublin !) and stayed in a lot of hotels in the area. This time I decided to stay at Wynns as my mother had had her 70th party here 2 years ago.
Let's face it - if you are under the age of 50, it's unlikely that you would be rating Wynns top marks (take a look at the average age sitting at breakfast!)
If you are a fan of reasonable quality rooms and facilities you are unlikely to be giving it a '5' ! (pay the extra and stay at the Gresham)
BUT it has a great location and the staff are very friendly. 
If I had to sum the hotel up in 5 words :
Tatty (rooms)
Sofaless ( no real comfy sofas in the public rooms - take a look at the Gresham !)
Weak ( wi-fi almost non existent esp in all public areas)
Glorious (dining room - although doesn't make up for no beans with the breakfast - yes I did ask !)
Friendly (staff)
In essence ANCIENT AND MODERN without the MODERN !!!!

232,Saint Patty's Sleeping Place,"My husband and I were in Dublin on St. Patty's day 2012, and the Wynn's was the perfect place for us! We were right off the path of the parade route, in walking distance to MANY bars, sights, shops, and other fun things, and had a cozy little room to return to once we were done painting the town. We had to book months in advance for the holiday weekend, but the result was worth every ounce of planning. Stay here any time for a nice central hotel.",4,2012,11,17
232,Breakfast for one,"I had been given a voucher for Wyyn's as a gift, so I decided to have breakfast one morning. I went to the hotel, not as a resident guest and was treated royally nonetheless. Excellent food. When I was told the plate was hot to touch, it certainly was. I breakfasted at my leisure and did not feel 'hurried' by staff which was very nice indeed. It was a very pleasant experience. All staff from the breakfast room to the reception that I met, were courtious and friendly and efficient.",4,2012,11,11
232,Wynn's Hotel Dublin,"Very central, pleasant and accommodating. Breakfast excellent with very good service. Excellent carvery. Planning to take group in 2013. They were very helpful in the planning. Rooms good. Hihjly recommended.",4,2012,11,09
232,Excellent In All Ways!,"We stayed at Wynns on two separate occasions during a recent trip to Ireland. Both times we found excellent service, staff who were actually trying to help us with our needs, breakfast outstanding both with food and service, old world charm at its best.  

The reception staff went out of their way to assist us with luggage and rebooking again with them is a no-brainer. 

We enjoyed an evening meal at a very good price and standard of food was excellent.

We did not have a car so lack of parking was not a problem for us. The location was exactly where we needed to be.

The rooms were large and well stocked and, most importantly, clean.

I would recommend Wynns to anyone wanting to stay in central Dublin.",5,2012,11,05
232,Wonderful stay,"Upon arrival we were friendly welcomed at the reception. All was well taken care of, rooms were fine, beds are a bit small though (140cm width). Breakfast was good, nice variety. Location of the hotel is perfect, almost everythins is within walking distance, busstops just around the corner.
We had a wonderful stay at the Wynn's Hotel. We'll definitely book the Wynn's again when staying in Dublin.",5,2012,11,03
232,Ideal Location,"My wife & I stayed in Wynn's Hotel for one night recently. We found it the ideal location to get around the city. The staff were most helpful. The room was clean & spacious. Our room was at the front of the hotel & the noise from the trams could annoy others but we found it not too disturbing.There is free wi-fi throughout the hotel. We did not dine in the hotel except for breakfast which was lovely with a good selection. We would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to anyone. We liked location, price, cleanliness, staff and athmosphere.",4,2012,11,02
232,Very pleasant stay in Wynns,"Just came back from a pleasant nights stay in Wynns hotel. Was staying with my mother as she had business on Tue morning. We were not too sure of the directions and the pleasant lady on Reception printed us out directions even though she was busy. On check in the man on Reception was very friendly aswell.

Willl def come back again",5,2012,11,02
232,Old world hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Wynn's is a small hotel on Abbey Sreet, two minutes from O'Connell Street (Dublin's main street) and so perfectly siuated for visiting both the north and south side of the city.
The decor is very turn of the century (and I mean 19th to 20th) from the glass awning over the entrance to the dining room and bar.
The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, always finding time to have a little chat with each guest.
We didn't get to eat dinner at the restaurant but the breakfast was really good and served at the table (not your usual buffet-style) This meant that the Irish beakfast was prepared when ordered so freshly cooked, hot and eggs just the way you asked for them.
All in all a hotel which offers excellent value for money. Shall become ""my"" hotel in Dublin",5,2012,10,29
232,An elegant time capsule!,"If you are looking for a glimpse of old world elegance, this may be your place.  With an excellent location on the north side of the River Liffey, access to most things is a breeze.  The luas (tram) stopped practically in front of Wynn's and provided access to either of Dublin's train stations and more.  We found the room to be fairly spacious and it appeared to have been totally remodeled.  It was nice and clean, clean, clean.  There were employees everywhere constantly cleaning and polishing brassworks throughout the hotel.  Our room was on the third floor on the right hand side of the building and it was delightfully quiet.  Towels were fluffy, the pillows great, but the mattress had seen its better day.  (That's the one thing that prevented me from making this a five-circle hotel.)  The lobby, bar, restaurant, and breakfast areas looked cared for, clean, and still represents the best of that era.  (I think the hotel was about 90 years old, but had been on that site for longer {due to fire I believe}.  The breakfast was very good and bountiful.  My bride  and I had several drinks in the bar on the evening of arrival.  One down side, though, is that when we charged our tab it came back in dollars - not euros - which did not favor the traveler.  I made them replace my bill, with euros.",4,2012,10,20
232,A great Olde World  Hotel,"This is a Hotel situated right on the main thoroughfare of the city centre in dublin...One would be forgiven for thinking they had stepped back in times gone by but whilst the feel of this hotel is olde world the atmosphere and service is very much in the now...I did not unfortunatley book a room in his Hotel as they were booked out but I did travel and met a friend there for dinner in their Restaurant.  We met in the Main Lounge Area and were very promptly served and addressed as ""Mam"" and in my case ""Madam"" which was nice.  I could tell that this Hotel and their staff are very comfortable with their customers and the feeling i got was that most of the customers were regulars and good friends with the staff.  There was a lovely homely feel in the bar area.  The restaurant itself was very subtle in decor..retainig very much the Old World charm..The Chefs you can see working in the kitchen area which is very differenbt as I have never seen this in a Hotel Environment before.  The food was good but not i felt of fine dining standard, more like home from home standard..but the quality was excellent.  Our Waitress Fabian..I hope i have spelt this right was just a dream...she was a pure natural with her service.  sometimes you engage with your waitress and you know they are just doing their job...but in  Fabian's case she was, and i know, enjoying her work.  Her Service and conversation were of a 5 star standard.  The Hotel Manager on Duty in the Hotel, Simon was also very attentive with the Guests both in the Bar/Lounge area and in the Restaurant...Staff were all very well presented and i got the feeling that every customer was treated like a long time friend.  Overall I would highly recommend this Hotel and if a website tells you there is no availability..please phone the Hotel directly as they will do their very best to accomodate you.",4,2012,10,19
232,Right in the Heart of Dublin,"Arriving at Wynns, it was a bit of a shock. Where the Valet Parking should have been, there was a tram stop!!
To the rescue came one of the staff who helped unload our luggage and took our car away. A real relief.
The location of Wynns is amazing, being about 100 m from the main street and main bridge over the River. Oh yes, and the open-top buses also start and end near here.
The rooms as can be expected in a City Centre Hotel are not large, but quite adequate, although storing our (small) suitcases was a bit of an issue. Ended up leaving it in the (small) bathroom.
In room WiFi was fast, the room and the bed comfortable and the Full Irish Breakfast, included in the room rate, excellent.
Highly Recommended, if you are visiting Dublin and want to be in walking distance of most attractions including the Temple Bar District.",5,2012,10,18
232,Charming comfortable hotel in a great location,"Found the hotel to be charming and comfortable - had a room on 3rd floor at back of hotel which although small, was spotless.   Had asked for a room at the back of the hotel as other reviews mentioned street noise etc. at front of hotel.   I would mention that there was some sort of noise coming from outside - not sure if it was air conditioning units or boilers - it was a bit annoying but it seemed to be turned off around 10.30 pm but back on again early next morning.   

Had dinner and breakfast at the hotel and found both very good.

Staff were attentive and polite.

Hotel is very central to everything and there is a luas stop outside the hotel.

I would definitely return to this hotel.",4,2012,10,15
232,old world charm,"Having past by on previous trips it was interesting to step inside. The staff were excellent and welcoming. We found the meals excellent. I liked the breakfast choice, have not had ""eggs benedict"" for a long time-delicious"". The rooms were a good size,maybe a little dated but that added to the charm. My only reservation was that at busy times there appeared to be little staff and those that were there looked stressed. I actually walked out of the Scholars Bar having been left for 30mins waiting for service.",4,2012,10,11
232,"Pleasant staff, Great location","The staff was warm and welcoming, always smiling when you enter or exit. We stayed here before and after a group tour and had two different rooms. The rooms had the charm and comfort I associate with Ireland, but don't expect anything elegant or fancy. It is easy to use the hotel as a base to visit all the major sites. It is an easy walk to Temple Bar, the Trinity College area, all the museums, and the literary sites along Parnell. There are a few decent restaurants within walking distance, but you will probably need to go south of the river for most of the better known eateries. Note that rooms on the street may be noisy until the pubs close.",4,2012,10,10
232,Great location & homely meals,Was pleasantly rewarded when I found this gem of a hotel. The staff were helpful and busy. I enjoyed the carvery dinner - felt like a homecooked meal - perfect after so much travelling. The rooms were nice but not outstanding. The tram line is right outside the hotel which I wasn't expecting so there is some noise from that but this didn't bother me during the night. Nice roomy bathroom. Breakfast was great - no waiting for me even though the staff were run off their feet.,4,2012,10,04
232,Wynns hotel Dublin,"Its all about the location at Wynns hotel Dublin.This once elegant old hotel is now showing its age and in need of some T.L.C as the cracks are begining to show.
While the the hotel is convenient for all Dublin has to offer O'Connell street is riddled with undesirables looking  for easy pickings
access to the hotel is via steps and is hard for mobility restricted to reach.
Rooms are ok but dated and rooms at the front suffer from street noise.
Staff try hard but are snowed under.
Breakfast good and plentiful.",3,2012,10,03
232,"a place of ""goodwill""","this is our second time staying at Wynns Hotel ( NOT always easy to get accommodation there due to its popularity)with great ease we got the LUAS from Heuston Station,given a great welcome-- though receptionist sounded non national-- which added to the Dublin ""flavour"".. our early evening meal left NOTHING to be desired...good service with a smile along with amazing food and a fine bottle of wine,,,, after which we set off to see ""THE PLOUGH AND THE STARS"".. Though not at the Abbey (due to renovations) we were treated to a stunning performance at Belvedere College..Being the opening night we just had one small complaint ie the ""dreaded deaths of 1916 took far too long !! we returned to Wynns ON FOOT at 23hrs though had been advised to get a taxi.... but only about 3 or 4 were available..we felt a little uncomfortable but stayed very close till we arrived at hotel and welcomed back by the porter.. Breakfast was amazing..my husband had ""egg benedict"" whilst i opted for the traditional irish one..  ONn day 2 we took the DART to Bray..passing by delightful places of beauty..we actually wern'nt totally aware of the NOTEWORTHY place we were visiting---- THE HOMELAND OF KATIE TAYLOR... we thoroughly enjoyed a long stroll on the well kept promenade after which we enjoyed chilled wine and a light seafood salad... we were blessed with beautiful sunny weather while in Dublin,Staying at Wynns made it all the sunnier....THANKS TO ALL THE STAFF
  C A..",4,2012,10,02
232,Very convenient and lovely staff,"This hotel is very convenient to O'Connell Street (shopping, bars, restaurants) with a Luas tram stop right in front of the hotel.  The welcome we received was fantastic and gracious.  The food in the restaurant was great - but beware it gets very crowded at breakfast (need more servers).  Dinner was equally great.  If you are looking for a centrally located hotel - Wynns is an excellent choice.",4,2012,10,02
232,Location location location,"Its all about the location at Wynns.Staff try hard but seem to be snowed under. The hotel is getting on a bit (aren't we all) and the cracks are begining show.rooms at the front suffer from street noise.
Elderly guests struggle with the steps at the front and the heavy room doors.
Breakfast was good and plentiful 
 There is something about this hotel that makes you overlook the shortcomings. It has a certain charm,like Dublin its self",3,2012,10,02
232,Mahogany & Brass setting,"When I told my cab driver I was staying at Wynn's, he said, ""In de old days, dat was known as the priests' and nuns' hotel"".  Presumably they chose it for reasons of discretion as then Lower Abbey Street would have been quiet.  Now the streamlined trams of the Red line glide silently along it.
The tram stop is right outside the hotel.  Walk a dozen paces to the left on leaving the hotel and you are on O'Connell Street.  Walk thirty paces to the right and you are at the doors of the Abbey theatre.  This hotel could scarcely be more central.
As other reviews have stated, this is a traditional hotel. Some tiffany glass on the outside canopy, polished wood inside, thick carpeting, a panelled lift says it all. The bar is the sort of bar you would expect to find in Dublin.
The staff are friendly and obliging.  But you would expect that of the Irish, of course, except that many of the staff are actually from Eastern Europe.
My room was a twin room, very comfortable although may be on the small side.  It had solid furniture in the form of a large wardrobe, desk and fireside chair,  There was a small wall-mounted television. 
The bathroom was a strange - almost bizarre - mixture of old and not so modern.  There was a large oval acrylic bath with jacuzzi fittings (about 1980) but the brass taps (faucets) were from the 1920s. Still everything was clean, the water was hot and towels were fluffy and dry.  
The restaurant at the front of the hotel is in the grand style.  Two aspects of breakfast I can commend: the availability of hot porridge and the delivery of tea in a good sized teapot.
As an old-fashioned sort of chap myself, Wynn's suited me fine.",4,2012,10,01
232,Traditional hotel in a bustling area,"My husband and I spent our last night in Dublin at Wynn's, on the busy north side of the Liffey River (at the beginning of our Ireland vacation, we had spent four nights at a small townhouse type hotel at the elegant St. Stephen's Green). It was good to experience both. Wynn's is a 19th century, traditional hotel that is kept up well, with very nice, accommodating staff and a fine breakfast. We had a larger double-deluxe room on a high floor, which insulated us from the street, which is busy. From this location, we were able to walk to many historical sites. We had an excellent experience at Wynn's.",4,2012,09,26
232,Both Location and service are excellent,"First time in Dublin for conference and experienced a very good 5-nights stay in this hotel. Both location and service are excellent. In the city center, easy to go everywhere. The double room (bed) is a bit small, but quite comfortable.  Great breakfast as well.",4,2012,09,24
232,Great location and friendly service,"The hotel has the best location you can hope for while visiting Dublin and had a really good price. You can walk to many of the attractions and the hop on and off tours have a stop right around the corner. My room was small as I expected but had everything I needed including a safe and toiletries. It was in decent shape and appeared clean. I didn`t have a view so it was quiet which is preferable since the neighborhood is very lively. Breakfast is included and is solid with choices of full or continental items. The staff was very friendly and helpful in regards to anything I needed. You can request breakfast before the official start time and I did that once but things weren`t quite ready on time. So I would suggest to allow for potential delays when you make the request. Overall, I would greatly recommend it.",4,2012,09,20
232,Good value and location,"My wife and I just spent two nights at Wynn's on a short trip to Ireland.  We took the train in from Cork, arriving at Heuston Station.  The LUAS tram picks up at the station and dropps off literally in front of the hotel (and it's very quiet, no worries!).  The hotel itself, though claiming to be recently remodeled, wasn't restored to A+ condition.  Still, the rooms are clean and have nice amenities.  The breakfasts were pretty good, and the staff is as helpful as possible.  The one thing that gave me pause was when they hadn't heard of a couple restaurants in Dublin that get a high ranking here.  Really, they haven't heard of O'Neil's?  The north side of the Liffy doesn't have nearly as much to offer, but this hotel is so close as to make no difference.  You're 5min from Temple Bar, for example.  Overall I'd definitely recommend, but choose for the value and location.",4,2012,09,19
232,My Favourite Hotel in Dublin :),"Just back from another wonderful stay in Wynn's Hotel, Dublin. My daughter and I stay in Dublin at least 3 to 4 times a year and we always try to stay at Wynn's if it's available. We love it because of the olde world charm, the friendliest staff in Ireland, the comfortable rooms, the fantastic breakfast ( waiter service and very relaxing ). Also, being a smoker, there is no problem here as they have plenty of smoking rooms :) The location is excellent, just off O'Connell Street and the Luas stops just outside....which is a big plus if you're going to The O2, as it brings you right there. Wynn's is the ideal location for shopping, sightseeing etc., in Dublin.......you won't get a more central hotel than this.......AND you won't get a better "" Cead Mile Failte"" anywhere else in Ireland. What more can I say...........I ♥ WYNN'S ;-))",5,2012,09,16
232,"Nice hotel, conveniently located","A nice, majestic building, just of Connell Street and only a bridge away from Temple Bar, Wynn's is a nice hotel with a nice bar and more than friendly staff.
Rooms are clean but not always very big. Breakfast is okay if you like cooked breakfast, but very little options if you just wanted a slice of bread with some ham.
Some remarks: my sister and I both paid the same price, but my sister's room was more than twice as big as mine, the complementary wireless internet has no coverage in the bar and upon checkout they forgot to deduct the advance I paid when making the booking (luckily I checked).
But all in all a nice place to stay.",4,2012,09,16
232,Pleasant stay,"We visited Ireland in September/October 2011.  We started our trip in Dublin and stayed at the Wynn's Hotel.  Convenient location to most sights in Dublin.  Very clean, very friendly staff, lovely Full Irish breakfast,  I recommend highly.",4,2012,09,10
232,Just regular,"Just regular VERY IRISH hotel with nice location, quite simple but clean rooms.
In the adjacent building there is a very famous pab, that is recommended for visiting.
All the sight are in walking distance from this hotel.",4,2012,09,04
232,"Location, service, comfort","We had 3 nights in August. Everything was great. Yes, the lift us slow but the shower was great! Breakfasts were a treat. The service was friendly and helpful ( especially when I left something behind and they posted it on for me) we  were in 524 and the windows opened! Fresh air !",5,2012,08,30
232,Loved It!,"The breakfast was awesome, service outstanding and the room was comfortable.  Hotel was very clean and I rested quietly.  I will agree with some of the previous post, electrical outlets in the bathroom were sparse...lacking is more like it.  However, it is typical for European accomodations. 

Location was near major areas of interest and easily accessible to buses and rails.  

For the price, I would recommend to everyone and stay again myself.",5,2012,08,29
232,change of ownership has destroyed a good hotel,"rooms with sockets behind heavy furniture or in nonsensical place like at ankle height at room entry door
clean and tidy 
some great staff like actual dubliners who i remember from previous years visit and some downright rude foreign workers 

restaurant serving microwave fresh salmon at 15 a plate ,wormholes in my baby potatoes 
and in my mothers 

green beans that were so overcooked they were mush

once at lunchtime i returned a soup to an irish chef and asked him if he would oblige me by pureeing or sieving as my mother has a glottal swallowing problem

it lust came back in a new dish colder with half of it missing and had neither been sieved nor pureed 

i returned it to the chef and that was that ..no offer to sort problem , return money and definitely no apology

if you must stay there ..avoid eating there and you might enjoy your stay !",1,2012,08,27
232,A real city centre gem!,"Yes, the hotel building is rather old and yes, the furnishings may be considered a tad old fashioned by some guests, but my wife and I thought the furnishings were totally in sympathetic accord with the building which is centrally located a few paces from the main thoroughfare of O'Connell Street and conveniently close to bus stops. The LUAS (tram) also stops outside  the hotel. The hotel also has good old fashioned values in relation to courtesy and service.  Our bedroom faced onto busy Abbey Street, but noise levels were no better or worse than those experienced elsewhere in a city centre hotel.  The housekeeping was of the highest order with immaculately clean bedding and towels.  We ate both breakfast and dinner on most days and found that the portions provided real value for money.  The only rather small criticism which prevents an 'excellent' score, is down to the fact that side dish vegetables served at dinner had so obviously been pre-cooked and reheated thus detracting from the quality of the otherwise very good food. Would we stay there again?  You bet.!  Wonderful staff, great location, lovely old building with a fascinating history.  Thank you Wynn's Hotel for a wonderful break.  I would not stay anywhere else in Dublin.",4,2012,08,18
232,"Perfect location, Nice Hotel, Great Price","This hotel is located right on the LUAS light rail city transit system and close to the Dublin Airport Bus stop, right in Dublin City Center. It is an old fashioned hotel, but very charming if you appreciate that type of decor. The room was very, very, small room, with a TV screen no larger than my laptop. I was solo which was no problem, but two people with luggage, good luck. 

Roberta at reception was simply marvelous; warm, friendly and charming. Just radiates so much personality and friendliness.",4,2012,08,16
232,Superb choice,"I stayed here for a city break weekend with my Mum in August.   We loved the hotel and couldn’t have been more pleased that we had chosen it.

Dublin seemed very busy, but the hotel was an oasis of calm.  We found the reception staff very helpful and friendly, really welcoming and more than happy to look after our bags on the day we arrived and on the day we left.

The breakfast was superb, very good choice of hot food cooked to order, generous quantities, and a good selection of cold buffet items.  The staff were very courteous to my Mum who struggled to hear them and struggled to find food she liked.  We felt very cared for.

The only downside was a very rude barman who frankly let the hotel down – all the other staff were so nice.  I found it very surprising that they would employ just one rude person – maybe he hasn’t been there long.  All the other bar staff were nice, and it was a good place to while away our last hour before returning to the airport.

The room was perfectly fine – single glazed, I think, but not too noisy (although I’m quite a good sleeper – the tram might have kept others awake) and with tea and coffee making facilities provided.

We used the airlink bus from the airport and back, and the stop is conveniently close (and the bus driver will tell you which stop to use, if you ask).  It cost €10 when we went in 2012.  The location is great, just off O’Connell Street, very handy for bus stops, the tram, and all the sights.  There are also plenty of places to go out to eat in the area (the hotel has a very limited restaurant menu).

We would definitely stay here on any return trip to Dublin, I’m sure it could not be improved upon.",5,2012,08,16
232,"Great hotel, service and location","This hotel was great, I would stay here again if I was coming to Dublin.  The location cannot be beat, right in the city's center, so it is walking distance to anywhere you want to go.  The staff was friendly and the breakfast each morning was a delight.  We really enjoyed starting each morning with a nice, hot breakfast in the lovely dining room.  The rooms were clean and the bathroom was nice, we were given a free upgrade to our room!  Great stay, good value, great hotel, wonderful city.",5,2012,08,15
232,"Old-fashioned, good value for solo travelers","I stayed at Wynn's Hotel because I was traveling by myself and they offered a big discount for single occupancy. My room was small (like, it was a bed with a narrow pathway arround the bed), but comfortable. The fittings and decor were old-fashioned but seemed clean and reasonably well-maintained. 

I stayed at Wynn's in July, and the rooms are not air-conditioned; the first night I found the room a bit stuffy, but I think that was because I accidentally left the towel warmer on all night long (blame it on the jet lag!). Although the room across the hall seemed to have the TV blaring whenever I was out in the hall, I couldn't hear it from inside my room. Since I had the window open, I did have some street noise drifting up (including what I think must have been someone power-washing an assortment of stainless-steel kitchen implements), but for being so centrally located it was pretty quiet. 

Another minor issue was that there was only one usable power outlet in the room, and this was located behind the nightstand about three inches from the floor. There was also a non-UK/Ireland plug with a lamp plugged into it, and a shaver outlet in the bathroom. The TV and the kettle were hard-wired into the wall, an interesting touch. 

Breakfast was excellent, with lots of choices (full Irish or continental), and when I checked out early on my second morning (technically before the breakfast room was open) they insisted I at least have some coffee and continental breakfast before I left (sadly I was too early for the delicious sausages). 

A Dubliner friend told me that the area around the hotel has a bit of a reputation as a haven for heroin addicts, but her husband didn't think it was as bad as all that, and I didn't really notice. The location is just off O'Connell Street, close to the bridge, within easy walking distance of most of Dublin's sights.

I would absolutely stay at Wynn's again and would recommend it to others.",4,2012,08,13
232,trevor should get a medal,"we stayed at this hotel for four days last week, first the breakfast GREAT a good breakfast sets me up for the day and this did thanks to Trevor what a man nothing was to much trouble for him.thanks to the guys who parked my car well done,the food,we had a meal in the restaurant on our last night and we really enjoyed it.Now the room,yes it is small we asked for a quiet room and we got one at the back should of gone for the front and a little larger,we had a wardrobe and a desk only no drawers to put our smalls in ie socks and underwear it was clean but the bathroom let it down it was dark as was the room,the shower had mold at the bottom of the tiles this could and should of been picked up and sorted sooner it wouldn't of took much to sort out room (383) But on the whole this is a very good hotel and I would come back again and agian,for the staff the service and the irish breakfasts and lastly the irish poeple wonderful thanks for a great visit.",4,2012,08,12
232,"Perfect location, lovely hotel","our room was upgraded free as it was my birthday which was a nice touch. Hotel was decent size, nice ensuite. Breakfast was very good, continental and full irish.
Great location- just off O'Connell Street.
free parking also included which was a big bonus in the city centre.
Would stay here again and recommend to friends.",5,2012,08,12
232,excellent hotel for central Dublin,"We have stayed at Wynns for the last 5 years and have always found it to be an excellent hotel. It is ideal for sight seeing. The breakfasts are good, the rooms and hotel are clean and of a good standard. ",4,2012,08,10
232,Loved our stay at Wynn's Hotel,"We were staying at the Wynn's hotel on Saturady night, August Bank Holiday. The Hotel is ideally situated in the city centre of Dublin and very close to tourist attractions and shops. 
Loved the breakfast and friendly staff, specially big thank you to Simon and Rorry (managers) for their hospitality! Guys, you are BRILLIANT!!!",5,2012,08,07
232,I stayed at Wynn's for my first visit to Dublin.,"I chose Wynn's hotel because of it's location to all the places I wanted to visit.  For example Trinity College (book of Kells), St. Stephen's Green, Dublin Castle, National Museum of Ireland (Bog people) and Temple Bar are all walking distance from Wynn's.  The room I booked was spacious and very comfortable and I loved eating my breakfast in the elegant dinning room.  Local's stay at this hotel so that is a good sign.  The highlight of my visit was taking the tour at the Kilmainham goal built in 1792 and to get part of the way there I caught the tram which was just near the hotel.  I would be happy to book this hotel again.",5,2012,08,04
232,"Regal hotel at affordable price, excellent stay","We got more than we thought by stopping at wynns. The hotel is a magnificent traditional regal hotel just off oconnel street. Superb location, clean, staff were very friendly and help. 

The bar was cool with a good range of beers, and breakfast was amazing. Cooked to order with quality produce.

The only negative for me, and I haven't marked them down for this was the bed. It was one of the old style beds with a bolster at the bottom, which isnt great when yr 6'4""....  However, the bed was extremely comfy.... 

Great hotel and I wouldnt hesitate to book here again...",5,2012,07,31
232,"Excellent, Friendly Hotel in the Heart of Dublin.","This hotel is a family run Hotel , small, very central and very friendly. The receptionist (2) were fantastic, efficient and very welcoming. Doorman was also helpful in storing our bags as our room wasn't quite ready, only had to wait 10 mins and all was ready. Our room was at the back of the property in a quiet area, which we asked for. The room was a little small but we managed quite well.. The bathroom was an unexpected surprise with a huge spa bath. The hotel was very clean, quaint and the perfect spot to stay.
Out the door and a few metres and you are on the main street of Dublin O'connel Street, plenty of food outlets and shopping. Within good walking distance ( 5-10 mins) of Temple Street and bars. Hop on Hop off Bus 5 mins away. Luas right outside.
The restaurant also had wonderful friendly staff and the food was excellent and plentyful.
I would definately recommend this hotel and would stay here again.",5,2012,07,29
232,An Excellent 9 Nights At Wynns,"We have just spent a consecutive 9 nights at Wynns and it was simply fantastic! We had 2 twin rooms on the second floor near the function room, facing the street and over looking the LUAS tramline.  Being in the heart of the city it was not surprising that you could hear the sounds of the city, but with the windows closed it was not enough to disturb our sleep, except on one occasion when a young man was have a heated argument with his girlfriend on the street below (and that was at the weekend).

Over the course of our stay we sampled everything on the breakfast menu from an Irish Breakfast to Kippers and all our special requests were met  - I doubt we ordered exactly what was on the menu on any occasion, but the staff happily attended to every request.  We dinned at different times ranging for 7:30 to 10:00 and while it can take a while longer to get seated later in the morning, the food was always excellent.  BTW, the hotel does advise you that it can take longer to be served later in the morning, so no surprises there.

We eat in the restaurant on several occasions and also sampled the bar food on a couple of evenings.  Again the food was excellent, well presented and more than we could eat on many occasions.  The restaurant is not open every evening, but again this was pointed out to us when checking in and the bar food more than made up for the lack of restaurant on those occasions.

On arrival at the hotel we asked for quiet rooms and it was explained to us that rooms at the back of the hotel were quiet, but small and so we opted for the front rooms instead.  We were told that there would be a 21st party in the function room on the saturday night and that there would be music until 01:30 am, so it might be a bit loud as we were near the function room.  However this did not prove to be the case, yes you could hear the sounds if you really tried, but  we were long gone to sleep before the party ended.  

Our rooms were spacious with plenty of room for our luggage.  The beds were nicely made up and there was spare bedding in the wardrobe if needed.  The bathrooms were spotless, as were the bedrooms and I'd be very hard pressed to find a fault with them.

And finally the staff, they were absolutely brilliant!  They could not have been more friendly and helpful and really they went out of their way to make our stay an enjoyable one.  I use a cane and have some difficult walking, so it was nice to find that the porters were thoughtful enough to have the elevator waiting for me when they saw me entering the hotel - the little things count!  On a similar note, the staff in the bar alway offered to bring my tray to the table when dining there, fetch drinks from the bar for me and so on.

Thanks for everything, you made our holiday!",5,2012,07,26
232,honesty at the Wynn Hotel,"I was recently traveling with a group from Casterbridge Tours and we stayed at the Wynn for three nights.  The hotel was in an ideal location and had a great deal of charm.  We all had favorable comments about our extensive breakfasts as well as excellent dinners.

What really stood out about this hotel to me was the honesty of the staff.  I had used the safe in the room to secure my passport as well as some extra currency in both dollars and euros.  On our last day there I retrieved the passport but not my black wallet.  I realized I had misplaced it upon my return to the USA.  I simply thought I had left it on a counter someplace.  Our local tour guide informed the two of us that had stayed in the room that a wallet had been found and asked if it belonged to either.  Of course I was delighted to find it.  I wasn't sure of the amount that I had left behind but had guesstimated.  Our local representative put me in touch with the Wynn hotel and arrangements were made for the wallet to be sent to me.  I am happy to say that it arrived today with cash in tow, even down to the US coins!  I think that is exceptional customer service and honesty!",5,2012,07,24
232,Perfect place to stay in the heart of Dublin,"I have been bringing small tour groups of Australians to Dublin for the past six years and we always stay at Wynn's Hotel Dublin. It is an iconic hotel with an elegant restaurant and a vibrant bar. Rooms are comfortable and tastefully furnished. The other great feature of Wynn's Hotel is the wonderful staff. At all times I have found them to be friendly, helpful and truly professional, whether it be at reception, in the restaurant, or at the bar.
As well as all this the hotel's location is just superb. There is a luas [tram] stop right out front and less than a minute from O'Connell street. Other major attractions such as the General Post Office, Trinity College, Temple Bar and Grafton Street are only a few minutes walk away.
I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2012,07,23
232,WYNNS,Wynns hotel has a good central location.The valet parking was great and we were able to have our car brought to door when we needed it.The rooms were comfortable and breakfast was good.We would definitely stay at wynns again.,4,2012,07,22
232,Very convenient,"Stayed a nite in Dublin and wanted to be close enough to either walk or take the rail (Lucas) to see the sites. This hotel was in the ideal location.  It was less than a block from the bus you take from the airport to get into the city (bus 747) and it is steps from the Lucas (rail) to get to other parts of the city.  The city center (Trinity College, the National Museums, etc) are a quick walk over the bridge.  We were on the 4th floor, front and it was very quiet.  Breakfast is included and has a nice selection.  Would stay here again.  Staff very friendly.  Our flight arrived early so we just checked our luggage with the desk and headed into the city center.",4,2012,07,19
232,wynns hotel,"I recently returned from a trip to Ireland and I began my first night  and my last two nights at Wynn's hotel.  I made my reservation over the phone and changed it many times and I wasn't sure of my plans. They couldn't have made it easier.
The hotel is situated right down town, I walked everywhere I needed to go. The Luas, Irish  rail system stops right outside the door.  The bus from Dublin Airport stops on O'Connell St. just up the street from Wynn's.
This hotel was very clean, which is top priority for me.  Security is visible both in and out and since I was traveling solo, this too was important. They had a party going on on the Saturday night, but the noise didn't bother me.  It was not too loud that I couldn't sleep. The price of this hotel is so reasonable since it included full breakfast.
The receptionist Ann-Marie Mulligan  was so friendly, sincere and kind. Always a big smile and hallo when I was coming or going.
I grew up in Dublin and remember Wynn's as the meeting place for people coming up from the country for the day. It had charm back then and I can honestly say it hasn't lost it. 
The previous  year I stayed in a hotel up near Temple Bar, much more expensive, but it really didn't hold a candle to this one. I would definitely recommend this hotel",5,2012,07,19
232,Good value hotel,I stayed in Wynn's Hotel as I was in Dublin for the weekend and wanted a central location which didn't cost the earth. Wynn's fitted the bill nicely. Comfy bed and a good breakfast in the morning .,3,2012,07,19
232,Where people care,"My wife and I spent the last 4 days of our two-week visit of Ireland in Dublin - we stayed at the Wynn's Hotel. Our first impression was not great, given that you can not park directly at the door of the hotel to unload baggage and the room was quite ordinary. However, over the next four nights, we came to appreciate the centrality of the location, the hidden splendour of the place (opened in 1845) and above all, the absolute gracious and courteous help afforded by all staff - receptionists, porters, chambermaids, restaurant waiters, barmen. We had an early morning flight and the breakfast room was open (before 6:00 AM) and available (to us and others) with a nice cold buffet and tea and coffee. Rooms were clean and quiet, apart from the odd street sounds one can expect in most hotels in Europe. Excellent return for the price paid - but above all, the people working there make you feel at home and go all out. We recommend it highly!

232,Missleading information,"I have recently returned from my trip to Europe. I had selected my hotels through booking.com. But I also go to the hotel web page to asure myself that it is a place that I would like to stay. My priorities for selecting a hotel are as follow, #1 cleanliness, #2 safety area, #3 respectful staff. This hotel was probably many years ago a very good hotel, but unfortunately the hotel was not kept up as they advertise. The cleanliness of the hotel is all superficial. The matress had huge yellow stains. The bedspreads were probably 50 years old. The rooms are very very small and so are their bathrooms. The waitress and roomservice personel were very nice but as for the administration personel not pleasant at all. The location was very good and safe to walk. Very noisy. They advertise quiet rooms, but it is not true. I asked for a non-smoking room as I have asthma, however the room smelled like smoke despite the non-smoking sign. As a solution, they brought in a machine to clear the air, which barely worked. There was no apology whatsoever for this inconvenience.",2,2012,07,16
232,Hotel with real character in a great location,"Real old world character, fantastic location, and they whisk your car away & park it for you. Very noisy at weekends - didn't bother me, but it might annoy some. Will definitely stay here again. ",4,2012,07,15
232,Abbey visit,"If you are planning to visit Dublin and need someplace close to the Abbey you couldnt get closer than this.  Stayed here with my mum when we went to see The House recently.  The hotel was clean, central, with a good breakfast.  We were very happy with the choice we made and thought it was excellent value for central Dublin.  In saying that we booked a twin room however I found the room very small and the twin beds were not separated nor could they be.  I like my space so I didnt like that the beds as they could not be parted as there was no room to separate them.  Lucky I was with my mam, but still i would rather space.  i would have booked a double if I had wanted to sleep with someone next to me.  Just a tip so you can see if they have bigger twin rooms.",4,2012,07,14
232,Dont book function room,"I booked function room for a party im having 3 months ago , i gave my name and phone number  to the manager and he wrote it down in  the hotels reservetion book ,,, The other day i went into hotel to finalise everyting and pay the money for the party I COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT I SAW, when the manager opened the reservation book my name was removed from the book and it was replaced with another persons name,,,,,, i was fuming ,, The managar i was talking to did not seem to give a damn ,,,, i found him to be very very rude,,,, and not a bit helpful he said he would ring me on 3 ocassions and i am still waiting 2 weeks later,,,, so people you have been warned  ,,,,,,,,  MICKEY MOUSE COULD RUN THIS HOTEL BETTER  WHAT A SHAMBLES",1,2012,07,12
232,Don't stay here,"The room smelled like smoke but stated it was a non smoking room. The room was loud from outside traffic. Also, music from a banquet could be heard through the floors on a Wednesday night. They state music will be heard through the hotel on Friday and Saturday.  Stay somewhere else.  Don't listen to he high travel advisory rating.  I am in the room now wishing I stayed elsewhere.  ",2,2012,07,11
232,LOVELY HOTEL,"Stayed two nights in june. Excellent location, friendly staff and clean! We had four rooms,two that faced the front and two faced internally, front  ones larger, the internal ones were smaller and darker, but not small enough to bother us!  Very good choice for breakfast, all well presented. Fourth stay at this hotel and would recommend and hope to return.Dublin is a great city - a lot of it able to be visited on foot.",5,2012,07,03
232,Feels like home!,We just returned from a vacation to Ireland and the south of France. We stayed at the Wynn's Hotel in Dublin. The staff was exceptionally friendly and accommodating. My sister left her shoe behind and they made sure to deliver it to her on the return trip through Dublin - a testimony to their excellent service! Although the weather was pretty bad during our stay we found it difficult to leave the Wynn's for the sunny Cote d'Azur. We travel to Europe often and like to fly through Dublin to spend a few days. We now feel as though we have a home away from home at the Wynn's Hotel; can't wait to go back. We also had the same issue as EMcGruff; Aer Lingus transatlantic flights usually arrive very early so you may want to book an extra night to be able to sleep off the jet lag when you arrive.,5,2012,07,03
232,Absolutely Perfect Hotel,"Absolutely perfect hotel. The minute we arrived we knew we had made the right choice.
On arrival the car was parked for us as the car park was a small distance from the hotel.
The hotel is in a perfect spot, it is close enough to be a short walk from the busy part of the city.
The staff are VERY helpful and go out of their way to make you feel welcome.
The room was lovely, nice and big, lovely on sweat with shower.
A very comfortable and clean hotel. We had 2 rooms and were here for one night on a bed and breakfast rate and the service and quality of food at breakfast was without fault. We did stay for an evening meal and that was without question perfect.
We stayed in a front facing suite overlooking the main road and there was some slight early morning noise from the passing traffic.",5,2012,06,29
232,Have recommended to anyone staying in Dublin,"We stayed for one night on May 17. I only realized a few days before that my friend was arriving so early in the day from Boston that it might have been wise to book an extra night so that he could just collapse as soon as he arrived. Not to worry - Wynn's is on the job even at 6:30 in the morning! We were led to a sitting area and given a fantastic, hot cup of tea until breakfast was ready – and the breakfast was delicious. The staff couldn’t be nicer either - we were told to check back at ten and there might be a room available. Sure enough, two hours later we were checked into the most beautiful room imaginable, fireplace, sitting area, just lovely. And they even gave us a room on the top floor at the back (I had asked based on tips here on Trip Advisor). We loved everything – the pub, the breakfast, the dinner, the people, the room, the old-fashioned charm. I have recommended Wynn’s to everyone in my family in Ireland and friends here if an opportunity arises for a Dublin getaway. I will definitely be back, p.g..",5,2012,06,24
232,great location in city center,"Stayed here with my 2 teenage daughter's for a shopping trip in the city,we were made feel very welcome by the staff,would highly recommend as it was great value for money also.I would stay here again.",5,2012,06,19
232,Good value and walking distance to many places,"The staff here is very nice and helpful. I had reserved a Superior room and had requested a quieter room at the back. When we checked in, they told us that they didn't have any Superior rooms on the back but they had a Superior room on the 5th floor and a Standard room on the back and they were holding both rooms for me and I could look at both and choose. I choose the Superior room on the 5th floor and it wasn't too noisy the first two nights. The third night was the Friday might of a holiday weekend and it was much noisier. 

The rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable and the shower good (inside a jacuzzi tub). Both the room and the bathroom were large. There were at least 6 empty and easily accessible outlets in the room which is nice if you have ever unplugged lamps or crawled under a desk to charge your phone or camera. The room had a safe and complimentary coffee and tea. 

Breakfast was included in the room rate and it consisted of cold cereal, yogurt, breads, and juice. They also brought coffee or tea to the table along with toast and your choice of hot breakfast items (porridge, full Irish breakfast, eggs Benedict, or goat cheese on crumpets).  The man who worked in the breakfast room was very pleasant and extremely hard working. 

The location was by a red line Luas stop, around the corner from airport bus stop on O'Connell street, and across the street from a Collins Day Tour stop. O'Connell Bridge was a block away and Trinity College a short walk. 

On the way to Trinity College is a wonderful restaurant called Gallaher and Co. ",4,2012,06,18
232,Very friendly hotel,"The staff at Wynns were exceptional. My room was comfortable and and the breakfasts were of a good standard. There were a few areas that would have benefited from re-decoration but this was outweighted by the lovely atmosphere, clean facilities and excellent staff. I would definately stay here again.",5,2012,06,15
232,Rita Mendes Wonderful time @ Wynn´s Hotel,I would like to congratulate the service in this hotel. IÂ´ve been at Wynn`s from 6 to 10 June.People were so kind and thoughtful that were like friends not staff. I will recomend this hotel to all my friends and if I visit Dublin again I Â´ll definitively stay at WynnÂ´s. Great Time! Great City! Wonderful people! Thanks a lot!,5,2012,06,14
232,Central and staff were excellent,"only stayed for one night in the hotel. was very easy to get to from Connolly station via the Luas got dropped of right outside the hotel. staff were very helpful, welcoming and nothing was to much hassle. our room was ready for us on arrival and there was no waiting about. they were very clean rooms and the bathroom ESP the bath and shower were great (had 3 showers it was that good lol) the breakfast was very nice and there was a good variety of different things to eat and drink. the hotel is very central and was within walking distance of everything we were looking for and we were able to get the Luas to the o2 arena for the concert that i was in dublin for.
overall excellent and would definitely recommend it to anyone and i will use this hotel again.

thanks for a great night",5,2012,06,13
232,Friendly Hotel in Ideal Position,"Wynns is a charming and traditional hotel very well located just off O'Connell Street so ideal for Temple Bar and lots of local bars.  The Luas pases right outside the door and runs direct to the O2 for those attending concerts as we were.  Whilst our room, at the back on 2nd floor, was a little small and definitely too warm this did not spoil our stay.  The room and bathroom were both very clean and the bed comfortable.  Breakfast, cooked to order, was excellent.  What really makes this hotel though is the staff who are friendly and helpful.  As an example of this, the barman was only too happy to arrange sandwiches on our return at 11.45pm as well as offering advice on which beer was best.  Reception, kitchen staff, waiters and porters were all equally helpful and pleasant. We would definitely stay again.",4,2012,06,11
232,"Really Good Location, Good Hotel","Just back from a weekend break at this Hotel , really Good Location for exploring Dublin, nice Hotel, Good room and Very Nice Helpful Staff. We were in room 247 nice size, good bed to.
We stayed B&B so we can't comment on the food but Breakfast was good. Would stay there again, no problem.",4,2012,06,11
232,perfect place for the Crack,We have stayed at the Wynn's twice now and can't say a bad word about it. The food is excellent the decor and rooms very good and the Guiness in the bare excellent.,5,2012,06,11
232,We'd definitely go back,"Very central hotel, great position for shopping and just across the bridge from Temple Bar. The staff were all polite, helpful and friendly. Getting to the hotel is difficult if you're driving - we decided to return our hire car and get a taxi after we'd driven round the block a couple of times!  Our room was on the 5th floor so we had a view across to O'Connell Street and as we were high up we weren't bothered by any noise from the street below. I think the rooms on the 5th floor are slightly smaller but we still had ample space. There was a small damp area on the ceiling which could do with touching up, it would make a big difference to the look of the room.  The bathroom was large and exceptionally clean - we loved the jacuzzi bath after a long day sightseeing.  There's a safe in the room, there's also a hairdryer but it's in the bathroom which isn't ideal.  I took my own hairdryer but there's no socket near a mirror.  The bed was extremely comfortable and we slept really well.  Breakfast was cooked to order and although it appeared limited (for veggies in particular) they were happy to take orders for a variation on the menu. The gates were shut when we returned in the evenings but there was always someone there to let us in - there were a few dodgy characters around but we didn't find them a problem.  The hotel and furnishings are rather old fashioned but that is part of its charm and we would definitely stay here again.",4,2012,06,09
232,"Great location, good value for money, excellent staff!","Hotel is within easy walking distance of main shopping and bar/restaurant areas, two shops for ""snacks"" (mini marts) directly opposite the hotel, loads of good pubs within a few minutes walk. Tram stop virtually outside the door, DART station (trains to the coast) within 5-10 minutes easy walk. Excellent base for a city break.

Accommodation is very good - safe, clean and cosy hotel, would have been happy to stay here as a lone female. 

Hotel staff all, without exception, superb - very helpful and friendly, they put staff at many 5 star hotels to shame. If you need any help at all ref. transport, recommended restaurants, attractions etc., ask any of the staff and they will go out of their way to help you.

Hotel interior is a little tired but is clean and comfortable. Some rooms at the front (particularly above the function suites) may be noisy, however, the staff do warn you if there is a function and, if so, what time it will finish. Kettle and tea/coffee provided in the room plus smoking rooms are available on request.

Being very picky, the cooked breakfast is perhaps a little mean portion-wise but, for the price, can not complain. Also, no power point at the mirror in the room (unfortunately not that unusual) so take a portable mirror.

Dublin itself was a little disappointing – the economic crisis in Éire is very apparent, from roadside beggars (worse than in London) to “pop up” street stalls selling washing powder(!), it can feel unsafe at times, even in the busy areas. Meanwhile, the investment in, for example, the transport system and the restoration of public buildings is very noticeable – EU money at work. Whilst it is important in any city to remain vigilant, it feels more so in Dublin – maybe unfair but it is how I felt. However, the genuine people you meet could not be more welcoming – very strange dichotomy. 

Glad we visited but would not return to Dublin. If I had to, would be happy to return to the Wynn’s.",4,2012,06,08
232,Nice lhotel in great location,"Our family stayed here and thought it was very nice.  Actually wished we had stayed there all 3 nights in Dublin.  

Everyone made us feel very welcome.  They were very helpful.  The ladies at the front desk and the gentleman at the bar were very warm and friendly.

We drove into Dublin and they parked our rental car in the carpark. They had space in the carpark, so they let us keep it there until late the evening we checked out at NO extra charge!!!! (Very nice option since I have no idea where we would have parked in Dublin)  

The rooms were nice, we couldn't figure out the air conditioning, but it wasn't a big deal.  The bathrooms were fair size and no one in my family really had any complaints.

Breakfast was good.

We had no complaints about noise, slept like babies.......

This would be a place I would recommend without hesitation.  It's very close walking distance into Dublin.  The tour buses stop literally at the end of the block.  Lots of food nearby, 5 minute walk to Temple Bar area.",4,2012,06,04
232,What a trip!,"Where do I begin?  We drove into Dublin with our rental car just after lunch and it was a nightmare.  No place to park.  Trying to look at GPS, maps, etc.  The hotel put the porter on the phone and was listening to him, too.  He told us to turn left at the next street.  I asked if that was Beresford Street and he said yes.  Only it wasn't.  So we turned onto Beresford St.  He got really upset.  He told us to stay where we were and he would come and get us which he did.  He told my companion to get in the back seat and he drove us over to the hotel!  When my companion told him he was close to the wall he said ""just don't talk""!  I had to laugh.  He never spoke to us again even though we tipped him for what he had done for us.  The hotel is adequate somewhat.  Our room's shower was broken and I had to hold the shower head between my knees between soaping up.  I liked the room's layout and didn't want to move but they moved us to a room just like we had but with a working shower.  It took about 5 minutes to get the temperature of the water to my liking and the a/c leaked.  They said they weren't prepared for the warm weather.  The louvers on the a/c unit actually moved back and forth-again, had to laugh.   Great service in the restaurant.  He actually remembered which one of us wanted coffee and which one didn't.  The hotel was in a good location.  Traffic is terrible, don't drive in Dublin.  We took our rental car back and we got lost (again) but it was so nice not to drive, just walk.",3,2012,06,03
232,Disappointing & noisy,"I stayed for a night in the Wynns hotel thinking that it was a very attractive hotel from the outside and pictures on the internet.First the receptionist was not what you would expect from this kind of hotel her strong accent made her difficult to understand on top of not being particularly helpful.I enquired about the car park and trying to understand her english and how obvious questions seemed to annoy her made me give up enquiring about anything.Lift to bedrooms incredibly slow so you are pretty much sure to go up and down 5 floors by foot.Bedroom was OK but very stuffy no fan in the bathroom ,limited choice of channels on a small TV.Above all don't pick this hotel if you are hoping to sleep at night: traffic, LUAS and people shouting and fighting in lower Abbey St where the hotel is located make this place extremely and continuously noisy.And if you think breakfast will cheer you up well it won't the full Irish was very depressing looking :2 waxy looking slices of pudding and a couple of skinny sausages.Never again.",2,2012,05,27
232,Lovely blend of history and modern,"I was unsure about how an old hotel in the city centre would live up to its reviews.  Well I like  all things modern, clean etc.  And I was very surprised to see that this hotel delivered on it all.  It somehow has been updated without losing any character.  The staff are simply amazing.  We were on a large tour of people and needed to be at the train station at 8:30.  We went for breakfast at the opening time of 7:30, found out they had opened early for us and the fellow who was serving over 40 people single handed, was only over shadowed by the cook who when I asked how long it would take to get eggs and bacon, replied 2 mins and it literally was 2 mins before our food arrived.  The bedding, bathrooms carpets etc were all immaculate.  This is a real gem of a find in the city center.",5,2012,05,15
232,Close to everything,"Wynn's is a older hotel that is close to the main sites of Dublin. It is also at the crossroads for public transportation. The breakfasts were excellent and the service good. It hosts hen parties and weddings and is near Temple Bar, so it is a tad noisey when folks are going off to bed. Some will find it loud. We found it added to the experience. Upper floors would be quieter. The room we were in faced the street and was newly remodeled, clean and large by Irish standards. We stayed five days and would go back.",4,2012,05,13
232,Lovely hotel,"We were at a wedding reception on 16 April and stayed the night. The hotel and staff were lovely. The food was great, we ordered breakfast in bed the following day which was delivered about 10 minutes after we ordered. The rooms on the 5th floor are quite small as you are in the roof area. My only criticism that the room we stayed in 522 had no mirror near a plug so trying to straighten my hair for the wedding was a bit of a struggle, very small thing and apart from that an excellent place to stay. The beds were so comfy. Very central to the city centre and the luas runs directly outside the hotel. Valet parking to the car park located a few minutes from the hotel.",5,2012,05,03
232,Excellent Hotel & Central Location,"Stayed here for a weekend with my family before attending a conference in the city. We booked a family room (one double, two single beds). The room was more than large enough for 4 of us, the bathroom was good sized and the room was very quiet. Hotel staff were very friendly and service was always good. On our first morning, the breakfast room was full (due to a conference), but we had a table within a few minutes. Selection of food was good, and the hot breakfast was prepared fresh, so tasted better than usual in a hotel.

On our first night we ate in the hotel restaurant, and the quality of the food was good (note - last orders 9pm).

The only complaint was that the shower head in our had apparently been recently replaced, but did not fit the holder anymore, which basically meant a shower was a quite complex gymnastic exercise of always having to hold it in one hand! I forgot to mention it on checkout, but was anyway an inconvenience rather than a major complaint.

Location of the hotel is very central and there is a tram stop right outside. Perfect location for a trip to Dublin.",4,2012,04,30
232,Excellent choice for our small conference of 50 persons,"Wynns worked with us to set up our small conference (50 persons) from beginning to end. When we got there the service was great and super friendly. Our meeting room was very adequate with all our IT needs met. We were able to host part of our meeting online with two individuals joining us over the internet. It worked perfectly. 
The hotel is located right in the heart of the city and everything is within walking distance. Our delegates loved it. 
The thing that surprised us the most was the food! The lunch menu for our delegates was excellent. Far exceeding our expectations. 
I would definately go back to Wynns Hotel. ",5,2012,04,25
232,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I stayed here for one night on a Friday night recently.  I had a ticket for a show and wasn’t sure whether I could go or not so it was really last minute when I booked it.  In fact it was the Friday morning when I rang to book and got a rate of €79 B&B for that night so I was very pleased with that.  I got the Luas from Heuston Station to the hotel – the stop is directly outside the hotel so it was very convenient. 
Check in was quick. Girl at the front desk was pleasant. I was really pleased with my room.  It was on the 2nd floor overlooking Abbey Street.  It wasn’t what I was expecting at all – it was quite a big room.  I think it was probably a disability friendly room so maybe there was extra space for that reason.   The bathroom was large also.  I had free WiFi in the room which was a nice feature as many hotels still don’t offer it complimentary. The bed was comfortable and despite the room overlooking a noisy street I slept well enough. I am a heavy sleeper but the Luas did end up waking me around 7am. 
I was slightly disappointed with the breakfast particularly the continental section. There was very little to choose from, a few cereals, two flavour yoghurts and fruit, not what you would expect.  I ordered a cooked breakfast from the menu and that was nice, cooked fresh. 
I enjoyed my brief stay a Wynn’s.  I would consider staying here again when next I’m travelling to Dublin.",4,2012,04,21
232,Old world charm and hospitality,"Hotel is in the middle of Dublin. We had my 77 yr old mother in-law with us and they went out of their way to accommodate her needs. Bar area and dining was great, no complaints.Staff were excellent. They allowed us to leave the car in valet parking after we booked out so we could see the sights. 100 mtrs to open bus tour. Almost forgot, the best showers! Only down side, we had only one night stay.Loved it would stay again.",5,2012,04,20
232,I'm proud to recommend a Hotel that shares my name,"We had a very pleasurable stay at Wynn's Hotel; the staff, accommodation and service were excellent. Wynn's gave us an oasis of calm along with traditional ambience in the midst of a busy metropolis. Our room had warmth and character and was of good quality. The staff, from the receptionists to barmen and porters gave us 100% of their attention. We look forward to our return to the Hotel that shares my name. Thank you

Dennis Wynn",5,2012,04,20
232,a classic choice,"A classic choice in the heart of Dublin. Old-fashioned but warm, at reasonable rates",4,2012,04,19
232,Excellent stay,"Came to Dublin for 4 nights at the end of March for a conference and booked into this rather central hotel. Was a fine and enjoyable experience - the rooms were standard (nothing out of the ordinary), the breakfast was lovely and the staff - especially Dave the barman - were especially helpful. Would recommend staying here again.",4,2012,04,05
232,Very Helpful Staff,"As a number of reviewers have mentioned, this hotel's 'great days' are a long time passed, and some of the rooms do indeed need some TLC. However the public rooms are fine and the staff are amongst the best you'll encounter. I stayed here in November-December 2011 for 5 weeks off and on, and the only reason I'm not booked in now is because it's full! Apart from bar snacks I've only ever eaten breakfast, which is both very good, and can be swift if needed. Add to that, it has a great location, and valet parking - which is free, and frankly I wouldn't choose to stay anywhere else.",4,2012,03,31
232,Enjoyable stay,"I was visiting Dublin for a conference and so booked this hotel due to its proximity to the CCD as well as O'Connell Street and Temple Bar.  The hotel was in a great location for my needs and when it came to the service I received I have no complaints.  Check in was nice and simple, the room whilst not being massive was very clean and provided me with everything I required.  Breakfast was very tasty with a large selection to choose from and very attentive waiters.  You certainly wouldn't go hungry.  I spent a few evenings in the hotel bar and have to say Dave the barman was extremely friendly, giving us plenty of tips as to where to visit during the little free time we did have.  We were also entertained by many an interesting story!

I would definitely stay in this hotel again and recommend it to friends and family.",4,2012,03,30
232,"If hospitality is important, look no further.","I booked this hotel because of it's proximity to O'Connell Street and the St. Patrick's Day parade. Not only is this hotel in a great location, but the staff were absolutely the most accommodating, friendly, and truly caring staff I've EVER encountered in a hotel. A huge thank you to Rory, the manager, Dave and Adam, the bartenders for an awesome St. Patrick's night I'll never forget.

As far as the room goes, I found it to be quite comfortable, quiet and clean. I didn't spend a lot of time in it, but when I did, it was great.

I have ZERO complaints about this hotel and if I ever visit Ireland again, this will be the hotel I stay at.",5,2012,03,28
232,"Great service, poor hotel.","This 3*** hotel is worth it for its service and location but for nothing else. 

Most of the rooms are tiny, the ceiling of the bathroom is as low as it can be, there is at best 6 tv channels available on a low quality flat screen, the hair dryer blows cold air, and the shower door won't close.

The Irish breakfast is really good but if you are not use to this type of food for breakfast you will be disappointed. The continental breakfast lack of diversity and resumes itself by croissant, yogurt, cereal and juice. Not one thing more.

However, if it was only that it would be worth it for the great location. Sadly this hotel as a pretty busy schedule and host a lots of (external) events in their ballroom. In itself it is great but would be much more enjoyable if the place was soundproofed properly. On the 4th floor (on a total of 5) you are easily disturbed by traffic noises (but it stops after 9pm mostly) and the music or various animations offered in the 1st floor ballroom (which can go on up to 1am). Also when you do go complain at the reception they tell you either that it is not possible to hear the music from your room or that you could move to the 5th floor in a room so tiny you can hardly get around the bed...

It seemed quit promising. It was a really disappointing stay. ",3,2012,03,25
232,Thank you,"In 40 years of travelling, I have rarely stayed in such a lovely hotel. I canot find a single fault, from the people who clean the rooms through to the managers, each one is a consummate professional and, they all CARE. Thanks all of you for making me feel most welcome I will stay with you anytime. Slainte!",5,2012,03,23
232,great stay,"I love this hotel! Great location, great price, great service, great Breakfast! I felt so spoiled staying here. We arrived a little early for check in and they took care of our bags, called the maid and sat us down in the lounge so we could eat and relax while they got our room ready for us, instead of just telling us to come back later. Having a restaurant in the hotel was great as there were a few times we were just too tired to go out and the food was delicious. The breakfast was amazing and honestly I would stay there again just for that! Lots of variety and you could have a cooked or continental or combo of both. Served by a waiter with china. Just wonderful. The only reason I did not give them full marks is the hotel is a little dated (could use an update) and their soundproofing could use some work. None of those things however should prevent a stay at this marvelous hotel as the benefits far outweigh these two very minor downsides. Highly reccomend!",4,2012,03,22
232,Very average!,"An old world hotel that was grand in its day. Unfortunately that day was many years ago. Needs updating . Refreshing and a lot of much needed modernisation . Our rooms tolite was a very poor flusher and leaked all night keeping us up. Then to add insult to injury the shower did not work after a restless night . On a positive note the bed was realtivly comfortable and the breakfast average. 
I don't think I would stay here again ",3,2012,03,17

232,"Comfortable, well located, and excellent value","I was somewhat apprehensive about staying in a hotel smack bang in the city centre but was pleasantly surprised with my stay in Wynns hotel.  The hotel is a little dated and perhaps doesn't have the pizazz of a 5 star hotel but for a very affordable price it provides all the comforts you'll need.  My room at the back of the hotel was surprisingly quiet and comfortable - in fact I had a better night's sleep than in several rural 4 and 5 star hotels I've stayed in.  Staff were welcoming, accommodating and very efficient and the breakfast was excellent - I recommend their eggs Benedict.",5,2012,02,18
232,Good location,The hotel is a bit old fashioned but the rooms are clean and comfortable. The hotel is really close to the abbey theatre so it is the perfect location to catch a play or shop in o'connell street. The lady receptionist was very nice and helpful.,3,2012,02,18
232,Great location and value but a bit faded,We were staying in the Wynns on a business trip - my first ever trip to Dublin so I haven't much to compare Wynns too. The location was superb only 100m from the airport shuttle bus stop. One of the tram lines also runs right past the door. My first impression of my room was OK but it looked a bit worn. It was very functional though and everything seemed to work OK and was adequately maintained. The room was at the back of the hotel and was nice and quiet although this did mean the view was of a wall 10 ft away. Overall the room was very comfy with a good bed and a nice touch of industrial strength blackout blinds. Compared to other hotels i've stayed at in the UK (especially London) the value was superb at 60 euros. The bar was less superb value at 14 euros for two drinks. The Irish breakfast was adequate without being anything special but the service was a bit hit and miss - the waiter seemed more intent in tidying up than serving breakfast. Will definitely stay here again if priced the same.,4,2012,02,16
232,"wynns hotel, dublin","i really enjoyed my recent stay in wynnes hotel, dublin. i have stayed there quite a few times and always found it very good. the staff are really friendly and helpful.the breakfast anddining room are really good too and the bar has a lovely old world athmosphere. the best part is the location, it is so central for shopping, theatre etc. i would always put it my no 1. for convenience especially with luas stop outside door of hotel, bea,(from kilkenny)",4,2012,02,13
232,Excellent rugby weekend at an excellent hotel,"As usual we enjoyed a tremendous welcome at Wynn's hotel. This centrally located hotel has been our base for the Ireland/Wales rugby internationals for the last 30 years plus.
As the trip organiser I can unreservedly recommend Wynns for all classes of client",5,2012,02,11
232,Rugby Weekend in an ideal location,"We stayed last weekend for the Ireland v Wales rugby match and as normal everything was excellent as was the result the staff as always were very friendly and could not do enough for use.
We also had an early start on Monday morning 07:00am and breakfast was started early for our benefit which was a nice gesture.
Roll on 2014.",4,2012,02,08
232,Amazing staff,"We had to get a place to stay on very short notice and even with a big sporting weekend coming up, the hotel staff managed to provide my fiancé and I with a nice room. Throughout our stay we could not help to notice just how friendly and helpful the staff were helping and assisting wherever they could. 
An old majestic building, clean and neat and with the amazing staff, this hotel a place well worth visiting.",4,2012,02,07
232,"Great hotel, dicey location","I agree with all previous reviewers who raved about the great staff and convenient ocation of this hotel. My husband and I stayed here in January 2012 and really liked the charm of the place and the incredible location. Having said that, though, please be aware that there are some pretty scary people hanging around the hotel day and night. We heard from a taxi driver that there is both a homeless shelter and a methadone maintenance clinic on the street, and I checked online and found this to be true. I was surprised this wasn't mentioned by previous reviewers. If you are a woman traveling alone, or if you plan on late nights (when the hotel is locked up behind bars), this may not be the safest choice. I really regret to mention it, because our overall experience was so positive and we liked the staff so much, but its something to consider when booking.",3,2012,01,30
232,Never Again,"We booked this hotel for a night out in Dublin because it had parking & was central. We arrived at the hotel only to be told that there was no car parking spaces & the porter could take our car to a city centre car park. I assumed that the hotel would cover this cost but was told that we would need to pay. If I had known there was a possibility of no car space & that I would have to pay 20 euros on parking I never would have booked here in a million years or perhaps I wouldnt have brought the car.

We then went up to the room which was twin, we are a couple so obviously we booked a double. We rang down to reception to advise of the error only to be informed by the receptionist that this was what we had booked. We remained calm & explained that as a couple we wouldnt have booked a twin. The receptionist continued to contest that this was the room booked. At this point we were getting pretty fed up and asked if she could place us in a double room. There was only one left which we were shown to. This room absolutely stank of stale cigerettes, it was vile and no amount of having the window opened helped.

There was a private function on in the hotel which meant that there was music pumping until almost 1.30am so no sleep was had. After 1.30am people from the party continued screaming and shouting. 

The next morning at about 9.30am we were woken to more pumping music from the same funciton room and the sound of kids shouting, there was another childrens party on,

Overall it was an extremely unpleasant stay, I definately wouldnt recommend, I feel as though the hotel reached into my pocket and robbed the 110euro I paid for the room and 20euro for the car park because I would have preferred to stay home.",2,2012,01,30
232,Fantastic!,"I've stayed in an awful lot of hotels and guest houses in the last 12 months, but Wynn's Hotel has to rate of one of my favourites. 

If you want modern, bland and faceless accommodation in Dublin, then don't book here. If, however, you want character and incredibly helpful staff then you really should make this your first choice.

Ok, I'll admit, it wasn't perfect, but only on two counts: our third floor room faced the street and was a little noisy. That said, I actually liked the sound of the trams and the other traffic didn't keep me awake - it was just a little louder than I'd have liked when we were in our room during the day (which wasn't often). The only other thing I'd have changed was the bedsheets - they were a bit stiff and starchy so weren't the most comfortable things to sleep on. However, the bonuses of this hotel, far outweighed those two minor points. For example:

We had an early flight into Dublin. I'd emailed prior to arrival asking if we could drop off our luggage at around 09.00 and if possible, have a slightly earlier check-in. Well, we arrived just after 9 to a very friendly greeting and were given the keys to our room. We were able to have a cup of tea and a rest before heading into the city. 

The location is amazing. The bus from the airport drops you off just around the corner and the Luas red line tram goes right past the hotel. This made getting to the O2 arena (the main purpose of our trip) a doddle. 20 minutes after walking out of the hotel and we were at the venue.

If you want to do the touristy bus ride around the city, that too is a 2 minute walk away and the nightlife of Temple Bar is a 10 minute walk over O'Connell bridge.
 
Our room was a good size, as was the bathroom. We had a lovely sleigh bed and a spa bath and everything was spotlessly clean. The decor was a tiny bit tired, but not scruffy or worn by any means. The whole hotel has an elegance about it and it made a refreshing change from the contemporary neutrality of many of the newer hotels I've stayed in.

To top it all, there was a very good breakfast to be had in the wonderful dining room and every member of staff we met in our two days were helpful, efficient and incredibly friendly.

I can't imagine I'll return to Dublin again as it's not my favourite city, but if I did, I'd certainly be booking another room at Wynn's Hotel.",5,2012,01,22
232,Average hotel with average rooms,Stayed in Wynns hotel last weekend for my boyfriends birthday. Location is excellent as the hotel is city centre but the hotel is very dated and rooms less than impressive. Stayed in the deluxe room and I was really disappointed. Room decor was old and to be honest I have stayed in better ordinary rooms . Bathroom was the same size as the ordinary rooms. Everything about the room was old so I wouldn't recommend for something special. On the plus side Staff in the hotel were pleasant and car parking was great. ,3,2012,01,15
232,"Great ambiance, clean rooms, great breakfast",Old fashioned hotel but the rooms and bathrooms were spotless and more than comfortable.  The hotel staff were superb in every way.  I usually stay in more contempory hotels but stayed here due to the fantastic central location and I was not dissappointed.  The breakfast was great and it was wonderful to stay in such a friendly atmosphere.  I stayed for business reasons but intend returning for a leisurely stay.  I would highly recommend Wynns and I have nothing bad to say about it at all.  Keep up the good work.,5,2012,01,13
232,Old Hotel Charm in a Great Location,"Stayed here 2 nights before Christmas. Great older hotel with lots of charm. Rooms are adequate size and very clean. The bar is charming and the restaurant reminds you of something from the 1920's. It's right around the corner from a major shopping street with lots of restaurants/eating places and with easy access to both the airport bus, city buses and tram. The breakfast that came with the room was great, they would make whatever you wanted. Would stay here again.",4,2012,01,04
232,A great place to stay and see Dublin,"Our stay at the Wynn's was great. It is a little loud with the LUAS out front, but it does not run all night so it wasn't too bad. The rooms were very clean, and the staff were more than helpful and accommodating. Even when we would have to depart early to catch trains they would have breakfast prepared early for us. I would most definitely stay at the Wynn's again. On top of all of this, you cannot beat the location of the Wynn's! Right in the heart of Dublin.",5,2012,01,02
232,What a find!,"Having stayed in Dublin twice before, in hotels a little way out of the centre, I selected Wynns Hotel this time due to the central location.  Beautiful traditional hotel with lots of character, charm and elegance.  You could just imagine it in the old days!    As soon as we checked in we felt at home.  Friendly and efficient staff. Spotlessly clean.  Our bedroom was on upper floor at the front of the hotel with interesting views.  Very spacious room with superior furnishings, comfortable sleigh bed and flat screen tv, and the bathroom was amazing - big with jacuzzi bath!  Breakfast was in a lovely dining room with lots of choice, hot breakfast being cooked to order.  Good gym too, which was very quiet.  The adjoining bar was well used by locals as well as tourists and catered for the slightly more mature crowd than Temple Bar.  Very friendly, relaxed atmosphere.  Great convenient position in the middle of all that Dublin has to offer.  A little noisy at night, with Christmas revellers passing by outside, but that's a small price to pay for being based so centrally.  A short walk or tram ride to the station where we took the Dart train along the Dublin coast to visit favourites such as Dalkey and Howth.  We will definitely stay at Wynns again next time we return.",5,2011,12,18
232,Terrible terrible terrible,I stayed one night in the hotel and then cancelled my booking for a second night. Room was smelly and not clean and toilet ran all night. Came home from pub to find gates locking entrance to the hotel. No warning of this. Next morning was booked on a tour at 8 so was trying to check out and the woman told me to come back later. Then as I was explaining I couldn't her printer started chewing up the paper and she stormed off. Rudest person I came across in 5 weeks overseas.,2,2011,12,17
232,Very Clean and Central Location,"The room was really clean, it was on the top floor  the sound of the luas as I went to sleep I could imagen old Dublin and the passing trams. The room was not big but more 'bijoux' and I loved the fact it was so clean. The bed itself was soft and so comfy. The price for two was good with parking included and breakfast partially served by men in white shirts. We went to a play in the Abbey down the street, the next morning we shopped in Henry St. We did try and eat in the bar which was just packed out so we went to 101Talbot instead another good choice. I would stay here again without a doubt.",4,2011,12,14
232,Great City Centre location,"Great location in Dublin City Centre, close to the Airport Bus stops.

232,Excellent value for money,"We stayed in this hotel on 26th November. On arrival, the check-in was swift and professional. The girl on the reception desk couldnt have been more polite and helpful. The rooms are very beautiful, they are decorated to a high standard given the reasonable price for B and B. It was quite a cold weekend outdoors and the ability to control the heating in the room was a bonus. Three of us shared a family room that was quite spacioius and even had two flat-screen tvs! The hotel is very well located, when you step off the Luas you are at the hotel door. The room we had was at the back and was quiet at night. The breakfast mainly comprised of Full Irish (or a mixture of whatever type of hot breakfast you want), to a variety of cereals, breads, pastries, fruit etc. The dining room is very pleasant and the staff again, worked to the highest of professionalism. We had breaksfast at a very busy time but the waiting staff were excellent at making sure all ran smoothly. On checking out, the girl at the reception was again extremely polite and a pleasure to deal with. The kind concierge took our luggage to a store-room while we went shopping before getting our train home. Everyone in the the hotel made sure our stay was a pleasant and enjoyable one. We stayed here before and are already looking forward to our next stay! Thanks to all.",4,2011,11,29
232,Excellent Hotel - Perfect Location,"It was my first visit to Dublin and I selected the Wynn's Hotel because of the value and the great reviews.  I must say that it lived up to my high expectations.  The owner has been able to capture and maintain it's history and classic feel, dating back over 150 years.  It is centrally located and I was able to walk to the vibrant nightlife of the Templar Bar district and also the downtown shopping areas.  The staff was very friendly, accommodating, and professional.  I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there on my next visit.",5,2011,11,23
232,Value for money,"I stayed for a total of 9 nights at the Wynn's Hotel in September/October.  As a solo traveller I have no hesitation recommending this Hotel. The reception and dining room staff were friendly, attentive and always gave quality service during my stay.  My room was clean, comfortable and totally adequate for my needs.  I did not have any trouble with noise issues during my stay.  The hotel is central to transport, shops and local tourist attractions.",5,2011,11,22
232,Great staff but trams outside made it noisy,"An old hotel (founded in 1845) in the heart of the city. The staff were incredibly welcoming. The tram line outside was noisy. The rooms have been refurbished and my Mum's disabled friendly room was really good with a modern wet room. Avoid the second floor at weekends as its over the function rooms. We ate in every night as this worked for my Mum and the food was good. For disabled travellers it should be noted that there are steps outside and no ramp, and be that because of the tram lines taxis cannot draw up right outside the hotel's front door.",3,2011,11,22
232,Cool - A total time warp,"This place is cool. The real Ireland. I felt like I had stepped back to at least the 1950s, heavy carpets, dark wood, and a rattly old cage of an elevator that slammed and clunked around. The rooms and bathrooms were fine, and the wi-fi even worked well in the room. Beds were fine too. Even though my room overlooked a busy street, street noise didn't really bother me even with the window open. The included breakfast is big and heavy. The location cannot be beat. I'd stay again in a heartbeat. The ""gym"" is in a seemingly condemned, musty corner of the basement, but I got some use out of it.",4,2011,11,14
232,Great place to stay,"I stayed here for a week in August and it was wonderful. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the breakfast was excellent and it was a fantastic location.  I thought the room was clean and comfortable. I did bring  a little sound machine with me so it helped drown out the street noise but I think even without it I would have been ok.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2011,11,11
232,There's no place like Wynn's,"Just returned from a fantastic visit to Ireland which included a week's stay at the historic Wynn's Hotel in Dublin's City Centre.

Located on Lower Abbey Street, just steps away from O'Connell Street and the famed Abbey Theatre, there is truly no better home base for a Dublin visit. 

From the moment we arrived in the elegant lobby, the staff went out if its way with warmth and hospitality, offering suggestions and directions to our inquiries for off the beaten path pubs and attractions. Ann Marie and the other staff at the front desk were gracious from beginning to end, and Paul helped us with our bags and always greeted us with a smile at the door. Dave, one of the bartenders in the Saints and Scholars Bar and Lounge, was a delight to chat with, and also offered many suggestions for an insider's view of Dublin. My husband decided at the end of the trip, which included a week in Kilkenny, that Wynn’s offered the best pint of Guinness of all.

The complimentary breakfast in the beautiful dining room is like nothing we’ve ever experienced and is such a wonderful way to start each day. Offerings include simple items such as porridge and fresh fruit to more decadent fare such as rashers, crumpet pancakes and Eggs Benedict, not to mention scones and brown bread. Lingering over breakfast and a pot of tea while looking out at the scenes of Abbey Street are memories I will always cherish.One evening we enjoyed a delicious Carvery meal in the lounge, topped off by a truly amazing Tia Maria cheesecake with clotted cream and mixed berry compote. The camaraderie and friendly atmosphere in the lounge added to the ambience of the meal.

The rooms are warm and attractive, offering appreciated amenities such as a hair dryer, towel warmer and large tub. After a night flight from the States, it was pure heaven to take a much needed nap in the extremely comfortable bed. Our suite was also equipped with a Jacuzzi tub and electric fireplace, both a delight to weary travelers. Every evening we returned to our immaculately cleaned room to be greeted by a complimentary newspaper on the doorknob, which was also very appreciated.

I could go on and on about how much I love Wynn’s. I stayed there for my first visit to Dublin in 2000 and, since then, no other hotel manages to compare. It was very hard to say goodbye and I am already hoping that another visit to Wynn’s will be in my near future.",5,2011,11,09
232,A real Wynner,"This hotel might look out of place with it's old style appearance & charm, both inside & out, in a busy, modern capital city but don't let looks deceive because comfort & friendly service are the things that really make this a very good place to stay. 
The reception area is quite small, located immediately inside the main entrance but check in was ultra fast & friendly & we were quickly in the gold & mahogany decorated lift & at our 4th floor room door where we found a complimentary national evening newspaper hanging from the door handle for us & which, when opened, was like entering a pleasant timewarp with it's rustic colour scheme, original panel door, fireplace & old mahogany furniture. Old it might look but it was clean & comfortable & still had a double bed, single bed, (& a fold out single bed that we didn't use,added because all the family rooms were already booked), small wardrobe, luggage rack, safe, iron & ironing board, armchair, lamp, dresser & chair, small fridge, wall mounted tv, smoke alarm, electric heater, tea/coffee. We found the room just a little bit on the warm side & had problems with noise during the night from the Luas trams which ran straight past the front of the hotel & which our room faced out over, though to be honest, the hotel has been there long before the Luas line & so there's not alot of point in blaming the hotel for the noise. Our bathroom was ok, a nice size with shower cubicle, detachable shower head/riser bar, hairdryer, heated towel rad, toiletries, plenty of towels & extractor fan but the gold shower door & other gold/chrome fixtures did little to add any charm. 
The bar was a treasure with it's decor, fixtures & furniture. The original  mahogany  panels on the walls & the moulds on the ceiling really added to the old style feeling & the stained glass window behind the bar itself seemed to draw alot of attention as the customers, ourselves included, tried to name the famous faces depicted. The bar was very busy with a great atmosphere & friendly staff & it seemed that many of the customers there were locals who liked to pop in for a pint or two. Breakfast was served in the hotel's beautiful restaurant which, in keeping with the rest of the hotel, had a definite old style feel to it. The choice was very good with cereals, yoghurts, scones, croissants, brown bread, toast, porridge, full fry, pancakes, kippers, melon/grapefruit slices, prunes, grapefruit juice, apple juice, freshly squeezed orange juice, tea & coffee.
This hotel has alot going for it. It's old style charm, friendly staff, great bar, good breakfast & cozy rooms & added to that, it's location. Located only metres from oConnell Street & less than 5 minutes walk from Busaras ( the central bus station). The Luas trams outside might be the cause of some annoying  noise, especially if your room, like ours, is at the front of the hotel but they also give plenty of options for getting around the city without walking more than a handful of metres from the hotel reception.",4,2011,11,05
232,Fantastic hotel,"Wynn’s is a fantastic hotel right in the heart of vibrant Dublin. From the time of our booking made from home to when we arrived and the morning we left, the staff at Wynn’s were wonderful, especially lovely Roberta at the front desk and Robert who helped us with our heavy bags and parked our hire car for us, and for whom nothing was ever too much trouble. Our room was clean and bigger than we expected, with an immaculate renovated bathroom and hot strong shower being a real surprise. In the evening the barman was happy to serve our little boy a warm milk (and us something stronger!), and the breakfast in the beautifully ornate and inspiring breakfast room early next morning was sumptuous and quickly prepared. Wynn’s is simply the best value hotel in Dublin, stay here if you want to meet friendly staff, unwind in comfortable surrounds and enjoy the atmosphere of old world Irish hospitality.",5,2011,11,03
232,Good hotel Great Staff,"We stayed at Wynn’s in late October arriving on the day that Dublin was flooding. From reviews here I asked for a room at the back which would be quieter – at check in I got this, but then the rains came in through the roof and we were moved to room at the front which was bigger but it was quite noisy.

The hotel is good. All staff were really helpful and welcoming (note to the management: the guy who does the breakfasts is one of your greatest assets, what a great ambassador for the hotel!)

The hotel has free wi fi and coffee and tea making facilities and the room and bathroom were very clean. Curiously the room had very poor lighting, no central light just lots of small candle bulbs which don’t adequately light the room.

Breakfast was excellent with a good choice, and as noted above very professionally delivered in a very nice dining room.

The hotel is very centrally located and convenient for all the main attractions.

So not physically the best hotel you will visit but it’s shortcomings were more than made up for by the staff.",4,2011,10,31
232,Welcoming stay at Wynn`s Hotel.,"I spent the nights of 20th and 21st October at Wynn`s Hotel.  From the moment of arrival, there was a  warm welcome, and a feeling of security.   I had a comfortable room, and good bathroom.   The food was excellent for breakfast and lunch, and the service and atmosphere in the dining room could not have been better.   There is a ""lived in "" feeling in the bar, and while there I was served with care and attention.   Great location and good value and excellent service.   I look forward to my next visit to Wynns Hotel.",4,2011,10,29
232,Very Helpful Staff,"My daughter and I stayed at Wynn's Hotel in July of 2011 for four nights.  The most excellent aspect of our visit to Wynn's Hotel was without doubt the cheerful and helpful customer service from the front desk clerks, bellhops, dining room staff, etc.  Without exception the staff went out of their way to make our stay pleasant and comfortable.  We were very impressed.",4,2011,10,27
232,GOOD VALUE,"We stayed at Wynne's for three nights in late September, 2011 and were very pleased. The hotel was very reasonable for Dublin. The hotel was built in 1874 and has some good architectural features. The rooms were a little small, but clean with good baths. The breakfasts were excellent with great service. Actully all of the hotel staff was very good. The dinners are overpriced- we ate elsewhere. The hotel is just over the bridge to Trinity College and walking distance to all of the city center attractions. It is a half block from the ""hop on hop off"" tour bus stop (highly recommended if it's your first time to Dublin). We would definitly stay there again.",4,2011,10,22
232,w/end in Dublin,"excellent location and good value. very comfortable room,good breakfast. the lift was a bit slow and dodgy... thought I might get stuck in it. all in all a nice old hotel with a bit of character to it.",4,2011,10,13
232,"Comfortable hotel, excellent customer service, great transport links","I stayed at Wynn's Hotel with my father for 3 nights in October, partly for the Dublin Theatre Festival, and we had a very comfortable and pleasant. 

Tthe staff were very helpful, friendly and courteous - that makes such a difference. 

The rooms were clean, comfortable and well-equipped. Both our rooms were over some kind of ventilator, which made a noise that might disturb some people but which didn't bother us.

At 79, my father is getting on in years, so it was very helpful to have tram, bus, coach and Dart all within just a few minutes walk, as well as the Abbey and Peacock theatres. Day trips and theatre trips were all completely hassle-free.

The breakfasts were ample, and I was offered a continental breakfast at 4am when I was up early for a flight. The hotel has a traditional, well-established feel.

I left my camera in an off-the-street taxi on the way to the airport, and hotel management could not have been more helpful in looking for and co-ordinating the return of my camera. (If you are reading this, then thank you!!)

Some Dublin hotels can seem expensive to Brits, I think, and Wynn's offers very good value. I think they are maybe missing a marketing trick in not offering Theatre Festival Deal, but perhaps they are booking out anyway.",5,2011,10,12
232,Very Good if slightly old fashioned hotel,"We stayed one night in a deluxe double room.  The room was more like a suite with a separate seating area, jacuzzi bath etc.   I had emailed in advance asking for a quiet room.  I promptly received a response and the room was very quiet.  Breakfast was excellent in the morning and all the staff were extremely helpful and pleasant.  The free carparking is a great bonus and if you are going to an event in the O2 as we were it couldn't be a better location as the Luas stop is right outside the front door.  All in all great value and we would have no hesitation in recommending it as a great place to stay.  It isn't trendy or stylish just good old fashioned hospitality.",5,2011,10,10
232,Great location and charming hotel,"The hotel is located right in the center of Dublin right next to shopping and public transport. There is a 5-10 minutes walk to the Temple Bar district.

The rooms were large and well equipped compared to other hotels in Dublin. The complementary breakfast was good and the staff were very helpful. I would definitely come back next time!",4,2011,09,28
232,"Found on TA I will now always trust the reviews.
 I  will give as best I can to help all !","In the Wynn hotel at moment having had a great night around Dublin !(reviews to follow on pubs and restaurants) it's old ! That's fantastic for me it's got character ! Great location if you can walk for 10 mins you will be in temple barr ! The hotel staff at night  are great two czechs(if thats right wording)run the door and bar at night what a laugh they are especially David !! We stopped in room 400 facing madigans bar , we were upgraded no idea why maybe they heard of me ""forkhandles"" anyway room is good next to lift but no sound from that or people passing (however this is Monday but hotel is full) bed good has a topper (memory foam) length of bed is limited to 6ft and it's wood sleigh bed so for me head touches top and feet bottom but wife Sock on!!! Got coffee good instant and plenty milk(uht) wardrobe not massive but doubt you come for 2 weeks so it's fine,bathroom great hot tub ish and good shower,over lighting at shaving mirror ( difficult to wet

",5,2011,09,26
232,Pleasant Hotel,"Very good location and I had a pleasant and well maintained room. Good bed and comfortable furniture. Free wirless internet. Good bath. Some of my colleagues complained about very small rooms. Our conference room was spacious but in need of maintenance. Breakfast was very good but I had a meal in the hotel restaurant one night and that is not to be rocommended. Friendly reception and bar staff while the rest of them were rough and wearing ""uniforms"" which had seen better days. But all in all this hotel can be recommended.",3,2011,09,24
232,Location location!,"The central location of this hotel was perfect. There is the Luas Tram outside the door, and the Tour buses and local buses are 30 yds away on O'Connell St.
The hotel is old in character but up to date in bedroom furnishings and the dining room and lounge bar were well appointed. We had a superior room on the 4th floor at the front (499) it was very well decorated and the bathroom was large with a corner spa bath which was wonderful after a days sightseeing. We would have preferred a King sized bed(5ft) but it was not an issue.Plenty of storage space for clothes and luggage, tea and coffee and a fridge.
The breakfast was very good and the service in the dining room was excellent. The reception staff were very welcoming,helpful and polite.
The only issue we had which was not the hotels fault was the noise from party -goers/pub drinkers late into the evening/early morning.
Apart from this we would recommend the hotel for a trip to Dublin as its location for everything was brilliant and the staff were very welcoming.",5,2011,09,20
232,Charming old style hotel in perfect location,"Wynn's is a charming hotel with old personal style. Rooms and corridors are beautifully decorated and furnished. There are nice old prints on the walls to build the atmosphere. My room was spacious and facing to the back alley. The staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel has a free WiFi which seemed to be working very well. The age of the hotel showed e.g. in the condition of the bathroom, but everything seemed to be clean and well maintained. Unfortunately there is no proper lobby in the hotel, which could sometime make things a little complicated. For a city break Wynn's offer affordable option in a central location.",4,2011,09,17
232,Fine older hotel with great location,"We enjoy older hotels when we stay in city centers and the Wynn's offers a lot of charm and history.  Room was clean, but a bit small.  Somewhat noisey from street traffic, but that is to be expected in a downtown hotel.  Excellent location in the heart of the city.  Staff were very freindly and accomodating.  Breakfast was very good. Good bar with many locals.",4,2011,09,15
232,A gem for solo travellers,"Stayed 3 nights in June and going back this week! perfect for solo traveller as it is close to all tourist attractions, rail and bus service.  had a great small single room that was quiet and extremely clean.  Only minus is the breakfast queue some mornings, that needs to be rethought. Also may not be suitable for wheelchair as there are a few steps at entrance and the porter is not always looking out for hotel patrons? However location and the fact that breakfast is included can't be beat!!",4,2011,09,13
232,Great location in Dublin,"We stayed at the Wynn's for 2 nights, and were thrilled with the choice.  While the hotel is a bit older than it may look in the pictures, the rooms were clean and spacious and the location was perfect - right across the bridge from Trinity College, Temple Bar, etc.  

The hop on/hop off bus stops just at the end of the block to get you around Dublin, so no car or taxi are really needed if you stay here.  There is a bar attached to the hotel and the breakfast was very good.  I'd definitely stay here again.",4,2011,09,13
232,Mixed Feelings,"Having a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence and having undergone a €5m refurbishment (when?) one would think that this hotel would live up to the photographs on its website.  Indeed the public rooms are smart but our bedroom on the fifth floor was a disappointment.  The room decor was tired and dated, the shower room although clean was clearly in need of refurbishment and major attention to detail. You will find the remains of mould around the shower doors and in the wall tile grouting.  The heated towel rail was broken at the electrical connection exposing wires and a downlighter in the ceiling above the electric shower had a considerably large gap around the rim making it potentially dangerous if water got in! See the attached photos.
On the positive side the staff were attentive particularly the male waiter at breakfast.  He deserves a commendation.  The hotel was particularly well located for the Temple Bar.  Would I stay there again - No!  The hotel needs to get its act together with routine maintenance and the decor in the room I stayed in was depressing.",3,2011,09,11
232,"Wonderful staff, shame about the carpet!","I'm really torn writing this review. The staff were excellent, the best I've ever known in a hotel. Friendly and courteous, nothing was too much trouble. We weren't kept waiting on our arrival and our room was ready (which is a first for us as in other hotels we have been kept waiting).
On the downside the room was small and smelt of smoke even though it was meant to be a non-smoking room. The bathroom was small too but fine for one night. The room was slightly grubby, I'll post a photo of the room carpet.
We were on the 2nd floor with the luas line just below us but it wasn't too noisy with the window shut. 
The hotel is in a great location, handy for all the shops and it was brilliant to go out and do some shopping and bring it back to the hotel.
The breakfast was lovely. There was no ham or cheese as you would find in most other hotels though. The cold breakfast (cereal, yogurt, bread) you served yourself.
The hot breakfast, which consisted of Full Irish, Porridge, eggs, kippers and even goats cheese and crumpets was served to the table. The toast was warm which makes a nice change. The service in the restaurant was excellent.
There was free wifi in the hotel and a tv in the room (although the channels were limited). You could hear the people in the next room turning on their sockets and flushing their toilet.
So all in all for staff and location I would stay here again, but if you are looking for a modern hotel Wynn's is not it.",4,2011,09,07
232,"Great staff, great location.","My girlfriend and I stayed in the James Joyce suite of the hotel as we were attending a performance at the Abbey Theatre. It was a great location 30 seconds from the Abbey an O'Connell Street. We arrived at 12 noon and I informed the friendly receptionist I had a car. A porter immediately appeared and took the car- parked for free and it was great not to have to worry about it for the day. The room itself was clean but a bit dated. The en-suite was modern and had a great jacuzzi bath and a comfortable sleigh bed. We met a friend in Dublin who had luggage and wanted to leave it at our hotel, I asked the receptionist to keep the luggage at reception, again the porter appeared and insisted on bringing it to our room! He was brilliant. The bar man was full of chat and friendly also and the breakfast was great apart from the pudding- its disgusting and needs to be changed by the hotel and quickly! On the morning of departure the car was waiting for me and our luggage put in the car by the same porter! Overall it was a great experience an we hope to return. ",4,2011,09,04
232,A home away from home!!!,"We stayed at Wynn's hotel with our 2 children aged 10 and 7,for 2 nights.On arriving we were welcomed like royalty. The chatty porter (Paul) offered to carry our bags to our room. Roberta, the receptionist, could not have been more friendly and helpful.She took time to chat to the children (and provide them with endless pencils and paper!!) Her beaming smile   greeted us morning and evening, a refreshing change from other hotels we have stayed in in Ireland. Our room was very clean and comfortable, with a separate tv for the children.We had a delicious evening meal on one evening and again the staff were very friendly and efficient.Breakfast each morning was freshly cooked ( served to our table-no carvery)  and much to our childrens delight toasted bagels were available!!! 
We had a most memorable stay at Wynn's hotel and would highly recommend  it as a city center base for sightseeing in Dublin. However our lasting memory will always be the pleasant, helpful staff and Roberta's warm, welcoming smile!!!",5,2011,08,25
232,"Nice place, huge room!",The room we had was so big and it was nice. The bathroom was also big and the location is good! It's in the middle of everything. Awesome breakfast!!!,4,2011,08,25
232,Lovely & Friendly,"Stayed in this hotel on the 24th & 25th August 2011. Must say we thoroughly enjoyed it, 
It is a lovely cosy  hotel. The Lady on Reception  (Sorry dont know her name, ) was so friendly and helpful . Didnt get to have an evening meal there as it was closed both nights, but breakfast as lovely. Just loved the idea of being able to shop in comfort knowing we could drop back our parcels to our room so easy, and then the Luas stopped right outside the door to take us anywhere we wanted to go. Cant wait to return there again.",5,2011,08,25
232,"Disappointing. Service good, but the hotel is tired and unloved","I researched hotels extensively and picked this based on the positive reviews and their website.  The pictures are carefully selected and provide the impression of a historic, warm and luxurious place to stay: a step back in time. Unfortunately the reality was somewhat different. What was clearly a beautiful hotel in the past, is now tired, unloved and lacking attention. There was nothing luxurious about it.  It is actually pretty 'tacky'. For example, a cheap nasty LED display in reception and laminated print out information leaflets in the rooms and as restauarnt menus. If it was not for the wooden panelling you would think you had walked into the wrong hotel all together. 

The room was fine. Nice shower, comfortable bed etc, but I suffered with the lack of closing curtains  and an operational black out blind which provided very little by way of black out. As for the raging tram noise outside....

That said, the location is fantastic and the service was very very good. Reception staff were cheerful, helpful and generally knowledgeable (definitely showing willing even if not expertise!) and the breakfast staff were also very good (albeit clearly rushed off their feet). 

Overall, what was supposed to be a treat ended up a rather expensive disappointment. Shame. I hope they stop the decline before it is too late.",2,2011,08,24
232,"Bright lights, Big city","Wynn's hotel is in the heart of Dublin, steps from Trinity College, Grafton Street and everything else you want to see. The breakfast is nice, and staff is very enthusiastic and helpful. Great pub with wi fi sitting area. Rooms are small, no wi fi in room,  like London hotels, but otherwise  are clean and fine. Staff very nice to my kids, who eat a lot of toast.",4,2011,08,21
232,The best hotel I have ever stayed in!!,"My stay at the Wynns Hotel was so enjoyable. The management and staff were excellent. Anne Marie, the reservation manager, took the time and helped me book bus tours to see all arouond Ireland. It was clean, the resturant was excellent, it has a fantastic bar, everyone working there was so nice and friendly. I cant say enough good things about my stay there. I will be returning to Ireland in the future, and I will be staying at the Wynns Hotel. Debra, from Texas.",5,2011,08,20
232,Great Hotel we would return,"We have just spent a night in this hotel and if returning to Dublin will stay here again. The hotel is old fasioned but not rundown at all. The location is excellent the city centre is on the doorstep. A bonus for us was free parking not something you expect in a city centre hotel. The breakfast was lovely and plentyful, they advise you that it can get busy at times but we did not have a problem. The only minor let down was that we had a little to warm and tiny room just space for a double bed and our bags but we where there to see the city and the room was fine for somewhere to sleep.",4,2011,08,20
232,Excellent place to stay!,"I strongly recommend Wynns hotel in Dublin! Comfortable beds, beautiful rooms, nice atmosphere, delicious breakfast and excellent staff!",5,2011,08,17
232,A Horror !!!,"I can only tell you to avoid this Hotel at all cost!  My sister and I happened upon this Hotel after attending a family reunion in the west of Ireland.  We inquired at the Front Desk Lobby for rates for a two bed room for two nights.  We were waited on by a woman Roberta, (From Italy)  This was the 7th of August about 4pm.  She stated first that because we were arriving so late she would have to post all charges to credit card for entire stay. (???)  did she have  questions of our credit worth? Did she feel we would leave and not pay or put a stop pay on the credit card???  We were quoted a rate of 125 Euros for two nights. That rate would also include a dinner each night and a breakfast each morning..  It was quite obvious that English was not her mother tongue as we asked her first regarding a AAA discount which many hotels in Europoe accept, any discounts for Amex or visa/mastercard, car parking fee, etc, etc.  We still were unsure as to the room rate.  125 euros is quite a bit for two people for a Hotel of this ranking. (Not a Michelin Hotel)  Several times she had to go to the office behind Front Desk to speak to some person to find the answers to our questions. Obvious she did not unerstand English well. (Southern European) We asked her if she could assist us in Irish, the national language of Ireland, answer was no. ??? {Will inform ""Bord Failte,"" Irish tourist Board}  We asked her if she could assist us in French.  The answer was no.  She would return from the rear office and did more talking with her hands then her mouth.  We checked in and proceeded to the elevator and still unsure of what we were getting for our money went back to the Front Desk and asked her for clarification on rate and meals included.  She handed us a voucher for our dinners and breakfasts.  Upon entering the room it felt like an oven, called Front Desk and a woman arrived who spoke little English she turned the heat up even higher.  I asked her where she was from and she said, ""Latvia.""  I showed her after finding my glasses and looking at the controls how to turn heating unit off. I opened window and signage in room stated window only opens 4 inches.  For 125 Euros for two people for two nights and no AC?  Noise from trams, buses outside and drunks going by late at night kept us up, had to leave window open for air.  First dinner I handed voucher card to young woman and she didn't know what it was????  I asked her, ""is there a problem?""  She spoke no English, (from Spain) waiter with blonde hair and ponytail assisted us and told us we would get another voucher for dinner tomorrow night at the Front Desk.  One hour later we were stuck in ELEVATOR and used emergency phone to call for help.  There were no apologies from any staff members.  Following night  went to Front Desk for Dinner Voucher Card and told by blond hair woman, only one dinner with your stay here.  I spoke to this woman with shoulder length blond hair, (did not get her name.)  (She to had problems with English, Slavic?),   I informed her of the poor linguistic skills, lack of knowledge, mannerism, Customer Service and information provided by Roberta regarding rates and what was included.  Her response was, ""I heard the whole conversation when you were checking in last night.""  I then said to her, "" Were you the person in that back office Roberta kept going to for answers regarding simple inquiries and clarification of rates, discounts and what was included???"" She did not answer me. I said, ""Why did you not intervene and assist us when it was obvious Roberta was clueless and did not have answers to basic guest inqueries?""  Her answer was, ""Roberta is professional.""  The whole time I spoke to this woman on the evening of August 8, 2011, to voice my concerns and short comings of the accomadations and Front Desk staff, she had a wide smile on her face.  I asked, her. ""After all that you know and Roberta's inability to assit my sister and I in simple guest inquiries. Why are you smiling, do you find this humourous?""  Brace yourselves, the shocker is later that night again we were stuck in the elevator, no staff apologies. On checking out rate was 125 Euros per person for two nights not two people for two nights at 125 Euros.. Total of 250 Euros ($360.00 US dollars) plus tax for two nights,  No AC, elevator getting stuck twice, room had two twin beds, room was small no place to put luggage, volume on TV would go up and down by itself, then no volume.  Noise from trams, buses and loud people late at night unbearable.  Enclosing waiters, waitresses, valets, porter, food, cooks and bartenders were wonderful.  Sadly Front Desk staff is unprofessional, poor customer service, mannerism and language challenged with English, Irish and French. English is a fifth language at this hotel by Front Desk Staff and Room Service.  Best you speak either a Slavic language or Southern European language to stay at this hotel..  Chances are it still will be an unpleasant stay!!!",1,2011,08,15
232,Nice hotel w/ good location.,"This was a comfortable, clean hotel with just enough class  :)  We thought the location was good and within walking distance to most attractions.  If walking is not your thing, the LUAS (light rail) is literally right outside the front door.  The bathroom was pretty cool with a huge shower/jacuzzi tube.  The breakfast was also good.  If I am ever back in Dublin, I would stay here again.",4,2011,08,14
232,Plush and Comfortable and Great Location,This hotel was our treat after a week of hostels on a bus trip.  It definitely met and exceeded expectations!  I got a great deal on their website booking in advance which included a delicious 3 course dinner for one night and big breakfast for both mornings.   The room included a spa bath to my surprise and had comfortable beds.  Staff were helpful.  Location is good on the north side of the river - so only a short walk to some of the attractions on the other side. I would definitely stay here again if I ever return to Dublin.,5,2011,08,09
232,bad hotel,"first the shower was broken no shower for whole stay even though they said it was fixed 

next morning for breakfast eight other couples got there breakfast orders taken and recieved same while we were sitting there with 2 small kids waiting to be feed had to call manager to get breakfast order taken 

hotel nice but dont take room on a road side as clubs outside will keep you up all night 

would not stay here again",2,2011,08,07
232,Great hotel in just the right place!,"The positioning in the centre of O'connell St couldn't be more central to Dublin if you're there for a city break.  With all transport links nearby it is really handy for your time in Dublin.  
In short it was a luxurious hotel in the traditional manner befitting a city centre hotel.
Reception staff was a major plus point for the hotel as all were very helpful in giving clear advice on a number of questions.  They also looked after our bags as we arrived early and giving us an update on the progress of our room availability. 
Room were well furnished and the bed was large and very comfortable.  Apparently our room was better than another couple (but we didnt see but I would expect it was of the same standard) but superior to a single friend who had a small double room by our standard but then again he paid a lot less than our rate!
The Bathroom was large with a jacuzzi bath which was great to relax in and enjoy.  TV was limited in channels (compared to other hotels).  Our room was at the front of the hotel and despite some clanking from the Luas and other noises from the street it wasnt obtrusive or a problem.  Windows could be left open and you are not overlooked. Breakfast was partially buffet (cereals and fruit) and cooked to order (with a wide choice).   Bar service was OK as the single barman was very busy and was serving us as well as fulfilling other orders.  It  seems to be a popular eating place in Dublin which is a good sign.  The porter was also helpful and a nice touch in helping people out. 
Booking on line and not really having an idea of its fantastic position unfortunately we limited our stay (but prices seemed to go up as it was unbeknown at the time of booking a bank holiday weekend!).
We stayed for one night but after experiencing the hotel wished it could have been more.",5,2011,08,02
232,Amazing establishment and wonderful staff - we will definitely return,"The hotel was amazing, spotless and the staff exceptionally professional and helpful.  They were so courteous at all times and they made our stay so relaxing.  The night porter was exceptional and parked our car in the car park for us and returned it to us when we were departing. The food was delicious and the rooms perfect.  The only negative thing I have to say is that we could not stay long enough!  There were six of us and we all thoroughly enjoyed our time at Wynns.",5,2011,08,01
232,Perfect for  bed for the night in a very convenient location,"With Wynn's it's all about location location location. If you are on a night out in Dublin and need somewhere to lay your head for the night with a decent breakfast for under €80 - Wynn's will do the trick. I wouldn't pay over €80 for a single room (incl breakfast) here though, there's better value to be had if you're paying more. 
The staff are very helpful and friendly, and the rooms are spotless. They are a bit battered though, as in they don't appear to have had a lick of paint in some time and are a bit the worse for wear.",3,2011,08,01
232,We loved it and we will be back!,"Wynns Hotel Dublin is a beautiful historic building near the center of everything in Dublin: clost to Temple Bar, Trinity College, the Irish Writers Museum and much more. Our room was beautiful...wood paneling, a seperate sitting area and a large jacuzzi tub with shower in the bathroom. The heated towel rack was an unexpected treat! The staff were extremely polite and very helpful with everything we needed. The full Irish breakfast, included with the room, was delicious and filling. We did not need to eat again until dinner. the service at breakfast was friendly and efficient. The restaurant and bar in the hotel are also beautiful with wood paneling and lovely chandelers.",5,2011,08,01
232,"Good location, but underwhelming","My husband and I stayed at the Wynn's our last couple of nights in Ireland.  It was fine, but definitely underwhelming.  Most of the customer service left a lot to be desired and I wasn't thrilled with their model of requiring you to leave your hotel room key at the front desk when you left the building (especially because they weren't checking IDs to get them back!!).  I wouldn't stay here again.  We stayed at Albany House on the front end of our trip and I was *much* happier there.",3,2011,07,31
232,Excellent atmosphere and location,My travel agency bring mostly senior citizens from Denmark to Ireland. Very central location is a must for my clients and Wynn's is perfect. We like the old style atmosphere including old fashioned good service and very friendly staff. The rooms are clean and the restaurant and bar are great.,4,2011,07,29
232,GREAT VACATION,Excellent older hotel near Abbey Theatre and O'Connell Street.  Fantastic hot breakfast served at your table- great wait staff.  Carvery meals were outstanding and reasonably priced.  Best deal in Dublin- great room rates and spacious rooms- anoid street side though- can get a bit noisy.,5,2011,07,28
232,Great place to stay,"I really like the Wynn, it is not flashy or super modern, just a very nice hotel in a great location....right off O'Connell Street near Trinity College, and within walking distance to Connolly Bus Station.  Temple Bar and Grafton Street are just minutes away. The staff is very accomodating and helpful, the rooms are clean, and you even get a full breakfast included for a very reasonable rate.",4,2011,07,28
232,"Nice staff, good breakfast but cramped quarters","The staff at this hotel couldn't be nicer or more gracious but I envy the people who say they had a big room. If you wanted to cross from one side of my room to the other you either had to walk on top of the bed or the suitcase, it was that small. Just one average suitcase took up all available floor room. So the room was also very stuffy and hot in July.",3,2011,07,27
232,Great hotel with lots of local character,I stayed at Wynn's for 5 nights with my 11 year old daughter and we were pleasantly surprised.  Our room was spacious and very well maintained with an enormous bathroom.  The staff were extremely friendly and we enjoyed eating in both the restaurant as well as the bar.  The location was good in down town Dublin and only 5-10 minute walk to Trinity College and Grafton Street.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2011,07,22
232,"Fantastic,friendly,lovely people",We stayed at wyns for 2nights and we cant praise it enough! Arrived late but staff parked the car for us and even opened the bar! The food was excellent as was the service. We are definately returnin!,5,2011,07,21
232,"Excellent. Good service, good food, friendly and helpfull staff.","Wynn´s hotel is very good located, close to the big shopping areas, museums, restaurants, Grafton Street and Trinity College. The tram is a plus. The hotel is oldfashioned, well kept, clean  and cosy. Excellent service - the reception was wonderful, the restaurant never kept you waiting. The room - a double on the 5th floor - was airy and tidy with a big bathroom. A very nice hotel I would recommend to anyone.",5,2011,07,12
232,Excellent!!!!,"Perfect location!

Gorgeous room!

Delicious Irish breakfast!",5,2011,07,09
232,Best location in city center,"We started our 2 weeks vacation in this hotel for 2 nights.  We wanted to be as close as possible to the city center without being in the ""bars"" area.  Only 5 minutes walk, cross the bridge and you're in the middle of the action!

The hotel itself is nice, with a nice vintage look (looks old but in a nice way).  Room was OK, clean, spacious.  The breakfast was very good.  It was our first Irish breakfast and we were plaesantly surprised.

Very recommended.",4,2011,07,08
232,This is the place to stay,"We stayed here recently after a concert.   Last Oct when the tickets came out we had initially booked 2 treble rooms at a very good rate.  When the concert came round 2 people were unable to stay.  Two days before our travel we rang to ask could the rooms be changed to a quad.  There was no problem changing the booking and again the excellent price was reduced further.  All week long we had heard on the radio about hotels overcharging,  this did not happen in wynns.  From our check in, the friendly welcome we received from the receptionist right through to our check out we could not fault this hotel in any way.  Location wise there is a luas stop right outside the front door and around the corner the air coach stops. A night cap in the residents lounge before bed was delivered by the lovely barman simon.  We really enjoyed his friendlieness and wit.  Our breakfast the following morning was very tasty and the scones were beautiful.  I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel to anyone and will definitely stay here again.",5,2011,06,24
232,"Location, Location, Location!","Not only does the Wynn's have a great location within downtown Dublin, but the accomodations were tremendous! Everyone that I met was extremely polite and helpful. I plan on only staying here upon my future trips to Dublin.",5,2011,06,23
232,Excellent staff makes this Hotel the one to choose if visiting Dublin,"A  group of friends, we booked wynns for an overnight after a recent concert and found that it is the friendly staff that make this hotel a perfect choice for a visit to Dublin. It is ideally situated, with a Luas stop in front of the hotel, tourist attractions, and shopping nearby. From the initial booking through to the excellent breakfast, with an attentive and  efficient breakfast manager the service was in the best Irish tradition, humerous, friendly, and charming. We have to give a special mention to barman Simon who welcomed us in the hotel bar and makes an excellent Irish Coffee! Rooms are clean and the decor is warm, cosy and has a Dublin character that is missing from the larger more inpersonal modern hotels. Even the room keys are full of Dublin charm. Book Wynns you wont regret it!",5,2011,06,19
232,Very central location,"Recently stayed here for one night. Hotel is quite an old building and has quite a lot of old features about it. The room was nice, was quite big, 2 single beds - although the furniture is quite dated as is the decor but I guess this is in keeping with the old features of the hotel. Location is perfect as it is just off O'Connell street and has a Luas stop just outside the door of the hotel. Staff were very friendly. Breakfast was nice.",4,2011,06,16
232,"Hidden quality historical gem at half the price of Temple Bar hotels, fantastic find!","The Wynn in Dublin in a hidden gem in quality, and in price/performance. The food is decent, the coffee very good, andthe hotel is dark and old in a great way. The bathrooms are about twice the size of the trendy Morgan.

The Wynn is just north of touristy Temple Bar area a few blocks, across the O'Connel or ha'penny bridges. There are some nice restaurants on the north side now, and some cool bar & grills like The Church. I highly recommend the Wynn since it's roughly half the price of the nicer Temple Bar hotels, is 5 minutes away, and much more nostalgic.

The service provided by David at The Wynn is fantastic, also make sure you call them to discuss group rates if you have 10-20 people.",5,2011,06,13
232,Classy Comfortable and Affordable,It felt like home. The price was 1/2 of other hotels in the area. The breakfast was high quality and made to order (and was included in the price). David went out of his was on numerous occasions to helps above and beyond the call of duty. Always a friendly smile from the staff. Comfortable common areas to relax in after a day of touring around Dublin. I'll be back!,5,2011,06,12
232,I will be back!,"Thank You for a lovely stay! My room was very clean, comfortable and quiet. The staff was very friendly and polite, I really felt welcome in this hotel.",5,2011,06,08
232,Comfortable stay in an excellent location,"The hotel is situated in an excellent location in the centre of Dublin. It is an old building with a period charm about it.

Our room was comfortable, well equipped and very clean.  We felt the room was a little small for  a superior double room however the bathroom was spacious.   It was located at the front of the hotel and we did expect some noise from the LUAS tram as it runs directly outside, however, this was not an issue at all as we both slept very well.

The reception staff were friendly and helpful at all times.  We took the carvery dinner in the bar on the first evening and this was very acceptable.  The bar staff were courteous.

Breakfast on both mornings was excellent.  There was an good choice of high quality breakfast items from the buffet counter, toast and tea/coffee were served very soon after we were seated and the hot items were cooked to order.  Everything was delicious.  The breakfast waiter  was friendly, welcoming and efficient and a credit to the hotel.  The waitress working with him on the second day was a bit grumpy though and gave the impression we were an inconvenience.

To sum up, we enjoyed our two day stay at Wynn's.  We thought it was good value for money and would definitely stay there again in the future.",4,2011,06,05
232,very tired hotel with poor facilities but friendly restaurant staff,"Location is OK - it is very easy to walk to a nicer area. 

It is in bad need of paint and new wall paper and although clean the carpets have been on for a few years more than you would expect at this price! 

The shower was a trickle and the hairdryer was useless. They will bring you a hairdryer to plug in but the flex is too short to see your hair in the mirror and blowdry at the same time. The bathroom was clean and more modern
There is a desk but no lamp to shed light on the desk! 

People stand smoking in the doorway and I was told to take the main roads as it was not safe to exit right. On my first night there lots of drunk teenagers hanging around.",2,2011,06,05
232,Good value reliable city centre hotel,"I stayed here for one night after a late flight into Dublin before travelling further into the countryside.  I mentioned on the booking form that I was going to arrive late around 11pm which was after the normal check-in hours but it was no problem, when I arrived, the night porter was expecting me and checked me in smoothly.  All the staff were friendly and helpful.

The hotel is very central, just off O'Connell street which was very central for getting to the shops, buses, transport and a short walk across the bridge to Trinity, the museums and the rest of the centre.

I had a room facing the street and you could hear a slight traffic sound but on the whole, the double glazing was good and the noise wasn't enough to disturb my nights sleep.  The room was clean, recently renovated bathroom, non-smoking with no smell of smoking (not always a given for hotels in Ireland!) and had everything you would expect for your normal 3* hotel.

In the morning they had an excellent breakfast, lovely fresh juice and a choice of hot breakfast menu also served with a choice of cereals, fruit and pastries etc.

I left my luggage there after check-out for a couple of hours before I travelled further without any extra charge.  They had good free wifi that worked.

All in all, a great little 3* hotel where I would happily stay again.",4,2011,06,05
232,Great central Dublin hotel,"Terrific location in central Dublin, less than a block from the airport bus stop, and a short walk across the river from Trinity University and Temple Bar.  Wonderful full Irish breakfast cooked to order.  Spacious room with a very comfortable bed and great bathroom and shower.  Nice hotel bar in the lobby.  There are some tradeoffs to being so central to the city.  There's some street noise at night, including the tram stop directly in front of the hotel.",4,2011,05,27
232,Excellent location and wonderful staff personnel,"The hotel is located in the center of Dublin. The double room we have was clean and elegant with a spacious bathroom. The restaurant and bar are cozy and peaceful and especially the breakfast was many-sided and delicious. Above all best of the hotel is the personnel.  The staff is helpful and kind. Ask for David in the bar if you want to talk about e.g., music or sports.",5,2011,05,21
232,"Old fashioned character, new world facilities","The hotel is superbly located, with only the tram in front and echoes of  Temple Bar revellers to threaten the peace (a minor threat though; I slept great). Clean, spacious, excellent breakfast, everything one needs!",5,2011,05,14
232,A big disappointment,"We had read very good reviews of Wynn's Hotel, but sadly our experience did not live up to expectations.  The location is indeed excellent, although the tram tracks make it impossible for a taxi to pull up to the front door.  
Our problem was with our room.  It was an interior location with a view of a fire escape.  We were surprised to find a double bed and two single beds (just my wife and I were travelling), but that was the only room available.
The room was very old, and initially appeared ""cosmetically redone"".  However,  the heating/AC/ventilation system was non-functional, so that it was very stuffy.  The window blind unravelled completely when one pulled on it, and could not be raised again.  The handheld shower nozzle could not be placed on the designated wall fixture because the fixture kept collapsing, making it a real problem to try to have a shower.  The headboard of the bed was upholstered -- not the most sanitary situation for a hotel.
This hotel is 150 years old, and undoubtedly would be seen by many as charming.  However, the charm wears thin when the room and its amenities actually seem to be 150 years old as well.  In that situation, historic charm deteriorates into annoying seediness.
Wynn's has a small and pleasant dining room, and our breakfast there was fine.
We only stayed one night before heading for the airport, and I did report the room problems to the front desk before leaving.  Hopefully they'll have them fixed before the next traveler uses it.  This had been our 8th night in Ireland, and it was our most disappointing hotel experience.",2,2011,05,09
232,Amazing place to stay in Dublin,"A delightful hotel. Four of us stayed at the hotel during Easter week, and we all had a most wonderful holiday. The hotel is right in the centre of Dublin, ideal for shopping, visits to museums, theatres etc. The rooms were very clean, comfortable, and quiet. The bar is full of athmosphere, with delightful wood panelling and the bar staff were so friendly. Every member of staff at the hotel was both friendly and helpful, and they went out of their way to make you feel welcome. A special ""thank you"" to Ammemaria for her helpfullness. The food in both the carvary and restaurant was superb, at very reasonable prices, and the full Irish breakfast a delight. An amazing place to stay. Can't wait to return. Highly recommended.",5,2011,04,30
232,"Central location, close to it all","My partner and I just got back from a trip in Europe and I just had to come on here to review some of the places we visited and stayed.
We loved this hotel, it is really central and made it easy to travel around. We did a day tour to Belfast and the Giants causeway with Paddywagon which was just a short walk away, and got the luas over to Heuston station and went down to Cork for a night.
The rooms were homely and we had the papers delivered to our room everyday. Breakfast was awesome and a great start to the day. I only wish we could have stayed longer, the staff were awesome and couldnt have done enough.
Highly reccomended and cant wait to get back!! (Once we save up)",5,2011,04,28
232,Old-fashioned courtesy and charm,"Really enjoyed my stay. A good old-fashioned hotel with emphasis on courtesy and service. Room was thoroughly cleaned and ""reset"" every day, the receptionist was warm and friendly, and the breakfasts left me fit to burst. They let me check in extremely early off a 7am flight, and I had evening newspapers delivered to my room without requesting, and at no extra charge. Nice extra touches like a safe in the room, a fridge, free wifi etc. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to others - they've clearly worked out a good formula over years, and know what people appreciate.  Location is fantastic, and although I overlooked Lwr Abbey St, I slept fine every night.",4,2011,04,25
232,First choice in Dublin,"Wynns is always my first choice of accommodation in Dublin city centre for shopping, concerts etc.  It's located just off O'Connell Street at a Luas stop, with easy access to bus stops and around the corner from a taxi rank.
It is an old building and has some lovely period features, and rooms are clean, quiet and comfortable with TV, hairdryer and tea/coffee making facilities.
The bar and restaurant are beautifully decorated, the food from breakfast to dinner is excellent and the staff are all very pleasant.  The reception staff are also very friendly and welcoming, and will gladly take luggage after check-out.
All in all, it's the perfect hotel for locals and visitors alike and is one which always guarantees a faultless stay.",5,2011,04,18
232,Excellent,"From the minute we arrived at Wynn's we were treated so well by all the staff here.  They were very friendly & helpful.  We were told there were 2 private parties being held on the Friday & Saturday & there could be a bit of noise but we heard nothing.  Our room did face onto Lower Abbey Street & the Luas, but you get used to this and the rest of the city noises (we live in a very quiet town).  We also booked for breakfast which was beautiful & as much as you could eat.  Hotel was spotless & is obviously very popular as the bar and dining room were always very busy.  Bar prices were certainly not as pricey as some bars down the Temple Bar area.",5,2011,04,05
232,Great Location and Very Comfortable,"We stayed here one night at the front end of our trip before striking out into the country.  The hotel is perfectly located off of O'Connell Street with a tram stop literally outside the front door.  Despite the busy neighborhood, the hotel is surprisingly quiet.  The rooms are cozy and a bit dated, but in a lovely comfortable way.  The staff were very nice and extremely helpful.  

It's not a glamorous place, but it is exactly the kind of place we love - clean, well located, comfortable, friendly and cheerful.  We'd definitely stay again when back in Dublin.",4,2011,03,31
232,gone down hill,"i have never written a review before, but after my weekend stay here, i feel i must .
i have stopped here serveral times in the past, but as my subject says the hotel has gone down hill,  we where put into a room on the 2nd floor, the room wreaked of smoke,for the 2 nights stay we where subjected to  exessively load music which didnt finish till 1am , the reception where less than helpful, as i informed them i thought we had booked into a hotel rather than a nightclub.
the breakfast was better than the service.",2,2011,03,27
232,good location,"Great placement, big bed, rooms where smoking is prohibited so they do not smell and they have training room for free
the hotel and the room looks old. It could have been better soundprotected both from hallway, street and other rooms.
Service was ok, breakfast good.
free internet was great. Short distance to everything fantastic. Nightlife just around the corner. But sleeping to long in the morning was not easy beacause of noise.",3,2011,03,04
232,great location and very friendly staff,"A very nice hotel, with a great location, near the city centre, and a very friendly staff.",4,2011,02,28
232,The most convenient location if a little noisy,"Very central and convenient for Temple Bar, Luas(Tram), buses and shopping. Dublin's spire is only 2 minutes walk away. 5 min walk from the Bus station.

The hotel is a charming, period property with everything you need in your room including a fridge - not mini bar - so do take your oen drinks :). The staff are wonderful, so friendly and helpful.

If you can, ask for a room on the back as the front leads straight onto the Luas (Dublin's excellent tram service)  and it can be a bit noisy, especially if you are used to the peace and quite as we are. Other than that - typical city type noise and hub bub.

The breakfasts were wonderful - lots of choice. We had a few drinks in the bar one night and again, the staff were lovely. Not cheap though - but typical hotel type prices.

5 minute walk from Temple Bar area over the Liffy and 2 minutes from Dublin main street and lovely department stores.

Can highly recommend this hotel and we will definitely use again as we expect to return in the very near future.",4,2011,02,22
232,Staff make this hotel,"My wife and I stayed for 2 nights while visiting Dublin. This was our second stay in Wynn's which had been recommended to us by a neighbour.

The hotel is right in the city centre so it is extremely convenient for everything. ( We were going to the National Concert Hall which is a short walk. )
The rooms are very comfortable with tea/coffee making facilities. They are also quiet which we like.

However, it is the staff who really make your stay memorable. The lady on reception is attentive, efficient and friendly, even when she is busy.
The bar staff are also very welcoming ( especially the gentleman from Prague who, like the receptionist, had also impressed us on our previous visit ).

We wrote to the manager to express our thanks but thought we should also post this on Tripadvisor to let others know of our good experience.",5,2011,02,19
232,"brilliant spot, in a great location","Lovely hotel, with a 1950's glamour feel to it with big polished mirrors and shiny floors. Lovely clean room with a great view over the city's rooftops. I slept like a log. Ate several meals in the dining room, all great. Staff at reception were really helpful, especially the porters. All in all, a great choice for a break in the city centre.",4,2011,02,15
232,Hotel with old world charm just off the main street in dublin,Stayed one night in this old world oasis in the centre of dublin enjoyed my stay the rooms in this hotel have been tastefully decorated to reflect the age of the hotel but still giving you all of the comforts of today. I really enjoyed the breakfast in the morning with the full irish toast and coffee brought to my table no waiting at a buffet counter for the hot food or waiting for the toast machine. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone.,4,2011,02,03
232,"Great service, and about as central in Dublin as it gets!","I stayed at Wynn's last weekend whilst visit the Temple Bar TradFest.  As a wheelchair user, it's handy to have evertything close by, and to be only metres from the O'Connell Bridge was ideal.

On arrival, I was a little concerned to be greeted by a flight of steps, and had to ask someone to make a member of hotel staff aware I had arrived, however in no time at all, someone had arrived with a portable ramp, and this was sorted.  However, I would suggest that some sort of call button or intercom would be useful to connect with reception from outside.  

After checking in, it appeared that the lift was out of order temporarily too, but I was assured that an engineer had been called, and it was arranged for me to use a service lift instead.  Although this may sound negative, it was done with the minimum of fuss - indeed at one point no fewer than 3 staff were doing everything they could to help, which has very rarely happened in other, often more expensive hotels that I have stayed in.

One thing to note when staying at Wynn's is the proximity to the Luas.  It passes right in front of the hotel, so if you're in a room at the front, you can hear the trams easily.  Although not excessively noisy, it's worth bearing in mind that they start operating at about 6.30 am!  On balance, though, this shouldn't stop you from staying at this excellent hotel!",5,2011,02,01
232,"Beautiful hotel, great service","I stayed at this hotel in two parts, when first arrivng in Dublin as part of a two week tour and at the end of my tour.  I stayed in a number of hotels and this one was one of my favourites.  Walking distance to everything, great service and nice clean rooms.  They were so nice to my daughter (3 yrs old).  I had an issue with a late flight and they let us stay in a guest room at no charge for a few hours.  

I have travelled considerably with my 3 year old and I was given the best service from this hotel.  

My only complaint is that the street is for trams only now, so taxis and cars have to drive in front of the hotel illegally to disembark passengers.  Quite harrowing when you have luggage and a 3 year old, very dangerous.  I hope the hotel finds a way to change this.",4,2011,01,31
232,One of the Dublin's Best Kept Secrets.....,"I'm Shawn Silver from Newfoundland Canada. I have been staying at Wynn's Hotel regularly since 2003. I can state with complete honesty and without hesitation that Wynnn's Hotel, owned by Niall Loftus and family is probably one of Dublin's best kept secrets. In the day and age of mega/super/bigger means better hotels I am here to state that this hotel deserves every accolade it receives.It's charming, cozy beautiful centrally located downtown Dublin in a historic landmark.  The staff have become like family to me and this really is my home away from home. They are professional, concerned and caring and I will add that the staff are obviously happy there, they have been all the exact same staff since day one. Mr. Loftus runs a tight ship and it's evident in the cleanliness and beauty of this quaint and historic hotel. I have only been treated like a friend not as much a guest. The professionalism and customer care is second to none. I travel around the world and stay in many hotels. But I always look forward to my trip to Ireland mainly because Wynn's has become my second home and I can not readily say that about any other place in the world. It's easy to overlook this place in our big fast paced world. There's an old world charm with a very new attitude. It's sparkling clean, the food is second to none, it's situated right in the heart of the city centre, has every amenity one could want, but above all the staff are probably what sets this hotel apart from all the competition. Christina the manager, Mr. Loftus' right hand gal is an asset to the place knowledgeable helpful and pleasant. I have come to know each of the staff personally, simply because they make it their business to want to know you. Evelyne, Ann Marie, Roberta, Francesca and the staff on the front desk, the porters Robby, Paul, the restaurant and bar staff, James, Pavel, David, Trevor, Sunny the cleaning staff, Aileen and her team and everyone I'm forgetting all make my trip that much better. If we measure hotels by stars, the Wynn's gets 6. I was motivated to present the staff with a piece of Irish Crystal as a token of my appreciation complimenting everyone for making my stays so enjoyable and memorable. I recommend to anyone out there looking for beautiful rooms, cozy and elegant surroundings with hotel staff second to none, stay at the Wynn's hotel and you're in for a surprise. Wynn's Hotel is  affordable and I am sincere when i say, your stay in Dublin Ireland will be that much better because you chose it as YOUR home away from home. On top of it, there are dance classes held several times a week. As an Irish Dance teacher and performer I suggested to owner Niall Loftus  traditional Irish dance classes to tourists and visitors and without batting an eyelash, he got Christina the manager on it. These people know the hotel industry and are eager to serve you. If you're searching for a hotel in Dublin, your search will end here.",5,2011,01,19
232,a warm friendly family style hotel offering wonderful service and food.,"Represents the traditional cream of Irish Hotels. An old hotel yet fully modern in facilities. The atmosphere is warm, cosy and friendly.There is nothing like a carvery meal in the bar with a pint of guinness, surrounded by easy efficient friendly and helpful staff in the true Irish manner of old. Or a hearty Irish full breakfast. The hotel is very centrally located in Dublin, close to shopping, bars, and cinemas. I highly recommend Wynns.",5,2011,01,14
232,A comfortable home from home - like moving in with a friendly family.,"I stayed over the Christmas weekend 2010 and it was a lovely time. I'd not stayed in a hotel over Christmas before, so I was not sure what to expect. I did not need to be concerned. The staff at Wynn's were courtious, helpful and friendly yet professional in all aspects. I felt I had come amongst a close knit family. It was a lovely experience.

Actually I felt a little sense of disappointment  on the morning I had to leave.  I'm already looking forward to my next stay here.",5,2010,12,28
232,Hidden gem in centre of Dublin,This city centre hotel is vey good offering old fashioned style and service with all modern comforts.Staff very friendly and welcoming.Really enjoyed my stay.Would recommend this hotel to anyone,5,2010,12,24
232,Terrible room!,"The staff was really friendly and the welcome was great. I've read good stuff about this hotel but for me, this was not good. Perhaps they do not invest as much in the single rooms?

My room was really small and the view was a brick wall about 1 meter away. I was on the second floor but still I was really disturbed by the ventilator on the roof. Luckily I had some tape with me so I could isolate the window to make the noise tolerable. The room was still draughty (and this was only September). On one evening there was a private party at the hotel, which they had informed me about but it was very noisy!

The breakfast might have been good, but I guess full Irish breakfast is not for me. The location of the hotel was excellent though and the bus to/from the airport stops 200 meters away from the hotel.",2,2010,12,19
232,"Parking is a scam, must state Non Smoking Room","BEWARE.......Stayed at Wynn's on the 25th of November 2010 as part of a group of 5 couples because of the location and  FREE parking. The booking stated free valet parking for all guests and I rang ahead to find out where to park and was told I would have to book in at reception first and that the parking was on a first come basis. On arrival the receptionist told me all the parking was gone and I would have to use the public car park down the road. Having argued the case I resigned myself to the public car parking only to overhear a guest who had not yet booked in be told they had his parking space for him and the valet would collect his car.Four of the five couples had to pay for the parking 
I did not specifically request a non smoking room in the comments section of the booking form and the room we were given had a stink of cigarette smoke. We asked to change room and were given a room so small you literally couldn't swing a cat. I tried to sort it out with the manager about the parking the following morning and all he could say was the website was wrong and they would have to change it.So basically if you are DRIVING A CAR and are A NON SMOKER I suggest you stay somewhere else as the parking is a complete scam and state in all correspondence that you want a non smoking room. Management were unhelpful.",2,2010,11,28
232,Great location and great value for money,"Stayed at Wynns last weekend and thought it was great.  The receptionist was really pleasent and check in was hassle free and the valet parking is a lovely touch.  The hotel is old (in a little need of paint) but very clean and confortable.  Room was a little on the small side but again, very clean.  Bathrooms were quite modern and we had everything we needed in a room (iron, te, coffee etc).  There was alot of buzz about the place and it was clear that people came to use the hotel restaurant and bar from outside.  
There was a private function on on the Saturday night (which we had been advised about during check in) and as promised, music stopped at 1am.  I felt the hotel controlled the function and noise very well (though some of the party goers may have disagreed as i heard them giving off to managment the next morning as they had been asked to keep the niose down- congrats to managment!)  Breakfast was nice, not exceptional but nice.  Wynns is very central and great for a short break in Dublin, we will be back.",4,2010,11,16
232,LOVED THE WYNNS - EXCELLENT STAY,"Thank you again Wynns Hotel
LOCATION - EXCELLENT
STAFF - EXCELLENT
FOOD - EXCELLENT
Would we stay again - certainly
What a find and such a good price....",5,2010,11,08
232,Horrendous!,"All we wanted was a clean room and a quiet night sleep which seemed reasonable.  I did not anticipate that the hotel would have an event in their Ballroom which would result in music being played from 10pm to past 1am in the morning.  Which the staff advised me is common practice at the weekends, however omitted this when I was booking the room.  The music was so loud that even on the 4th floor I could hear every word the DJ mentioned!  The shower cubicle leaked and the water pressure was terrible.  Strongly not recommended.",1,2010,11,07
232,perfect nothing was too much trouble,"We booked for 1 night and was so impressed we stayed 2 and a third on our return loop, full of old world charm and old fasioned could not do enough for you hospitality on every turn above the car parked and bags delivered all the staff were more than efficient and pleasent even when we asked a local question the staff asked around until a chef appeared in the lobby with clear directions and a hand drawn map as backup, the food was great, the bar was warm and friendly the barman full of local knowlege, the rooms well appointed and very clean and comfortable, the location so central to everything, next time in dublin we shall return.",5,2010,11,04
232,Fit our needs perfectly,"My husband and I visited Dublin in October.   Having spent a semester in Dublin 10 years ago, I wanted a centrally located hotel that would be a perfect base for showing the city to my husband.  It wasn't so easy for me to chose a hotel, having never stayed in a Dublin hotel before.  I found Wynn's through TripAdvisor and we could not have been more impressed!
The location is fantastic, we were able to walk everywhere from the hotel- including the Guiness Storehouse.  The room was beautiful, comfortable and very stylish. The staff were all very friendly, helping us with directions and any questions.  They went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and accomodated.  Breakfast was tasty, and the server in the breakfast room welcomed us each morning, and quickly remembered us and our wishes.  We also enjoyed the atmosphere in the bar, where we enjoyed a pint and chatted with the bartender.  We are already looking forward to staying at Wynn's Hotel on our return trip to Dublin!",5,2010,11,03
232,"Great location, great service, very pleasant stay!","I booked this hotel with trepidation as the tariff was very reasonable and I did not know what to expect - what a pleasant surprise. Very attractive dining room and bar and very pleasant and helpful staff. Location is perfect - in Lower abbey st, just off O'Connell st, with tram going past door and buses just around corner. My room was small but well appointed and very clean and pleasant - bathroom spotless. When my electric jug suddenly stopped working I rang housekeeping and five minutes later had a new one. Breakfast  was included in the tariff and was excellent - again very pleasant and friendly service. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.",4,2010,10,24
232,Great location with a quality service,"I stayed in Wynns hotel with work colleagues. Check was quick, efficient, rooms were spotless, large showers with all necessary toiletries. Breakfast was perfect. We booked our next stay before we left.",5,2010,10,16
232,the location is the biggest asset of this hotel,"this was the first time i stayed in this hotel. i was very pleased with my stay. the check in was friendly, welcoming and very efficient. my room was on the 5th floor overlooking lower abbey street and was comfortable and reasonably quiet enabling me to get adequate sleep. two down sides as far as the room was concerned was the absence of wi-fi and no mirror in the room itself. the dining room at breakfast time is very relaxing and the food and service are of the highest standard. the ground floor reception area is cramped with no place to sit unless you went into the bar. my biggest complaint relates to entering and leaving the hotel.  all enclosed spaces and public buildings are smoke free areas in dublin so the hotel is smoke free which is fine for me. sadly the entrance porch was always filled with smokers and it was very unpleasant to have to walk through a wall of tobacco smoke entering or leaving the hotel. in other hotels and buildings smoking is not allowed within 10 metres of any door way or window which makes sense as the smoke does find its way into the hotel when the entrance door is opened. i also had problem gaining access and egress from the hotel since non residents tended to sit on the steps some even parked their bicycles there. on the balance of things my stay was enjoyable and i will use this hotel again.",4,2010,10,10
232,Great Old Fashion Hotel in the Heart Of Dublin,"Wynn's is in a great location just off O'Connell Street and just minutes from Grafton Street and Temple Bar.

It is very old fashion in that they have keys, as opposed to key cards, that you actually leave at the desk when you leave for the day.  It is a bit shabby with worn carpet etc but very clean and comfortable none the less.

There was a party in the hotel on the Saturday, which I was warned about on check in, but it really didn't disturb me that much as I was on the 4th floor.  I heard the music when it started and then fell back to sleep.

The breakfast was excellent both days.",4,2010,10,10
232,"...AN ELEGANT  HOTEL WITH  HISTORY , IDEALLY LOCATED IN THE HEART OF DUBLIN.","Our 9th. stay at Wynn's  and the service is always excellant..the staff are personable, friendly, helpful and they  make a point of knowing your name and nationality !!!. Our rooms are always clean, well appointed with the best of beds and fixtures .The hotel is located near the Abbey Theatre and O'Connell Street  in the heart of Old Dublin within walking distance of Trinity, Temple Bar. The bar and dining room are elegant and the afternoon carvery is to die for. .. occasionally the noise from the Luas fast train on Abbey Street can be loud...but not overpowering.A great place to mix and mingle with real Irish people who frequent the hotel.

232,"very clean, friendly and excellent service","I was driving to the hotel and did find it quite difficult drving through the city centre but when I found the hotel I was very pleased it was in a very good location to reach all amenities.  The hotel porters were excellent, they took my keys and parked the car and later in the evening I asked if I could get my car and they were very accomodating, the hotel porter got my car for me then left in back for me later in the evening (parking is first come first served).
The room was small but very cosy, comfortable and immaculately clean, I paid for a single but got a double room which was a nice surprise, also I did read other posts saying there was no tea/coffee making facilities, but my room did have these which was a pleasant surprise.
The breakfast menu would suit all different tastes and was very nice. I didn't have anyother meals so cannot comment.   I could not fault anything to do with this hotel, the staff were the most friendly, very approachable and accommodating I have ever came across and made my stay very enjoyable and comfortable, I would definitely stay here again.",5,2010,09,26
232,Top of the Heap,"when you travel with InRoads Ireland small group tour company, one of the hotels utilized by this company is the Wynn in Dublin, Ireland.  I have stayed there three times and the last time utilized their restaurant for dinner, not just breakfast.  I heartedly recommend the Wynn.  The rooms are lovely, very comfortable, and the food was very good.  During the week, dinner is served in the pub area and you can choose a carvery buffet.  It was great.  the hotel is very centrally located to shopping, other tours, the on and off tour bus, train stations, etc.  Personnel are extremely cordial and friendly and will help you with any advice you are seeking.",4,2010,09,23
232,Cozy and Charming,I found this hotel thru the Abbey Theatre web site.  It is located a half block from the Abbey Theatre.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The room is cozy and includes a desk.  The internet is free.  The Irish Breakfast is delicious and I loved the carvery dinner in the bar.  Never felt uncomfortable as a solo traveler.  Kind of like coming home - that's how welcoming the atmosphere.,5,2010,09,16
232,"Great Service, Great Location!","This hotel was located in a great spot, easy access to everything. The service was excellent. Rooms are a bit older and don't get a room near the back alley if you are a light sleeper. Definitely recommended to all. There is also free wi-fi!!",4,2010,09,13
232,Lovely Hotel and staff,"My wife and I and another couple stayed at Wynn's for the night of Monday 30th August.
We got a good deal for room and breakfast. 
The rooms were spotlessly clean. The lady at reception ( not Irish ) should give lessons on how to do this job; she was excellent in every way.
We had the buffet dinner in the bar and were very happy with the quality and the reasonable price. It was here we met the barman ( not Irish ) and found him to be an extremely helpful and considerate gentleman with a nice sense of humour.
We had booked to go to the Abbey Theatre and it was less than three minutes walk from the hotel. The location is perfect in the city centre.

Would we return? Our unanimous view was CERTAINLY.",5,2010,08,31
232,Friendly staff and a great location,"The hotel staff were amazing,so friendly and helpful.The location of this hotel was the reason we chose it but the staff were some of the nicest people we've met.The breakfast was excellent also. and the convenience of the local transport meant that a car was not neccessary.This was our first trip to Dublin but we'll be back !",5,2010,08,24
232,"Excellent, friendly and very helpful staff","We stayed for 2 nights at the end of a holiday in Ireland.  The hotel was excellent value and, as others have said, the location is excellent.  We enjoyed many aspects of the hotel including the free wireless internet, excellent cooked breakfasts, valet parking, accommodating and very friendly staff and the impeccable cleanliness of the hotel.  The general feel of the hotel was a kind of old world gentility.  Many of the guests appeared to be regulars and the bar and lounge areas were always very busy and popular.   

On the down side, and these are minor in the scheme of things, our twin room was rather small - had it been any smaller I would have asked to move.  Also, the basement gym is very well equipped but needs air conditioning.",4,2010,08,23
232,Excellent hotel,"Our stay was really really good. The service at the hotel is amazing, the cleanliness is impeccable and everybody is very friendly. The location of the hotel is excellent, it's the very center. The stay comes with full Irish breakfast included (as in ""all you can eat"" in the morning). The lunch can be a little bit expensive in the hotel restaurant but there are lots of other places in the center to eat at.
If you want to reach the hotel from Dublin airport, just take the bus 747 or 748. They make a different route but they reach the same destination that is literally a block away from the hotel. The 747 will leave you a O'Connor Street, and you just need to walk in the direction of the river (one block to Lwr. Abbey Street) and then turning to the left in that same street and you will be able to see the Wynn's Hotel. It seems small from the outside but it is actually quite big and, again, really impeccable when it comes to cleanliness and service. 
One of the things we loved as well, are the small but very very practical things that the bedroom has. Example: tea and coffee facilities with an electric kettle and different types of tea, an EMPTY mini fridge where you can put your own drinks that you buy at the supermarket or anything else that you like. Also, our room was in an L shape and the service at the hotel had put two TVs in each side of the room.
Really excellent service. I really recommend it.
We also went to Malahide Castle (beautiful trip if you guys are able to do it) and at the hotel they can give you information about restaurants or pubs to go to.
ALSO! Free fitness center (included in your stay!!). It's a little bit small though, but well furnished.",5,2010,08,21
232,excellent hospitality,"We were exciting of unusual hospitality and  service .
The staff is very friendly and professional.
Special thanks to Mrs Annemarie.
It worse to stay here !",5,2010,08,20
232,Great service & perfect location,"Just home from a very short (one night!) stay at Wynn's.  First time visit, though the hotel is my parents' favourite in Dublin. To be honest, I always found somewhere not quite as perfectly located cheaper but there are really good deals around these days and Wynn's proximity to the Luas and the Abbey Theatre was too good to resist.
We arrived very early for check in so I was unsurprised that our room wasn't ready.  We were made very welcome by the extremely pleasant and helpful receptionist who offered to look after our bags while I attended an appointment.  
I'd asked for a triple room with three single beds as I was staying with my two teens.  We in fact got a large L shaped room with a double, two singles and two tvs.  Our room and every area of the hotel we saw was spotlessly clean, someone is putting a great deal of effort into maintaining things like windows and brass and it  really does give a good impression.
We enjoyed a carvery lunch in the bar - get there early because it's justifiably popular.  Lovely food and really pleasant and attentive staff.  You'll need to be hungry, the portions are generous!
Breakfast is served in the gorgeous dining room.  I think Wynn's have cracked breakfast service - it's a combination of buffet for cold items and service for hot.  My teenagers are in a typical state of constant starvation so they love hotels with 'all you can eat' breakfast buffets, but I've found that the quality and temperature of the food suffer from standing and queueing!  This is not the case at Wynn's, the delicious breakfast we chose from a varied menu arrived hot and on hot plates too.  I must mention the dining room staff, the waiter and waitress we met were really lovely, just what you'd want to meet for a good start to the day.
This hotel is definitely doing a lot right - service in particular being exemplary, especially at front of house.  The only thing marring a perfect stay was the noisy air conditioning we needed on because our room was so hot  (but it was a particularly humid night when we stayed and I only have the heating on at home when it's literally freezing!). Even with that, I would love to have stayed for longer and that's most unusual for me, I'm usually relieved to get home from city centre hotels!
Great night's sleep, no disturbance, fantastic staff, lovely food and the best location in Dublin - steps from O'Connell Street with the Luas outside the door.  I would definitely recommend Wynn's to anyone who needs to stay in Dublin.",5,2010,07,29
232,"Great location, friendly staff, good food","Excellent location, close proximity to shopping areas, hop on-hop off bus stops... Good food, extremely friendly and supportive staff (a girl, serving guests for breakfast particularly!), clean and nicely furnished rooms. Rooms might look a bit small for a traveler, who lives in 250 sq.m. apartment :) and if I am to travel with my kids, I'f definitely need a separate room for them. The only thing that I could not figure out reasons for and did not like at all - two separate taps for hot and cold water, so I ended up brushing my teeth and washing my face in the shower.",4,2010,07,22
232,Wonderful staff in a central location.,Exceptionally helpful staff. Very anxious to please. Centrally located so you can walk to most tourist and restaurant sites. Valet parking only but no charge. Lovely dining room with excellent breakfast. Older hotel that has been remodelled. The internet worked only intermittently. The coffee was poor ( tasted like instant). Stick to the tea.,4,2010,07,16
232,centrally located plus great value for money,"I stayed in this hotel last week and i'm quite satisfied with the hotel service. Location is very important to me and this hotel is situated right in the city of Dublin. Staff were helpful and friendly.Room was spacious and clean. The other thing was, despite being in the city center, it was very quiet in my room which made a huge difference as i was able to really have a good sleep after a busy day/night! All in all, this hotel is good value for money.",5,2010,07,13
232,A Charming hotel,"A charming hotel with a touch of class from yester year right on the door step of O'Connell St. This hotel has a lovely feel to it and the moment you step inside your made welcome. The room was very comfortable, clean,  spacious and very nicely  decorated including a safe, Iron/ board. The only things missing was a full length mirror and complementary biscuits would have been nice to have with a coffee. Oddly it had a mini bar which was empty.  My room had  a  large bathroom unlike the one on the photo on this site though sadly it had no bath. The hotel advised me of a function being held on the first floor which would be on until 1am.  My room was only one floor above it on the second floor and never heard a sound. I was also impressed with the fact I could open the windows as I hate hotels where you are shut in with only aircon. The full Irish breakfast was good with  grilled bacon not fried and the option of eggs poached / scrambled or fried all served on a very hot plate. I would definately stay at Wynn's hotel every time I visit Dublin and hope you enjoy your stay as I did.",4,2010,07,05
232,Delighted!,"My first visit to this central hotel. But hopefully first of many.
The staff were welcoming & friendly. The dinner menu/meals were excellent.  Breakfasts were hearty. The lounge/bar areas were a bit too crowded - I would have liked another quieter one. The room was adequate. clean & comfortable. I was pleased to have an iron & board in situ,,(more than I expected from a 3-star hotel). I was on 5th floor overlooking Abbey Street, but didn't find it noisy.  The lift seemed a bit temperamental.  But,all-in-all this is a great hotel for a short or longer stay",4,2010,07,04
232,If in Dublin You MUST Stay at Wynn's Hotel,"As a 25 year old male, traveling with my 22 year old brother, I can say that Wynn's hotel is exceptional.  It has an atmosphere of both luxury and hospitality.  A delicious free breakfast provides adequate sustenance to cure the most brutal of hangovers, allowing one to enjoy the rest of their day in Dublin.  The staff is both accomodating and personable; the bartender, David Schwarz, in particular made our stay most enjoyable through genuine friendly conversation.  The hotel is walking distance from temple bar, it is in the heart of dublin.  I have never had a better stay in a hotel and never did I think I would feel compelled to write a review of  a hotel; however Wynn's hotel is just that good.",5,2010,06,20
232,very helpful staff and excellent hotel in every way,"overall this hotel is top class. the staff  wer very helpful and would help you in every way.
our stay was very enjoyable and when i need a hotel in dublin in the future i will definintely book here again,",5,2010,06,15
232,Nice Surprise,"My company forgot to book my accomodation so I found this hotel on the off chance and booked a room at a fairly good B&B rate.

The ability to utilise valet parking was a good bonus as driving to and from the hotel is difficult with the vehicle restrictions in the area. There are signs telling you that only bus, taxis and access only can use certain routes around the hotel so you just have to drive through taxi ranks, bus lanes and a tram line.

I was dismayed that they demanded I pay by credit card upfront and offered no alternative other than prepaying in cash. How odd for such a good hotel.

The lifts are incredibly slow but other than that you shouldn't find fault. 

The room I had was newly redecorated with an extremely comfortable bed and pillows. The room has blackout blinds, flat screen tv and a very nice en suite with no bath just a shower enclosure. The only issue I have with the room was the noise from street level. There are many many bums and stoners around the area hanging around the tram/luas line outside the door. I was on the top floor and they spoiled the otherwise very nice stay.

I arrived far too early for breakfast but the very helpful waiter allowed me have some continental whilst the chef fired up the kitchen. You have a nice view out onto the street and the vibration of the tram passing and people watching is enjoyable.

Ladies, the room did not have any full length mirrors at all which was rather strange for a very newly renovated room. I know my other half gets very annoyed at that.

I enjoyed the traditionally designed bar and the staff were friendly and I enjoyed having a chat whilst being otherwise bored in the hotel room.

Would I stay there again? Definately and have already recommended it to colleagues.",4,2010,06,10
232,The Wynns was a great hotel in a perfect location,"The Wynns is a friendly hotel with an upscale atmosphere.  The rooms were small, yet spacious.  Breakfast was quite tasty, but at times the serving staff was a bit overwhelmed (when the hotel was full).  The location is great - it is right on the city train and walking distance to the train station, all the major sites, and around the corner from the Hop On Hop Off bus stop.  The staff was quite accomodating, and the free internet always worked.  I would stay at this hotel again.",4,2010,06,08
232,Perfect for Dublin,"My wife and I stayed 3 nights,14th to 17th May 2010.  The location of the hotel was right in the city centre just off O'Connell St.  The reception staff were always excellent, efficient and friendly and made us feel very welcome.  The security person on the door parked my car on arrival and retrieved it when we were going home with no problems.  Breakfasts were brilliant and beautifully cooked fresh for you.  There was plenty of choice.  We enjoyed dinner at the carvery on  the Sunday afternoon. The hotel in general was very clean and our room was serviced every day.  All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone.  It is the perfect spot for Dublin tourism.",5,2010,05,30
232,"Perfect location for an Irish wedding, city centre, great craic, super staff","To all the staff and managment at Wynns, I would like to offer my deepest thanks for the wonderful night you provided to myself and my new wife last Friday, from the moment we entered to the second we left it was enjoyable throughout, and this was with the dedicated team you had on hand and of course Greg who initiated the night for me.

232,"Best city centre hotel, ideal for O2","My partner & I are from Dublin but moved to Wicklow a few years ago. When we have family events or parties to attend in Dublin, we always book a hotel, and this week we went to see Rod Stewart at The O2 in Dublin.
I booked Wynn's because I knew it was on the Luas line and located centrally which would be handy for after the concert.
We arrived at the hotel in the afternoon to be greeted by a very polite and curteous receptionist, who quickly checked us in and gave us our room key. We were on the 3rd floor, and the charming brass lift took us up the floors. Our room, which we specifically requested be at the front of the hotel, was very nice.
A large double bed and one single bed beside it, dresser, wardrobe, bathroom and TV,,, nothing spectacular to describe here, but very clean and that's all that matters to us.
Our view was of Abbey Street, and it was ideal for us because we like being surrounded by the buzz of city life; if you're after a quieter rest, definitely request a room at the rear of the building. There was one slight problem when we arrived; we noticed the plug sockets beside the bed weren't working but after a quick word with the receptionist, she swiftly gave us an extension lead and all was well again.
We had our meal in Saints and Scholar's bar, located beside reception. A charming, elegant place to unwind with a drink or relax over dinner; we chose food from the carvery menu and it was the best carvery meal I've ever had.
There is a restaurant in the hotel, but we fancied something quick so that's why we chose the bar instead.
We went off to the concert (brilliant) and returned at 10.30pm, and decided to have a few drinks in the bar. The barman, Mark, was extremely polite and chatty and made us feel very welcome as we sat over two of the best pints of heineken we'd had in a long time.
We slept very well that night. 
At breakfast, in the restaurant, we were welcomed by a very polite man with impeccable manners who told us to help ourselves to the breakfast table, while he returned with some tea/coffee.
My partner had kippers and said they were gorgeous, while I had some cereals and toast. Breakfast was a varied menu and enjoyed by us both.
Wynn's Hotel is located on Abbey Street on the Luas line; the Luas stop is right outside and the tram will take you right to the door of The O2 if you're going to a concert.
This hotel really impressed us and we will definitely return again.
The rooms are spotless, the staff are second to none, the food is beautiful and you're right in the heart of the city!
A winner all round!
PRICE MIDWEEK: €109 for two adults for one night, including breakfast",5,2010,05,13
232,Amazing staff and location,"We had to find this hotel at short notice (on the day we stayed) and was so lucky to come accross this hotel.  The location is amazing (right in the centre of Dublin just off O'Connells Street).  The lady on reception was so welcoming and helpful.  The rooms are very traditional and dated although the hotel is currently being refurbished.  The brrakfast was amazing, with cerals and breads avaiable and then breakfast off the menu made to order - this is all inlcuded in the room rate.  The gentleman at breakfast was very lovely.  The customer service and location of this hotel cannot be faulted.  I would not hesitate in staying there again",4,2010,05,11
232,The central location first attracts but it is the staff that make the place and will bring you back,I was not staying in the hotel but  organising a reunion for a Sunday afternoon. From the outset the staff were helpful and oblliging. On the day they had tables reserved although we had been unable to confirm numbers.  25 - 30 of us had a marvellous afternoon. It was a busy place but the staff were both courtesous and helpful.  We  had absolutely nothing to complain about and to top it all the chef is a dab hand at risotto -worth going for. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone. The luas stops outside the door.,5,2010,04,30
232,The Wynn's Hotel was very accomodating and the staff was very hospitable.,"I had a wonderful stay at the hotel.  It was actually extended because of the volcanic ash cloud, which shut down all the airports in Europe.  When I arrived hours before the standard checkin time, the staff imediately checked to see if the room was ready and allowed me to check in early.  After that the staff was nothing but curtious, and professional.  The service at the morning breakfast was exceptional, and the food was well prepared.  I only went to the bar once during my trip, but enjoyed it thoughly.  The bartender was very freindly and very funny.  Everyday, my room was cleaned and fresh towels were provided.  Since, my stay was extended I utlized their laundry service was was terrific.  I dropped off my dirty laundry in the morning, and had clean underwear waiting for me when I returned later that afternoon.

The best and most hospitable gesture I recieved was when my flight was cancelled because of the volcano, and I found myself stranded in Ireland indefinately.  They went out of their way to be accomodating and understanding of my situation, including lowering my nightly rate.

Not a single complaint.

232,Excellent location and service,"This hotel is very well situated just off O'Connell Street near O'Connell Bridge with tram (Luas) stop right outside the hotel front door. We had three rooms - had to change one of them as was too small but no problem with that. The staff are outstanding, particularly the porters/concierges who are very attentive and provide excellent service and helpful advice. They valet parked our vehicle and brought it to us on request, no problem at all - they are typical of the friendly and cheerful locals that we met everywhere during our stay in Dublin.The hotel itself is quite clean (maybe some of the carpets are a little worn) has a good atmosphere with good choices for breakfast. We had one evening meal there and it was very good. One comment however - we did not have sufficient storage space for clothes - no wardrobe or small chest of drawers in any of our rooms so were ""living out the suitcase"". Maybe okay for an overnight but not for a five night stay.
Would definately recommend this hotel and will return on next visit to Dublin",4,2010,04,09
232,"Ultra clean, comfortable, and exquisite breakfasts","We spent four happy nights at Wynn's Hotel enjoying a luxurious room, spotless bathroom, and the most HEAVENLY breakfasts ever (try their eggs benedictine); a wonderful start to our days exploring Dublin. The hotel bar and restaurant are also popular with non-residents who are out for a special occasion, so there is a definite buzz to the place and a feeling that Wynn's is treated like a superior and distinguished venue by them.

The location is absolutely perfect; you really are in the very heart of Dublin, walking distance from O'Connell Bridge, Temple Bar, and Trinity College, and the LUAS (Dublin tram) stops right outside the hotel door. The hotel itself has a beautiful exterior and a stunning stained glass awning.

The antique-style fixtures and fittings in the rooms are of an extremely high standard, but this is not at the expense of modern bathrooms and a swift brass and mahogany lift between the five floors.

My only quibble would the noisiness of the chambermaids in the mornings, who clattered down the corridors with vacuum cleaners and called to each other from different rooms from 7:30 am each morning.",5,2010,04,08
232,The staff were very friendly and professional,"Trinity GAA had our annual Sports awards ceremony in Wynn's Hotel recently and it was a great success.  The food and service were top quality and all our students had a great night.  We were made feel very welcome on the night and would have no hesitation in recommending Wynn's Hotel.  The central location is a big bonus but the staff made our night a huge success.

Thanks again from Trinity GAA Club",5,2010,04,06

232,"Shaky start, adequate value for money. Good location.","On arrival we were shown a room resembling a cupboard overlooking the dumpsters.  This ALWAYS happens when you use a discount hotel booking service and it just is annoying when you have to ask to move.  

Receptionist is very efficient and takes a bit of getting used to, she appears to not be listening but is in fact taking everything in and doing 10 other jobs at the same time.  

Breakfast was a mixed bag, fresh ingredients excellent (eggs in particular) bought in items (such as cereals and yoghurts) poor quality.  

We had a room with a fireplace and an uninspiring view. Bed comfortable enough but for no more than 2 nights. No newspapers offered, no WIFI, no biscuits etc. 

Good value for money for Dublin though.

Public areas upstairs a bit shabby looking and in need of painting in places.

This hotels main attraction is its location.  Right on the LUAS line and on the doorstep wit Temple Bar but far enough to actually sleep at night.",3,2010,03,24
232,The Excellent Wynns Hotel Experience,"For well over 30 years I have enjoyed the excellent facilities offered by Wynn`s Hotel, Dublin. For decades a party of over 50 adults has stayed for a long weekend at Wynn`s for the biennial Ireland v Wales 6 Nations rugby fixture. Wynn`s Hotel is centrally located in the heart of the vibrant city of Dublin, has a loyal and dutiful staff, competitive tariff and bar prices as well as an over-riding atmosphere of friendliness and efficiency.

To anyone, whether contemplating a business or leisure visit to Dublin, I can wholeheartedly endorse the many attributes offered by Wynn`s Hotel and feel confident that, like myself, you will return as guests whenever the occasion arises.

232,"excellent staff,food,ambience,location...a reminder to us all what a hotel should be.","I stayed for two nights in feb and am now planning my return visit. From the time I booked( via the phone) until I checked out I was very impressed by the customer care shown by all the staff. Everyone was friendly, polite,professional and yes .... there was always a smile. The level of hygiene was excellent in the rooms and I was in a smoking room and no there was NOT a smell of stale smoke. Plenty of hot water, clean towels and the heated radiator in bathoom is a great idea. The lounge area  has a warm and friendly atmosphere and has a constant quiet buzz from the customers. It is a very popular place to meet and/or eat. The food in the dining room was first class... so thank you to the chef and all the staff. Breakfast was prompt and, apart from your cereal,fruits etc., it was table service which was a big plus to me as I have disability and find it difficult to carry trays etc.The reception staff...what can I say... Excellent.  Location...couldn,t be better. Security..felt very safe. Spot the family run hotel in the city.. you cannot better it and I have stayed in my fair share of hotels. Keep it up ..... It,s an oasis in a city that has,at times, forgotten what hospitality means.",4,2010,03,15
232,Great Value Hotel,"I recently stayed in this hotel along with 9 other friends.  We all found the hotel to be clean and satisfactory. This is not a luxury hotel but you do not pay luxury prices. The rooms are ample and spotless.  The staff are fantastic, from the concierge to the cleaning ladies, there was a friendly hello or passing smile.  This is what made our stay so enjoyable. Breakfast was very good and service was quick and friendly. We had dinner in the restaurant and it was very good value again we were under pressure time wise and we found service to be quick and friendly.  You cannot beat this hotel for location particularly if you are travelling by train as you can get the Luas to the door stop.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and I will use it again in the future. It does what it says on the tin at prices that are affordable in what is an expensive city!!   Also if you are attending an event in the O2 Arena, perfect place to stay, the Luas runs from the front door of the hotel right to the O2 Arena.",4,2010,02,04
232,Excellent Hotel,"I have stayed in lots if hotels in Dublin and I must say this beats a lot of them. The staff are top class, friendly, helpful, efficient and always available. Checkin and out is done quickly. Rooms are lovely, spotless with lovely clean modern bright ensuites. Wifi is great. In the dining room the staff remember you and what you like.  The food is served hot and is excellent. The Porter takes your car at the door and parks it for you and helps you with your baggage. I havn't had this kind of service in some of the five star hotels in thus country. There is nothing more I could ask for - I'm really pleased.",5,2010,01,30

232,Old World Dublin,"Wynn's hotel was so comfortable and it's historic details make it notable. Staying here felt like being a part of the golden age of travel. We had a fine room, with a fireplace and a wonderful view out to downtown Dublin. When I return, I'll stay here again.",5,2009,11,24
232,"Night out in the ""Big Smoke""","A group of friends and myself decided to stay in this hotel as we were going to Vicar Street that night. 

Unfortunately on the way, the traffic was horrific and took us over an hour to get from Drumcondra to Lower Abbey Street. Also due to the Luas and re structure of the road layouts we struggled to get to the hotel. We rang the hotel and they directed us to a car park close to the hotel, however their Free Valet Parking (which is subject to availability) was full so we would have to pay for parking. If we had of know this we would have got the bus. 

We then walked from the car park to the hotel in the miserable rain and checked in. We were on the 5th floor and eventually after 1 hour of traffic it was a relief to finally relax. The rooms are basic: LCD TV, Bed and Bathroom. The bathroom has a hair dryer which worked well. Overall the room was comfortable and clean which are my main requirements. So I was happy. 

The location is the main feature of this hotel. It is right in the city centre along side O Connell Street, and you are within walking distance from Grafton Street and Henry Street. The Luas stops directly outside the hotel and bus services are very close too. Next time we won’t drive… 

However the shower facility was bit of a nightmare. The holding device for moving / holding the shower head was a joke. I couldn’t manage to get the shower head to be fixed in my desired position. It also kept spinning and falling on the ground after I tried moving it... Maybe I should have left it alone. Anyways as you can imagine I soaked the bathroom from ceiling to floor... ooooops!!! 

The next morning we went downstairs for breakfast, I went for the full Irish. It was lovely, freshly cooked and there service was friendly and efficient. 

Would I come back – doubt it. There are superior hotels in Dublin in the same price range. But if someone wants a central hotel this is perfect!",3,2009,11,16
232,Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It's the first time I was in a fantastic Hotel I mean the staff ,the services in general ,I was so impresses about many things ,it's in a good location ,in the city close to eveything ,you just walking and you can visit the main places.

232,central hotel but....,Stayed here for one night with my husband. Arrived early so we managed to get the free car parking in the hotel. Room was ready early also whic was great. First impression is that the hotel is a bit shabby. Carpet worn throughout the hotel and wall paper falling off on most corridors. We had room 372 and the whole floor and room smelt strongly of cigarette smoke!. Room was compact with 2 single beds and flat screen TV - only had 3 channels. Did not stay in the room during the day as we were eating and shopping. Did  not drink the bar of the hotel. When we checked in we were told there was a party going on in the hotel so to expect noise until 1am. This was a disaster. The music and noise felt like it was right outside our room. It was SO LOUD. I wore ear plugs but could hear the noise of the party still. It finished up after 1am. The only think I really enjoyed about this hotel was the breakfast. Lovely choice of food and the waiter in restaurant at breakfast is very good. Would not stay here again.,3,2009,11,09
232,Winning at the Wynn,"The Wynn was an extremely pleasant place to stay.  Having arrived at the awful hour of 7:00 am, I was given hot coffee and a soft seat to sit until I was ready to brave the shopping excursion at 9:00 a.m.  I stayed two nights, before and after my short trip and both rooms were very nice, clean, and well throught out.  The staff at the front desk were very cordial and always willing to give advice.  I would recommend this hotel as a place which was very close to shopping, the bus line, both from the airport and to excursions out of town.",4,2009,10,26
232,Wynn's was a little gem in every way.,"Our stay at Wynn's was just perfect in every way.The staff were friendly,courteous and most helpful in every way.The food was delicious at every meal.The rooms were clean and comfortable.There was no loud noise at night time.We had a wonderful few days there.Marian",5,2009,10,14
232,Very central and a taste of revolutionary Ireland.,Victorian with enough of the old feel. Not to smart. Plenty of wood. Good full irish breakfast. close to the Abbey Theatre and the river. A good place for a first city. We had no expectations but loved it.,4,2009,10,05
232,Charming hotel in great location,"Location is excellent, central for everything Dublin. I found it very quiet, other reviewers have mentioned noise from the trams on the street but I never heard a one.

The breakfast was freshly made to order and was very good. Not a huge selection, but unless you're staying for a month there's enough variety to keep you happy for days.

The room I had was comfortable and spacious, the staff were friendly and helpful.

The only negative thing I noticed (and it is only a small concern) is that it's starting to show its age just the tiniest bit. Loose door knobs, screws coming out, cupboard doors that don't quite shut right. But really, such things probably don't bother most people and it certainly didn't detract from my stay.",4,2009,09,13
232,Excellent,My wife and daughter stayed in Wynn's Hotel recently while they enjoyed a shopping weekend. They found the staff to be extremely helpful & courteous. The Doorman arranged for our car to be driven to the car park on arrival which allowed for a speedy and efficient check in. Breakfast was exceptional. Very good value overall but the staff are the jewel in the crown.,5,2009,09,02
232,cracking stay,"this is a smashing hotel, oozes character. very clean and stylish. lovely breakfast with table service, very nice and comfortable bar and lounge and friendly helpful staff. Couldn't fault the place. Right in the centre of the city, great location but very calm and peaceful inside. highly recommend a visit, well worth the reasonable price.",5,2009,08,31
232,rally cool!!,"Great 3 days stay! A great location in the heart of Dublin. A quick walk to Temple Bar.  Our room in 3st floor is very nice. Beds are comfortable and room is clean. Room is big enough. Bathroom was a good size with a powerful shower Staff were warm, hospitable and friendly and went out of their way to make you feel at home. Their restaurant   was excellent as well, they had a fantastic choice of dishes that tasted exquiste and beautifully presented. The bar had a lovely relaxed atmosphere. Overall i can't think of anything i would have changed. We had a great time in Dublin and would definitely stay at the Wynns again.",5,2009,06,04
232,"Excellent location, great staff and really clean & cosy rooms","I stayed in this hotel a couple of weekends ago. You can't get much more central than this location. Wynns is located in the middle of Dublin's 2 main shopping streets, Grafton St and Henry St and very near most of the main sites in the city which makes it ideal for popping in and out of while your out and about around the city. I found the staff very knowledgeable about the city and were only to happy to point us in the right direction for sites, shopping and of course the famous night spots of Dublin! 

The rooms were very clean and comfortable and the breakfast was great, really set us up for the day! 

I would stay in Wynns when/if I go back to Dublin ever again, and hopfully i will!",4,2009,05,22
232,Disappointing,"On a recent visit to this hotel we were late for breakfast by ten minutes. We were told that we could have tea and toast in the bar which we accepted gratefully.
However when we were asked for 11euro for a small pot of tea and two slices of toast we thought it a bit petty and mean in the circumstances.
This was all the more disappointing as we are regular guests to the hotel and always had the highest praise for it.
I may not go back again",3,2009,05,19
232,"Charming, convenient, good value","My partner and I stayed here for 4 days recently on our first trip to Ireland, and overall were very pleased.  The hotel was built in 1845, so it has old-world charm, but is kept up-to-date and very clean.  The location is very central so you can walk to everything. Our 5th floor room faced the street but was very quiet, and we could not hear the noise from the events in the hotel on the weekend nights.  The rooms are nicely done with traditional furniture, quite charming.  The hotel offers free valet parking, which was perfect for us as we had a car and used it to take day trips out of the city.  Be aware though that it is on a first-come, first-served basis so when we returned on Saturday evening we had to park in the nearby public garage at about 7 euros for the night.  The elevator was out of order twice, both times late at night, and once continuing into the next morning.  Wireless internet is free, but depending on your computer's wireless card it may not work on the top floors.  I had to go down to the bar to use my computer.  The breakfast is lovely, with lots of choices and excellent food, served in the attractive restaurant.  With the free breakfast, internet service, and parking it was very good value for money.  I would definitely stay here again.",4,2008,10,08
232,Not so impressed,"After a train and ferry ride from London, we arrived in Dublin and checked into the Wynn at around 2pm or so.  It's not far of a walk from the central bus station where our bus from the ferry terminated, and the hotel is very convenient to all of the other sights of Dublin.

The lobby area was small but nice, and the attendant was pleasant - obviously not a native English-speaker and with a really strange inflection to her voice, but nice enough.  We were given a back room on the 5th floor - quiet as I had requested since I'd read some reviews about the hotel being noisy.  We were warned that there were functions in the hotel Friday and Saturday nights that would run until 1am, but the noise never reached us a bit in our room.  The view out of the window was practically non-existent, but that didn't matter to me.

You can tell the hotel has been around for a long time, and much of the details of the building (i.e. woodwork) seemed to be original or nearly so.  For example the doors to the rooms were ancient with half a dozen locks and chains and such.  At check-in you're given a key with a giant brass doorstop-looking thing attached to it.  That's the first time I've ever had an actual key to a hotel room, I think.  The cumbersome attachment ensures that you'll want to leave the key at the desk when you leave the hotel - which I personally don't care for because anyone can walk in and say ""the key for room 521, please"" and be handed your room key.  But I know leaving the key at the desk is something that was once common to hotels.  That's one area I think the Wynn should upgrade.  Replace the doors and go with electronic locks - though there is a bit of charm to the old-fashioned key system.

The room itself was small (no surprise), and a little worn-looking.  The coverlet on the bed had seen better days, and you could see the body-indentions in the mattress plainly.  There was a desk with a chair and built-in mini fridge, a closet with a safe (read the directions for it first - it's different from the normal hotel safe), a flat-screen TV, and the bathroom with pedestal sink, toilet, and shower (no tub).  That shower was freakin' small, let me say.  There's barely room to squeeze into it and barely room to turn around in it, and I'm an average-sized female.  A big guy would have a hard time in it.

The air conditioner is controlled by remote control instead of by a normal thermostat, and it's annoying in the sounds it makes. 

The room was serviceable enough and clean enough for my pretty high standards in that area.

The Irish breakfast was in the nice dining room each morning (included in the room rate), and we enjoyed it very much.  There was the continental usuals, and you could order from the menu for hot items as well.

One little incident I have to mention occurred on our last night there, and it left a bad taste in my mouth, unfortunately.  There are these guys ... I can't really call them doormen because they don't do anything but stand on the front steps and smoke.  My husband had picked up a slice of pizza from a little place nearby and was carrying it into the hotel to take up to our room.  The ""doorman"" stopped us and proceeded to lecture us about bringing food into an establishment as if we were idiots.  The bar was packed that evening, and he obviously thought we were just coming into the hotel to drink and eat our contraband pizza. He assumed that instead of asking first if we were hotel guests. I looked at him like he was a moron and said ""We're staying here.""  He obviously didn't get it right away and went on with his lecture until a lightbulb went off in his head and he started talking about it being OK to take food up to your room.  That's exactly what we were doing until you stopped us, Einstein.  Ugh.  I was ticked off, and it was not a nice way to wind up our stay at the Wynn.

I'm not sure if we'll ever return to Dublin again since I didn't care for the city much (though we'll definitely return to Ireland to explore more of the countryside), but if we do, I'll most likely choose a different hotel.",3,2008,09,26
232,Disco hotel,"This is not a hotel. It is a disco. A very loud one.

Reception warned us when arriving on Friday there would be
music. It was. Loud. 

They did not warn us it would get worse on Saturday.

Sunday was also noisy but it stopped around 12 pm.

Maybe it´s quiet on weekdays. I don´t intend to find out.

I´ve been to thousands of hotels around the world. None of them have ever come close to decibels produced at Wynn´s.",1,2008,09,24
232,Wonderful,"This was our first time in Ireland and our first stop on our trip. The room was clean, quiet and comfortable. The staff were outstanding. We arrived a day late due to illness and weren't charged for the night we missed. They were very concerned that I was feeling better. We felt very pampered. The location was perfect as we had theater tickets for the Gate Theater and it was within walking distance. We were able to explore much of the city on foot from this central location. We hope to return to Dublin and the Wynn will be our first choice.",5,2008,08,12
232,attractive hotel,Wynn's Hotel is centrally located just off O'Connell Street in Dublin.  It is attractive both inside and outside.   The only thing that wasn't perfect is that the restaurant is a bit small and you may find yourself in line waiting to be seated for breakfast.,4,2008,08,05
232,Not good value,"We stayed at Wynns between 24th and 26th of May this year and although the hotel has a certain Je ne ces quois- being very old, and centrally located, it is certainly not worth the 175 Euro per night that they charge. The rooms are very small compared to rooms three times the size for two thirds the price we have stayed in elsewhere in the world. You are being charged purely for the location.
For an excellent night out in Dublin go to the Arlington Hotel near O'Connell bridge, 28.95 Euro buys you a three course meal and a great show of Irish music and dance.",2,2008,05,27
232,First Class,First class perfect location and good value will stay again,4,2008,04,24
232,Enjoyed Wynn Hotel,"We stayed for three nights in November, 2007.  We'd requested a quiet room and were given one on the top floor, back.  The room was very clean and comfortable, with the view as shown in another poster's photo.  Considering the cost of hotels in Dublin (and the weak U.S. dollar), we felt it was a good value.

Staff forewarned us there was a party scheduled downstairs our first night there and we did hear some noise and music.  The only true disturbance was the fire alarm that was pulled late evening.  Though a call to the front desk said not to worry, it was nonetheless disturbing.

Breakfasts are offered in their slightly formal dining room, a pleasant setting.  Nothing inspired, but a good, basic Irish.  We ate dinner in the onsite pub on a Sunday evening at the carvery and would be hard pressed to recommend the fare -- boiled vegs, rather tired salmon.  I'm not sure it offers table service as we couldn't get any.

The location is great, steps from O'Connell Street, and within walking distance to many sites and most buses.  We took a bus in from the airport, hopped off, and were at the hotel in minutes. 

My husband fell ill during our stay and staff at the front desk was very helpful, telling me where to find a doctor if we wanted to walk (there's one quite nearby) and calling one to our room since he couldn't go out.  They called for me, made arrangements, and allowed the visit to be billed to our room.  (The doctor actually arrived in less than a half hour, astounding to this U.S. native. )

We wanted to extend our stay since Hubby wasn't fit to travel.  Wynn's was booked solid but they recommended another hotel not far away, called and booked a room for us, and arranged a cab as well.  They were very helpful and the alternate hotel was quite suitable.  

All of their assistance was gratefully received since it was very unsettling for my husband to be unwell so far from home.  Coupled with a nice room and good location, it was well worth it to us.",4,2008,04,04
232,Great Location,"Stayed here for a two night city break.  Location was excellent, just off O'Connell Street with both the Airport and Sight-seeing bus stops just a few minutes walk away.  Temple bar area was only about 5 minutes walk away, so close enough to walk to but just far enough away from the late night noise.
The hotel was elegant, old fashioned style, rooms were clean and tidy, we had a back room on 4th floor, no views but did not experience any noise.  Full Irish breakfast was excellent, with more than enough to eat.  We found staff to be friendly and helpful when called upon.",4,2008,03,29
232,Excellent location to discover Dublin,"Stayed at the Wynns Hotel for four nights. The main reason for choosing this hotel was because of it´s location. The bus from the airport stops 100 m from the hotel entrance, very convenient. The room I had was on the top floor (#524) facing the street, which I soon discovered was a good thing since it was St Patricks weekend. Every night boozed up people were rambling in the streets until the early morning hours, but I´m quite a hard sleeper so I was not to bothered. The room was just fine, clean, comfortable bed, nice bathroom with powershower. The cleaning up was nicely done every day. One good thing with this hotel was that the room rate (100 euro) included full Irish breakfast. The breakfast itself was not too exciting but quite OK and definitely filling enough. The only problem I had was that some of the staffs english was less than perfect which caused a few minor misunderstandings, none to troublesome however. I must also recommend the neighbouring  Grand Central Bar for a drink or pub meal in the afternoon. Very friendly staff and nice interior. The location of the hotel was excellent for either walking the city center, everything within easy reach, or if you have to take bus somewhere the bus stops are just a minutes walk away on O´Conell street. Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel if are not in need of 5-star standards, would say this is a very good 3-star hotel.",4,2008,03,17
232,"Not Fancy, But Comfortable","The property may be a little worn and old-fashioned, but the rooms are more than adequate, the staff are extremely friendly and very helpful, and the location is unbeatable. Breakfast was OK but not exceptional. I paid just over 90 Euro per night and thought that was fair.

Some have noted problems with noise; I was warned by the staff about events in the hotel for two of the three nights I was there and on one evening I could hear faint music, but in my third floor room the volume was not objectionable and I had no difficulty going to sleep.",4,2008,02,22
232,brillant location,"Easy to find, and close to everything. Just off oconnell street, 5 mins walk to temple bar. Staff were friendly. Rooms were fine, bathroom was clean and bright. only thing was we were on the top floor were ceilings were slanted and i hit my head, so be careful. Also the hair dryer was one of those ones - a box on the wall with a hose attached in the bathroom.",4,2008,02,20
232,Well satisified all pro's no con's,"Stayed 2 nights 

LOCATION : could not be better just off O'Connell Street in a quieter side street  Close to bus stops and modern trams stop outside! 

ACCOMODATION: 
we were upgraded to a junior suite at no extra cost: huge room, inc 2 wall mounted tv's 'lounge' area with chairs and books! and plenty of coffee and tea The bathroom also had a jacuzzi bath and shower

The hotel is of a traditional style high ceilings wood panelling but 'bright' 

STAFF: all were extremely friendly and helpful - nothing too much trouble 

TRANSPORT TIPS: buy a 'hopper' pass - includes Airport bus express link - takes 30/40 mins from airport to centre of  Dublin - run every 10/15 mins  / pass also includes city centre tour -takes 1.1/4 hours well worth it  - all main sites covered and you can also use general buses in Dublin for the price within the pass purchase 

SIGHTSEEING: you could walk to most of the city cente sights but the hopping on and off using the bus pass is very welcome for tired feet! 

We throughly enjoyed Dublin and whilst we do not make a habit of returning to the same place visited we would have no hesitation in using Wynns hotel again",5,2008,02,13
232,Great Hotel,"Well just arrived back from one night at the Wynns, 6 of us stayed for one night and 7 for two nights for my sisters 40th Birthday, Rooms we had were mostly triples and believe me very surprised at how  much space, at one time most of the party was in. Decor looks like just been refurbished no bath only shower. There was a function on first floor on Saturday night and music very loud but was told when booked in it would finish at one and it did. Breakfast first class, last thing, did want to know how much taxi from airport would be before i arrived and never found out, well it was 35 Euros for the 6 of us, and asked to book him for return and he told us no problem will be here.On time there he was. Hotel was right in the middle of everything would recomend it .",4,2008,02,04
232,A Happy New Year at Wynn's,"I was really worried about the noise at this hotel after reading previous reviews but really I needn't have worried.
My husband rang up and booked direct (a superior room with breakfast) and the staff were really helpful and gave us a good deal.
On arrival we were impressed by the character of the hotel and the friendliness of the staff. Our room was on the 2nd floor, facing the street, right above the ballroom and that afternoon there was a singing group practice on which we could hear, but it finished at 4pm. The reception told us no other functions were on so it wasn't a problem.
The room was fine, the double bed was 2 singles zipped together and the duvet could have done with being a bit wider but it was very comfy. The bathroom was big and had a lovely jacuzzi bath. The only thing to say to you girls is take your own hairdryer as the one in the bathroom is one of those swimming baths hose on the wall ones, not very powerful or easy to use!!
It was great to have a (empty) fridge in the room for your own bubbly etc.
The staff were helpful, a lightbulb and tap were fixed promptly.
The breakfast room was beautiful and food ok, it was packed at 10am on new years day morning but we didn't have to wait very long for our cooked food.
Finally the noise issue... Because the location is so fabulous (it is in the city centre) there is bound to be outside noise at night. It's a young/fun persons city, it's easy to stay out past midnight and breakfast is til 10.30 so just go out and enjoy yourself!!
We had a great new year and would go back to Wynns as it is such good value and in a fab location.",4,2008,01,03
232,A nice place to stay right off O'Connell Street,"My wife and I enojoyed my stay at Wynn's Hotel very much. Traveled to Dublin from Belfast on the train and arrived at Connolly Station. Wynn's was located nearby and was easy to find. The stretch of Abbey Street that Wynn's sits on was fairly busy and noisy, this but did not disturb us even though or room faced the road, which was surprising.   Expect normal city noise but not a large number of late-night revelers returning home in the wee hours of the morning.  There were a few, but not enough to be out of the ordinary.   The hotel's outer facade is very nice. The staff was courteous and helpful. Our room was clean and well appointed, if a bit small. It was quite comfortable, though. We ate dinner in the hotel's lounge area. It was fine. Breakfast was tasty and cooked perfectly. Overall, an excellent stay and good value for money. Two minor complaints: firstly, our room key was attached to a heavy brass weight of awkward shape. This made it very difficult, if not impossible, to carry in your pocket. Secondly, the lobby and restaurant areas smelled strongly of cabbage in the evening.",4,2007,12,24
232,"Noise, and more noise","I've just returned from a disappointing stay at the Wynn's Hotel in Dublin. 
On a positive note, the hotel is in a central Dublin location and the staffs (with the exception of a manager) were really courteous and friendly. Breakfast is served until 10.30am in a relaxing dining room and the food was good. My room was clean with ample bed linen and toiletries. The decor in the rooms was becoming a little tatty, but more than acceptable, however the corridors were showing the abuse from passing suitcases etc and are in need of urgent attention. 
The problem I had with the hotel was the noise which was two fold. Firstly, the hotel is situated a 30 sec walk off of O'Connell St and the noise from drunken people could be heard through the night. Screams were heard on a regular basis till almost 5am. Maybe this is accepted as the norm in city location hotels, but at the very least I feel that double glazing would have helped to reduce the noise. 
The reason why I have rated this hotel as terrible is due to the second noise problem. My first night in the hotel was a Saturday night and the hotel had hired out one of its conference halls for a private function where they were having a disco. The room the disco was in had no sound proofing and the disco went on until 1am. My room was situated above the disco and the noise was unbearable. After complaining to a manager who either did not care or was fed up with all the complaints I was moved to a different room 2 floors higher. The noise in the new room was still loud although I could hardly hear it when the TV was at a high volume. In my previous room I could not even hear the TV due to the music! I can't imagine that any guests that night were able to relax in their rooms until the music stopped at 1am. 
It amazes me that the Wynn's hotel would book a function that would annoy ALL of their guests - this lack of respect amazes me. For this reason alone I will never return or recommend this hotel.",1,2007,11,27
232,Lovely old hotel - great location,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Wynns  for a Saturday night before flying back to Madrid.
I am originally from Dublin and Wynns was always a hotel I wondered about.  (it has fantastic stain glass windows)  It was a popular hotel - very historical - but it had got a bit run down over the years.
While searching for a hotel I read that it had been refurbished and I decided to give it ago.  The rate was good for a Saturday night in Dublin. (A busy weekend if I remember correctly.)

At arriving at the hotel the reception area is very small and old fashioned - but it's an old hotel so this is to be expected.
We were checked in and given an old style key - very atmostpheric.  however, our room was not ready - fair enough as we had arrived early.  They took our bags and stored them while we took the opportunity to wander around the city.

When we returned to our hotel our room had indeed been refurbished.  A beautiful big bed, (a proper double, not two singles pushed together!), v.comfortable, and many, if not all of the original features in place.  And a flat screen tv. 
We were facing the road so we could hear the LUAS but this is to be expected in a city center hotel.

The breakfast was excellent!  A real old-style feed and the service was excellent.  Couldn't ask for better!!

The hotel is old and the rooms have been refurbished some of the public areas are still a little shabby - stair well.  The lift had some problems too.  But I have to recommend this hotel on the basis of a good room, great breakfast, and plesant staff!",4,2007,11,21
232,what a location!,"location:excellent,right in the middle of abbey st,just off o connel st.2 mins from gpo.

lobby and rooms:lobby is old style lobby and not that comfortable.the rooms are of average size,clean and with sat tv.
 
bar & food:we did not have a drink in the bar.the breakfast was lovely.full irish breakfast with great service.

extras:located in an excellent position for anyone who wants to tour dublin.lots of pubs,shop etc located near the hotel.

overall i would recommend this hotel for tourists.the hotel is an old style hotel but kept in good order.the room rates are not bad for the location.",3,2007,11,14
232,Grand hotel with old fashioned style,"A good old fashioned hotel right in the middle of things - but a step aside from the stag and hen beat. We asked for a quiet room and got it - right at the top of the hotel and at the back. The view of a scruffy back alley wasn't that inspiring but it was as peaceful as one could expect of a city centre hotel. Staff helpful and polite - informed us on check in that there were functions planned for Friday & Saturday nights and there would be music 'til 1am... and there was. Loud thumpy stuff for a 21st party and folky Irish giggy stuff for a 50th birthday - but it did finish at 1am as promised.
Rooms pleasant and well looked after. Public rooms very 1920s grand - nice to know that you're staying where history was made. The seeds that grew into the IRA were sown at a meeting at Wynn's. Breakfast variable - different chef each morning. Bar a haven from the hurly burly of Dublin streets and the Guinness is great. 
A family owned establishment that beats the chains - but not for you if you're impatient or over demanding",4,2007,11,12
232,Not Happy Campers,"We recently stayed in the Wynns Hotel in Dublin.  Prefect location for shopping just off the main street. Staff were friendly, however our room was at the front of the Hotel facing the main street and the Luas -tram line. We were unable to close both our hotel window and curtains,resulting in a cold draught and very loud street noise. It was a very cold night and no extra blankets were available.  The room had a stale smell of smoke and was in need of decorating.",2,2007,11,12
232,We Love the Irish and want to go back ASAP,"Wynns hotel is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in for so many reasons. 
The hotel's location couldnt be any beta. Its just off the main street of OConnell Street and is walking distance from most of the main attractions. 
The hotel itself is really lovely! The rooms are ideal. Although not the most modern decoration- the rooms are clean and tidy and have everything u need including a hairdryer, iron and ironing bored. As well as a flat screen tv. 
Staff are so unbelieveably friendly. They bend over backwards to help and assist you. 
The food is nice and again the waitressing service is excellent.
We will defnitley be staying there again on our next visit to Dublin .... 10/10.

232,Excellent experience,"Wynn's is just off O'Connell street, about a block from the river.  Its within easy walking distrance of most everything, while still being out of the fray.  O'Connell St. is on a major bus line, including for the airport shuttle, and the LUAS (tram) stop is right outside the hotel. Our room was huge.  It had a separate sitting area and an immense bathroom with a spa tub.  There were two flat screen televisions.  The room was spotless and appeared to have been recently refurbished.    The bed was very comfortable - not the usual rock hard hotel mattress. The bedding was of high quality.  The bath towels weren't as plush as I would have expected, but the towel warmer made up for that. There was even a small refrigerator so I could keep my Guinness cool.  The only thing the room lacked was internet access.  (There is an internet cafe just around the corner.)  Breakfast was cooked to order and was very good.  The dining room was comfortable and the service excellent.  I had a little trouble staying away from the hot scones with Irish butter.   Front desk staff was also excellent and very helpful with suggestions and directions  for sightseeing.",5,2007,10,12
232,"Great Location, but needs updating","We arrived at the Wynn Hotel mid afternoon, I had booked the hotel through ebookers, and got a fairly good deal which included breakfast.

The outside of the hotel is very impressive, very old and full of character, and the location was excellent, just off O'Connell Street.
Reception area was small, but very nice, lots of shiny brass, and one
very slow lift. Which wasn't working when we got there, so we had to climb 4 flights of stairs.

On entering room 408, we realised we were at the back of the hotel. The view was dreary and so was the room. Overlooking a back alley, fire escapes and pigeon poo. 

The room was very clean but had very dark furniture, which overtook the room. The bed was small (reg double) and the bathroom looked as though it had been patched together. We also noticed that there were no smoke detectors or door closers on the doors (don't know whether irish regulations are different), so you could guarantee being woken up by a door slamming from 6:30am. VERY ANNOYING!

I did ask about changing rooms, but there were no other double rooms available. On the other hand the staff were very helpful and the breakfast was superb. All in all we had a great couple of days, but thank goodness it was only a couple of days, our room was so depressing.

P.S If you're thinking of booking this hotel, request a room at the front of the hotel. Trust me, i saw a few of them while the maids were cleaning. They are so much nicer and brighter.",3,2007,10,08
232,excellent hotel,"top class hotel. small room but spotless, we stayed on 5th floor so very quiet. breakfast very good, staff friendly & helpful. would stay here again, highly reccomended.",5,2007,09,27
232,wynns worth a visit...,"Stayed at wynns hotel from 31st august through to 4th september,an i must say that i was pleasantly suprised by the quality of the hotel,the room  was plenty big enough to accomodate both myself an my girlfriend with all the luggage,our room was on the 4th floor at the front of the hotel,due to the room having no air conditioning we had to have the window open as it became very hot at night,having the window open was fine until it was kicking out time at some of the many nightclubs,( shouting and screaming as the drunks made their way home....hic !) had the room been airconditioned it would have made for a good nights sleep,as we would have been able to close the window,but hey ho its a city an good on the peeps that were enjoying themselves !

also found the staff very polite and helpful,the breakfast in the morning was superb and not to be missed.

all in all would definitly stay here again as the location is yet another plus point for this hotel as its close to all the major shopping streets in dub, an temple bar is just around the corner...
",4,2007,09,12
232,Always a great stay..we keep coming back!,"We have stayed at Wynn's four times and keep coming back.  For the value, location and friendly staff it is hard to beat.  The rooms are very clean with flat screen t.v, warm towels in the bathroom and a double and 2 single beds in the rooms-perfect for a family.
The location is minutes from Temple Bar and O'connell street and all the attractions ate an easy walk away.
The breakfast included in the rate is excellent!  We have also had dinner at the hotel throughly enjoyed it-freat value.
Tip:  request a room in the back of the hotel and avoid the noise that others have complained about.
We have recommended this hotel many times and will contine to enjoy our stays here.

232,Very well located,"This hotel has a great location in the centre city of dublin, few steps from O'Connell Street
Clean and well decorated
Staff gentle and helpful
Irish and continental breakfast delicious
Very good hotel+++

",5,2007,08,24
232,Perfect Location,"The hotel is in an absolutely perfect location, within a 10 minute walk of everything in dubin, as the city is fairly small. It is within staggering distance of the Temple Bar area, but far away enough so it is nice and quiet. We stayed on a top floor room which was fairly good as you were further away from the noise of the trams which stop directly outside, but they didnt disturb at all really. 
The staff were all friendly and helpful, the breakfast was nothing special,but nice anyway we got a full irish every morning of course. 
I would recommend this hotel to anyone becuase of its perfect location. I also would insist to anyone going to stay in Dublin to go on the Viking Splash bus tour, it was the most hilarious, amazing touristy thing i've ever done!
",3,2007,08,15
232,Wonderful hotel,"We had a great stay at this hotel, the room was newly decorated and the bathroom large with a corner whirlpool bath.  Flatscreen TV on wall. We overlooked the front of the hotel.
The breakfasts were superb and included in the price we paid. You could choose from Continental with freshly baked scones or freshly cooked full Irish, including kippers and porridge. Some greedy  people had Continental and cooked!!!
We ate in the bar several evenings which was very good. The staff worked extremely hard. The dining room was very up market, beautifully decorated.
The only problem was that the bar was very crowded so not easy to get a table for an evening meal.
An excellent hotel in every way and we won't be staying anywhere else in future.
",5,2007,07,31
232,great location,"Stayed at this hotel for two nights.   Hotel is in a great location as it's two minutes from O'Connell Street and the Liffey.  Room was very clean and adequate. Our room was at the front of the hotel so there was some noise which is to be expected from any city hotel.    Staff were extremely helpful and friendly.     Breakfast was very good and we also had dinner at the hotel one night and the standard of the food and service was very high.   All in all an enjoyable stay.

232,"Central Hotel, Good Value","We stayed at this hotel for our one night in Dublin in June as I had read the reviews of this hotel on TripAdvisor and it seemed the best within my budget. 
The hotel is in an excellent location for exploring the sights, just a stone's throw from O'Connell St and the River Liffey. The buses, taxis and tram are all very close by.
We had booked  a superior twin room that was spacious with a large bathroom and the room was clean and perfectly adequate. The bathroom had a power shower and jacuzzi bath. There was some noise from the trams and road outside as our room had a street view, but only to be expected in the city centre! The only unusal thing was that the tv, lamps and fridge were all unplugged when we arrived and even one of the bulbs was not in place! Not sure whether this was the staff or the previous occupants! 
The breakfast (included in the room price) was lovely and the staff very friendly and helpful. We arrived very early and although we could not access the room until 2pm, they accommodated us and our luggage with no problem at all.
Overall - particularly in relation to the location - would be happy to stay there again.

232,Good Value and Location,"Located 1 block from the River Liffey and next to one of Dublin's major avenues, O'Connell Street, the Wynn is an excellent value when compared to other more expensive hotels in downtown Dublin.  Our room included a high definition TV, complimentary coffee, a safe, and a made to order breakfast served in an elegant dining room.  Think historic boutique hotel.  Room rate was US $160, but other hotels in the area ran well over US $200.  Staff was very friendly and provided us with information on where to catch buses and trains.
",4,2007,04,13
232,Great hotel and reasonablly priced for Dublin,"Dublin hotels are terribly expensive, so the Wynne is a great deal. It is across the River Liffy, but is only one block away from the river. It is very quick and easy to explore Dublin from this location. We found that many locals frequent the bar and restaurant, so this told us that the hotel was good. Our room was nice and was very clean and the bath was very good. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. In fact, the bellman found my change purse on the floor of the hotel lobby and turned it in with all the money in tact. I was amazed and tipped him well! The dining areas and bar have been lovingly restored and the hotel has many antiques and interesting pictures.  The hotel was excellent for us -- nice and a good deal. Christie White Osceola, AR

232,Dublin Divas on Tour March 2007,"This was our first stay at The Wynns hotel and as a group of four ladies we found this hotel lovely. Staff were helpful and friendly. Rooms were of a good standard, clean and tidy. Room service was excellent. Was literally a two minute walk to Temple Bar bar area and the shops/cafes were just outside too.  Bar area and food were good, although we only ate here for one night. Would highly recommend this hotel and would most definately go back.

232,Wynns Hotel March 07,"Stayed at Wynns from12/3/07 for 3 nights. Best location . Room more than adequet and very clean. Stayed on 4th floor at the front.  Some noise from trams but not enough to be a problem. Some work still going on some drilling noise during day.  Lovely old hotel with elegant dinning room. Bar prices cheaper than most bars we visited. Breakfast fine lots of choice and good service. Lift a bit hit and miss think it gets tired and needs a rest every now and then.  Seems to start working without anyone doing anything to it. Would definitely stay again if got at same price £195  for double room with breakfast for 3 nights booked with Octopus.

232,This hotel ruined our vacation!,"Booked 2 rooms for 1 night. Prepaid over $400. for these rooms. What a mistake. Read other reviews. Mgt. places online booking guests right over room where parties with bands play until 1AM.  Other rooms are available but for some reason we are penalized. I was tired from a long train ride and wanted to sleep at 11 PM. Big mistake-Band started Playing and it seemed as if I was in the room. Loud music blaring. Went down to complain to Mgr. Neil Loftus. Only offerered to move me to another room after  1 1/2 hour. (12;30 AM} Only did that after I insisted he call Orbitz with my complaint. Told me it was no sense to call because she couldn't help me anyway but I insisted. Agree with other reviews. ""Mgt. made me uneasy"" If a hotel can ruin your vacation this one will.  Orbitz thought I was due a refund but Mgr. refused.  Sour Dispositions all around.Why is every body so unhappy?  Another reviewer felt Mgt. displayed some contempt toward them and I felt the same way. Had a sneer that you couldn't ignore.THIS IS A NASTY PLACE. The staff does seem to be apolegetic for unpleasantness.  of Mgt.  It was a nightmare and we woke up early the next morning and left. Never to return.

The Reception staff were very friendly too.  The room was a bit small but we were only there for the night no bath in the bathroom  only a large shower which to be honest I prefer.
The breakfast was fantastic lots to choose from.  This hotel was a great find, fabulous price , will be returning!

We loved the warm towels in the bathroom.  We loved the history and the old world charm.  The location was great for walking, shopping,  Dart, and night life.  The breakfast was a great way to start the day.  The people were so friendly and helpful to us.  We hope to go back.

The room was clean and newly refurbished and the shower was fantastic.  The staff were friendly and kept our luggage on the final day until we needed to leave for the airport, giving us more time to explore the city.  The breakfast was excellent with more than enough to last you through until the evening and the bar prices were cheaper than many of the pubs in the area.  If I return to Dublin I will be staying at this hotel without a doubt.

232,Fantastic  Find!,"We visited the hotel for 2 nights just after Christmas. The hotel itself has a real charm, its history is very interesting. Our double room was very spacious, clean and comfortable. No bath but the large shower suited us fine. Staff were efficient and courteous, particularly in the restaurant. Breakfast was included in the room rate and was brilliant - free choice from continental and then a choice from a large cooked menu eg full Irish, eggs benedict, kippers etc. Freshly cooked and delicious! The hotel is in a brilliant location, close to pubs, restaurants and shops. A must is a visit to the Arlington Hotel where you can have a fantastic evening of traditional Irish food, dancing and music - we had a great night  out here.
I have no hesiatation in recommending Wynns and am looking forward to a return visit.

232,Highly Reccomended!,"If you are staying in Dublin then I doubt that you could do much better than booking Wynns Hotel in Lower Abbey Street.
It is right on O'Connell St and by the River Liffey, just a couple of minutes walk from Temple Bar. It is handy for the bus stops to and from the airport and for the city tour buses and the trams.
The hotel is a beautiful traditional building over 150 years old, and has some beautiful decorative touches. The dining room is superb, with an ornate ceiling and beautiful big mirrors (and Villeroy & Boch tableware), and the bar has a nice ceiling and chandaliers
Breakfast good and plentiful.
Rooms nice, have fires and LCD TV's.
Not expensive - ideal.",5,2006,12,07

232,Perfect Base,"Just got back from staying at Wynns and felt compelled to write a review because before I booked a hotel I spent weeks reading reviews for different hotels and couldn't decide which one as I was worried about the bad comments. In the end a friend i was travelling with told me to stop fretting and we plumped for this one as it was away from Temple Bar and we could not afford the prices around St Stephens. I WAS SO PLEASED I DID. I am really fussy but my room was great (helped by the flat screen tv), staff were helpful and friendly and the breakfast was served (I asked for a boiled egg) which was perfect, no pushy buffet! I arrived at 10am and was able to leave my case whilst I attended a conference at Trinity Hall and when I booked out they held onto my case till I departed in the evening. I did have a back room on the 2nd floor so got a very good nights sleep whilst my friend had a front room on the second floor and had to put up with the trams! The hen and stag parties in the hotel were not there on a weds or thursday night.....to be honest it was more the blue rinse brigade! I'm 30yrs old from London and when I come to Dublin again (which I will), I will be staying here. Its an affordable, friendly, well located and clean hotel.

232,Wonderful location,"We just returned from a 3 night stay at the Wynn's  Hotel.  We were extending our stay after an 8 day Brendan tour.  The hotel is located close to everything.  We walked everywhere.  There was a heat wave - high eighties and no air conditioning, so we had to leave the windows open.  It was noisy at night, up to 2:00 am, then it quieted down.  This was a bit of a problem.  The hotel has been renovated with beautiful bathrooms and flat screen TVs on the wall. (Not much on Irish TV on the other hand there isn't much on US TV worth watching).  The dining room was quite nice and the service excellent.  The breakfasts were not  just the typical irish breakfast - eggs, tomatoes, bacon & sausage, altlhough that was available.  One day we had pancakes with goat chees and raspberry sauce.  It was like nothing I had ever tasted before.  Very good.  The staff was friendly, but not overly so.  We arrived at 9:30 am on a Sunday and were able to get into our rooms right away.  This was a big plus.  I would stay there again - noise and all.

232,Home from Home,"Stayed again in my favourite hotel in Dublin...............well you've gussed it, Wynn's Hotel, Abbey Street. Its just around the corner from the Abbey Theatre, a short walk from the Finanical  Services Centre in the Old dock area of Dublin, and is off O'Connell Street where you'll find the GPO and the Spire.
 I've always found the staff and management to be helpful, polite and friendly. Its a family run hotel and provides a ""Home from Home"" atmosphere.
While there is now a multinational staff many of the staff there have more than twenty years experience working for Wynn's.  
The food is of the highest standard, quality, and quantity.  Breakfast is a feast.
In fact I would describe my stays at Wynn's as ""Pure Magic"".
I'll be back again and again and again and.........

The room, although a little small, was well furnished, clean and comfortable. A very useful addition was the safe in the bedroom.Meals were excellent. The traditional Irish breakfast was wonderful and very well served. The hotel was very tastefully decorated and in good condition. I would most certainly stay here again and recommend this hotel to my friends.

232,ok if your short,"for the price, it was ok. we were there over a bank hol so didn't get interepted much by the building work going on.
the inclusive breakfast was ok, once you got understanding from the mulitnational staff.
the room was clean and modern but the bed had an end so if your tall you had to sleep on your side!  
no air conditiong either - if you have the window open you can hear the tram going past and the city noises. 
good location - buses and shops, cinema just around the corner one way
more buses, temple bar and the other shops,  st stephens green the other way just over the river.

All staff very helpful and polite, nice breakfast and bar. 5 minutes from Temple Bar and Grafton Street. Would definitely recommend it and in fact, I already have!!
",4,2006,06,06
232,Give Wynn's a wide berth,"Very noisy day and night; both from the street and from the party-goers in the hotel. Functions on all the time - wild music and revelry to all hours. Remember drinking is a big problem in Ireland and Dublin is a 24 hour party city every day of the week!

Nowhere to hang out in the hotel - there are no lounge reception areas apart from a very small bar on the ground floor ! That's it.

The ordinary staff are pleasant and helpful; but that doesn't chime with the reception and management who made me uneasy. Phoney smiles bordering on sneer or contempt and only interested in one aspect - get the money, get the credit card details, make sure you are charged for every little thing. Gave me bad feeling of being used. 

Impossible to get money back from them if you are over-charged or have complaint  - but  left your credit card details.

Food - stodge. Give it a miss.

Apart from a lot of genuine consideration by ordianry staff this was a nasty little place. Almost had the feeling the staff were apologising for the overall unpleasantness of the place.

232,Great 'City Break' Hotel.,"Stayed for a weekend at Wynns Hotel. We were in Dublin to see Ralph Fiennes in the Gate Theatre so the location of the hotel was excellent. We got the Luas tram from Hueston station and it left us right outside the hotel door. Cristina on reception couldn't have been nicer and she went out of her way to make sure we were happy with our room which was small but cosy and even had a fireplace and for a city centre hotel was very quiet.
The dinner was average enough but the breakfast was lovely. I would definitely recommend it for a city break.
",4,2006,04,30
232,You lose with Wynn's,"Found right in the city centre with trams clanging bang outside the door and Dublin's notorious traffic snarl, fumes and roar for company.

Describe themselves with cliched  'Family run hotel' charcter. Actually means grasping, self-important 'dynasty' ruthlessly exploiting their satff and putting on a faux bonhomie. Yeat's hand in the greasy till comes to mind. 

Speaking of greasy - the food is lumps of roast meat with over-boiled veg smothered in sauces out of a packet - thats in the Carvery. Pay twice as much for the same stuff in the Restaurant.

If you like the company of hordes of drunken teenagers-come-twentysomethings celebrating their 18th/21st/Engagement then Wynns at the weekend is place for you. Never will you see a hotel more efficient at renting out it's function rooms.

Failing that if you'd rather have the company of smug opinionated fiftysomethings with permanent higher management jobs - people in the loop servicing the Celtic Tiger for their Fat Cat masters. Then the bar is where you can be assailed by these types all day and night.
One word - gauche.

232,Excellent location.,"Stayed last October.  Hotel really central.  Room clean but small, staff friendly and helpful.  Noise from trams at front may bother some, but didn't affect us.  Definitely would stay again.
",3,2006,04,08
232,Would not stay here again,"the bathroom was not heated...the window in the bathroom would not shut so that didn't help...the bed was absolutley horrible, worst sleep ever, bad view, elevator broken the whole time we were there...lugged suitcases up and down 3 floors, only somewhat good thing was the breakfast, your paying for location

232,Nice centrally located hotel,"A very centrally located hotel (Take 747 bus at airport and it drops you at a few meters from the hotel) Rather small rooms but comfortable (flatscreen TV) Nice Irish breakfast. Ideally located for a short citytrip.Reception staff is OK but not 'very' friendly. Other members of staff are very friendly.
",3,2006,03,05
232,Excellent CityHotel,"I stayed at this hotel on Jan 25 for one night only on a business trip. The staff were very freindly and helpful. They ordered me  a taxi as I had to to a function on the other side of town and assured me that they use this firm often . I was a little concerend about going in the taxi on my own, but all was well. My room was in 3rd floor, it was a basic single room, but it was very clean. I ordered breakfast to be delivered to my room in the morning and this arrived promptly. It was only €2.50 extra. The only complaint I had, as I was at the front of the hotel I did find the traffic in the morning noisey. But it just meant I was up earlier to go shopping. The staff let me leave my overnight bag at the recepiton, while I went shopping for the day. I then collected it on my way home. I would stay again as you are only a few minutes off O'connell st and all the main shopping areas in the city.
",4,2006,01,27
232,A little rundown but fine,"We stayed here for 2 nights in two single rooms.  The hotel is in a great location and overall was value for money.

The hotel is a little rundown.  Past its prime is probably a fair description.  The staff were friendly but I also had strange experiences with leaving a credit card to guarantee charges.  No card no phone line but leaving rthe card details was torture.  

What it loses in amenity it gains in price and location.  I would most likely stay here again.
",2,2006,01,22
232,Excellent - read the review,"We stayed at the Wynn's over the New Year period and nothing was too much trouble.  The staff and service provided was second to none, true there are no tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms but all you need do is ask, we emailed through prior to arrival and a tray was provided - even stocked up again every day.  The room was spacious, we were on the fifth floor, we had made a request for a higher floor room after reading reviews re functions - even took ear plugs as a precaution.  Room consisted of Wardrobe (inc dressing gowns and iron /ironing board and wall safe), desk and chair, two window seats but these were over the heaters so you didn't sit there long, two bedside cabinets.  The bathroom was also very reasonably sized with a shower facility. 

Housekeeping was provided every day, even New Year's day, including daily fresh towels.  The hotel was clean in all areas and we were even provided with a continental breakfast on the morning we were leaving (6.15am start) of toast, cereal, coffee /tea, yoghurt.  Nothing was too much trouble for these staff.

Much of it was dark wood and brass in the hotel, this was to reflect the traditional style of its original building.  Food in the hotel was excellent, lunch (full roast dinner) was around 11 euro.  Dinner in the restaurant for three courses was 25 euro or a la carte.  The dining room was well used by travellers and regulars alike and was always quite full.

Can also recommend a nice Italian restaurant on O'Connell street, Café Carlos, lunch for 11 euro consisting of starter, main course pasta or pizza and a glass of wine, again excellent service and quality both at lunch and evening.
",5,2006,01,03
232,"If on business, do not stay here!","From the moment I walked in their were problems. 

Straight away, I handed over my Amex for a swipe (standard procedure), but was given a funny look, and I was then asked to write my card details down (inc security code) on the guest card!

I refused, as this is highly irregular, and not very secure. 

I was then asked to pay up front, which I did in full, but I was unable to get an invoice as the system was being backed up! 

I then noticed that I had been given a smoking room. They had a non smoking available, but only for my fist night, so I had to put up with the somking room!

I then went to my room, using the lift which seemed like a death trap!

When I went to my room, the first thing I noticed was the absence of any coffee facilities. 

I also noticed there was only a tiny little desk to do my work on, and no data point. Instead I had to stretch the phone over to the middle of the bed, and move the desk right by the bed too, to get dial up access. 

I have 800 dial up access, so it is a free number. Anyhow I decided to see if if I would get a one off connection charge (normal hotel stuff) so I called reception, and got told it would be 70c per minute!!

I asked her to double check this, as that is crazy, but she could not confirm!

So I then said I would connect for two minutes, and call her again to see if  I had been charged. 

She then told me that she needs my credit card details to open the phone line. 

I said no, as I did previousley, but I argued I will be making a free call. eventually she opened the line. 

Anyhow, I connected, and was annoyed as I only got 28.8Kb/s (very slow). 

I then called her 5 minutes later to see about the charge but she had gone home, and I spoke to someone else who told me it was all locked! so he could not tell me. 

Other points to note is that the toilet flush handle is broken, and the bath panel is all cracked. 

On the plus side, there is a flat LCD TV on the wall, however the pricture is rubbish, and two of their sky channels are not working. 

Overall, if I hadnt paid up front, I would check out and find another hotel.

232,The family loved Wynn's,"We arived at Wynn's after an all night flight from Boston and my wife had a terrible head cold.  Though it was only 9:00 on Sunday morning, the staff invited us in to breakfast and proceeded to go all out in their efforts to get at least one of our rooms prepared for us so that we could get at least a few hours rest.

Our 3 day stay at Wynn's was pure pleasure.  The staff was helpful and friendly and the facilties were excellent.  

I read a few reviews that mentioned noise issues; our stay was Sunday through Wednesday so we didn't have to deal with Friday or Saturday night receptions in the hotel or pariters on the street.  Their was some street repair taking place one night until about midnight, but I always travel with earplugs to insure a good night's sleep.

We will visit Wynn's again and I will recommend them to anyone thinking of visiting Dublin.
",5,2005,12,01
232,"Sorry, but no thanks","The location is O.K.-very convenient for sightseeing and shopping.  
The room I stayed was far too small and no view (you could touch the wall of next building if you open the only window).  The reception staff was unfortunately not so helpful.
",2,2005,10,19
232,Too noisy to sleep!!!,"I stayed at Wynns with some friends for 2 nights to shop and sample the well renowned night life of Dublin.  We were told at check in that there were functions in the hotel on both nights of our stay, however we didn't appreciate how noisy this would be.  We returned to our rooms (which happened to be directly above the function room) at 1.00am and all I can say is that we might as well have been in the room with the party - the noise was horrendous.  The music stopped shortly afterwards, however people seemed to be there for hours afterwards, shouting and singing.  We asked to be moved the next day and the staff were very helpful and accommodating, and duly moved us up to the third floor.  They even moved our luggage for us.

Whilst my friend and I were moved to the back of the hotel which was quiet, the other two were in the same position above the function room and could still hear the music despite being two floors above.  The hotel must have known which guests attending the function were staying in the hotel so why don't they put those guests in the noisy rooms??  

The hotel was very central, just off O'Connell Street, and very handy for the shopping areas and Temple Bar, which was a 5 minute walk away.   It would have been nice to have tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms as a E2.50 charge for room service seemed a bit steep (this made the cost about E5.00 for a cup of tea, however it wasn't a big deal really.  

Overall, the hotel was very nice and the staff were great, however I think they need to consider guests a bit more when they have functions on.  Even though we're no stick in the muds, we do like to sleep sometimes!

232,Go on go on go on go on go on go on go on go on go on,"THUMBS UP
Wynn's hotel is in a superb spot in the centre of Dublin. All amenities are close by.
The hotel is well presented and the staff are hospitable and helpful. The room i stayed in had some character and was comfortable.

THUMBS DOWN
The shower wasn't very powerful but it worked. My room was situated at the front of the hotel so the tram line that runs out the front could be heard. However, this didn't appear to run throughout the night and was bearable. The hotel is undergoing repairs so i was woken early by loud drilling but i had to get up to go to breakfast anyway so it was no great shake.

No hotel is perfect and despite the thumbs down list i'd recommend Wynn's.",4,2005,09,06
232,Wynn is a winner!,"Having been to Dublin many times, I've stayed in a variety of different hotels from the Brewery hostel to a 5* near Grafton.  Wynn's is that perfect little hotel right in the middle. It's a fantastic 3* that benefits from a perfect location.  The hotel is right in the heart of Dublin with Temple Bar a short walk away and the shopping centre of Grafton Street just over the bridge.  It's also pretty close to the main Stadium if you are there for a concert (as I was).

The service is fantastic and the accomodation is above a 3*.  Though the room was on the smaller side, it had all the modern conveniences and a modern bathroom as well! Very hard to find sometimes!  

My only complaint is the breakfast.  Though a full Irish breakfast was available and usually the norm in Dublin, I found the quality to be poor.  The food had very little taste and it was just reheated and dished out cafeteria style.  If they improve this I would say this is a very very nice place.  Having said that, I would still stay here again because of the other advantages and simply get breakfast on my way to Grafton Street!  Enjoy!
",4,2005,08,30
232,In the middle of everything,"Took a city-break with my wife to celebrate our anniversary.  There are some appalling places to stay in Dublin (and I've stayed in a few!) so we did a lot of research before going.  

Wynns is situated in a fantastic spot just off O'Connell Street with a Luas (tram) stop outside and just a short walk from the DART at Tara Street. All the main tourist areas in the centre of Dublin and much further afield are easy to get to.  There are also scores of bars and restaurants nearby - particularly good was the Town Bar & Grill on Kildare Street (great food worth the awful service), and Fitzers in Temple Bar.

Our hotel room was spacious and clean with a huge sleigh bed and two window seats overlooking Abbey Street.  If you are a light sleeper it may not be the right place as the noise at the weekend from the street can last all night. Breakfast could be embellished by some fresh fruit and pastries!
",4,2005,07,13
232,Wynns is the best,"Just had to let someone know what a pleasure it was to stay at Wynns Hotel-seems like they are a hidden little treasure-so glad I found them. The staff are excellent-so attentive & helpful about anything & eveything. The hotel is old-fashioned(and I mean this in a good way) & charming. Beautiful sleigh beds,deep window seats, but a plasma tv & extremely clean,modern bathroom. They give you your messages from a slip of paper in the mail box & the room key is actually a key-some may consider that a drawback but we found it delightful. The location is wonderful as well-right off of O'Connell street-a quieter location than some hotels & yet very easy access to buses & the Luas is right outside the door. the Flowing Tide pub & Sherie's restaurant -two terrific local,non-touristy establishments are just a few steps away too.  I just can't say enough about what a pleasing experience we had at this hotel. I will go back there as often as I can. Our whole trip to Dublin was a treasured experience & our hotel stay was a big part of that.Dublin is a city with a lovely mix of old & new and Wynns Hotel
is a perfect example of that as well.

232,pneumatic drill!!!!!!!,"just returned on 29th Jan.  Its a nice, grand, quaint hotel, centrally located hotel BUT they are getting the kitchen extended and there are pneumatic drills which go on from 8:15 until 18:00.  They did not warn us about this when we booked even though I asked if I could have a quiet room!

There was also a disco on Friday (but we did not hear it on the 5th floor).

No tea/coffee.

Ok but a bit disappointing.
",2,2005,01,30
232,Perfect location,"I recently stayed at Wynn's for one night only and was impressed enough to log on here and write a review. Located directly beside a Tram stop (which serves the train station) on Lower Abbey Street, Wynn's is a stone's throw from O'Connell Bridge without being right in the centre of the sometimes mayhem of Temple Bar. 
The hotel itself is of the old school and could probably do with a bit of an overhaul, however I couldn't fault it really. My room was comfortable and warm, best of all I was at the back of the hotel so it was very quiet. I had requested a bath (some rooms have showers only) and to my delight my bathroom, which was lovely, had a large jacuzzi bath which was perfect after a long day walking around Dublin.
The staff were also pleasant, especially the porter who was very helpful.
Breakfast was good, traditional Irish fare, but I do think they could update their menu with some muffins or croissants.
All in all it was a pleasure to stay there and I will return.
",4,2004,12,08
232,Great location,"Just returned from a two-night break in Dublin with six people. The hotel couldn't be more centrally located. It is easy walking distance to shops, pubs, restaurants and tourist attractions. 

The hotel was quite noisy, especially as they had a wedding reception on the Friday night and a party on the Saturday night. Also, there was quite a lot of noise from the street below from people returning home after they'd had what seemed to be a very enjoyable night! However, there is very little traffic noise as the street is mainly used by trams rather than cars and buses.

The rooms were a bit on the small side but very clean and pleasantly decorated. Tea and coffee facilities are available on request from reception rather than being automatically in your room. Breakfast was generous but not always very hot.

Overall, I would definitely stay here again for the location and the price was reasonable but take ear plugs if you are a light-sleeper!
",4,2004,10,11
232,Great hotel,"The Wynns was a great hotel to stay in.  The location is perfect.  It's right off of O'Connell street in the city center.  The room was very nice, no complaints.  They were putting in tracks for the new Louis train that is suppose to be up and running this month.  Don't know if that will add to the noise or not.  Although the construction noise wasn't a problem for me, so I imagine not.  The staff was great and very helpful.  I stayed in three different hotels in Dublin and this was by far the best.
",4,2004,06,18
232,Wynn's- A good place to stay in town,"I stayed at Wynn's in 2003, and rather liked it. The location is great - right in the center of the city. The rooms were serviceable, but certainly not elegant. I recall that the staff was extremely helpful, though. We had a flat on our rental car(with a bent wheel rim), and the garage man took care of getting the tire and wheel fixed for us while we were out sightseeing. The desk attendat was also extremely pleasant. 
Although the hotel is a litle noisy, I would definitely stay there again, based on the wonderfully helpful service provided by the employees, the convenient location, and the charming old world atmosphere of the public rooms.",4,2004,03,17
232,Dublin Sept. 2003,"I recently stayed at the Wynn's Hotel in Dublin. The hotel rooms are very comfortable and the staff helpful. However, I would have liked to have seen tea/coffee making facilities in the room.

It is worth checking if there are any parties booked into the function room as rooms above it suffer greatly from noise. There are also major roadworks and upheavals in the centre of Dublin adding to the noise and inaccessibility by car.

The price rose for the period of my stay because of the Hurling Final that weekend, without prior warning.

The good point is that the hotel is very central.",2,2003,09,17
232,Reception ladies and mattresses at Winn's Hotel,"I stayed in this hotel with a friend of mine from 7 to 12 August of the c.a. and we had a wonderful time.
At the reception, we found Roberta and Camilla who pampered us from the beginning to the end of the stay and any information we asked, in Italian, they gave us suggestions and tips with extreme courtesy and preparation. 
Breakfast delicious and varied and personal room, especially the lady who speaks in Italian but whose name, alas, I do not remember, always ready for clarification.
The location is great for walking to all the main points of interest: the Temple Bar area, Trinity College, Georgian Quarter, Christ Church Cathedral and for more turn to the wonderful Roberta and Camilla at reception.
The Irish Information Office is a stone's throw away on O'Connel Street. 
In the same street of the Hotel the Dublin Bus line 41 or 16 to the airport stops and departs, ticket 2.60 €, you pay in currency on the bus to the driver but does not give change, otherwise bring your 90 minute ticket, . Travel time 45-55 minutes depending on traffic. On the parallel route to the River Liffey, namely in Eden Quay you will find the Dublin Express to the airport, slightly more expensive and slightly faster because it does not pass through the centre and makes fewer stops.
We slept in a room on Abbey Street on the second floor, during the day, those very few times we allowed ourselves to do the Roman nap, we heard a bit about buses or trams but frankly our rest was not affected and at night, I imagine with fewer rides, ""we were great"". The mattresses, both single and double, are FABULOUS, in no hotel of the many shot in Europe in recent years, we found them so perfect. Too bad we can't take them home...  The bathroom, spotless, is without bidet but for those who are used to traveling outside our magnificent Italy, this is expected, with the shower you have to commit to use properly the knobs, the cleanliness of the room is good but I, at home, brush with my hands even the sheets on which I sleep.  As a Southern Italian, I have the cult of the bed! 
In the closet there is the ironing board, for those who wanted, we moved it to make room for clothes. There are two lovely radiators, in the room and in the bathroom that we have not used but , in winter, you can turn them on or off as you please.
Value for money: Excellent
I forgot, the location of the hotel is also strategic because a 5-minute walk, always on O' Connel Street, depart many tours around the city and outside.",5,2024,08,17
232,Wynn's Hotel is a win,"The hotel was very central, relatively quiet (street noise reasonably audible, in the hotel room quiet, well insulated). Nice, friendly, helpful staff. Breakfast was very good, with good choices. Even the coffee was quite good. The rooms were big enough but not huge and the wet area good. Price / performance ratio I found good. Recommended.",4,2024,07,28

Very good breakfast and very kind staff, Trevor in particular.
The location is great for walking to all the main points of interest. And it's a stone's throw from Eden Quay where you can catch the Dublin Express to the airport.
As soon as I return to Dublin, I will definitely choose the Wynn's hotel",5,2024,06,02
232,Good choice,"The location of the hotel is unbeatable, walking distance to any of the places to visit in Dublin (we even went to Guinness and Kilmahaim prison on foot). The tram stops right next door, Tara station is five minutes away.
It is a classic hotel, with furniture from other eras. The double bed is small and the duvet that covers it is smaller than it. The bathroom is spacious, with a hydromassage bathtub. On Saturday night you can hear the street party a lot, the rest of the days the seagulls.
The breakfast room is small but has a lot of charm. They offer two possibilities, the second is the best, highlighting the eggs Benedictine or the vegetarian one. One of the people there, Anna María (I think her name was), was very attentive and professional, she was off on Thursday and we couldn't say goodbye to her, so thank you very much from here. At the reception we were treated very well, but especially by some fantastic young Andalusian women, Bea and Miriam. Greetings and thank you.",4,2023,11,16

Letto comodo, pulizia perfetta. Unica cosa che non conoscevo, nel lavandino ci sono rubinetti separati per acqua calda e fredda, ma mi è stato spiegato che è una cosa diffusa negli alloggi irlandesi. Il personale è stato impeccabile, a partire dalle signore delle pulizie, che mi hanno ringraziato per come tenevo la mia camera, fino alla reception, dove una mattina che dovevo partire per un'escursione si sono preoccupati di fornirmi la colazione da portare, inoltre prima della partenza sono stati disponibili ad una richiesta, ed hanno tenuto il bagaglio oltre il check-out. La colazione è abbondante, con scelta tra vari dolcetti, cereali, yogurt, succhi freschi, ma si può anche ordinare altro, cucinato al momento, sia dolce che salato. Anche il personale di sala è professionale. L'hotel per la sua posizione è centralissimo e si possono raggiungere le principali attrazioni di Dublino a piedi, questo implica che le linee di trasporto, e nello specifico la Luas, passino nella strada dove si trova l'hotel, il rumore dalla mia stanza si sentiva, ma non era fastidioso, mi sono abituata in breve tempo e ho dormito sempre tranquillamente, ma io ero al quinto piano e non so se ai piani inferiori si sentiva maggiormente.

Personale molto gentile, anche a colazione. Discreta varietà di dolce e salato, compresa la Full Irish Breakfast. Il rapporto qualità prezzo è buono, considerati i prezzi a Dublino. Dovessi mai tornare in città, sicuramente tornerei qui. Consigliato",5,2022,06,03
232,Favoloso,"Abbiamo soggiornato 3 notti in questo hotel e siamo rimaste pienamente soddisfatte. È in stile classico, elegante e ben tenuto, la posizione più che centrale permette di visitare la città tranquillamente a piedi e con una camminata di 3 minuti si raggiunge la fermata da e per l'aeroporto. La nostra camera era al quarto piano, molto spaziosa e sempre pulita. Colazione ricca e molto varia sia di opzioni salate che dolci, noi abbiamo sempre optato per la colazione dolce ed i pancakes erano buonissimi. Ciliegina sulla torta la disponibilità dello staff tutto, in particolare grazie alla receptionist Roberta molto gentile e cordiale, ci ha accolte come fossimo a casa e ci ha dato consigli utili per vivere al meglio la nostra vacanza!! Super consigliato",5,2021,10,19
232,Eccellente,"Sono rimasta entusiasta di questo albergo. Quando ti muovi per le sue stanze sembra di essere in un altro tempo. La camera era bellissima e spaziosa, all'ultimo piano, quindi con gli abbaini. Era sempre ben pulita. Solo l'ultimo giorno ho avuto l'impressione che non avessero lavato a terra nel bagno e l'altra pecca è che non ci hanno sostituito le tazze sporche del caffè in camera. La colazione molto buona e abbondante, con il self service. Abbiamo mangiato anche al ristorante quando era aperto e il cibo era molto buono. Tra l'altro l'albergo è vicino alla maggior parte delle attrazioni di Dublino: il museo delle cere, il castello, la Christ Church Cathedral, e per andare allo zoo passa il tram proprio lì davanti.",5,2021,09,15
232,Toll ,"Es ist ein tolles Hotel im historischen viktorianischem Gebäude. Obwohl wir um ca 10 Uhr angekommen sind, war unser Zimmer Nr. 526 schon fertig 😎. Zimmer lag zur Straßenseite und konnten gut schlafen. Betten sind bequem, Zimmer und Bad ausreichend groß.
Personal ist super freundlich, Frühstück sehr gut. Ich würde hier gerne noch mal übernachten. Vielen Dank",5,2020,01,22
232,Capodanno,"Hotel molto carino in pieno centro a Dublino vicinissimo a tutti i percorsi da fare. Struttura antica ma tutta ristrutturata pulitissimo, personale molto cortese è disponibile. Colazione compresa nel prezzo strepitosa. Lo consiglio! ",5,2019,12,30
232,El personal inmejorable!!,"El hotel es estupendo,en una zona perfecta para hacer turismo,muy céntrica.El trato del personal fue excelente,sobre todo la chica que trabajaba en el comedor(desayunos) fue súper amable,el desayuno muy bueno.todo en general Excelente.",5,2019,10,31
232,Hotel a Dublino della metà del XIX secolo,"Questo hotel è perfetto per visitare la città a piedi: dall’aeroporto si raggiunge in circa 20’, con fermata nella principale O’Connell Street. E altrettanto rapidamente si raggiungono tutte le attrazioni della città: Trinity college, the liberties, Temple bar, le cattedrali, Guinness center, musei, ...
Al nostro arrivo siamo state accolte in modo gentile e semplice, come sono gli irlandesi, in uno splendido edificio che ospita l’hotel dal 1845! La camera è pulita e confortevole, con la vasca idromassaggio, il bollitore. Le prese elettriche sono quelle inglesi, ma la receptionist ci ha prestato l’adattatore immediatamente e gratuitamente.
La stanza è silenziosa malgrado sia in centro città.
La prima notte dal soffitto gocciolava dell’acqua, ma l’indomani mattina, appena informati, hanno immediatamente provveduto a risolvere il problema: sono stati bravissimi!
Il punto di forza è indubbiamente la colazione, a buffet, e con un piatto caldo a scelta del menu: noi abbiamo sempre preso i pancake con lo sciroppo d’acero e la frutta fresca, una vera bontà!",5,2019,10,27
232,Excelente elección para alojarse en Dublín,"Hotel con más de un siglo de historia situado en una calle adyacente a la principal arteria de comunicaciones de Dublín. Céntrico y cercano al río y la zona del Temple Bar, y a sólo 5 min a pie de la parada de los autobuses del aeropuerto.
Hotel reformado, sobre todo los baños con todas las comodidades. Personal de recepción y cafetería muy amable (en especial una chica de recepción que habla muy bien español). Servicio de bar completo. Desayuno irlandés cocinado en el momento de lo mejor, mención especial a los huevos Benedict.
Excelente elección para alojarse en Dublín en un hotel con mucha historia.",5,2019,10,15
232,Una buona scelta,Scelto per la posizione centrale  l 'Hotel ristrutturato da poco ha stanze molto carine e arredate con gusto. Colazione superlativa in ambiente raffinato. Ma la piacevole sorpresa è stato il Ristorante. Piatti deliziosi di carne e pesce con contorni vari a un prezzo competitivo rispetto ai Ristoranti di Dublino. Gentilezza e cortesia dello Staff in particolare della signora Roberta e di Andrea. Il prezzo è abbastanza alto ma in linea con le altre strutture. Consigliatissimo. ,5,2019,08,29
232,Altes Hotel in optimaler Lage,Dieses Hotel besteht seit 1845 und ist gut in Schuss. Wer ein Designhotel will ist hier fehl am Platz doch für einen Städtetrip ist es optimal da es sehr zentral liegt. Frühstück ist sehr gut und das Personal sehr freundlich. Mir hat es gefallen.,5,2019,08,28
232,Alt aber super Lage,"Perfekte Lage direkt an der O‘Connel Street und nahe der Temple Bar. Hotel alt, kleine Zimmer. Mein Zimmer war wohl direkt über einer (Küchen-) Lüftung, es roch nicht sehr angenehm. Frühstück gut, Personal sehr freundlich. ",3,2019,04,06
232,Buen hotel,"Hotel algo antiguo, con habitaciones cómodas aunque con decoración bastante anticuada. El personal es muy amable.

Si tienes opción de pedir habitación con cama de matrimonio, mejor pues si no, las camas no se pueden juntar.

El desayuno bastante bien, los huevos benedictinos muy recomendables.",4,2019,04,01
232,Buono in assoluto!,"Hotel a ridosso della zona centrale della città, camera confortevole e un po piccola ma  dalla massima pulizia, arredata in stile classico e con gusto. Il bagno risulta piccolino ma funzionale per le esigenze di un turista ( in fondo in camera si sosta per dormire e per ''docciarsi''). La prima colazione e di livello eccellente e nulla mancherebbe ai turisti più esigenti in termini di ''mangiare''. Il personale è cortese e estremamente disponibile, in modo particolare alla reception,  sempre pronto a rispondere ad ogni sorta di bisogno da parte degli ospiti e con una spiccata gentilezza atta a far sentire coccolati i suoi clienti.
Consiglio questa struttura a chi ha voglia di soggiornare a Dublino trovandosi al centro dei siti più importanti da visitare gustandosi il conforto di un alloggio e di personale di gran classe.",4,2018,12,10
232,Ottimo per posizione e servizio,"Abbiamo dormito qui una sola notte ad agosto 2017. Gentilezza nel servizio e buona colazione. Stanza all'ultimo piano pulita e con due finestre, arredata in modo tradizionale e molto comoda. Posizione strategica per visitare la città.",5,2018,11,18
232,"OTTIMO, Personale GENTILE ... CONSIGLIATISSIMO!","Ho soggiornato al Wynnis Hotel per due notti, non potevo fare scelta migliore. Mi hanno assegnato una camera al 5 piano. Piacevolissima sorpresa: ottimissima pulizia, camera riscaldata , letto grande e comodo con tanti cuscini :D ! Il bagno non aveva segni di alcun tipo, pulito, profumato, asciugamani morbidi. C’é la possibilità tramite pulsante di accendere il radiatore per scaldare gli asciugamani. C’è anche un ferro da stiro 😄. Tutto in stile irlandese, ottima la colazione, gentilissime e disponibili le receptionist ( che saluto tantissimo , parlano perfettamente l’italiano !! ) e il personale di servizio nella sala colazioni. Ci tornerò con la mia famiglia , assolutamente , anche perché vicinissimo alle fermate dei mezzi pubblici, da e per l’aeroporto. Ho girato a piedi, centralissimo e ad un passo dalla bellissima Temple Bar. Davvero complimenti e grazie ancora per l’accoglienza. Sara ",5,2018,10,24
232,Posizione comoda ma hotel datato,"L'hotel si trova quasi su O Connel street molto vicino al ponte sul Liffey, quindi la posizione è molto comoda, il servizio è cortese e la pulizia di buon livello. Detto ciò la stanza non è molto grande l'armadio non può contenere quasi nulla per appendere due vestiti ho dovuto metter fuori l'asse da stiro e tutto è molto vecchio. Anche la colazione è appena sufficiente e viene servita a tavola. Insomma risulta un pò troppo costoso per il livello.",3,2018,09,25
232,Una gradevolissima sorpresa,"Abbiamo pernottato il giorno 14.06.2018 in viaggio con un tour organizzato. Camere in stile inglese , cioè non molto grandi, ma con tutti i confort del caso. Ottima la pulizia. La sorpresa maggiore è arrivata al momento della cena che ci aspettavamo di tipo "" Inglese "" ed invece è stata una cena deliziosa : voulevant con crema e pollo e verdure miste - filetto di orata con crema allo zafferano e patate dolci (squisito ) -  tartine di pasta frolla ( fresca !) con crema e frutta fresca. Ho fatto i complimenti agli chef perché veramente se li meritavano. Il personale dell'hotel è stato disponibilissimo e molto cortese. Tra l'altro è proprio centralissimo a due passi da O'Connell Street. Insomma, un hotel decisamente da consigliare. ",5,2018,07,09
232,Buon livello,"Sebbene la struttura sia un po' datata, il Wynn's hotel ha uno stile retrò molto affascinante ed ha subito nel tempo ritrutturazioni che gli conferiscono un'aria tutt'altro che trasandata. Il personale è molto cordiale e la posizione è strategica. Gli unici nei attengono ai rumori che provengono dalla strada (cui si può rimediare chiedendo una camera ai piani più alti) e alla colazione che andrebbe forse un po' arricchita,sempre nei limiti dello standard dell'hotel.",4,2018,07,04
232,Favoloso,"Ho prenotato questo Hotel per il concerto di Taylor Swift a Dublino. Accogliente, a pochi passi dal Croke Park luogo dell'evento. Il personale é preparato e cortese, una receptionist parla anche italiano. In stanza c'é la vasca idromassaggio e un TV HD Samsung che prende anche canali italiani e Eurosport. Inoltre al piano terra c'é un pub per bere la Guinness. Unica nota dolente é il prezzo 200 euro a notte, ma ne vale la pena.",5,2018,06,19
232,Bell’atmosfera,"Abbiamo passato 2 notti in questa struttura.
Situato in pieno centro, l’hotel è ideale punto d’appoggio X visitare la bella Dublino, a pochissimi passi anche dai collegamenti urbani ed extraurbani.
La camera, in termini di spazi, arredi e dotazioni ha soddisfatto le ns esigenze. Pur essendo lato strada nn abbiamo avuto nessun disturbo da quel punto di vista, rivedibile invece l’isonorozizzazione interna, infatti si sentiva distintamente e fastidiosamente ogni cosa succedesse nelle camere vicine. Questa si è rivelata l’unica pecca di un soggiorno piacevole. 
Il personale è semplicemente fantastico, competente, organizzato, disponibile, servizievole e molto cordiale. Fantastica l’irish breakfast servita nella bella sala colazione.
È presente anche un bel bar in stile, perfettamente in linea con il tenore generale. Tutti gli ambienti sono curati e ben tenuti.
",4,2018,05,20
232,Stile Belle epoque,"Location indovinata per questo ottocentesco hotel,ma pulito e ben organizzato.Bus stop di mezzi pubblici per e  dall'aeroporto a pochi metri :noi abbiamo optato per il bus 41(dublin bus)  e tram Luas davanti all'hotel.Stazione di Tara  oltre il ponte(per chi fosse interessato ai paesini nei dintorni nella baia (bellissima) di Dublino. A piedi è visitabile tt il centro di Dublino.Trinity college appena varcato O'Connell bridge,poi Grafton Street e St.Stephen's Green.(circa 15')Temple bar dopo il ponte A'penny,Dublino medievale con castello, chiesa cattolica e cattedrale di S:Patirck relativamente vicine.Miriade di pub nelle vicinanze, tt con accompagnamento di musica irlandese.Personale cortese e disponibile,abbiamo lasciato in loro custodia i bagagli prima del check in e dopo il check out.La ns stanza era al 5°piano,affacciava in un cortile interno, letto comodissimo,qualità del sonno ottima!Da far presente magari  la scarsità di prodotti per igiene personale, e la rubinetteria datata(forse risalente alle origini dell'hotel....)cque,ben pulita.La colazione:sebben fornita,scevra di torte di pasticceria e brioches ripiene,tuttavia, servita in un salone stile belle epoque,con camerieri gentilissimi.Il giudizio è cque molto positivo, ci tornerò nel mio prossimo soggiorno a Dublino!",4,2018,05,17
232,Ottimo come posizione ma con poco confort,"Il punto forte della struttura è sicuramente la posizione, in pieno centro sull'altra sponda del fiume rispetto a Temple Bar. Per cui da qui, a piedi, è possibile visitare praticamente tutta dublino. Dista anche poche decine di metri dalla fermata del bus che collega all'aeroporto. 
Da segnalare poi la gentilezza dello staff e la colazione inclusa, che visto il prezzo di una ""continentale"" o ""full irish"" non è poco. 
Il giudizio si abbassa però passando al confort della stanza, davvero pessimo:
il materasso era duro che sembrava di dormire su una panchina e la schiena ovviamente ne risente, inoltre nella doppia c'è il letto di 1 piazza e 1/2; le tende della finestra non sono oscuranti per cui entra la luce; le finestre non sono ben insonorizzate e si avvertono di notte i rumori della strada (tra cui il tram che passa esattamente di fronte all'ingresso"".
Il prezzo è nella media di strutture di questo livello, ma ripeto il vero plus è la posizione.",3,2018,05,02
232,Centrale e comodo per visitare la città,"Abbiamo soggiornato per tre notti in questo hotel. Centralissimo, nel cuore della città, a pochi minuti dalle maggiori attrazioni e musei di Dublino. Tram e autobus vicinissimi anche per raggiungere l'aeroporto.
Le camere non ci hanno entusiasmato, che ci sia pure un ferro con asse da stiro é apprezzabile ma che non vi siano né un asciugacapelli né uno spazzolino per la pulizia del water é abbastanza disagevole. Abbiamo dovuto chiedere un kit di cortesia aggiuntivo perché era stato messo per una sola persona anziche due. Ad ogni modo abbiamo ricevuto attenzione e cortesia da parte della reception e dal personale dell'hotel che é stato sempre molto cordiale e disponibile. La struttura é in stile, va apprezzata per com'é...moquette anche dove si mangia e tante...troppe argenterie e porcellane sui tavoli da colazione. Non proprio igienico lo zucchero a zolle senza coperchio e l'aspirapolvere presente vicino ai tavoli dove si mangia...
Altra cosa che abbiamo gradito poco é che la stanza non era ben insonorizzata, dava sulla strada e gli infissi sono datati, sentivamo tutti i rumori della strada, i tram, gli schiamazzi, etc... magari il consiglio é di chiedere una stanza piu' interna e non che dà sulla strada. Per noi questo hotel si é distinto solo per la cortesia del personale e la sua posizione centrale. Se dovessi tornare a Dublino credo sceglierei un altro hotel.",3,2018,05,02
232,"GuteLage, freundliches Personal, gutes Frühstück","Das Hotel hat Still liegt sehr zentral und hat sehr freundliches Personal. Es ist sogar aussergewöhnlich freundlich. Bei dem Frühstück kann man wählen (Irish,Intercontinental) und es sehr schmackhaft. Die Zimmer sind schön und aussreichend groß. Ich war mehrmals da und hatte auch mal ein Zimmer ganz oben, was ich nicht so doll fand, weil man auf die Hinterhöfe sieht. Das hat allerdings den Vorteil, dass es nicht laut ist , was bei den Zimmern vorne zur Strasse hin, manchmal der Fall sein kann. Je nach dem was da gerade passiert. Dennoch würde ich da wieder gerne übernachten.",4,2018,04,27
232,Super Lage,"Tolles Hotel in bester Lage von Dublin, super geeignet für Städtetrip, sehr nettes Personal und super Frühstück, Zimmergröße ausreichend, ein Stern Abzug, da es auch lautere Zimmer zur Straße gibt, unseres war aber nach hinten und ruhig. Gerne wieder!",4,2018,04,25
232,Super Lage,"Das Hotel ist für einen Städte Trip perfekt gelegen. Das Frühstück bietet alles was man braucht und mehr, die Zimmer sind urchig und sauber. Das Restaurant und die Bar scheinen gut zu sein, waren sie doch immer gut besucht. He höher die Zimmer gelegen desto ruhiger.",4,2018,04,03
232,Se merece más estrellas,"Hemos estado en este hotel en Dublín en nuestra escapada de Semana Santa, del jueves por la noche al domingo. Nos tocó en la última planta, habitación 524, con vistas a la calle en una habitación de tamaño bastante aceptable con baño reformado (con plato de ducha) y estaba todo impecable. La habitación tenía un amplio armario, nevera, caja fuerte, hervidor con cafés y tés, televisión de pantalla plana en la pared, y algo que no había visto anteriormente y me pareció muy útil: el radiador-toallero. La habitación era muy tranquila, no se escuchaba nada del hotel, en todo caso cuando pasaba el tranvía por la calle, que tenía parada justo debajo.

La ubicación del hotel es excelente, junto a la calle principal O´Connell donde te dejan los buses que vienen del aeropuerto, justo al lado del puente del mismo nombre que es cruzarlo y ya estás en la zona de Temple Bar. 

Además el desayuno que viene incluido es digno de un 5 estrellas, el restaurante donde lo sirven es precioso y tienen una carta sólo de menús para el desayuno donde puedes elegir desde pancakes, hasta el típico desayuno inglés con bacon, huevos revueltos, etc., así como buffet variado continental, sin olvidar sus increíbles huevos benedictinos, todo el desayuno, desde la comida, hasta el lugar como la atención de los camareros es altamente recomendable.

La atención tanto para el check-in como para el check-out fue rápida y los distintos recepcionistas que nos atendieron cuando dejábamos las llaves al salir fueron muy amables y educados.

Yo quedé encantadísima con este hotel, lo recomiendo 100%, si vuelvo repito seguro.",5,2018,04,02
232,Clásico,"El Hotel Wynns en el centro mismo de Dublín, es un hotel muy antiguo, más de dos siglos de existencia según me pareció leer, con instalaciones que llevan muchas batallas. Las habitaciones son cálidas, pequeñas y los baños aunque se han ido 
remodelando, no dejan de notarse muy utilizados. 
Todo con moqueta al estilo de hace muchos años, confortable, todo en perfecto orden, la limpieza de las habitaciones perfecta con toallas y sabanas renovadas, que no se notan usadas.
La estancia resulta cómoda por su situación, muy agradable por el trato del personal y porque tienen un restaurante con una cocina sensacional. El bufete del desayuno es generoso, los  huevos Benedictine que te los cocinan al momento si los solicitas, aparte de exquisitos, con calorías suficientes hasta el mediodía. 
En definitiva, hotel súper céntrico, no caro y práctico para pasar un par ó tres de días.",3,2018,02,08
232,"Ottima posizione, atmosfera fiabesca","Sembra di tornare indietro di un secolo, albergo in stile, valet alla porta, camere in stile con bagno di lusso. Sala colazione con personale premuroso, reception formale e friendly allo stesso tempo. Gli alberghi di lusso di una volta!",5,2018,01,30
232,capodanno,"Abbiamo scelto un po per caso questa struttura ed è stata un ottima scelta.
Sitrova a pochi passi dal centro, a la metro  luas proprio davanti per chi vuole muoversi un po in altre zone.
A primo impatto sembra una struttura di altri tempi ma e questo che lo rende caratteristico ha un bel bar dove consumare una buona birra e magari mangiare qualche pietanza a pranzo inoltre dispone di  un ristorante molto buono.
La colazione e ottima si puo ordinare la classica colazione irlandese con un po di tutto e diversi modi di fare le uova o la classica colazione con brioches e marmellata confezionata io consiglierei allo staff di aggiungere qualche torta sarebbe perfetto.
IL personale è gentilissimo e molto professionale.
 SIAMO RIMASTI MOLTO COLPITI DA COME TUTTI CERCASSERO DI FARE AL MEGLIO IL LORO LAVORO veramente coccolati dall arrivo alla partenza.
La nostra camera era in un cortile interno ma era molto silenziosa non c è una vista bellissima all interno ma e silenziosa tanto in camera si dorme quindi va benissimo pavimenti in legno proprio vintage bagno nuovo e camera pulita .

232,Decisamente superiore alle aspettative!,"Io (la zia) e mio nipote di 12 anni siamo stati ospiti di questo albergo dal 29 ottobre al 1° novembre 2017. Posizione centralissima  Abbiamo visitato Dublino a piedi! Camera e bagno puliti ed accoglienti. Colazione strepitosa sia la irlandese che quella continentale, servita in una sala molto bella e curata. Personale dell'hotel  davvero molto gentile e disponibile e la grande Roberta è stata fantastica! Eccellente rapporto qualità/prezzo. Lo consiglio vivamente.

232,Bien situado,"Viajamos el mes pasado a Dublin, el hotel estaba bien situado, como no hay mucha oferta de hoteles, en general son bastante caros. Sorpresa al entrar en la habitación y ver que teníamos bañera grande con hidromasaje. Desayuno bueno y personal muy amable. Lo único malo es que cuando me estaba bañando el agua comenzó a salir de color marrón, al comentarlo en la recepción sólo recibí una disculpa, me hubiera gustado que hubieran tenido algún detalle por las molestias...",4,2017,12,15

232,Buen hotel si la habitación no da a la parte de atrás,"Un hotel muy céntrico, a un paso de la zona de Temple Bar y del Trinity College, y con casi 175 años de historia, pero muy bien remozado y cómodo. Los desayunos son espectaculares y el personal muy amable.

Lo peor: la situación de la habitación (nº386). Daba a la parte trasera, a un callejón y a una escalera de incendios, no a la calle principal. Por ello hay ruidos de todo tipo, de las maquinarias de mantenimiento, de los camiones de reparto que utilizan el callejón, etc.... , y todo esto con la ventana cerrada, si fuera verano y estuviera abierta sería insoportable. Es el único pero al hotel",4,2017,11,07
232,comodissimo e pulito,"Albergo in centro, ti consente di muoverti agevolmente a piedi x tutte le principali attrazioni della città; peraltro, vicinissimo alle fermate dei bus x aeroporto o altre città (ad esempio: Cork, Galway).
Il personale dell’hotel è davvero gentile e disponibile ad assecondare ogni richiesta.
La stanza era comoda e pulita, sebbene non grandissima; cambio della biancheria della camera giornaliero; il bagno, invece, grande e pulito.
Consigliatissima la colazione, molto buona sia nella sua versione “irish”, sia in quella tradizionale/continentale.",5,2017,11,05

232,buona esperienza a Dublino,"Abbiamo soggiornato due notti in questo hotel e ci siamo trovati molto bene. Vicino al centro,e vicino alla fermata dei mezzi pubblici. Ottima la colazione, in particolare quella irlandese, preparata e servita calda.  Lo consiglio.",4,2017,10,16

232,Luxus Aufenthalt in nostalgischem Ambiente,"Das Hotel, und im speziellen der Frühstücks-und Restaurantbereich hatte sehr viel mit ""Alt-Wiener"" Kaffeehaus Flair gemein. Der sehr großzügig angelegte Saal  mit seiner hohen Decke und den großen Fenstern wirkte dabei fast schon wie in einem Palais. Als Frühstück steht sowohl ein Buffet, als auch Gerichte aus der Karte zur Verfügung. Auf Sonderwünsche wird gerne Rücksicht genommen. Das Personal ist sehr professionell und freundlich. Hinsichtlich der Zimmerpreise wird der Gast auch entsprechend hofiert. Das überwiegende Publikum, zumindest während unseres Aufenthaltes, ist eher im fortgeschrittenen Lebensabschnitt angesiedelt. Die hauseigene Bar haben wir nicht besucht, schaute aber sehr gemütlich aus. Die Zimmer waren äusserst sauber. Das Bad frisch renoviert ( Fugen etc. alles Top). Sprudelbadewanne, zwar nicht benutzt, aber vorhanden. Unser Zimmer lag im 5 Stock, und war sehr angenehm. Die Lage des Hotels ist perfekt. Luas Station direkt vor dem Haus, diverse öffentliche Busse, sowie Tourbusse, ein paar Schritte um die Ecke. Damit kann man alle Ziele der Stadt leicht erreichen. Inklusive Heusten Bahnhof für einen eventuellen Trip an die Westküste.( Galway in 2,5 Stunden). Alles in allem top Location in gehobenem Preissegment. Für einen längeren Aufenthalt wäre es uns zu teuer gewesen.",5,2017,06,15
232,Tutto perfetto,"L'hotel si trova in posizione strategica per visitare a piedi qualsiasi zona della città. Le stanze sono pulite anche se non molto grandi. La colazione è ottima; per gli italiani suggerisco i pancake caldi con la nutella, veramente ottimi. Il personale è gentile. Buona la connessione wi-fi.",5,2017,06,08
232,"Maravillosa estadía... el desayuno, lo mejor!","Visitamos Dublín a principios del mes de marzo y decidimos hospedarnos en este hotel sin tener mayores referencias. No nos equivocamos, el hotel es perfecto para pasar una excelente estadía, descansar y disfrutar del entorno.
Ubicado en pleno centro de Dublín con transporte público a la puerta y servicios de buses al aeropuerto a pocas cuadras.
Es un hotel antiguo, pero muy bien mantenido. Con muebles de madera, alfombras y cortinas de calidad y renovadas. Al igual que el baño, con artefactos nuevos y todo lo que un buen hotel debería tener para dar comodidad a sus huéspedes. Habíamos solicitado una habitación con bañera, pero como reservamos a última hora no estaba disponible, lo cual no fue un problema ya que la ducha era muy cómoda y cumplió con creces nuestras expectativas.
La cama era cómoda, aunque de tamaño regular, la ropa de cama le otorga un punto a favor, por lo que pudimos tener un sueño muy reparador. Nuestra habitación daba hacia un patio interior, por lo tanto era bastante silenciosa.
El hotel cuenta con un bar típico irlandés, muy variado y de buen ambiente para conversar una copa de vino o una cerveza después de un día movido y a un precio justo. El barman que nos atendió era muy amable.
Creo que con todo lo anterior, lo que se roba la película es el desayuno, incluido en el precio. El salón es muy elegante, iluminado y la atención inmejorable. Su plato estrella, huevos benedictinos... sencillamente una delicia. 
En resumen un gran hotel donde sin duda volvería a hospedarme.",5,2017,05,28
232,En el corazón de Dublin,"Correcto hotel con una inmejorable situación en el centro, centro, de Dublin.
Efectué un viaje por motivos familiares en coche desde Barcelona, y al llegar al hotel, existen verdaderos problemas para aparcar, incluso diria yo para detener el coche enfrente del hotel. Estos problemas son enseguida resueltos por el aparcador, que te lleva tus maletas a recepción y tambien tu coche al garaje, estando a tu disposición siempre que lo pidas. He de comunicar que la dificultad consiste en que pasa el tranvia por la misma puerta y debes dejar el coche al otro lado de la calle para que puedan atenderte. El hotel es antiguo, pero bien decorado, con un comedor sugestivo, una sala de estar y bar muy bien decoradas y una recepción muy atenta. Buen servicio. En la primera planta existen salones para convenciones y fiestas, por lo que, según el día, puede existir cierto ruido. La habitación debe estar, a ser posible, en la parte opuesta a la calle, pues es más tranquila, y, si puede ser en piso alto. Ascensor amplio y rápido. El desayuno puede ser continental o irlandés, a elegir, todo muy correcto, con un espléndido servicio.
La relación calidad, precio es muy correcta. Recomiendo este hotel en Dublin, por su ubicación central y por su servicio y atención siempre correctos.",4,2017,05,14
232,Albergo storico in centro,"Siamo stati alcuni giorni fa in visita a Dublino ed abbiano alloggiato in questo storico hotel nel centro della  città; posizionato ottimamente permette di spostarsi facilmente in qualsiasi  parte della città. La bellezza dell'hotel è nella sua storicità rimasta immutata nello stile e nell'arredamento. La nostra camera non era particolarmente grande con servizi essenziali, nota negativa il bagno piccolo e con lavabo per buono per i bambini. Frigo bar senza bevande. La colazione in bella sala era sufficientemente varia di discreta qualità.",4,2017,04,29

Bella la camera, eccellente la colazione, posizione ideale per girare a piedi e visitare le principali attrazioni di Dublino (Trinity College, Temple Bar, Castello,ecc). Ma una menzione particolare la merita lo staff della reception, simpatico e professionale (il mio personale ringraziamento va soprattutto a Roberta)!!! Senz'altro un albergo da scegliere, particolarmente adatto a chi cerca qualcosa di diverso rispetto agli ormai ""omologati"" hotel delle principali catene mondiali.",5,2017,04,28

Ho avuto un disguido con la riconsegna dell'auto a noleggio e lo staff dell'hotel mi ha supportato e si è reso disponibile ad aiutarmi finchè non ho risolto. in particolare quello che credo fosse il direttore dell'hotel (un bel giovanotto di al massimo 40 anni, bel portamento, gentile e rassicurante), vedendomi agitata, si è prodigato affinchè risolvessi il problema nonostante l'hotel non c'entrasse nulla con il problema della compagnia di noleggio.

Le camere sono pulite e spaziose. La colazione, come viene descritto nella brochure che trovate in camera, viene servita senza sovraffollare la sala destinata, quindi se si è in troppi a volervi accedere e la sala è già piena, una persona dello staff invita gli ospiti ad attendere prima di entrarvi. D'altra parte l'hotel conta di molte camere quindi è possibile un sovraffollamento soprattutto in determinati orari/periodi. Nella brochure sono indicate le fasce orarie di maggiore o minore affluenza in modo che un ospite possa regolarsi se ha in programma di visitare la città e non vuole perdere tempo in attesa che si liberi un posto per la colazione. Detto questo, la sala è comunque grande. credo sia più un discorso legato al servizio che vogliono dare agli ospiti: se ci sono meno ospiti in sala, il personale può gestire meglio le loro richieste. La colazione è a buffet ma si può ordinare qualcosa di caldo che viene servito al tavolo. Anche la sala della colazione è elegante come il resto dell'albergo. Noi non abbiamo aspettato per sederci nemmeno un minuto entrambe le mattine e non siamo certo scesi in sala all'alba.

Consiglio assolutamente questo albergo, anche se il prezzo non è stato precisamente basso. Ma essendo il week end di Halloween, di sicuro ha inciso.",5,2017,02,01
232,Datato ma pratico,"Hotel storico in pieno centro a Dublino, se vogliamo trovargli un punto negativo è nella sua ""storicità "" in fatto di arredamento e stile che lo rende un po vecchiotto.

Tralasciando questo aspetto però devo anche dire che è praticamente a 100 metri da tutto, su o'connel street, grazie alla sua posizione ho girato tutta Dublino a piedi senza prendere mezzi (calcolando che davanti l'hotel ferma il tram e che a una traversa di distanza c'è la fermata dei taxi).

Lo staff e il servizio in generale sono stati ottimi, abbiamo avuto un problema con il termostato in camera che ad un certo punto non ha piu funzionato e nonostante fossero le 21 hanno mandato qualcuno a controllare e ci hanno subito offerto una nuova camera.

Pulizia ottima e, ultimo ma non ultimo per importanza, colazione buonissima con menu anche alla carta compreso nel prezzo (pancakes!!!!!) con ottime pietanze dolci e salate fatte in tempo reale nella cucina a vista.

Consiglio infatti per pochi euro di piu di comprendere la colazione nel prezzo, ne vale la pena!

Attaccato all hotel c'è un market spar e i vari mcdonalds, burger king e starbucks quindi da mangiare c'è la scelta; attraversando il ponte si trova di tutto e a poca distanza siete gia in zona temple bar o grafton street.

Consigliato sicuramente!",4,2017,01,24
232,Increible Hotel.,"Me encanto este hotel, esta al lado de unas de las mejores calles de Dublin, cercano al spire, el desayuno es super variado y e, servicio tanto el de la recepción y el de limpieza de habitaciones es impresionante.",5,2017,01,08
232,Perfetto,Super consigliato se si vuole un posto dove dormire a Dublino perfetta la posizione per visitare la città da segnalare la colazione buonissima varia e ricca. Molto cortese e preparata la signora alla reception,4,2016,12,07
232,HOTEL STORICO molto accogliente,"Hotel molto accogliente, con una grande storia. ambiente molto raffinato, considerando che si tratta di un tre stelle, stanze molto accoglienti, pulite, ordinate, TV collegato con moltissimi canali internazionali, il bagno con tutto il necessario. un piccolo difetto, il tetto matrimoniale era troppo piccolo. La colazione molto ricca e completa con un ottimo menù alla carta a scelta, compreso nel costo. e' in ottima posizione vicino al centro storico e alla stazione dei treni",5,2016,11,15
232,Tolles Hotel ,"Ich war für eine Woche in Dublin und hatte dabei einen sehr angenehmen Aufenthalt im Wynn's Hotel. Die Lage ist für einen Städtetrip optimal, da man fast alle Sehenswürdigkeiten bequem zu Fuß erreichen kann, zudem hält die ""Red Line"" quasi unmittelbar vor der Haustür. Die Zimmer waren stets aufgeräumt und sauber, das Frühstück exzellent und der Service ausgezeichnet. Ich kann das Hotel uneingeschränkt weiterempfehlen.",5,2016,10,27
232,"Ubicación perfecta, pero bastante ruidoso","Estuvimos alojados 3 noches. Nos dieron la 2a planta. Se oye perfectamente el paso del tranvía hasta bien avanzada la noche (con parada en la puerta del hotel), y sobre todo, la fiesta que se organizó en el Hotel la última noche que estuvimos, sábado.. (al parecer, el Hotel organiza algunos sábados fiestas en la 1a planta que acaban a la 1, con el volumen de la música tan alto, que parece que estás tú también en la fiesta.. Imposible dormir, incluso cortada la música, hasta que aprox, 1h después, ya desalojaron todos la sala). 
Otros puntos NEGATIVOS del hotel: el WIFI.. Sin señal en la habitación...; Desayuno normalito..si bien es cierto que el personal es atento y te preparan platos calientes..; y las habitaciones pequeñas y con moqueta (aunque estaba limpia)
En cuanto a lo POSITIVO: Ubicación perfecta (lo mejor del hotel).., pues estás junto a una de las avenidas principales de la ciudad.. A apenas 5-10' andando del Temple Bar, y a escasos 3-4' de la parada del bus (tanto el que va al aeropuerto, como desde donde salen todas las excursiones..); y el personal del hotel.. Muy amable y atento en todo momento.
Por ubicación, es un Hotel para repetir, pero dado el precio, y las importantes contras comentadas, dudo que lo hiciera..",3,2016,10,16
232,Lage!,"Mitten drin, top Lage. Von hier ist alles gut zu Fuss machbar. Für die weniger fitten hält die Straßenbahn LUAS dirkt vor dem Hotel. Sehr freundlicher Service, tolles Personal. Hotel hat Charme und wurde kürzlich einem leichten Lifting unterogen. Das Zimmer war sehr geräumig. Frühstück lecker. Insgesamt ein gutes Prei-/Leistungsverhältnis - vor allem bei den ansonsten sehr hohen Hotelpreisen in der Innenstadt. Komme gerne wieder. ",5,2016,10,09
232,Fantastico soggiorno ,"Centralissimo.  Hotel molto bello, pulito e accogliente. Il personale è attento, gentile, professionale e parla l'italiano. Ottima la colazione Irlandese.  Wifi funzionante in tutto l'hotel e, oltre al ristorante, ha anche un pub. Palazzo d'epoca splendido. Ringrazio tutto lo staff per aver reso speciale la mia vacanza irlandese!",5,2016,09,23
232,PERFETTO,"Pernottato per tre notti in questa bella dimora storica in pieno centro.
Camera spaziosa, pulitissima ,bagno idem.
Personale efficiente e sorridente, sempre pronto a darti supporto ( una menzione a speciale alla torinese Roberta)
Buona la colazione , servita in una sala  storica che dà al tutto una marcia in più ; anche il pub è molto bello.
Caldamente consigliato",5,2016,09,05
232,Atmosphäre und Lage,"Sehr atmosphärisches Hotel, passend zum Flair der Stadt. Super Lage, alles fußläufig erreichbar. Trotz einer Ankunft mitten in der Nacht lief alles reibungslos. Die Zimmer sind ein wenig klein, aber gut eingerichtet. Wir haben nur einmal das Frühstück probieren können. Es gibt mehrere Gerichte von der Karte zur Auswahl. Ich hatte ein Full Irish Breakfast. Mein Ding war es nicht, aber ich glaube, das ist Geschmackssache. Es ist wie die meisten Hotels in Dublin nicht unbedingt preiswert, aber wie schon gesagt, für Dublin ist das wirklich preislicher Durchschnitt.",4,2016,09,02
232,Servicio inmejorable,"Hemos estado tres días alojados y tengo que destacar el servicio tan excelente que prestan. El personal de recepción es increíblemente amable, no hablan español pero hacen todo lo posible por entenderte y hacerse entender. El personal del restaurante es muy profesional y agradable en el trato. Los desayunos son estupendos (recomiendo los huevos benedictine).
La única pega es que algunas habitaciones son muy pequeñas (la nuestra era pequeña e interior, era la 521) y con cierto ruido (en nuestro caso se oía una máquina que debía estar cercana). Imagino que en invierno, con las ventanas cerradas no será tan ruidosa, aunque seguirá siendo pequeña. El baño parecía reformado recientemente y era bonito, aunque también le vendrían bien unos metritos más.
La situación del hotel es estupenda, junto a O'Connell street, muy cerca de Temple Bar y Trinity College y muy bien comunicado con cualquier parte de la ciudad.
El precio caro si lo comparas con hoteles en España, en la media de los precios de Dublín.",4,2016,09,01
232,Centralissimo e storico,"L'hotel è centralissimo, in una posizione perfetta per girare la città a piedi, ed è una bella struttura d'epoca che conserva intatto il suo fascino.
La stanza singola non era grandissima, ma accogliente e confortevole, oltre che pulita e curata, dotata di bollitore e ampia scelta di the e caffè.
Una menzione particolare allo staff davvero molto gentile ed efficiente, con il non tracurabile vantaggio della presenza di personale che parla italiano alla reception.
Colazione abbondante e di buon livello, un po' carente sulla parte dolce. nel complesso un hotel assolutamente consigliato.",4,2016,08,30
232,leider wird gerade die Straßenbahn vor dem Hotel gebaut;  Fazit: sehr viel Lärm!!,"Das Hotel liegt schön zentral und man kann viele Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuß erreichen. Auch den Bereich ""Temple Bar"" und sogar bis zur Guinness-Brauerei
sind wir zu Fuß gegangen. Eine schöne Bar und auch sonst ein schön im alten Stil
eingerichtetes Hotel. Der Frühstücksraum paßte aber nicht zur Gästekapazität.
Wir waren alleine eine Gruppe mit ca. 40 Personen und konnten nicht gemeinsam
frühstücken.",3,2016,08,05
232,Top Lage. Super Frühstück.,"Die Lage ist super, nicht weit von Temple Bar und der Haltestelle von Air Coach. Das Personal ist überaus freundlich und zuvorkommend. Die Auswahl zum Frühstück ist groß und es wird frisch zubereitet. Wir würden jederzeit wieder kommen.",5,2016,07,15

232,Centralissimo,"Bell'hotel in posizione ottima,ci siamo trovati molto bene sia dal punto di vista della struttura(stanza grande e pulita) che da quello del personale(gentile,in più c'è una ragazza che parla italiano) che da quello della colazione(ottima e ricca).Lo consigliamo sotto tutti i punti di vista",5,2016,06,11
232,Hotel d'epoca,"Meraviglioso albergo ad un minuto della centralissima O'Connoly street.Stanza grande con 4 letti, nonostante avessimo prenotato una matrimoniale. Tutto pulito, nella stanza anche un bollitore con delle bustine di the e caffe .Stanza sul retro é silenziosa.
Colazione sia irlandese che continentale. Nella sala dovrete aspettare il cameriere per essere accompagnati ai tavoli. 
Personale della reception gentile.
Da ritornare.",5,2016,05,05
232,Old style,"Cercavo un hotel di buona qualità non in zona temple bar ma comunque vicino. E l'ho trovato nel Wynns hotel. Gentilissimi e professionali tutti.
Colazione in una bella ed elegante sala. A disposizione colazione dolce (a buffet)  e salata alla carta. Uova alla Benedict eccezionali. Ci hanno assegnato una camera tripla, quindi più ampia, anche se eravamo solo in due. Ho letto di altri utenti che si lamentavano del rumore. Ora, fermo restando che comunque siamo nel centro di in una città e non in campagna, devo dire che dalla nostra camera al terzo piano non sentivo la festa che si svolgeva al primo piano oppure i rumori esterni. Sono stata felicissima di aver scelto questo hotel. Grazie! ",5,2016,04,26
232,24 ore a Dublino ,"Sono stata a Dublino con il mio ragazzo e abbiamo pernottato in questo albergo di atmosfera di fino 800 .Posizione fantastica : centralissimo . Vicino al bus che porta all'aeroporto , massima gentilezza e pulizia . Colazione irlandese buonissima . Unica pecca un po' caro , pare per il centenario dalla rivoluzione ! ",5,2016,04,25
232,Perfetto,"Quando ho selezionato questo hotel non pensavo che avrebbe superato così tanto le mie aspettative. La struttura è storica e ti consente di immergerti nell'atmosfera di Dublino. Nella nostra stanza c'erano anche un caminetto elettrico, quadri, poltrone e una libreria con i libri di Joyce. La colazione è continentale a buffet e irish alla carta. Buonissima! Menù molto vario, pancakes, porridge, pudding, uova preparate dallo chef come si desidera, bacon, salsiccia, verdure, focaccia... perfino pesce alla griglia. Personale gentilissimo alla reception, al ristorante e al pub. Posizione perfetta, è in pieno centro, per visitare a piedi Dublino e per il collegamento con l'aeroporto via bus (ogni 15'). Pulizia delle camere buona e bagno confortevole, con jacuzzi. Gli accessori ci sono tutti: prodotti da toilette, frigo, cassaforte, ferro+asse da stiro, phon. Wi-fi free. Scelta azzeccata!",5,2016,04,24
232,Localizacion inmejorable,"Hotel super céntrico, en un edificio bonito, habitaciones espaciosas, (sin pasarse, y con un baño pequeño y sin muchas comodidades) muy buena atención por parte de todo el personal y el desayuno muy correcto. Lo mejor sin duda es la localización.",4,2016,03,29
232,Atmosphärisches Hotel in Top-Lage,"Jacuzzi, 2 TVs, bequemes Bett, Parkservice, Kühlschrank. Sehr schöne, auf typisch englischem Stil designtes Hotel mit sehr gutem Service. Frühstück ala Cart lässt auch keine Wünsche offen. Direkt in der Nebenstraße der lebendigen O`Connell Straße gelegen, ist es die perfekte Ausgangslage für Shopping und Sightseeingtouren. Übrigens sind die Startpunkte der Hop on Hop off Busse ebenfalls ca 30 m entfernt.",5,2016,01,07
232,solo di passaggio in hotel d'atmosfera,"Una sola notte pagata cara  perchè ho prenotato una sola camera un sabato sera nella quale Dublino era molto richiesta ma la colazione fantastica sia continentale che irlandese nella bella sala,  e la posizione a due passi dal Half  Penny Bridge e dal Trinity College la valevano e sono un bellissimo ricordo ! camera un pó piccola ma comoda . Se ritornassi a Dublino ci tornerei ! ( la sera stessa nel salone al primo piano si stava svolgendo una simpatica festa di un ottantesimo compleanno di una signora dublinese)",5,2015,12,15
232,Colazione buonissima e posizione perfetta,"Personale gentile, buona pulizia, posizione molto centrale e la colazione in particolare mi è piaciuta tantissimo siccome si poteva scegliere anche cose tipiche irlandesi.

232,Posizione fantastica!,"L'hotel si trova in un' ottima posizione, 5 minuti a piedi dal  Trinity College, quartiere di Temple Bar e dal ponte Ha' Penny.

",4,2015,12,08
232,Angenehmes Flair der Jahrhundertwende,"Wynn's Hotel wurde 1845 erbaut und ist damit das zweitälteste Hotel in Dublin. Es ist sehr gut gelegen, um die Stadt zu Fuß zu erkunden. 

Freilich wurde es seit Erbauung einige Male restauriert bzw. renoviert. Der besondere Charme eines komfortablen Hotels der Jahrhundertwende wurde aber erhalten. So sind die Decken des Frühstücksraums, der Rezeption und des Pubs mit teilweise goldenem Stuck und prachtvollen Leuchtern verziert. Die Zimmer sind ebenfalls sehr anheimelnd und atmen diesen Geist vergangener Zeiten.

Auf der anderen Seite hat das Waschbecken im Bad lediglich Miniaturformat und hängt nur knapp über Kniehöhe. Dazu kommt diese historische Spezialität, die man auch heute auf den Inseln noch oft bewundern kann, dass zwei getrennte Wasserhähne für kalt und heiß angebracht sind. Das Gesicht muss man sich also unter der Dusche waschen. In dieser wurde zum Glück eine neumodische Mischbatterie installiert. 

Damit kein Missverständnis aufkommt: die Zimmer sind sauber; das ganze Haus ist gut in Schuss. Das Personal ist auf natürliche Art und Weise freundlich. 

Zum Schluß noch eine Anmerkung, dass das Frühstück immer sehr gut geschmeckt hat. Auch hier eine Besonderheit: Es gibt kein riesiges Buffet, sondern die meisten Speisen bestellt man und sie werden dann sehr zügig für einen zubereitet.

Vor dem Hintergrund, dass das Hotel, zumindest die Standard Rooms, relativ preisgünstig sind, gebe ich vier von fünf Punkten.

Dublin ist eine sehr schöne Stadt mit den vielen kleinen bunten Läden, Restaurants und Pubs, dem kleinen Fluß, der Nordteil und Südteil voneinander trennt, sowie der Nähe zum Meer (für einen Besuch bieten sich Bray und Howth an - mit der DART-Eisenbahn sehr gut erreichbar). ",4,2015,11,13
232,Signorile,"Quest'albergo è decisamente ben posizionato, a pochissimi passi da O'Connell Street, il viale principale di Dublino. Si presenta molto signorile, sia pur nella sua non eccessiva grandezza. Le piccole dimensioni della camera da letto sono state compensate dall'ampiezza del bagno, spazioso e splendente. La camera era comunque molto graziosa e raffinata. La qualità del sonno è risultata molto alta. Il personale dell'albergo si è mostrato molto disponibile e preparato nelle lingue straniere: una delle receptionist con cui ho avuto modo di interagire parlava perfettamente l'italiano. Servizio wi-fi eccellente. Unica nota dolente probabilmente è stata la colazione: ho deciso di provare quella continentale, ma non l'ho trovata eccellente né qualitativamente né quantitativamente.",4,2015,11,12
232,Ottimo Hotel,"Dopo un'accanita ricerca su quale fosse il miglior compromesso tra qualità, prezzo e distanza dal centro, siamo approdati al Wynn's. Scelta azzeccata: albergo antico e arredato in modo molto classico, gentili alla reception, belle e pulitissime le camere (forse i materassi un pò morbidi per le nostre abitudini), buona e ampia la colazione, ottima la posizione, silenzioso nonostante il tram che passa sotto le finestre. Abbiamo prenotato 3 camere direttamente tramite albergo. avevo chiesto camere ai piani alti e siamo stati accontentati. Abbiamo chiesto un supporto per una prenotazione ad un ristorante e si sono messe in 2 per aiutarci. Ci è piaciuto veramente tutto.Che dire, lo consiglio vivamente.",5,2015,11,03
232,Empfehlenswert,"Habe 3 Nächte im Wynn's verbracht und war total zufrieden. Das Hotel wurde 1845 gebaut bzw. 1921 wieder aufgebaut. Dementsprechend ist es ein historisches Gebäude - trotzdem machen die Zimmer einen guten Eindruck, auch die Badezimmer wurden wohl erst kürzlich renoviert. Ich hatte ein Zimmer im 2. Stock mit Fenster zum Innenhof. Keine schöne Aussicht, dafür aber auch kein Straßenlärm. Denn das Hotel ist sehr zentral und grenzt an die lebhafte O'Connel Street - da kann es auch nachts mal lauter werden. Außerdem gut: freies WLAN im Zimmer, kostenloses super Frühstück und eine nette Bar mit frisch gezapften Guinness und anderen guten Drinks. Würde wieder hier übernachten!",4,2015,11,03
232,Lage top aber Hote mit Defiziten,"Das Hotel liegt in sehr zentraler Lage und ist somit ein guter Ausgangspunkt für Städtetouren.  Temple Bar liegt in direkter Reichweite. Das Hotelpersonal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die Zimmer sind groß genug, die Einrichtung aber in die Jahre gekommen. Die Wasserleitungen und die Toilettenspülung machen noch erkennbare Geräuche, auch wenn bereits der Wasserhahn zugedreht wurde. WLAN auf dem Zimmer ist nicht verfügbar. Hier muss man schon die hausinterne Bar aufsuchen. Das Frühstück besteht aus 3 verschiedenen Angeboten ....gut, aber etwas unflexibel.",3,2015,11,03
232,Bello,"Situato a due passi dalla centrale O'Connell Street, questo albergo si presenta all'esterno con grande classe. La receptionist parlava italiano ed è stata molto cortese. La stanza era un po' piccola anche se il bagno era enorme, tutto pulito e tutto garbato.
L'albergo ha anche un ristorante interno del quale non ho usufruito. La colazione può essere sia continentale a buffet che la tradizionale irlandese alla carta, tutto comunque estremamente signorile e professionale. Il wi-fi funziona perfettamente.",4,2015,11,02
232,Supera le aspettative,"L'hotel è in centro a Dublino, comodissimo se si arriva dall'aeroporto con il bus. Il personale è molto disponibile e gentile. La camera era completamente rinnovata pur mantenendo lo stile retrò, spaziosa e pulita. Colazione abbondante, varia e buona. Decisamente un tre stelle eccellente. ",5,2015,10,29
232,Storico e glorioso,"In questo hotel vittoriano dalla posizione centralissima ha avuto inizio, nel 1913, la storia della Repubblica Irlandese, con la fondazione degli ""Irish Volunteers"". Negli anni seguenti molte importanti decisioni sono state prese nelle sue sale dagli eroi dell'indipendenza irlandese, fino al suo completo incendio nel 1916 ad opera del bombardamento inglese. Ci sono voluti ben dieci anni per ricostruirlo! L'hotel dei giorni nostri è stato usato come uno dei set del film ""Michael Collins (1996).
Molto elegante e funzionale, dispone di ristorante tradizionale, self service e un ottimo bar, dove sono stata gentilmente ospitata, mentre le mie valigie erano a deposito, quando, alla fine del primo tour da me effettuato ""Dublino e sud d'Irlanda"" e prima di cominciare il secondo tour ""Ovest d'Irlanda e isole Aran"" attendevo il taxi che mi portava, incredibilmente!, in un hotel alla periferia di Dublino, brutto e anonimo...già, perché -grazie alla pessima organizzazione di CALDANA TRAVEL SERVICE TOUR- sono stata sbattuta lontano, sprecando un'intera giornata di viaggio e pagando da me il transfert, mentre sarebbe stato molto più semplice pernottare al Wynn's , come da programma e GIA' PAGATO, e farsi trovare all'angolo della strada il mattino dopo, quando il nuovo tour è passato proprio di lì!!! Nonostante le richieste congiunte della guida, sig. Montechiaro, e della agenzia con la quale ho prenotato,  Eurostudy Travel di Napoli, non c'é stato nulla da fare...né le promesse di rimborsarmi il taxi hanno avuto seguito...alla fine mi è stato offerto dalla mia agenzia, nella persona di Simone De Pascale, che ringrazio vivamente, come ringrazio lo staff del Wynn's per la cortesia e la comprensione. Spero di poter ritornare in questo storico Hotel e di godere appieno della sua ospitalità. Non altrettanto posso dire dell'operatore Caldana, che sconsiglio vivamente (ci sono stati problemi di organizzazione e mancanza di chiarezza e cortesia durante tutto il tour, mitigati solo dalla gentilezza delle guide!) e a cui, evidentemente, non interessa il benessere e la soddisfazione dei suoi clienti.",4,2015,10,23
232,In die Jahre gekommen - aber mit Charme und toller Lage,"Als ich gegen 23 Uhr ankam, dachte ich mir: oh je!

Nach dem erste Bier in der hoteleigenen typisch Irischen Bar wars schon besser und nach drei Tagen Übernachtung vorweg mein Fazit:
Ich würde wieder da übernachten!

An der Rezeption waren absolut alle freundlich und hilfsbereit. Besonders hervorzuheben ist der Servicechef im Frühstücksraum und jeder Mitarbeiter.
Das Frühstück ist beispielhaft toll - wenn man die angebotenen diversen Eierspeisvarianten mag.

Das Mobiliar im Frühstückraum ist antiquarisch und die Sessel dementsprechend durchgesessen. Aber es hat was.

Die Lage ist unschlagbar. 10 Meter zur O'Connell Street (wo alle Busse ankommen bzw abfahren), 100 Meter zur O'Connell Brücke und ca 400 Meter zum Temple Bar District.

Das (Einzel-) Zimmer war ausreichend groß, das Bad sauber und die Handtücher wurden täglich gewechselt. 

Gutes Shampoo und Duschmittel wurde ebenfalls täglich neu geboten!

WLAN war im Zimmer wie im ganzen Hotel kostenlos verfügbar!",4,2015,10,10
232,Ottimo hotel,"Un hotel a quattro stelle ma economico che ha tutte le qualità per essere tale.
Posizione centralissima e strategica, partendo da questo hotel si può girare tutta Dublino a piedi. Gran bella struttura, elegante e funzionale. Oltre al ristorante a la carte, l'hotel offre un sevizio di self service di buona qualità ed economico (dai 10 ai 12 € per un abbondante piatto unico di carne o di pesce con verdure varie). Inoltre ha un servizio bar molto carino e ben assortito (è stato qui che ho bevuto la mia prima pinta di Guinness). La camera era spaziosa e dotata di molte comodità: cassaforte, ferro da stiro, cialde per il caffè e svariati gusti di the con relativo bollitore.
Accanto all'hotel esiste un supermercato molto fornito che dispone anche di tavoli per pranzare o cenare a buon prezzo con piatti caldi o freddi. Una comodità da non sottovalutare
 Lo consiglio sicuramente",5,2015,09,15
232,Pretenzioso (e inutilmente costoso),"Bisogna prenettere e precisare che, da un punto di vista oggettivo, l'hotel è suggestivo e centrale, la colazione buona e, considerando gli standard dublinesi, abbastanza pulito.
Tuttavia, non vale il prezzo: la colazione si può fare praticamente dappertutto anche con pochi euro; l'hotel sarà pure storico, ma c'è un unico (e lento) ascensore per cinque piani; il wifi nelle camere non arriva, la tv non ha canali internazionali e il personale è disinteressato se non addirittura sgarbato (al contrario della maggior parte degli irlandesi che, invece, sono calorosissimi).
Per il prezzo pagato ci aspettavamo di più.
Segnaliamo un unico episodio davvero spiacevole: eravamo rientrati in camera nel primo pomeriggio (la camera quindi era stata già sistemata al mattino) e una persona ha bussato, ma senza attendere una nostra risposta, ha aperto la porta e poi, alla nostra richiesta di spiegazioni, ha detto di voler controllare se ""avevamo bisogno del servizio"".
Dopo tanti anni di viaggi e di soggiorni in hotel, alberghi, pensioni e stamberghe, mi è sembrato sconvolgente che un dipendente dell'hotel, sapendo che eravamo in camera, entrasse senza annunciarsi a dovere (e se davvero volevamo sapere se avevamo ""bisogno del servizio"" potevano telefonare........).
Non vale i soldi che si fan pagare, non ci torneremmo, nè lo consiglieremmo.",2,2015,09,13
232,Gradevole atmosfera retrò e colazione super!,"Ho soggiornato per due notti in questo suggestivo hotel in stile vittoriano, arredato con grande ricerca del dettaglio al fine di ricreare una suggestione tipica dell’albergo d’epoca.
Le porte completamente stuccate e riverniciate sono, con ogni probabilità, se non quelle originali comunque molto vecchie.  Si nota come le antiche serrature siano state disabilitate senza asportarle semplicemente affiancandole a quelle moderne!
Le stanze sono pulite ed accoglienti, i bagni sono nuovi e ben accessoriati ma sempre “in stile”.
L’ambiente, oltre che da un punto di vista estetico, è molto caldo anche come temperatura.
Quindi consiglierei l’hotel per chi viene a Dublino nei mesi freddi. Avrà a disposizione nella camera anche un termoconvettore elettrico che si rivelerà utilissimo per asciugare le scarpe dopo una giornata di cammino sotto le famose pioggerelle Dublinesi!
Infine la colazione, inclusa nel prezzo, veramente eccezionale.
Si può scegliere tra la soluzione “continental” self service, o quella “irish” alla carta, che consiglio vivamente. Per me si è trattato dei migliori pasti “Irish” che ho fatto a Dublino!",4,2015,08,31
232,Posizione fantastica,"Posizione perfetta: vicino a tutti i bus, DART e treni; 10 minuti a piedi da Temple Bar, facilmente raggiungibile dall'aeroporto senza spendere grosse cifre con i taxi (aircoach o airlink ).
Personale molto attento, disponibile e gentile alla reception e nella sala colazioni.
Colazioni ricche ed abbondanti.
Camera pulita e con tutti i confort e WI FI funzionante anche in camera.",5,2015,08,29
232,Muy buen hotel,"Nos alojamos en dos ocasiones (ya que el fin de semana nos fuimos a Belfast y muy amablemente nos guardaron la maleta grande hasta la vuelta). En la primera ocasión muy bien; habitación super silenciosa, el WiFi llegaba bien, etc .. en la segunda ocasión la habitación daba a la calle principal y había un poco de ruido. El WiFi directamente no llegaba. El ascensor es bastante lento.
La cama es muy comoda, hay nevera en la habitación y TV. Como curiosidad diré que aunque ponen un hervidor con sus dos tazas, solo hay una cuchara. En las dos habitaciones nos pasó lo mismo. No deja de ser gracioso. 
Los desyunos una pasada, muy muy buenos en especial los huevos benedictinos. La atención al cliente también es buena, había una recepcionista en concreto que era de lo más simpática. Si volvemos a Dublin repetiremos.",5,2015,08,22

232,Promosso a pieni voti!,"Scelta azzeccata!! Ottimo hotel, dieci minuti di passeggio dal quartiere temple bar, due minuti dalle fermate dell'air link da e per l'aeroporto, affacciato sulla frequentata o'connell street.
Personale della reception gentilissimo, check-in velocissimo,stanza pulita e completa di tutto. Nota di merito alla colazione inclusa, a buffet se la si vuole dolce, con croissant , torte cereali e succhi vari, e alla carta se si vuole salata, con uova salsiccia funghi un piccolo hamburger. Assolutamente da consigliare!!!!",4,2015,06,13
232,Posizione ideale per visitare la città,"Esperienza molto positiva. Posizione ideale (10mn da Temple Bar). Mezzi di trasporto vicini. Camera comoda, unico punto negativo, il bagno piccolo.

232,Muy buena ubicación,"El hotel se encuentra situado en pleno centro, pero lo suficientemente alejado del bullicio nocturno. Tienes a 5 minutos andando las paradas del autobús del aeropuerto, la zona de bares de Temple y una parada de tranvía en la misma puerta.
En cuanto a decoración es un poco antiguo pero reformado. Las habitaciones vienen totalmente equipadas, pero ojo! no son todas exactamente del mismo tamaño.
El desayuno estaba muy bien. Tienen wifi que funciona correctamente
Hotel recomendable si lo que necesitas es estar en el centro pero con buen descanso",4,2015,03,25
232,Amabilidad Irlandesa,"Hotel centrico con buena relación calidad-precio,que te permite visitar a pié gran parte de la zona turística dublinesa. 

Su personal con un trato exquisito y con muy buena predisposición para cualquier duda o imprevisto que os pueda surgir en el viaje.

Dispone de parking gratuito y personal que se encarga de aparcarlo o tenerlo preparado cuando lo necesites en la puerta del hotel.

Las habitaciones, conservan un aire colonial y cuidadas que hace que te sientas muy cómodo.

Una experiéncia muy buena, os lo recomiendo!!!! Y luego unas pintas en The Temple Bar.",5,2015,03,19
232,Quasi perfetto!,"Quasi perfetto se non fosse per la moquette (presente purtroppo in tutti gli hotel a Dublino) che non era molto pulita...
Abbiamo pagato non poco,2 notti a 238,00 € in camera doppia,ma sicuramente ne vale!
Il personale è stato veramente gentilissimo,le camere ampie,con un finto camino che riscaldava la stanza. Il wi-fi purtroppo non prende bene nelle camere, mancanza di prese vicino il letto e vicino la scrivania (l'iphone ho dovuto poggiarlo per terra per ricaricarlo...).
Per il resto, letti e cuscini comodissimi,nel bagno erano presenti shampoo,cuffie,bagnoschiuma,phon, e asciugamani in abbondanza.
La colazione è abbondante e molto buona,poca varietà di dolci però. E' servita in una stanza grande e molto elegante. Centralissimo e comodo per gli spostamenti.
Lo consiglio!",4,2015,01,27
232,UNA SETTIMANA SENZA ACQUA CALDA!!,"Premesso che l'albergo si trova in posizione centralissima, infatti in meno di dieci minuti a piedi si arriva a temple bar, e che la struttura è veramente bella siamo rimasti molto delusi dal fatto che un albergo a 4* ci abbia lasciato tutte le mattine senza acqua calda per problemi di pressione(così ci hanno detto). Per fortuna abbiamo contrattato ed ottenuto uno sconto sull'importo da pagare. Per il resto tutto nella media. Abbondante la colazione. Caratteristico il pub all'interno dell'hotel.",3,2015,01,26

La ubicación es inmejorable, solo cruzas un puente y estas en Temple Bar, Triniti College y todo lo mejor de Dublin. Y a 10 metros de O`Conell Street, y de sus centros commerciales. Creo que es lo mejor que se puede conseguir desde el punto de vista de calidad/precio. He pasado 4 noches en el y si volviera a Dublin, volvería a alojarme en el.",5,2014,10,12
232,Ottimo!,"Il mio 4 anno a Dublino, il primo in questo hotel e devo dire che mi sono trovata benissimo. Il personale è gentilissimo, pronto a soddisfare qualsiasi problema ed esigenza. A noi hanno prontamente cambiato la camera, nonostante l'errore di prenotazione fosse stato il nostro (twin invece che double) senza alcuna differenza di prezzo. Le camere pulitissime, molto comode e spaziose (ho avuto la fortuna di vederne due!). Il bagno spazioso e comodo con una splendida vasca idromassaggio enorme!!!Fornito di tutto: tv, cassaforte, frigobar, phon, set bagno, asciugamani (pulitissimi)  e l'immancabile set per il te!!! La posizione è assolutamente centrale, perfetta oserei dire: in pieno centro, ma sufficientemente ""lontana"" (se a Dublino si può definire lontano visto che è tutto a portata di ""piede""!) dalla zona ""Temple bar"" che è quella più movimentata la notte, per cui il riposo notturno è assicurato! L'hotel è silenzioso! c'è anche un ""pub"" interno che però non crea nessun tipo di problema di rumori. Per altro proprio sotto l'albergo ci sono le fermate della metro di superficie e autobus. Sicuramente non è un hotel in stile moderno, ma perfettamente in stile irlandese, arredato con gusto con mobilio d'epoca! La colazione abbondante, varia (sia salata che dolce), internazionale e tipica...buonissima, in una bella sala ""anticheggiante"" e luminosa! Ecco, se proprio devo trovare un difetto direi la mancanza del miscelatore nel lavandino...ma questo fa parte del fascino dell'hotel! Ci tornerei sicuramente!!",5,2014,10,06
232,Consigliabile!,"Mi son trovata benissimo in questo hotel , raffinato e arredato con mobili d'epoca! La posizione é centrale, la cortesia ineguagliabile e la qualitá prezzo é straordinaria. Quando tornerò   a Dublino non avrò il minimo dubbio sulla sua scelta. ",4,2014,10,05
232,Posizione eccellente e tanta cordialità,"Hotel storico risalente al 1845 posizionato strategicamente appena a nord del Leffey River, a 10 metri da O'Connel Sreet e a 5 minuti a piedi dal Trinity College. Personale alla reception e portieri molto disponibili e gentilissimi. Le camere sono di medie dimensioni, con arredi classici e moquette, tv, cassaforte, frigobar, asse da stiro. Bagno piccolo ma fornito di tutto il necessario (phon, shampo, docciaschiuma, cuffie x doccia), doccia ben regolabile e con un buon getto. Pulito e a buon prezzo (€90 in agosto). Ottima colazione servita in una bella sala ampia e luminosa: cibo a buffet + opzione a scelta dal menu per il cibo caldo (irish breakfast, pancake, porridge). A soli 50 metri c'è il bus per l'aeroporto (Airport Link, €6) e proprio di fronte la fermata del LUAS (tram). Consigliatissimo.",4,2014,09,22
232,Centrale e classico,"L'albergo e' una struttura piuttosto classica situata in zona centralissima in città assai comodo come base per passeggiare e per prendere autobus e tram.

La colazione ottima, oltre a servirsi da soli al classico banco, il cameriere raccoglie gli ordini per colazioni varie: dalla tradizionale irish, o come fatto da noi toast e pancake.oersonale gentile. Unico neo nel nostro soggiorno: l'ascensore non funzionava.",4,2014,08,26
232,una settimana a Dublino,"Allora, diciamo che il Wynn's ha la comodità di essere in centro città, di offrire una sistemazione confortevole e piacevole (si le camere non sono enormi, ma io penso che in fin dei conti uno ci dorme e basta). Il personale è molto disponibile e gentile( una delle receptionist è una signora italiana, ergo per chi avesse difficoltà con la lingua può rivolgersi a lei). Molto allegro il bar interno, e la cucina offre un menù abbastanza vario non legato ai soliti menù anglosassoni.
Certo non ha più lo splendore dei tempi passati (e[ stato anche ridimensionato come estensione),
comunque ci ritornerei molto volentieri.",4,2014,08,05

Grosse Frühstückskarte (mit Eiern, Pudding etc.) sowie ein kaltes Buffet.",4,2014,06,13
232,Schönes Hotel in toller Lage,"Das Hotel ist sehr schön, gepflegt und für eine Stadtbesichtigung in optimaler Lage. Viele Sehenswürdigkeiten, Lokale und die Fußgängerzone mit vielen Geschäften ist leicht zu Fuß zu erreichen. Alle Mitarbeiter sind sehr freundlich. Einzig und alleine das Ankommen mit dem Auto ist etwas problematisch, weil die Schienen der Straßenbahn direkt vor dem Eingang vorbeiführen und es daher keine Ladezone gibt. Wir sind auf den Gehsteig gefahren, das Auto wurde dann vom Hotelpersonal geparkt.",5,2014,05,27
232,Non proprio un 4 stelle,"Ho soggiornato dal 7 al 9 marzo , la struttura è un pò datata , le camere sono spaziose, il bagno un pò piccolo .

232,Un muy buen hotel en el centro de Dublin,"El hotel es muy bueno, situación inmejorable tanto para la visita de la ciudad, como para el transporte desde y hasta el aeropuerto. El tranvía para en la puerta del hotel. Lo dicho, la situación es inmejorable para visitar la ciudad.

El servicio es bueno y amable, especialmente los encargados de servir el desayuno, trato excelente. El desayuno es estupendo y abundante, servido en un salón muy bien decorado, espacioso y luminoso.

La habitación espaciosa, limpia, y silenciosa, instalaciones modernizadas, con los estándares españoles, yo le daría tres estrellas, casi cuatro.

en resumen hemos estado cuatro noches en Dublín, y repetiría sin dudarlo, por la comodiad de la situación  la amabilidad de su personal, y sobre todo la limpieza y la amplitud de la habitación.",5,2014,02,02
232,Centrale e comodo,"Situato in piena Dublino, in un antico palazzo ritengo rimodernato. Permette la visita della città comodamente a piedi. Vicinissimi i mezzi pubblici. Camere piccole ed essenziali, ma confortevoli. A disposizione asse, ferro da stiro e tutto il necessario per bevande calde. Bagno con idromassaggio. Qualche rumore notturno, che non inficia. Personale ""squisito"" e professionale. Garage gratuito con ritiro e riconsegna dell'auto a cura dell'albergo.

232,Gutes Hotel in toller Lage,"Wir verbrachten 3 Nächte zum Abschluss unserer Reise in diesem Hotel und haben es nicht bereut. Das Personal war sehr freundilch und hilfsbereit. Wir buchten ein ruhiges Zweibettzimmer und bekamen eines im dritten Stock in den Innenhof, das riesengroß war. Man konnte bei offenen Fenster schlafen, nur einmal verirrten sich Betrunkene in den Innenhof und machten entsprechenden Lärm. Das Hotel selbst scheint alteingesessen zu sein, das Alter war auch überall zu sehen, aber der Qualität tat dies keinen Abbruch. Beim Lift könnte man etwas ungeduldig werden, ein Klimagerät konnte man nur durch Ausschalten der entsprechenden Sicherung in der Nacht geräuschfrei machen. Das irische Frühstück war sehr gut und frisch gekocht. Da die Küche offen war, konnte man sich mit der netten Köchin unterhalten. Die Hotelbar war ebenfalls sehr gemütlich, das Essen hat dort auch gepasst und der tschechische Barman mit seinen deutsch-österreichischen Wurzeln war für einen Witz immer gut drauf. Die Lage des Hotels ist absolut zentral und für eine Stadtbesichtigung ideal. Man konnte fast alles zu Fuss erreichen.",4,2013,09,22
232,Traditionsreiches Hotel in guter Lage,"Das WYNN’s Hotel in Dublin ist ein hübsches altes Hotel im Herzen Dublins, das auf eine lange Tradition seit dem Jahr 1845 zurückblicken kann. Die Rezeption ist etwas eng und klein, aber alle Mitarbeiter waren ausgesprochen freundlich, hilfsbereit und bemüht, den Wünschen der Gäste gerecht zu werden. Die Atmosphäre im Hotel ist gediegen, etwas „plüschig“, aber durchaus gemütlich. Unser Zimmer und das Bad waren geräumig, sehr sauber, aber leider etwas laut, da bei den renovierten Superior-Zimmern alle Fenster zur Straßenseite zeigen, wo es doch bis in die frühen Morgenstunden recht lebhaft zugeht. Direkt vor dem Hotel befinden sich auch Haltestellen von Straßenbahn und Bus, was die Besichtigung von etwas weiter entfernt liegenden Zielen wie der Jameson Destillery, St. Patrick Cathedral, Christ Church und vielem mehr, sehr bequem macht, aber natürlich auch für einen gewissen Geräuschpegel sorgt. Bei kühleren Temperaturen und dann geschlossenen Fenstern ist aber alles gut auszuhalten.
Das WYNN’s Hotel hat eine nette Bar im Jugendstil-Dekor, wo mittags ein kleines Buffet aufgebaut wird mit verschiedenen Salaten und  Braten, auch warmem Schinken und Roastbeef, die jeweils frisch aufgeschnitten werden. Abends hat die Bar lange geöffnet und wird gerne von den Hotelgästen und anderen Besuchern genutzt.
Das Hauptrestaurant bietet eine recht vielfältige Menükarte, aber da wir während unseres Aufenthaltes immer außerhalb gegessen haben, kann ich die Kochkunst leider nicht beurteilen .In diesem Hauptrestaurant wird auch das Frühstück serviert, das für uns die einzige wirkliche Schwachstelle während unseres Aufenthaltes war. Das Restaurant ist viel zu klein für die vielen Gäste, die am Morgen zu den „Stoßzeiten“ frühstücken wollen. Das gestresste Personal machte einen eher desorientierten Eindruck und arbeitet m.E. völlig uneffektiv. Bis ein Tisch endlich abgeräumt wurde, wobei die Bedienungen die gebrauchten Tassen und Teller einzeln wegräumten und auf einen Tisch in der Nähe der Küchentheke abstellten, und bis wieder neu eingedeckt wurde, dauerte es sehr lange. Die wartenden Frühstücksgäste wurden so lange in die Bar gebeten, bis sie aufgerufen wurden. Das empfanden wir als nicht so glücklich! Das Frühstück selber – ein typisches deftiges irisches Frühstück mit Eiern nach Wahl – wurde am Tisch serviert, dauerte allerdings etwas lange. Auf der Theke und mit Blick in die um diese Zeit etwas chaotische Küche gab es eine kleine Auswahl an Müsli , Cornflakes und Dosenobst  - alles in allem nicht sehr prickelnd. Aber gut, wir wollten ja vorrangig Dublin sehen und dafür war das WYNN*s Hotel eine gute Wahl.

Gleich an der O’Connell Bridge gelegen, nur wenige Meter von dem berühmten Post Office entfernt, wo der irische Aufstand gegen die Engländer begann, konnten wir viele Sehenswürdigkeiten bequem zu Fuß erreichen, wie das Trinity College mit der Bibliothek und dem unbedingt sehenswerten Book of Kells. Die Einkaufsstrasse Grafton Street und auch das berühmte Stadtviertel Temple Bar mit seinen vielen Bars und Restaurants liegen ganz in der Nähe. Hier herrscht immer eine tolle Stimmung,  und der Besuch einer der typischen irischen Bars bei Livemusik und einem Guinness gehört durchaus zu den schönen Erlebnissen einer Irlandreise. Wir waren eigentlich immer zu Fuß unterwegs und empfanden das Hotel für unsere Zwecke sehr günstig gelegen. Auch das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis stimmte und wir würden deshalb bei einem weiteren Aufenthalt in Dublin auch wieder das WYNN’s Hotel wählen.",4,2013,08,31
232,Ottimo hotel,"L hotel si trova in un'ottima posizione per visitare Dublino. La camera che ci è stata assegnata era per 4 persone quindi per noi che siamo una coppia era veramente spaziosa, al contrario il bagno era piccolo ma funzionale. Ottima colazione a buffet con cereali, brioches, scones, yogurt, frutta tagliata e succhi. Caffè, cappuccino, latte caldo, thè vengono serviti al tavolo come i piatti salati che devono essere scelti dal menù. Il personale è molto gentile. Lo consigliamo!",4,2013,08,17
232,Zwiespältig,"Waren jetzt bestimmt das fünfte Mal im Wynns. Leider gibt es immer wieder Probleme mit dem Zimmer. Mal ist es über dem Partyroom/Hochzeit mit DJ bis in den Morgen. Mal ist es zur Strasse und laut und wieder ein anderes Mal ist es zum Innenhof mit Küchendüften.
Von all dem gewarnt habe ich alle diese Dinge in meiner Buchung erwähnt und um ein Zimmer gebeten dass diese Kriterien ausschließt. Bekommen habe ich wieder eines zum Innenhof. Diesmal allerdings wurden die Küchendüfte durch 3 sehr große Gebläse nach oben weggepumpt, die liefen von Morgens um 5 bis Abends um 10. Bei offenem Fenster schlafen unmöglich. Bei geschlossenem Fenster mit Klimaanlage ist die so laut dass man das Fenster auch gleich offen lassen kann.
Nach dem dritten Tag von dreien haben wir es erwähnt und man bot ein anderes Zimmer an. Warum frage ich mich hat man nicht gleich ein besseres Zimmer gegeben? Wir haben dann darauf verzichtet weil wir wegen einer Nacht nicht nochmal umziehen wollten.
Außerdem hatte das Bett in unserem Zimmer ein unteres Abschlussbrett dass es mir mit 1,83 Meter unmöglich machte ausgestreckt auf dem Bauch zu schlafen.
Sicher fragt der Leser sich jetzt warum wir das Wynns dann immer wieder buchen.
Es gibt auch Gutes. 
Das Frühstück ist formidabel, mit reichhaltiger Auswahl zwischen verschiedenen Variationen.
Die Einrichtung ist sehr hochwertig, Massivholz, Handtuchheizung, WLAN im ganzen Hotel, der Preis ist für die Lage sehr gut, ein paar Schritte und man ist mitten in der Innenstadt.
Als Konsequenz haben wir uns jetzt ein paar Zimmer vermerkt die wir in Zukunft zur Bedingung machen oder woanders buchen.",4,2013,08,17
232,Hotel en pleno centro con encanto inglés,"Este hotel situado en un lugar privilegiado junto a todas las atracciones turística de Dublín, destaca por la amabilidad del servicio y su estilo clásico. Las habitaciones son correctas, con un baño un tanto pequeño pero muy mono. La única pega las vistas. El desayuno era excelente en un salón muy agradable. ",5,2013,08,09
232,"Hotel ottimo in tutto, peccato per la nostra camera..","L'hotel è antico ma ben tenuto, con personale in portineria gentilissimo, una signora parlava anche molto bene l'italiano.
Peccato che a noi hanno dato una stanza veramente minuscola, con un bagnetto lillipuziano ed il letto piccolissimo, adatto più ad una persona singola che ad una coppia, con un solo comodino.
Visto che ci siamo stati solo una notte, la cosa non ci ha sconvolti più di tanto, però non abbiamo dormito bene, anche perché le stanze non sono ben insonorizzate, addirittura sentivamo il clic del vicino di stanza che accendeva la luce.
La colazione invece è veramente ottime, forse la migliore che abbiamo trovato in Irlanda: buffet con frutta fresca sbucciata, scones, croissants, e menu con molti piatti appetitosi, noi abbiamo mangiato delle uova benedict buonissime, il personale di sala è molto gentile ed efficiente.
La posizione è perfetta, a ridosso di O'Connell street, in due passi si è a Temple bar o a Grafton street, i mezzi pubblici da e per l'aeroporto sono dietro l'angolo.",4,2013,07,31
232,"Top-Lage, leicht veraltet","Als Ausgangspunkt für Städtebesichtigungen ist das Wynn's in Dublin hervorragend geeignet. Nur wenige Schritte vom Airlink-Bus und vielen weiteren Bus-und Tramhaltestellen entfernt. Auch sind viele Sehenswürdigkeiten problemlos zu Fuss zu erreichen. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend, jedoch gibt es sehr unterschiedliche Zimmerqualitäten. Die als Einzellzimmer angebotenen Twin-Rooms sind sehr klein, zum Teil auch sehr dunkel, mit Blick auf die nächste Hauswand. Die Fenster lassen sich nur einen Spalt breit öffnen und es gibt keine Klimaanlage, was jetzt, im Sommer, zu unangenehm hohen Temperaturen und stickiger Luft geführt hat. Trotz der höheren Lärmbelastung von der Strasse her würde ich ein Zimmer zur Vorderseite bevorzugen, diese sind heller und grösser. Zimmer zur Rückseite liegen zum Teil über der Lüftung (Lärm/Essensgeruch).  Wer kein britischisches Frühstück mag, ist in der Auswahl etwas eingeschränkt. Empfehlung: 1 Rührei für 2 bestellen, Portionen sind üppig! Ein paar Erneuerung (z.Bsp. WC-Spülung, etc.) würden nicht schaden. Trotz allem empfehlenswert, vor allem wegen der Lage, aber vielleicht eher nicht im Sommer.",4,2013,07,28
232,"Hotel viejo, con cierto encanto","Lo mejor del hotel es, sin duda, su ubicación. En grafton street, en el centro mismo de Dublin. Desde él se llega caminando a cualquier atracción de la ciudad sin necesidad de trasporte público. En cuanto a conservación el hotel es un poco viejo. Nada está descuidado, pero nada es nuevo. La habitación es antigua, como todo en el hotel, muebles de madera oscuros y de aire clásico. La cama es cómoda y los colchones buenos, por lo que se puede dormir y descansar, cosa que se agradece después de todo un día de visita por la ciudad.
Evirad las habitaciones que dan a la calle, son bonitas las vistas, pero muy ruidosas y el sistema de asilamiento, la verdad, no existe.
El baño es correcto. La grifería de nuestra habitación completamente nueva. Amenities de gel, champú, gorro de baño y útiles de cosido para una urgencia.
Hay caja fuerte y plancha. Televisión plana que no pusimos siquiera.
El comedor es muy bonito con estupendos ventanales a la calle. El desayuno sencillamente fabuloso, merece la pena llevarlo incluido en el precio.
El bar, en la misma línea es elegante y un buen sitio para descansar o tomar una  pinta.
En fin,  hotel correcto para visitar la ciudad unos dias.",3,2013,06,08
232,Ottima posizione,"Sito in posizione ottima per visitare il centro di Dublino anche a piedi a poca distanza. Ben servito da mezzi pubblici.

232,Sería excelente si cambiaran las camas,Hotel casi perfecto a falta de camas nuevas. Es el único punto en contra y por eso no les doy la máxima puntuación. El personal de recepción es muy amable y atento. La habitación está muy bien y el lavabo muy grande con bañera de hidromasaje. Todo muy limpio. El desayuno es muy completo con opción de Irish Breakfast. Y la ubicación es perfecta para moverte por Dublín e ir andando a cualquier sitio.,4,2013,05,13
232,"Buona posizione, struttura antica, internet pessimo","Ho soggiornato in questo antico hotel del centro di Dublino nell'area di O'Connel street.  La posizione è sicuramente comoda per i mezzi pubblici: dall'aeroporto troverete ben tre compagnie di bus che con circa 6 euro vi portano a due passi dall'albergo.
Una volta lì poi potrete, sempre facendo pochi passi, comprare un abbonamento a tutti i mezzi pubblici ed utilizzarli a piacimento, sebbene a Dublino tutte le attrazioni (e sono veramente molte) siano facilmente raggiungbili a piedi.
Il personale dell'hotel è sostanzialmente gentile.  Anche i camerieri presenti alla colazione sono molto gentili, e come breakfast siamo sicuramente ad un buon livello, sia se ci si vuole mantenere su quella continentale sia se ci si lancia in una delle 5 proposte tipicamente irlandesi.
La camera è risultata pulita...sicuramente vecchiotta ma in buone condizioni.
Il bagno non aveva finestra però estremamente pulito.   Bizzarro l'antico lavabo di dimensioni ridottissime e con una mensola di vetro che coprendolo per metà costringe ad inchini spaventosi quando ci si lava.  Sempre il lavabo, come segnalato già da altri utenti, ha due rubinetti separati per l'acqua calda e l'acqua fredda...cosa piuttosto scomoda: a sinistra ci si scotta, a destra si gela.
La doccia invece era ottima e con un getto ampio e molto piacevole.  I cambi della biancheria quotidiani.   Le cameriere ai piani sorridenti ed anche più carine rispetto allo standard medio irlandese.
La cosa veramente dolente è risulkata essere internet.
Avevo espressamente richiestoper iscritto una camera con una buona copertura perché mi sarebbe servita per lavoro.   Niente da fare: per aggangiarmi ho dovuto mettere una sedia attaccata alla porta e stare lì in castigo perchè solo vicino al corridoio del piano era presente uno straccio di segnale.  In ogni caso la velocità era simile ad una messa cantata in latino.
Per fortuna in tutto il resto di Dublino si trovavano wifi gratuite e velocissime così i files grandi li ho spediti da altrove.
Nel complesso il mio giudizio su questo hotel resta positivo sebbene altre zone di Dublino (Grafton St per esempio) siano più raffinate e pulite, così come altre però, tipo Temple Bar, siano anche più sporche e rumorose.",3,2013,05,02
232,"Tolle Lage, Renovierung nötig","Im Rahmen einer Irland Reise haben wir 2 Nächte im Wynn's Hotel geschlafen. Die Lage des Hotels ist unschlagbar - unmittelbar an der O'Connel Street, weniger Meter von der Brücke und damit auch nur einen Katzensprung von den innerstädtischen Sehenswürdigkeiten und Temple Bar entfernt. Der ""hop on hop off"" Bus für Stadttouren hält wenige Meter entfernt. 

Das Hotel selbst gehört zu den älteren Häusern und man kann den leider schon etwas verblassten Glanz der vergangenen Jahrzehnte noch erahnen. Insgesamt müsste jedoch massiv renoviert werden, um das Haus wieder von A bis Z in Schwung zu bringen. Überall sieht man die kleinen, jedoch meist undramatischen Macken - beispielsweise leicht aus der Decke hängende Strahler, abblätternde Farbe und ähnliche Kleinigkeiten.

Der Service im Hotel ist sehr freundlich, aufmerksam und hilfsbereit. Das Frühstück war sehr gut und landestypisch.
 
Wir hatten ein sehr sauberes Deluxe Zimmer, das vollmundig angekündigt wurde: ""Es hat einen Jacuzzi."" Es war dann eine Badewanne mit Düsen. Angenehm war diese aber nach den langen Stadtbummeln schon. Obwohl das Zimmer zur Straße gerichtet war, war im 5 Stock nichts vom Verkehr oder der vor der Tür fahrenden Tram zu hören. 

Insgesamt würde ich ein Deluxe Zimmer im Wynn's weiterempfehlen. Zu den Standard-Zimmern kann ich jedoch nichts sagen.",4,2013,04,09
232,"Pulito e centrale, ma old fashion!","Ho soggiornato 5 notti per lavoro in questo hotel situato ottimamente nel centro di Dublino.
Lo stile è rimasto quello proprio della fine '800, periodo della sua fondazione: entrando sembra di essere trasportati nella porta del tempo! Personalmente preferisco lo stile moderno e la semplicità degli arredi. 
Legno e moquet caratterizzano la struttura, che risulta comunque ben pulita, anche il letto è comodo e la colazione ok.",3,2013,02,09
232,Perfetto,"Ho trovato tutto ottimo dalla colazione alla pulizia e il personale di una gentilezza mai vista. Alla hall la si.ra Roberta parla un perfetto italiano ed e fantastica .

......
Fantastici musicisti in strada..ecc....",5,2013,01,23
232,Consigliato nel centro di Dublino,"Confermate in pieno le aspettative. L'hotel si trova in pieno centro, in una zona di recente valorizzazione a ridosso di strade pedonali e a pochi minuti a piedi da Temple Bar, e comunque tutte le principali attrattive di Dublino sono raggiungibili con una passeggiata. La strada in cui è situato è chiusa al traffico (ci passa solo il tram) e ciò favorisce la riduzione dei rumori provenienti dall'esterno (soprattutto se ci si trova - come nel nostro caso- al 5° piano). Le stanze sono anche ben insonorizzate fra di loro, la colazione vanta una buona scelta (c'è un menu con dolce/continentale e salato/irish: per le prime molto buoni i cornetti -se non sono terminati!- e poi ovviamente i tipici scones; tra l'altro uno dei camerieri alla colazione capiva l'italiano). Bella anche la struttura in sé, un elegante ed ""autorevole"" palazzo storico del centro. Funzionale il wi-fi all'interno delle stanze.
Migliorabile forse la pulizia (c'era qualche residuo capello sotto il copricuscino...), e si dovrebbe pensare ad installare un miscelatore nel rubinetto (solo acqua fredda o calda...il rubinetto della doccia invece fortunatamente aveva il miscelatore). Anche lo scarico del WC mi è parso non ""impeccabile"" (abbiamo imparato con la pratica...va premuto fino in fondo con gesto secco...ma ho notato essere una cosa comune dei bagni di Dublino).
In tutti i casi, un ottimo soggiorno in un hotel che mi sento di consigliare a tutti.",4,2013,01,09
232,Centrale ma vecchio,"Le recensioni per questo hotel sono decisamente sovradimensionate. L'hotel e' molto vecchio, la nostra camera era molto piccola con arredi fatiscenti. Il lavandino piccolissimo senza miscelatore. Due rubinetti separati per acqua calda e fredda. Il riscaldamento non regolabile, affidato ad un piccolo termosifone elettrico. Insomma, di buono la posizione centralissima e la colazione. ",2,2012,12,03

232,Ottimo e di altri tempi,"L'hotel si trovava a pochi passi dalla fermata dell'autobus, il Wynn's Hotel, un quattro stelle che abbiamo prenotato molto tempo prima e che con un'offerta trovata su internet abbiamo pagato molto poco, con trattamento BB (bed and breakfast).
Un'oasi di pace nella caotica Dublino.
Personale disponibile, anche con chi parla poco l'inglese.
Durante la prenotazione ho sbagliato e ho preso una twins invece che una doppia e visto il mio errore mi hanno cambiato la stanza senza nessun sovrapprezzo.
Colazione abbondante, sia europea che tipica dublinese (che consiglio vivamente).
Stanza in ordine e perfetta in ogni suo dettaglio.",5,2012,11,08
232,Nettes Hotel für Geschäftsreisen,"Im Rahmen einer Geschäftsreise habe ich hier gewohnt und da das Hotel ausgebucht war ein sehr kleines Zimmer im 4. Stock nach hinten raus, auf eine weisse Wand guckend, erhalten. Es liefen die ganze Nacht Lüftungen. Fenster auf war nicht möglich. Da ich nur zum schlafen da war, war es ok und auch sauber. Das Frühstück war sehr nett und der Service sehr gut. 
Die Zimmer zur Straße raus dürften dann den Straßenbahn- und Verkehrslärm haben, was ich persönlich zu einer weißen Wand bevorzugt hätte. 
Ansonsten hat das ganze Hotel gerade frischen Lack (es roch noch nach Farbe im Flur) bekommen und ist insgesamt traditionell eingerichtet. (Das muss man mögen). Die Dusche war super und heiß, die Betten hatte eine große Auswahl verschiedener Kopfkissen, Flachbildfernseher und WLan inkl. wobei in Dublin fast jedes Pub free wifi hat. 
Also alles im allen für eine Geschäftsreise völlig in Ordnung. Für Urlauber ist es sicherlich auch gut, da es klasse gelegen ist.",4,2012,09,25
232,Centrale e carino,"Mi sono recato in questo hotel vicinissimo a temple bar (ma non troppo per non dormire) verso al fine del mese di agosto.L'hotel è molto bello: stile liberty (sembra un pò fuori dal tempo) con molto legno e sale molto luminose e alte. Il personale è il valore aggiunto di questo hotel: sono tutto molto cordiali e carini. IN reception abbiamo trovato una ragazza molto simpatica e gentile che parlava perfettamente italiano e che ci ha suggerito sia le visite da fare che posti dove mangiare molto bene e psendere il giusto (che a Dublino non è proprio facile). Dovevamo andare a Galway per qualche giorno e abbiamo richiesto, al ritorno, una camera più spaziosa. Quando simao ritorani ci avevano dato al rpezzo di una dobbia una quadrupla senza alcuna costo supplettivo: chapeaux.
Colaizone abbondantissima e molto curata il prezzo vale il posto.
Camere molto pulite con bagni spaziosi e pulitissimi.
Location eccezionale (siete rpaticamente in una laterale bella di O'Connel Street a 5 min da Temple bart e a 5 min da Trinity College,

Alla reception, a cui mi sono rivolta, per sapere dove parcheggiare per scaricare i bagagli, una gentilissima signora, in un perfetto italiano, mi ha detto che un dipendente si sarebbe occupato di tutto....io ho dovuto solo accompagnarlo alla macchina e dopo un pò le valige erano all'ingresso. Il mattino seguente, al momento di uscire, con soli cinque minuti di preavviso l'auto è stata portata davanti all'hotel , e tutto questo gratuitamente!
 L'ambiente liberty della sala è elegante, con musica di sottofondo e tovaglie e posate di buon livello, la cucina è a vista, quindi sia la preparazione dei piatti per l'Irish breakfast, che quelli per la cena possono essere seguiti in diretta. Bella la presentazione dei piatti e buona la qualità dei prodotti. Gentilezza da parte di tutti, dai camerieri, alla ragazza ai piani e al portiere di notte, che alle cinque di mattina (in attesa del taxi ) ci ha chiesto se volevamo fare colazione prima di andare in aeroporto. Consigliatissimo per la vicinanza ai mezzi di trasporto ( Luas di fronte e bus all'angolo in O'Connell St.) e a tutte le attrazioni di Dublino. Camere del 5° piano con finestre a bovindo, pulite, non eccessivamente spaziose, ben arredate, set per il the, ferro da stiro, cassaforte, assenza di frigo bar. Bagni con doccia, solo lavabo(senza miscelatore)e con pochi piani d'appoggio intorno, c'è il phon. Per confermare la gentilezza e la disponibiltà degli Irlandesi, la signora che parla in italiano (di cui purtroppo non conosco il nome), in tre secondi si è adoperata per prenotarci il tour a Newgrange telefonando all'operatore che noi le abbiamo indicato, quindi tante attenzioni che quando si è in vacanza è piacevole ricevere. Non abbiamo avuto il tempo per valutare gli altri sevizi che l'hotel offre....sarà per la prossima visita........ Volendo essere pignoli un'unica nota negativa: l'odore di vernice nel corridoio, perchè stavano facendo manutenzione alle parti in legno. Avrebbero potuto farla a fine stagione?",5,2012,08,05
232,Buona soluzione per il centro città,"Questo hotel è una buona soluzione per visitare il centro di Dublino. Ben posizionato nella zona commerciale, tutte le attrazioni della capitale si possono raggiungere facilmente a piedi. Anche la fermata del bus per l'aeroporto si trova nella via trasversale. La struttura è carina, in stile british. un pò retrò. La camera è nella media: arredata in modo semplice ma perfetta per quanto riguarda la pulizia. La mia camera devo dire era un pò troppo piccola. Anche l'insonorizzazione delle stanze lascia un pò a desiderare. Staff davvero all'altezza per gentilezza e disponibilità. Colazione buona e varia. Peccato che nelle camere non ci sia un adattatore per corrente. Costerebbe poco metterne uno per camera e sarebbe di gran aiuto. Forse non proprio il massimo per chi viaggia per business, ma certamente una buona soluzione per visitare la città.",4,2012,07,30
232,Magnifico Irish Style,"Hotel in ottima posizione,  centrale e tranquilla a due passi dalle attrazioni turistiche della città e dallo shopping e facilmente raggiungibile dall’aeroporto perché vicino a tutte le fermate Bus di O’Connel Street e al principale Taxi Rank cittadino. Temple Bar, Grafton street, Trinity College sono tutti a 10 min. di passeggiata e a pochi metri dall'hotel ci sono le fermate della Luas (Tram) e dei Bus per andare in qualsiasi posto della città; abbinando Luas e Dart (treno) si possono raggiungere in meno di un’ora tutti i bellissimi posti del circondario. Le camere sono spaziose, pulitissime (cambio completo ogni giorno) e ben arredate. Il bagno è comodo con ampia doccia, idromassaggio e asciugacapelli  a muro. Nella camera ci sono il TV Lcd, la cassaforte a combinazione e la macchinetta con accessori per farsi The e Caffè (nel mio armadio c’era anche un set per stirare gli abiti con piano e ferro). La colazione è abbondante e per tutti i gusti; da provare la Irish. Alla reception il personale è gentilissimo e  c’è anche una ragazza che parla benissimo italiano. Bellissimo il pub interno ottimo per una serata irish style. Ottimo il rapporto qualità prezzo.",4,2012,05,07
232,"Netter Service, Zentrale Lage","Super Service, beste Lage, sehr sauber, große helle Zimmer, freies schnelles Wi-Fi. ca. 5min fussweg zum Trinity College, Temple Bar. Gutes Frühstück.

232,hotel di fascino con una location superlativa,"La location di questo hotel è assolutamente perfetta, una traversa di O'Connel St, da dove puoi raggiungere a piedi tutte le attrazioni di Dublino. E' un albergo con una sua storia, una struttura con un certo fascino dei tempi passati, con l'unica pecca che la stanza era piccola e 'vecchia', come anche il bagno. ma comunque pulita e confortevole. Il ristorante dell'albergo è molto bello ed elegante, i cuochi cucinano a vista, e il cibo servito è gustoso. Tutto lo staff è molto gentile e di aiuto. Sicuramente un albergo da considerare quando si va a Dublino.",4,2012,04,01
232,Wynn's Hotel,"Hotel a pochi passi da O’Connel St, fermate bus, taxi, comodissimo per muoversi verso Temple bar e le varie attrazioni di Dublino.

Hotel classico, accogliente, confort assicurato. Nell'hotel anche un pub per spuntini fuori orari
Stanze  e bagno ampi e puliti.

232,"Exelente,muy recomendable,quiero volver!!!","Es un Hotel construido en 1845,su ubicacion es exelente,lafachada deledificio es muy linda y la entrada y la puerta de madera son elegantes,tiene 70 habitaciones,es muy limpio y prolijo,las habitaciones son de buen tamaño,no son lujosas si no mas bien modestas y elegantes,pero muy comodas de buena ambientacion,bien arregladas,con tv de lcd,dvd y wi fi,ventanas dobles y buena aislacion acustica,y pava electrica para te o cafe,frigobar y caja de seguridad, y las camas son muy comodas para dormir, con baños indibiduales,limpios y bien puestos,con secador de pelo y seca toallas,tambien tiene un gimnasio bastante completo,la atencion es exelente,el personal se destaca mucho,siempre atento dispuesto a ayudar,aconsejar o recomendar y de buen humor,algunos hablan español,el desyuno es abundante,las instalaciones del hotel en general son muy agradables,techos altos con molduras,amplios ventanales,paredes con maderas,muy bien puesto,y no es caro el precio esta muy bien!!!,me encantaria volver!!!!!,una de sus mejores cosas tambien,que destaco e insisto, es su ubicacion a una cuadra de O'Connell Street,que es la avenida principal ,con bastantes paradas de bus,tranvia y taxis,es una avenida muy agradable para pasear debido a sus amplias veredas y suele estar repleta de gente a cualquier hora del día. Es una de las principales zonas comerciales de la ciudad ya que desde ella se puede acceder a calles como Henry Street o Parnell Street, dos importantes calles de tiendas en Dublín,a lo largo de 0´connell street se pueden encontrar numerosos monumentos entre los que destaca uno de los más recientes, el conocido como The Spire (la espiral), una gran aguja que se eleva 120 metros fundiéndose con el azul (o gris) del cielo, The Spire fue construido en el año 2003,y otros de los monumentos a destacar en O´Connell son la estatua del líder nacionalista del siglo XIX que dio nombre a la calle, Daniel O´Connell, o las estatuas de Sir John Gray, James Larkin, Charles Stewart Parnell 
El edificio de la Oficina Central de Correos de Dublín, construida en 1818, está considerado como uno de los mejores monumentos de O´Connell Street. Este emblemático edificio posee un gran valor histórico ya que fue el lugar en el que se proclamó la República de Irlanda después de la sublevación de 1916.
La calle O´Connell es un lugar de visita obligada para todos los visitantes de Dublín, tanto para pasear, como para ver sus monumentos, o para tomar cualquiera de los buses que tienen su parada a lo largo de la calle,pero tambien taxis y tranvia
En O´Connell  tambien esta una de las oficinas de información turística de la ciudad, un lugar muy útil para obtener cualquier tipo de información además de comprar la tarjeta Dublín Pass!!!,a pocas cuadras esta el puente O'connell,que es de 1882,se cruza caminando y atraviesa el Rio  Liffey,une O´connell con la calle D´olier,y esta la zona mas antigua,por eso la ubicacion del hotel es exelente,comoda y muy practica, tambien
está a sólo unos minutos a pie del el Abbey Theatre, que fue el primer teatro subsidiado por el estado en el mundo angloparlante!!!; desde el año 1925 recibe un subsidio anual del Estado Libre de Irlanda,es de 1904,pero perdio el edificio original por un incendio en 1951,continua presentando obras regularmente,en sus primeros años, el teatro estaba fuertemente asociado a los escritores del renacimiento celta, muchos de los cuales se involucraron en su fundación y la mayoría de los cuales presentaron sus obras allí,tambien esta muy cerca  Trinity College,la universidad mas antigua de Irlanda fundada  por Isabel Primera en 1592,y del Temple Bar,que es un pub muy divertido y conocido que data del año1673!!, y es ideal para tomarse unas cervezas,mezclarse con algunos lugareños y escuchar los grupos de musica irlandesa cuando tocan y/o cantan,muy divertido!!,recomiendo muchisimo este hotel,calidad,atencion,ubicacion,precio,es exelente!!!",5,2012,01,24
232,"ottimo hotel, centrale ed accogliente.","Ho soggiornato in questo hotel a fine settembre.
Posizione centrale  e  comoda. Personale italiano alla reception, molto gentile.
Albergo di tradizione, comunque rinnovato. Se volete la modernità non fà al caso vostro; se invece gradite un luogo accogliente, con una storia alle spalle e tanto confort, sistematevi qui se doveste venire a Dublino.
 Camere confortevoli e bagno con sanitari moderni ed un phon di ottima marca svizzera con presa elettrica adatta per i nostri caricabatteria continentali.
Ottima prima colazione e pub a disposizone per uno spuntino fuori orario.
Consigliato!",4,2012,01,06
232,un viaggio a dublino,"Per la seconda volta abbiamo prenotato al Wynn's per venire a trovare nostra figlia che vive a Dublino. Confermiamo in pieno la prima impressione. Hotel in pieno centro, su O'Connel Street, a pochi passi dalle attrazioni turistiche più importanti. Cortesia e gentilezza dello staff alla reception(dove è in servizio una ragazza italiana). Camere pulite e ordinate, anche se non molto spaziose. Prima colazione irlandese e continentale veramente favolosa e compresa nel prezzo delle camera. Atmosfera vecchio stle e molto ""irish"". In conclusione un ottimo hotel.",4,2011,12,10
232,centrico y aceptable,"hotel centrico, puedes ir andando a todos los sitios. 
Les dejas el coche y se lo llevan a un parking donde lo guardan de manera gratuita. 
El personal es amable y las instalaciones aunque antiguas aceptables. 
El desayuno también está bien.",4,2011,08,17
232,MUY BIEN SITUADO Y COMUNICADO,"buena situacion junto a o´connel street (avd.principal de dublin) con paradas de taxis bus tranvia, cerca del rio, lo cruzas y estas en el barrio atiguo, el desayuno no es buffet libre pero te ponen cafe y tostadas y luego puedes pedir platos con huevos y bacon o, zumos frutas yogurt, en general es abundante.",4,2011,04,25
232,Ein Klassiker,"Perfekte Lage ganz in der Nähe der GPO, zu Fuss ist von hier fast alles bestens erreichbar, Auch der Flughafen-bus hält in der Nähe. Sehr bemühtes , freundliches Personal an der Rezeption. Ein klassisches, viktorianisches Hotel, ohne starallüren, man fühlt sich sofort wohl. Die Zimmerpreise sind halbwegs moderat, specials für 2-3 Übernachtungen  bzw. mitten in der Woche. Manchmal am WE ausgebucht. Im 1. Stock gibt es gerade am Wochenende allerdings manchmal laute private parties, die bis 1 Uhr nachts  gehen können. Die Zimmer sehr nett, allerdings etwas klein, aber praktisch. Wasserkocher für Tee, Kaffee. Perfekt ist das Irish breakfest, mit frischem Orangensaft, warmen goat cheese.Die Bar gegenüber nichts besonderes, aber überwiegend irisches Publikum.Nicht schlecht für einen Whisky vor dem Schlafengehen. Schlechte Parkmöglichkeiten, am besten Bus oder Taxi zur Anfahrt.
Insgesamt stilvoll, aber nicht ""zu"" vornehm, bester service und ein wirklich gutes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis. Absolut zu empfehlen (Einschränkung Lärm durch private party, und die Iren feiern gerne und ständig).In der 2. Etage gibt es Raucherzimmer.",4,2011,04,19
232,ottimo,"servizio eccellente
staff preparato, gentile, disponibile e professionale
camera buona, posizione centralissima
unico punto debole: una certa rumorosita' notturna causa traffico stradale
Full Irish Breakfast da consigliare vivamente vista la varieta' e la qualita' delle specialita' locali offerte",5,2011,04,18
232,OTTIMA POSIZIONE ED ACCOGLIENZA,"OTTIMA POSIZIONE per visitare il centro città, a due passi da Temple Bar e praticamente su O'Connell Street. Servito dalla fermata del tram praticamente sotto l'hotel. La disponibilità alla reception è veramente ottima, la signora Roberta parla un ottimo italiano ed è sempre pronta a soddisfare ogni esigenza e risolvere qualsiasi problema. Camere buone e servizi di recente ristrutturazione. Colazione di buon assortimento anche se quanto ad abbondanza si trova forse qualcosa di meglio, ma tutti gli altri pregi nascondono abbondanetemente ogni altro piccolo difetto. Consigliato per ogni esigenza che necessita di frequentare il centro della città.",4,2011,03,27
232,Piacevole soggiorno a Dublino,"L’hotel Wynn’s, in stile classico, è in ottima posizione a 15 mt dalla strada principale di O’Connel St, a 30 mt da una postazione di taxi sulla O’Connel St, a 2 minuti dal ponte che porta alla zona di Temple bar. Vicinissimo si trovano farmacia, bancomat, ufficio postale e la partenza del bus rosso che fa il giro della città (consigliatissimo), quest’ultimo di fronte ad una succursale dell’ufficio informazioni.
Alla reception lavora a turno anche una ragazza italiana.
Poiché di fronte all’albergo passa la metropolitana leggera e data la vicinanza alla trafficata O’Connel suggerirei a chi ha il sonno leggero di chiedere una stanza tranquilla; a me hanno dato, pur essendo in due, una stanza per quattro; perfetta anche se sul retro; ma tanto si sta fuori tutto il giorno!. 
L’albergo è pulito.
Gli asciugamani sono cambiati giornalmente e sono meravigliosamente caldi visto che sono appoggiati su uno scaldasalviette ""ustionante"".
Consiglierei a chi pensa di lavare qualche indumento in camera di chiedere una stanza con la vasca (che funziona comunque anche come doccia), perché il lavandino è talmente minuscolo che a fatica ci si lavano persino le mani (Forse sono tutti così perché anche quello nella stanza dei nostri amici aveva le stesse dimensioni). Inoltre il lavandino ha due rubinetti separati, uno per l’acqua calda (molto calda!) e uno per quella fredda. Almeno con la vasca si può lavare qualcosa miscelando l’acqua.
Colazione buona sia continentale che irish. Tornerei sicuramente.",4,2011,03,08
232,muyyyyyyyy Recomendable,"Encontrar este hotel fue  de las mejores cosas que nos pudo pasar en dublin , el personal increible ,  instalaciones de primera ,  la comida, la vocacion de servicio  de los que atienden a  las personas.. para los hispanos   parte del personal habla español ....  vayan.. tranquilamente y disfruten una estadia en un hotel de lujo a precio accesible...  y con la seguridad que vovlerian otra vez a hospedarse en el Wynns ... desde Costa Rica  mi agradecimiento........",5,2010,09,28

El personal del hotel es muy amable y servicial y siempre te atiende con una sonrisa, pero sin llegar a ser exagerado.
Es un hotel muy limpio, aunque al ser antiguo al principio pueda dar otra sensacion, pero el servicio de limpieza es perfecto. 
El desayuno es muy bueno, y el comedor es precioso. 
Lo recomiendo, yo si vuelvo a Dublín, me volveré a alojar en él sin ninguna duda.",4,2010,07,25

Empezando por la amabilidad de su personal, en especial Cristina, madrile;a de pro, y Roberta en la recepcion, su confortable habitacion, el restaurante con una relacion calidad & precio inigualable, y que decir del desayuno irlandes, impresive.
Situado en el centro de la ciudad, a un paso andando de los lugares mas emblematicos de Dublin.
No dudaria en recomendar este hotel a mis familiares y amigos.",5,2010,04,28
232,"Excelente hubicacion, mejor trato","Viaje con mis amigos a Dublin para asistir al encuentro del 6 naciones de rugby entre Irlanda e Italia, y de paso revisitar la ciudad pues ya habia estado en otras dos ocasiones en diferentes hoteles. El emplazamiento del hotel es inmejorable para moverse a cualquier punto de la ciudad por estar centrico y disponer ademas de una parada del Luas en la misma puerta. Las habitaciones son comodas y acogedoras sin renunciar a ningun equipamiento y el trato del personal inmejorable. En la noche del sabado al domingo habia fiesta en la discoteca y en las habitaciones de la 3ª planta se oia bastante la musica pero no como para no dejar dormir. Recomendable 100%",5,2010,02,11
