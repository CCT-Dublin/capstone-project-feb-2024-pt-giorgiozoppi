15,Staff made this an even more memorable experience.,"Superior service, unmatched by any other hotel in our travels, and our assessment isn’t because this was an upgrade for us - we stay at higher end establishments.  Everyone we dealt with had great energy and were welcoming and helpful and engaging in an authentic way.  Special recognition to Mauro, Carla, Dani, Luis, Mario. But thanks to all who greeted us with enthusiasm and offered to help in so many ways, like walking us to the spot to get a taxi which seemed like a daunting task on day one.  Dani and Carla helped us with an amazing day trip to Figueries and Port Ligat for Dali experiences. The food was great and we are still talking about the truffle and mushroom ravioli! And the martini at the bar was perfecto. We switched our dining reservations based on Mauro’s suggestions and were so glad to have been asked about our plans. The rooms were lovely although dark making it difficult to put on make up and work on beards. We found some solutions by moving some lamps around. We stayed 6 nights and there was not one encounter that wasn’t pleasant. Friends recommended The Mercer to us and we will do the same.  Thanks to all for making a great trip even more memorable.",5,2024,10,11
15,Couldn’t be better!,"We were expecting the taxi to drop  us off  prior to  the entrance to this lovely hotel from  previous reviews.The driver negotiated the very narrow alleys and took us right to the entrance. From there we met the ever friendly and helpful hotel employees at the front door and check in. Such a cool hotel with such character. It’s intimate but with all the necessary amenities and seating areas. Hidden away from the noise on the main streets. We enjoyed the walk around a corner to find a wonderful coffee shop, restaurant, or bakery. We often encountered musicians or some form of entertainment close by. Located in the Gothic section it can’t be beat for comfort and location. It was clean, quiet, and charming. The plate of treats left on our first night was a great touch. Can’t say enough about what a great stay it was. Would LOVE to return. ",5,2023,03,01
15,Amazing experience,"We only had one night at this amazing hotel in the heart of the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona but absolutely loved our short time there.
The breakfast in the gorgeous courtyard was the best in the entire trip.
Can’t say enough about the friendly and helpful staff.
Hoping we have an opportunity to return at some point!",5,2024,10,10
15,Old+new+warm atmosphere,"A lovely small luxury hotel, almost hidden away in a beautiful, interesting neighbourhood. Contemporary architecture in an ancient, historic building.
Very welcoming staff, they made me feel at home and pampered all the time.
Excellent breakfast and service, in the amazing inner garden/patio.
Would love to go back anytime!",5,2024,10,05
15,Beautiful Mercer Hotel,"The service and the whole team at the Mercer is unbelievable.  The rooms are unique and lovely, peaceful setting.  The inner courtyard is a magical place for breakfast or a cocktail. We love unwinding on the rooftop terrace at the end of a long day of exploring.  One of the best hotels we have ever had the pleasure of staying at.",5,2024,10,01
15,At the Heart of It All in Barcelona.,"We booked multiple-day stays at the Hotel Mercer Barcelona as our home base for tripping around Catalonia.

Ensconced deep in the heart of the atmospheric Barri Gotic (Gothic Quarter), the oldest part of Barcelona’s 2,000-year Old Town, it is a 5-star Monument hotel jewel property built against a medieval palace’s remnant walls,  giving some of its 28 room and suites with exposed stone walls a telling character amidst the plush modernist furnishings.  It has a lovely rooftop deck with plunge pool and summer bar, where you can relax on reclining deck chairs amidst soothing planter shrubbery and flowers or lean against the decktop walls to enjoy a splendid vista of the Old Quarter surrounds. 

But its centrality of location in Barcelona’s most historic quarter is its prime feature, with its winding maze of narrow cobbled side streets replete with atmospheric medieval structures leading you quickly from hotel to the Placa de Sant Jaume - formerly the Roman Forum but currently housing Catalonia’s Parliament and Barcelona’s Town Hall.  A stone’s throw away is Barcelona’s Gothic Cathedral built atop an ancient Visigoth site, as well as King Ferdinand of Aragon’s Royal Palace.  Further along in the Old Town would be the scenic El Born district as well as the famously touristy Las Ramblas Avenue amongst whose more popular sites of interest is the sprawling La Boqueria food market. 

The hotel’s staff is young and charmingly congenial, the concierge helpful, and the breakfast buffet is small but quite delicious and very well served.  There is also a restful interior tree-planted patio with eating tables, and a small bistro adjunct to the hotel’s same Roman walls.  The bar is quite comfortable and the drinks are exceptional with delicious side munchies.  This is an excellent value property to stay in, especially if you book a Premium Junior Suite or Junior Suite to settle into after a pressured touristy day.",5,2024,10,01
15,First Class Service,I’m a bit biased when it comes to hotels and prefer a modern boutique style.  I was somewhat apprehensive due to the hotel’s history.  All I can say is Stunning!  Upon arrival we were greeted by Mauro and Luca with a welcome drink and tour of the hotel.  Their attention to making our stay 5*’s never waivered.  The rooms were spacious.  Hotel is beautiful.  And location couldn’t have been better.  Do not hesitate to book at the Mercer.,5,2024,10,01

15,Beautiful Hotel/Great Location,"This is a beautiful property and we were very pleased with the size of the room. Mario, the doorman stood out as the nicest most helpful person on staff. There are issues with food and drink service though…especially at the pool where we waited one hour after ordering for drinks and then once the phone to call in your order was dead..the system needs to be rethought. Also, sat for dinner on the patio and was ignored. Besides these service issues, it was a lovely stay.",4,2024,08,18
15,Boutique Hotel Mercer Barcelona was Fabulous!,"My Husband and I spent three wonderful days at the Mercer Hotel Barcelona.  Our room was well appointed.  We had a lovely garden view, and a large walk-in shower.  The roof top pool and bar had lovely views of the surrounding Gothic district.  Overall, the Hotel has a serene and welcoming vibe.  The staff, including the Head Concierge, Mauro, anticipated and attended to our every need.  We received excellent site seeing guidance and wonderful restaurant recommendations, including a lovely gourmet dinner at the hotel.  My only regret is that I wish we would have booked a few more days to enjoy the hotel and explore more of Barcelona.  We do plan to return to the Mercer Hotel Barcelona next year.

15,Oasis in a Tourist Storm,"The Mercer Hotel Barcelona is exactly what you hope for in a premium boutique hotel. Superb service from everyone there. Friendly and accommodating. Relaxed, very relaxed atmosphere. The location could not be better. Nestled on a very quiet no cars street front and back, the Mercer gives you a very quiet and relaxed environment in a wildly busy tourist destination. 3 min walk and you will find all the busy tourism if that is what you are looking for. Only place to stay in Barcelona. ",5,2024,07,25

15,5 days at the Mercer,Very nice hotel with excellent service. The only issue I had was the room. It was too small with a view of a black tarp and only an open air wall separating the bathroom. Everything else was very good including the rooftop pool and location.,4,2024,07,03
15,"Wonderful Service, Amazing Stay","My wife and I stayed here for one night after a cruise.  The room was great, but the service really set the Mercer Hotel apart from other hotels.  We had a tour immediately after our cruise, and the guide company sent our luggage to the Mercer, where the staff placed our bags in our room.  The concierge made a lunch reservation for us once we returned.  One of the doormen walked two blocks with us to assist us in procuring a taxi.  Lastly, they arranged for a taxi pickup on the day of our departure.  DEFINITELY staying here next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2024,07,01
15,We loved the Mercer and especially the restaurants!,"This is our second time staying in the Gothic quarter in Barcelona and our first time at the Mercer.  We loved the hotel and the location was perfect for our wandering.  

The only negatives about the hotel were the access to taxis is hard and the shower was odd.  But otherwise we loved it.  

The biggest highlight for us was the restaurants.  The breakfast was great, the tapas place in front was great and the restaurant for dinner was the best meal we had on our trip.  Highly recommended!",5,2024,06,21
15,Wonderful!,"This is a superb hotel in a great location. A little bit of heaven in a chaotic city. Nothing is too much trouble. No matter what, the answer is ‘Yes’. The most beautiful fruit salad for breakfast that I have ever seen! Everything is carefully considered.
My only negative would be that the pool is not a pool. It is a tiny plunge pool, with depth of waist height. This wouldn’t stop me staying here again. 
Wonderful hotel.",5,2024,06,17
15,Amazing hotel!,"Amazing hotel.  The service was amazing and the location was spot on.
Would love to come back anytime.  The hotel staff were specifically award winning.   They were right there to help you with anything you needed.   The location was perfect —— truly loved every minute.",5,2024,06,12

15,Excellent,"My wife and I along with 11 adult members of our family, spent 3 nights at the Mercer.
This small hotel is located in the gothic part of the city, on one of the very narrow streets.  Lots of interesting shops and restaurants in the area.  The hotel is very nice, and the staff, well the staff is the best.  From the front desk to restaurant staff, they all genuinely wanted to make certain that the guests were happy.   The concierge and bell staff were terrific.  Our stay was a pleasure for all 13 of us.
I travel quite a lot but,  write few reviews.  Hotel Mercer deserves a good review.",5,2024,06,10

15,Highly recommended - gets everything right,"Great location - on a quiet side street in the old town,  but very close to everything and easy to walk to and from. Very kind, polite, helpful, discrete, professional and efficient staff. Deluxe rooms are big and very comfortable with a large shower and Molton Brown toiletries. The roof-top terrace is a great place to relax if you need a bit of down-time. The bar/tapas restaurant is just right and the food was fantastic. The breakfast omelette is perfection on a plate and the best I have ever eaten!",5,2024,06,01
15,Magical Hotel … magical location!,"Such a wonderful luxury boutique hotel. They go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and to anticipate your wants and needs.

15,Our Stay at the Mercer Hotel Barcelona,"This charming boutique hotel offers beautiful, comfortable rooms and a wonderful atmosphere.

15,10 out of 5 stars!,"This hotel was amazing start to finish. The staff was so incredible helping with dinner spots, walking us to the little super market to buy some things, escorting us to dinner.

15,Beautiful jewel in gothic quarter,Every aspect of the hotel is gorgeous from the jasmine and orange trees in the courtyard to the glorious rooftop bar to the soft cotton sheets and modern decor rooms that are encompassed within Roman walls. One is living in a space of history and beauty. ,5,2024,05,22

15,Beautiful hotel in Barcelona,"The Mercer Hotel was highly recommended to us as a comfortable, high end hotel in Barcelona. It didn't disappoint!
Lovely room with everything that you would expect to have, good location in the Gothic Quarter, beautifully furnished and partially set in the old Roman walls. Our room was in the old Roman Tower so it was very characterful despite offering all modern amenities. The staff were very friendly and exceptionally helpful....booking taxis, restaurants and making our stay very easy and stress free. The nearest Metro station is very close at Jaume 1; a method of efficient and cheap transportation city wide.
It was easy to get around from the hotel which also boasts a good restaurant, a Tapas bar and a rooftop bar, sundeck and small pool. We would highly recommend this hotel and plan to come back. A great city break.",5,2024,05,19
15,A must stay at this luxury boutique hotel!,This is a lovely hotel. I love 5 star boutique hotels because of the personalized touches and exceptional service and Mercer in Barcelona certainly delivered. Location is perfect as well. They have a welcome and departing gift. Rooms are decent size and enough if you’re not spending too much time in the room. Hotel has historic parts throughout which is super cool and the terrace is lovely. They even made recommendations for tapas when we got in late the first night and it was one of our favorites of the whole stay. Thank you Mercer and I highly recommend this hotel!,5,2024,05,14
15,Beautiful Hotel w/Incredible Staff!!,"I’ve stayed in several Barcelona hotels and Mercer is by far my favorite. Primary reason: the staff are incredible! Welcoming, friendly, hardworking and knowledgeable — and they go way above-and-beyond in so many capacities. I got food poisoning from a restaurant across town and the staff took care of me so my sisters could continue to enjoy their trip while I stayed behind to heal. The concierge walked me to the market and pharmacy for remedies, the kitchen staff whipped me up a selection of stomach-friendly eats not on the menu and cleaning staff checked in on me. Honestly, like family; and it really helped when I was feeling awful.

On top of that, the hotel is beautiful, very clean, cozy, with an amazing location and the rooms have beautifully comfortable beds and smart layouts. Cannot recommend highly enough; we were sad to leave!",5,2024,05,09
15,Wow!  As good as it gets.,"We had the most wonderful experience at the Mercer Hotel.  I'd rate it a 6 if I could as our visit there recalibrated the scale.  The location was great.  Everything was comfortable and the staff is amazing.

I'm sure other reviews discuss the Roman wall, the location and the quality of the rooms.  All of which were great.  We couldn't believe the service by the staff, including concierge Mauro who recommended and made reservations for us at a wonderful restaurant about 1/2 mile away from the hotel (Sagardi), then, rather than giving us directions, walked us to the restaurant and introduced us to the proprietor.  Wonderful Charcoal Grilled Steaks and Fish and the friendly Spanish hospitality we received throughout the country.

The hotel is on a narrow street that doesn't have car access, but the staff helped us with luggage and taxis and it was all seamless.

Breakfast was included in our booking and it was very good in a beautiful setting with beautiful china.",5,2024,05,09
15,"Mercer Hotel, The Coolest  location and The Most Amazing Staff EVER","We had an amazing stay in Barcelona. Janina, Dani and the entire Mercer Hotel staff was ultra accommodating and literally the best hotel staff we have ever interacted with. If you want to stay in the heart of the Gothic Quarter and have a truly memorable experience, The Hotel Mercer MUST be your place!",5,2024,05,07
15,A hidden gem,"We stayed in the Mercer hotel for only 2 nights before going on a cruise and then another night in our return. This central hotel in the Gothic quarter is the most amazing hidden gem. 
The rooms are so clean and spacious, the food in the tapas restaurant La Bouchon was beautiful but the staff were exceptional from reception to the waiting staff, the chamber maids, concierges and above all the door men who had to heave our luggage through the narrow lane from and to the taxi.
So many exciting things to see with walking distance and very helpful advice from the concierge. 
A word of warning - please book tickets at least 2 weeks in advance for most attractions. 
Couldn’t recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2024,05,07
15,Highly recommend!,"Incredible stay at the Mercer Hotel. Great location, comfortable rooms, and friendly and helpful staff - they provided helpful suggestions, lent an umbrella when we needed it, and even helped rent a car for us on short notice. Food was also excellent. Would definitely book again.",5,2024,05,07
15,They take customer service to anew level!,"EVERY single staff person was delightful and helpful beyond expectation at every turn. They were not only welcoming, but friendly and happy to talk to us tourists. The concierge, Mauro, was amazing. He insisted on walking us TO the restaurant about 4 blocks away, rather than have us use GPS or directions through the tiny walkways and streets. I would stay there again and again. The rooftop deck/bar was a delightful way to end each evening.",5,2024,05,03
15,Don't Miss This Location,"Of the various locations we considered, I am so happy we chose to stay here at Mercer. The history is all around you and the front area is kept neat and clean, super clean. The staff were the most attentive I have experienced in a very long time. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Thank you Mercer for a great experience. ",5,2024,05,01

15,Wonderful hotel in Barcelona,"The hotel was in the heart of the gothic quarter and conveniently located to museums, restaurants, and Metro stations.

15,What a place!,"Immersed in the Gothic neighborhood, 1000/10, all the staff was great, room view was awesome. We had breakfast once and the food was great as well.
The hotel welcomes you with a glass of wine and some snacks, privacy 100% great place.

",5,2024,03,27
15,Excellent hotel,I was quite satisfied with this property. The only drawback is that is located on a street so narrow that most taxi drivers did not want to take you all the way to the entrance. Staff was quite professional and always willing to help.,4,2024,03,26
15,"Service, comfort, location and more","This is one of the best hotel experiences we have had.  The service was outstanding.  The rooms were comfortable.

Would absolutely recommend to anyone interested in visiting Barcelona.",5,2024,03,24
15,MAGNIFICENT MERCER,"We have just returned from a wonderful 4 days staying at this beautiful hotel. Upon arrival we were met with a warm welcome from Dani. Our room was lovely, overlooking a vertical walled garden. The bed was extremely comfortable, which was much appreciated after hours of exploring this wonderful city. Breakfast was delicious and served to us by the lovely friendly staff. Nothing was too much trouble from any member of staff, a special mention to Dani for booking the amazing flamenco evening, for Mauro who booked us a restaurant to experience paella and to Jenny who was so warm, friendly and helpful.  I was there to celebrate a big birthday and this was made extra special by staying at the Mercer. Barcelona is a fantastic city with lovely people and the food - wow! If you wish to visit this city please book with the Mercer, it will take your trip to the next level. Thank you to all the staff, you are ALL a credit to the hotel. ",5,2024,03,23
15,One of the best,"Over the past 40 years, we have stayed in hundreds of hotels all over the world. We rank the quality of a hotel by three criteria: the location; the ambiance and comfort of the hotel and the room, and the services. Mercer Hotel in Barcelona is one of the top hotels on our list. The small hotel with 28 rooms is hidden in a narrow alleyway in the mesmerizing historical Gothic district, which is within walking distance of many of the sites one must visit in Barcelona. The reception area is inviting, simple, warm, and elegant. The hotel is very quiet because there is barely any traffic and few pedestrians on the alleyway. The room and the bathroom are not big, but comfortable, sufficient, and tastefully decorated. One of the walls in our room has a floor-to-ceiling glass wall facing a wall of greeneries in a small courtyard. There is also a beautiful rooftop garden with comfortable seating arrangements and a small pool on the 4th floor. The services of the hotel staff were exceptional; more than one could ever ask for. A few times, Mario, one of the staff at the front desk would walk us to the main street and halt a taxi for us. Of hundreds of hotel staff we have encountered over the last four decades, Mario by far is the best!",5,2024,03,21
15,The Mercer Hotel Barcelona met every expectation,"Every moment of our stay was wonderful. The appointed rooms, the delicious cuisine, the warm, helpful staff and beautiful location. We felt at home from the moment we arrived until the departure. The time spent was memorable and we look forward to our next stay at The Mercer Hotel Barcelona.",5,2024,03,19
15,Incredible Stay,"We truly enjoyed our stay at the Mercer. Our only complaint is that it was a little difficult to find at first. Amazing location, luxury accomodations, amazing and helpful staff, as well as the comfiest hotel beds we could ever hope for!",5,2024,03,17
15,Perfect stay,"I have been in many nice hotels around the world, but the staffs friendliness in the Mercer ist outstanding. A very warm welcome, very attentive and warm hearted. The mattress seems too soft in the beginning, but it’s so incredibly comfortable. Very recommendable hotel. I’ll come back for sure.",5,2024,03,17
15,Wonderful hotel!,"We loved this hotel! The location is great and the service was amazing. Mauro was the best - so welcoming and accommodating.  

The rooms are spacious and the bed is super comfortable.  We loved the bar and seating areas.  Breakfast was also very good.",5,2024,03,16
15,Simply perfect!!,"Everything about Mercer was 5 stars - as you'd expect from a deluxe boutique hotel.
Staff: Every staff member is friendly and helpful. Professionally attentive. Personable. Special shout-out to the Concierge  Mauro: When we asked how to experience some of the incredible.",5,2024,03,14
15,Great hotel,"My wife and I searched for a boutique hotel in the Gothic area of Barcelona and came upon this gem. It’s located in the heart of the gothic area. The staff was attentive, willing to help with anything we needed, and took and interest in us. Rooms were modern and hotel decor was as we expected. Would absolutely recommend to anyone interested in visiting Barcelona. ",5,2024,03,14
15,One of our best hotel stays ever,"It's been since Easter 2015, but we still quote Mercer Hotel Barcelona as one of our top hotel stays all times. I'm writing a review now because friends asked for Barcelona hotel recommendations - easiest travel question ever.

Everything about Mercer was 5 stars - as you'd expect from a deluxe boutique hotel.
* Location: Superb central location on a quiet side street. It's an oasis which is what you want in the Gothic Quarter. Many sites and brilliant restaurants within easy walking distance. Easy walk to the metro.
* Building: Beautiful building with the Roman wall and wall of the palace showing throughout.
* Staff: Every staff member is friendly and helpful. Professionally attentive. Personable. Special shout-out to our concierge: When we asked how to experience some of the incredible Barcelona food scene, he made us reservations every night at the most amazing restaurants.
* Room: Gorgeous (more Roman wall!) quiet dark room with an amazing bed. Best sleep ever: I'm a morning person but more than once I had trouble getting out of bed in time for the amazing breakfast.
* Food: Ah the food. Brilliant Michelin-worthy meal at the main restaurant one night, with great wine pairings. Another shout-out to our lovely server who showed us the ancient cellar and told us about the history of the hotel building. Interesting and tasty breakfast dishes. Welcome tapas at the front taverna. Lovely bar for evening cocktails. 

Our stay was bookended by the easy welcoming cava check-in and the equally simple checkout with taxi pickup on the narrow street. A minor error on our bill was quickly fixed without question.

If I make it back to Barcelona - and if I can afford it at that time - I will run straight to Mercer where I know I'll be welcomed back with smiles and open arms.",5,2024,03,10
15,Beautiful Hotel & Awesome Customer Service,"I will start this review by saying that Danny at the front desk and Fernando, who is one of the bellmen, are both truly outstanding, very professional, kind, and amongst the very best I’ve encountered in any hotel, anywhere in the world. They made our experience from the moment we walked in, an extremely pleasant one. 
Hotel is located in the very heart of the gothic quarter. Every single detail about the design of this  hotel is awesome. From the lobby, to the hallways, to the rooms…everything is done with such great taste and touch. 
Our biggest regret was only staying 1 night at this hotel.",5,2024,03,05
15,Just great….,"The most calming place I know, and with a superb restaurant, understated interiors with every comfort within ancient palatial architecture  Always elegant, I love staying here - it’s an oasis of escape from the tourist chaos in the fascinating gothic quarter. ",5,2024,03,02
15,The perfect oasis in Barcelona,"
I can’t say enough good things about the Mercer. Starting with the very basics, the service is impeccable. Every single staff member is both incredibly kind and attentive. Next, the room was gorgeous, spacious, and the bed was so comfortable I did not want to get out of it. I think it is so important to mention when there is an excellent housekeeping service - they go above and beyond in morning and evening services. 
My stay in Barcelona would not have been nearly as wonderful if not for Mercer and particularly the concierge! From recommendations to bookings they made my trip so effortless. Special shoutout to Dani! The restaurants and tours he suggested were amazing. Also, both of the hotel restaurants probably serve some of the best food you can find in Barcelona. I would’ve eaten at either every night if I could have, make sure you make reservations when you arrive! A shoutout for Ago at the restaurant breakfast - she is lovely. 
A true luxury hotel, Mercer is the only place I would stay in Barcelona in the future. I felt so taken care of, the entire staff made me feel right at home. I can’t wait to stay here on my next visit! ",5,2024,02,26
15,Great stay,"We only stayed one night but we loved the hotel. 
Prime location near eveything, in a nice neighbourhood which is still quiet. The people at the hotel were all very welcoming, nice and caring. 
Our room was big, modern and well maintened. The bed was very comfortable. 
We could not experience the pool as we visited in February but we plan to go back.",5,2024,02,20
15,The most wonderful experience,"I can not recommend this hotel enough. The atmosphere is sophisticated yet welcoming, the rooms are comfortable and clean, and the amenities provided leave you wanting not. Mauro and his team went above and beyond to accommodate me in every aspect. From recommendations to appeasing all my needs including changing my room when things were not working probably. The hotel itself is beautiful the perfect juxtaposition between the new and old. The location itself is amazing for exploring the historic city yet unexpectedly quiet with undisturbed evenings and tranquil mornings. For me the people made this trip one to never forget and I can not wait to come back and stay here again. Thank to all of the staff at the Mercer Barcelona, all of you made my stay in your wonderful city an exceptional experience. ",5,2024,02,18
15,"Understated luxury, total serenity","We just visited the hotel for the second time in two years and already want to go back. It's a hidden gem in the middle of the Gothic Quarter, secluded on a quiet street, with an unobtrusive entrance and an unmistakable yet discreet sense of luxury within. We love how the space merges contemporary architecture and design with stone, brick, and wood from different layers of Barcelona's ancient past and how the lighting and exceptionally sound-proofed rooms radiate calm. On both our stays, we found that the exquisite setting was enhanced by the graciousness of the hotel’s staff.",5,2024,01,12
15,Stunning Stay,"We booked two rooms during the holidays in this elegant and well-located hotel. The friendly staff made sure we had everything we needed, and even left beautiful little cakes in our room for New Year's Eve. The hotel is connected to ancient Roman walls, but feels modern and spacious. One of the rooms was in an old tower! The rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. The hotel is close to a Metro stop, but we walked most places. Gorgeous!",5,2024,01,06
15,"Prices up, service down","We have been coming to this hotel since it opened 12 years ago with a short interruption due to Covid.
The once attractive service-minded boutique hotel has upped its prices considerably and lowered its service standards. 
The old problems like dark and badly lit rooms are still there. As long as you are willing to walk, the location is good. If, like us, you have to rely on taxis, then prepare yourself for a transportation nightmare. Works on via Laietana make the approach difficult for taxis due to permanent congestion. Most taxis don't even know the hotel and/or refuse to go there.
Simple requests like extra pillows, ignored. Turndown service, nada ( when you pay 700 euros for a simple room in a luxury hotel, you might expect that service). 
Bathrooms look ok, but there is no water pressure and the planks in the shower cubicles are highly unstable. Quality of drawers, cupboards and tables in the rooms has deteriorated and in some cases needs to be replaced ( for the going rate they need to be replaced)
Check-in: after 10 stays the hotel does not have a trace of your former stays. 
Exceptions for Mauro the concierge and the staff at breakfast.
This once fabulous hotel has lost its luster and does not encourage us to come back anymore. We are very sorry to say that we shall not come back.

",3,2023,12,30
15,A lovely place to stay,Friendly helpful staff.  Well located near the waterfront and the museums and so many of the other attractions. Cars arranged seamlessly. Clean well appointed room.  And they even arranged for sunshine in December.  All good. ,5,2023,12,16
15,Sophisticated Establishment in quiet Area,"We visited the hotel in December. The weather is quite pleasant in Barcelona at this time of the year and the hotel was not fully booked. Everyone therefore took a lot of time for us and there was a personal atmosphere. The hotel is very quiet and we were able to sleep well without any street noise. Our room was very clean and tastefully decorated, just as the whole hotel is very tastefully decorated. The brasserie has small dishes at fair prices that were really good quality. We did not visit the restaurant. The breakfast was a little too gourmet-styled for our taste, although the quality was really very good. Overall, the Mercer is a sophisticated establishment and offers a very comfortable stay.",5,2023,12,11
15,Love this hotel,Love everything about this hotel. The staff are so nice and considerate and the overall environment is amazing. I love the breakfast experience at Mercer especially. The surrounding small streets and boutique stores are nice too. I will definitely come back for sure.,5,2023,12,04
15,Wonderful stay1,"Everything we wanted in a short stay: excellent location in the Gothic Quarter, spacious room, good service, modern facilities, and a generous cooked breakfast.  Easy walk to many major tourist destinations, yet a quiet neighborhood.",5,2023,12,02
15,Luxurious and peaceful in the heart of the Gothic Quarter,"So happy with our recent stay here. The location is walkable to a ton of the main sights and the beach area. We stayed in a junior suite with our baby and toddler and it was really spacious and the hotel was super accommodating of the kids. The staff were all amazing - so helpful and friendly. They were so helpful actually that when we were waiting for our taxi to the airport, we were afraid our luggage might be overweight and they brought out a scale right to the lobby for us to weigh our bags so we could see lol. The only annoying thing, is that if you take a random taxi or Uber to the hotel they won’t drop you right at the door because they won’t want to navigate the narrow streets (so you might need to walk a few blocks with your bags). But the hotel can arrange for taxis that will come right to the door so it’s not too bad!",5,2023,12,01
15,What more could you ask for?,"A gorgeous boutique hotel that was a former sentry tower in the original wall surrounding Barcelona. The location is unbeatable - right in the heart of Barrio Gothic, but when you shut the windows, you cannot hear a thing. Magnificent rooftop pool and bar area. Beautiful common areas. A cozy bar with good service and an adjoining restaurant. Our room was very beautifully appointed - if a little small and somewhat dark (a brighter LED bulb here and there would be a great addition). First rate linens and bathroom supplies and a very helpful desk staff and concierge. What more could you ask for?",5,2023,11,27
15,Lots to like!,"My favorite aspect of this hotel is its location, in the Gothic area.    There is so much to see and do within walking distance of the hotel.   
My least favorite aspect of this hotel was my room's lighting.   I stayed in 2 suites.  Neither had overhead lighting, and the lamps did not provide sufficient lighting, in my opinion.      ",4,2023,11,20
15,A Gothic Gem,"Barcelona has many great hotels, however, the Mercer is jewel in the heart of the Gothic Quarter.  What makes this hotel special is a great architectural mix of the ancient and the new.  But what sets it apart is the staff.  Janina personified the perfect staff member.  She went beyond her job to get us a restaurant reservation.  Truly incredible.  Luca was another part of the great people at the Mercer.  If Barcelona is your destination, this is the place to enjoy it all.",5,2023,11,15
15,wonderful Barcelona,perfect hotel in the perfect part of barcelona.  great staff.  nice beds.  amazing food.  every one was willing to make our visit easy and happy. even willing to give a personal tour. loved the location tucked into the gothic area.,5,2023,11,14
15,Amazing hotel,"Beautiful hotel. 5 star. The staff was extremely attentive. They had everything we needed. Beds were very comfortable. The bar, lounge area was modern and lovely. We
Will be back! We had tappas and cocktails. Perfect! ",5,2023,11,13
15,Lovely hotel in a great location,"Fantastic location to explore all of Barcelona. The hotel is to be found in the quiet Gothic quarter but only minutes walk from the livelier areas. Small squares dot the area with bars and restaurants. Staff very friendly. The roof terrace is a few plus
There were a few niggles with the room but nothing that affected the stay.
",5,2023,11,13
15,Silver Annivesary,"Amazing hotel in the best location. The Gothic Quarter is definitely the place to be, and this hotel is central to all the most important sites, in walking distance (Cathedral, Guell Palace, La Rambla, Picasso Museum, and of course shopping). Staff was very friendly and helpful. Shout out to Luis for the wine selections. Restuarant dinner was excellent. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,11,10
15,Amazing engagement stay,"From start to finish the experience and service was unmatched anywhere else we have stayed. We enjoyed lunch at Le Bouchon just like we did on our visit 7 years ago. We also had the tasting menu for dinner in the restaurant on the second night. We got engaged in our Suite on the first night so this place will always be special to us. The Suite was spectacular and the little personal touches really made our holiday. Special mention to the concierge team for sorting reservations, taxis and giving us ideas of what to do. The breakfasts were absolutely stand out and the service was continually amazing. Particularly the roof top bar and pool was fantastic and we had the whole area to ourselves and managed to have lovely weather as well even in late October. Finally I would say the location was really good and in walking distance of most main areas and attractions. We love to be close to the marina so this was perfect and we also had the history of El Gotic as well",5,2023,11,04
15,Always the best,Have stayed at this wonderful hotel many times and it is the only hotel in Barcelona I will book. Rooms are very well styled and super comfortable. The Roman walls give the hotel excellent character. Staff is super helpful and always around to help if needed. Love the secluded location yet walkable to everything. Worth the stay every single time. ,5,2023,11,04
15,Wonderful Autumnal Break,Our first visit to Barcelona was made even better by staying in the Mercer Hotel. Atmospheric hotel in the centre of the Gothic Quarter. The staff were helpful and ensured we had everything we needed for a fabulous stay. ,5,2023,11,02
15,Customer service above and beyond,"We have the pleasure to have stayed multiple times at the Mercer Hotel. We love the place, the personnel, the location, the way they make you feel, and the VERY personalized treatment receive.

Today they once again went above and beyond by helping us to arrange for a local tour for some friends of ours who are not even staying at their hotel!!

Thank you Florencia, and mostly, thank you Janina, you have been UNBELIEVABLE!!

It goes to proof over and over how high and strong is their commitment to their guests and former guests. I have never experience anything like today's arrangements!!

Our loyalty to Mercer Hotel will be for life!!",5,2023,10,31
15,The best! ,We had the absolute best time staying at Mercer Hotel. Each staff member was so kind and helpful. Shout out to Janina for planning the perfect day for us. You made our honeymoon even more special! We will definitely be back !,5,2023,10,31
15,Lovely intimate boutique hotel with amazing service,"My husband and I spent two days at the Mercer at the end of a 3 week trip.  From the minute we walked into the hotel, we were greeted by the welcoming staff who made us feel like their most valued guests.  Everyone we interacted with made us feel welcome and at home. In addition to the excellent customer service, the hotel is immaculate.  Beds are comfortable and sheets a high thread count - we didn't want to get out of bed!  The rooms are tastefully decorated with everything you need, including free bottled water (sparkling and still), but not a lot of extra ""stuff"" that can make rooms feel cluttered.  We ate in both of the hotel restaurants - Le Buchon and the Mercer Restaurant.  Both are excellent!  Thank you everyone at The Mercer for making the last days of our vacation so memorable.  ",5,2023,10,30
15,Perfect stay,"Beautiful boutique hotel where they take care of all the details, the service is very good. They accompanied us to the restaurant that was reserved for us. 
The Head concierge Mauro made our vacation special.",5,2023,10,30
15,Loved our Stay!!,"Gorgeous gem of a hotel in the gothic quarter of Barcelona, impeccably renovated around an original Roman wall.

Perfect location, walkable to quaint shops, galleries, restaurants and even the beach. Incredibly comfortable rooms with beautiful bedding, all conveniences, exquisite breakfasts, fabulous tapas and wine (bottled specifically for the hotel) at the hotel restaurant Le Bouchon with 2 outdoor tables overlooking the cobblestone street, (we wondered why we hadn't gone there sooner in our stay but luckily discovered it before we left.) As others have mentioned, the customer service by the concierge staff couldn't be beat.

Janina was especially warm and helpful, but all staff were kind and willing to connect us with restaurants, guided tours, cab rides and anything else we needed during our stay. Highly, highly recommend the lovely Mercer Hotel!

P.S. - Include the Breakfast - great food options, terrific service, beautiful China, etc. etc. !",5,2023,10,29
15,"Very Nice Hotel, wonderful Staff","The hotel was really nice and a good location.   Off a side street, little harder to find, but quieter.    The staff was so helpful.   They would find us restaurants, even walk us to the close ones so we could find them.    The hotel bar also had great cocktails and a great staff!",5,2023,10,25
15,Best Concierge Ever!!!,"Well-earned 5-star service rating! My spouse forgot her Rx medicine at our hotel in Sevilla.  She would suffer large health problems if she went more than one night without her medicine. We arrived at the Mercer on Saturday morning, and the head concierge, Mauro, was ingenious (and well-connected) in solving this problem, which required a lot of his attention.  He saved our stay in Barcelona!",5,2023,10,25
15,Charming Small Hotel in Gothic Barcelona,"We found this hotel to be most welcoming and the staff friendly and efficient. The hotel is only a 15 to 20 minute walk from most of historic Barcelona, and its shopping. Interestingly, the food in their tapas bar ""Bouchon"" was great.",5,2023,10,21
15,A gem in the Gothic Quarter,"A hidden gem in the heart of the Gothic Quarter, literally built into the ancient Roman walls protecting Barcelona. The rooms are beautiful, the private central courtyard is a perfect place to linger over a coffee, the breakfasts are magical (the fresh fruit salads alone are perfect), and the staff is supremely helpful and most speak English. The Mercer is within walking distance of dozens of great tapas places and restaurants — down those hauntingly beautiful Gothic Quarter streets lined with galleries and charming shops, and enlivened by really creative graffiti — and museums like the Picasso Museum and the MoCo. Special gratitude to Mauro at the desk and Simone and Julia in the dining room. The tapas bar in the hotel, Le Bouchon, is excellent. A superb stay in Barcelona.",5,2023,10,21
15,Had a nice stay at The Mercer Hotel,We had a wonderful stay at the Mercer Hotel.  It is a very unique experience to stay at this historic building.  The location was very convenient.  Easy to walk to almost everything!  The staff was phenomenal - extremely helpful in every way!!!! ,5,2023,10,17
15,Great spot in the Gothic Quarter,"We stayed in a junior suite (room 106) overlooking the courtyard. It's quiet and dark - so much so that with the blinds closed we woke at 8:30am and thought it was still the middle of the night. The rooftop pool is small and great for a quick dip after a long day of walking, and the view is beautiful. Cars cannot drive up to the Mercer but the staff will walk you to an area to catch a taxi as needed. The area is just so beautiful to walk around - just make sure you have your map up on your phone or it's easy to get lost! I was busy taking photos on every corner while my husband directed us :) The staff were thoughtful and helpful and made sure to make life as easy and enjoyable as possible. There are lots of places to get coffee and croissants in the area so we didn't add the daily breakfast, but we splurged on our last day and it was well-presented and delicious.",5,2023,10,16
15,A fabulous experience,"From the time I arrived until I departed, my experience was amazing.  The staff was friendly and eager to help.  The concierge staff was quite helpful in setting up a tour and arranging for transportation.  The hotel and my room were beautiful and well kept.  All of my dining experiences at the restaurant were impressive, both the food and the service.  I highly recommend the Mercer to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2023,10,16
15,An unusual and lovely hotel.   ,"We spent a long time deciding which area and which hotel to stay in in Barcelona and we couldn’t have made a better choice.     The Gothic quarter is full of atmosphere and character with narrow streets and lots of restaurants and interesting shops.     The hotel is situated in one of these streets and is a mixture of modern and old. Part of the hotel is incorporated in the old city walls. Its location is excellent and there is a metro a couple of minutes walk away.    The hotel has a lovely roof terrace and swimming pool.
All the staff were really professional and couldn’t have been more helpful, we were made to feel very welcome.
Our room was modern with an extremely comfortable bed.    There was an open partition in it the other side of which was a narrow bathroom and cupboard area.   The toilet was separate.   Some of the tiles on the shower floor were very loose and wobbly.   This needs fixing before there is an accident.
We were told there was lots of petty crime in Barcelona but we felt quite safe during our trip although we were sensible and we really enjoyed our stay in the Mercer Hotel.  ",5,2023,10,15
15,Wonderful boutique hotel in Barcelona,"As a newcomer to Barcelona it was difficult to choose a hotel. My TA strongly suggested the Eixample area but we wanted to be closer to restaurants and coffee shops etc. Plus we love history and the idea of staying in the Gothic Quarter led us to the Mercer. It was the perfect choice! Very comfortable, wonderful people, and the two restaurants (same kitchen) for tapas (Bouchon) and gastronomy (Mercer Restaurant) were incredible. 

I had read a lot of scary stuff about Barcelona but there was not one moment when I felt nervous at all. To be fair, we weren't out after 10 pm and there were a few streets 4-5 blocks west of the Mercer that looked like they could be dicey late at night. But overall it was a wonderful and very safe area in which to stay. Also, exceptionally quiet. 

I took off one bubble for the rooms. Modern decor is not my favorite and though there was a separate WC room the bathroom had no doors. ",5,2023,10,13
15,Exceeds 5 Star Expectations,The best hotel I’ve ever stayed in.  The service is unbelievable and aesthetically it’s gorgeous.  We may consider coming back to Barcelona just to visit Mercer and the neighborhood.  The rooms are perfectly laid out and the air conditioning keeps the rooms freezing cold even during a heat wave.  Every single member of the staff was more than happy to go out of their way to make sure every aspect of our visit was comfortable.  To make things even better both restaurants in the hotel are exceptional. Some of the best food I had in Barcelona came from the tapas restaurant.,5,2023,10,11
15,Perfect,"Outstanding hotel, great location, absolutely perfect welcome and service thanks to a truly helpful, kind and caring crew. Definitely our best stay in Barcelona so far, we can’t wait until the next one !",5,2023,09,29
15,Wonderful Hotel in the Heart of the Gothic Quarter!,"I can't imagine a nicer hotel for our stay in Barcelona, the staff was fantastic, extremely helpful and attentive. Our room was very comfortable and clean and the beds were amazing.  The hotel is beautiful and the onsite restaurant and bar are one of the best. We were minutes from everything!",5,2023,09,25
15,First Class Hotel,"This hotel is one of the best Hotel’s I’ve ever had the pleasure of staying. Great Location. Exceptional Service, the entire staff just wants to make your stay more memorable. Large Room, very comfortable bed, exceptional shower. The breakfast is a Wow, the two other dining facilities are excellent. Can’t say enough. ",5,2023,09,23
15,An island of silence in the heart of Barcelona!,"Our stay was absolutely amazing! We enjoyed the service and kindness of the staff. No effort was too big! The hotel is situated very central what makes it a superb starting point for discovering any neighborhood! 
Rooms have original features combined with modern design. It looked very nice but on the practical side, good lightning above the lavabo's was missing. A second minus point were the towel hangers in the shower space. I would have preferred them to be outside of the shower. But any of these little things changed the positive impression we had of the hotel.
The cherry on the cake is the swimming pool and rooftop terras ... we enjoyed it every afternoon before dining! Top hotel! Top destination! We will be back!!!",5,2023,09,19
15,A beautiful hotel.  Something to see in itself and a very comfortable place to stay in the heart of Gotic Quarter.,"Such a beautiful hotel with excellent service.  For us it was the perfect blend of history.”, modern style and convenience.  The staff was incredibly helpful but not overbearing.  The hotel made us feel like we were living in the old part gotic of Barcelona. We truly felt like we had our own apartment.  The restaurant was very nice as well.  Our goal would be to stay at all their other hotels in the region. Jenina, Dani, Sofia & Mauro and many others whose names we forgot (staff) were wonderful.  Felt like old friends after a three night stay. Highly recommend!!",5,2023,09,17
15,Fantastic Hotel,This a wonderful hotel. We had room 108 which had a fantastic combination of ancient stone walls combined with clean contemporary design and the room has a huge deck that we had little time to experience. A great location in the Gothic District was also a plus.   All of the staff were friendly and provided excellent service. The restaurants and bar were top of the line. We would highly recommend the Mercer.,5,2023,09,13
15,Chic Boutique Hotel,This hotel is in the historic Latin Quarter. The property is a perfect blend of old and modern. The staff is amazingly friendly and helpful and made us feel like VIPs throughout our stay. Reach out ahead if you want help booking anything because they are great with suggestions and can make the calls. Rooms are gorgeous! ,5,2023,09,05
15,Best experience in Barcelona,"The staff at the Mercer Hotel were exceptional! My husband and I were greeted with a glass of Cava and upon request, we were booked hair appointments at a local salon. The Hotel is located in the most beautiful street of the Gothic Quarter. It is steps from Las Ramblas. 

We rented a car, so we drove to a plaza that’s next to the Hotel and the staff took care of our car. 

The breakfast is divine!! Their tapas restaurant is exquisite. We also ate at their main restaurant and ate their degustación menu by Chef Xavier Lahuerta with wine pairing. What an experience! 

We booked a couple’s massage which was done in the privacy of our room. 

We will be staying in the Mercer Hotel anytime we’re in Barcelona. Don’t hesitate to book. You will be in great hands.",5,2023,09,03
15,5 Stars is not enough to give!,"One of the best hotels my husband and I have ever stayed in. From our pre-arrival experience to out check out, the team at the Mercer Hotel could not be any more accommodating if they tried! The rooms were clean and spacious and the breakfast was something my husband and I will talk about the rest of our lives. Could not recommend a hotel more! ",5,2023,08,23
15,"Outstanding Service, Great Location, Highly Recommend!","I stayed at the Mercer Barcelona for 6 nights in August 2023. From beginning to end, their service was outstanding. We were greeted upon arrival with a glass of bubbly as we checked in, and the concierge Mauro took care to show us to our rooms and show us the features of the hotel, all with such a pleasant personality that set the tone for our whole stay. Throughout our stay, Mauro went above and beyond in supporting us with any request -- even making reservations for dinner for us, and then personally walking with us to the restaurant - twice! Francesco, the bartender in the main bar, also provided such kind conversation and used his skills to make a modification of my favorite cocktail. In addition to the outstanding staff (I don't know everyone else's names, but every single employee was pleasant, funny and considerate), their location in the Gothic Quarter can't be beat. Beautiful squares, great shopping, amazing restaurants all within walking distance. The rooms were as beautiful as on the site - modern up-to-date style. I would gladly stay there again when I return to Barcelona. ",5,2023,08,18
15,Perfect Location,"The Mercer Hotel Barcelona has to be one of the best in the Gothic Quarter.

With its renovated Roman architecture carefully juxtaposed to new modern touches, perfect location, amazing food & friendly staff.

I couldn’t have asked for a more perfect start to my European holiday. ",5,2023,08,16

15,"AMAZING experience, book immediately!!","If you are looking for the best hotel in Seville, look no further!! Five star hotel in every sense of the word at a GREAT value for the price. Firstly, the hotel is absolutely beautiful. The aesthetics, the comfort, the cleanliness, and the facilities are perfection. Our room was stunning and everything one could want with all the luxuries of a five star hotel. The lobby and floors are beautifully decorated and so enjoyable to relax in. Secondly, the service is beyond compare. There are not many rooms in the hotel (but the hotel itself is large and spacious) and the service is incredibly kind, attentive, and personalized. Before we even arrived, the hotel reached out to assist us with booking restaurants, entertainment, to ask about our dietary restrictions, etc. At check in after a long day of travelling, we were greeting with a huge smile, a glass of cava, and a voucher for welcome drinks at the beautiful hotel bar.  Throughout the entire stay, Silvia, Sergio, and Alfonso could not have taken better care of us. They were always available, incredibly kind and lovely, and helpful with our every need! Given the fewer number of rooms, it was never crowded and someone is always there to help - we even had the rooftop pool all to ourselves with a bottle of Cava gifted by the hotel. We have stayed at many wonderful hotels and this is up there with the best of the best. Do not hesitate to book immediately!!! We can’t wait to return!",5,2023,08,10
15,Great hotel in Gothic District,"The staff was very nice, friendly, and helpful. We arrived early in the morning and although our room wasn’t ready just yet, as we had anticipated, we were able to end up getting into the room much earlier than the check in time. Room was very nice and bed big and comfortable. The restaurant is so cute and we had excellent breakfasts. The bartender, Muriel, was absolutely wonderful! So friendly and even got us some drinks after she was closing up. The concierge booked us some dinner reservations at a beautiful rooftop restaurant. The Gothic area where the hotel is located has some cute shops and restaurants nearby. It was a wonderful stay for us!",5,2023,08,09
15,Barcelona,"Lovely hotel. Super comfortable. A perfect blend of service, food, and a comfortable atmosphere—casual yet elegant at the same time. Great rooftop deck. Rooms are excellent. Top notch and our 2nd stay here. ",5,2023,08,08
15,hotel stay,"Our stay at the Mercer Hotel Barcelona was excellent. The staff was outstanding in service and greeting you at the door. Very helpful with making reservations for dinner, museums, tours, etc. The hotel was contemporary in design but built into the historic city walls. The roof deck was really relaxing with a small pool. I would highly recommend staying her because it also was conveniently located within in the city which made walking the city easy. Happy travels!",5,2023,08,05
15,Lack of A/C,"Not cool… This hotel lacks proper A/C! Not great in the summer. Our room was 80*F (26*C) all night, and the manager told us “that is how we air condition”. Perhaps it was just our room - we were a top floor jr suite under the clay roof (not the pool deck) so it got direct sun all day, but it is very hard to sleep when it is so hot and really ruined our stay.
The building alone is beautiful but the interiors are weird - like an ikea renovation. The closets had no lights, actually the whole room only had 2 light options - one from the bathroom side and one in the middle of the room, so either you had the whole place strangely lit from one side or nothing at all.
As someone else mentioned below, the bathroom was overly-modern but not secure (shower plans wobbly), and generally seemed like a budget renovation in an absolutely stunning building. It’s weird. Wanted to love the place, but would not stay here and would not recommend. Also was very hard to get any help - had to call multiple times for someone to pick up, or go down to the lobby to find someone to order room service or get a fan… last thing - love the gothic area, but not great with luggage bc you can’t get a car to the front door. Be prepared.",2,2023,07,23
15,Absolutely wonderful!,"We stayed at Mercer Hotel Barcelona for three nights in July, 2023. The location is amazing, right in the Gothic Quarter, and every single member of staff made us feel so welcome. The first night we dined at the hotel restaurant and had the tasting menu with wine pairing. It was absolutely amazing, and Luis found wonderful wines for us, that we had never tasted before. Two of us have Celiac disease, and the chef perfectly adjusted the menu to accommodate our gluten free restrictions. I can not recommend this hotel highly enough. Just go - you won't regret it!",5,2023,07,10
15,Amazing staff and beautiful rooms!,We loved our stay at Mercer! Every single staff member was amazing! They were incredibly helpful and lovely to deal with! They helped me in advance of our trip with car and restaurant arrangements and we very helpful with everything during our stay! Our rooms were beautiful with the historic feel but with modern touches that I appreciate. Cannot wait to come back to stay here again some day!,5,2023,07,10
15,Luxury and Style in the Gothic Quarter,"Mercer Hotel provided a beautiful stay at the end of our trip.  The building was elegant, the breakfast was delicious and the staff was helpful and friendly.  Each of the people working there was devoted to making our experience perfect.  Our room was comfortable-air conditioning was excellent.  Hotel was luxurious with a cool vibe.",5,2023,07,05
15,"Mercer Hotel, Barcelona","This hotel is among the finest we have ever stayed in.  Service was impeccable, rooms luxurious and the food and wine, over the top.  The rooftop pool and lounge area are lovely for relaxing . Concierge Mauro was extremely helpful, making all aspects of our trip relaxed and enjoyable.",5,2023,07,04
15,Best hotel in Barcelona,I love this hotel.. the conceive organised our hire car for the morning while I went to the pool for a Gin and Tonic. Then great suggestions for dinner… just what you want when you travel we will be back,5,2023,07,03
15,Family Vacation,"Our travel agent helped us with this hotel, and she could not have picked a better hotel in the Gothic Quarter.  The staff was beyond helpful.  They met our group of 6 adults and loaded all of our luggage for the short little walk to the hotel from the drop off point with the taxi.  While we walked to the hotel, they gave us a brief history of the area we were in and the hotel itself.  Once inside they got us checked in and gave us recommendations for lunch as not all the rooms were ready. The lunch spot was amazing!  We spent a beautiful day walking around and the hotel was the perfect spot to drop back in and take a break or drop off items.  The hotel is beyond beautiful and historic.  The rooms were clean, and beds were very comfortable.  There is a mini fridge stocked with water and juices, should you need anything during your stay.  They even dropped off some house made sweets to welcome us. The staff happened to overhear us talking about our daughter and her boyfriend getting engaged just the day before and they brought all of us a glass of Cava to celebrate.  They are very focused on the client and will do anything in their power to help make your stay as comfortable as possible.  We were only at the hotel for one night, as we were setting sail on a cruise ship, but when we find ourselves in Barcelona next, we will be back to the Mercer. Excellent start to our family vacation.",5,2023,06,30
15,Brilliant modern/ancient combo,"On a hard to find walking street in the oldest part of Barcelona, this beautiful, full service hotel was one of the most unique hotels I’ve ever stayed in. The modern rooms are beautifully designed to complement the ancient architecture, the staff is super friendly and helpful, and the location is ideal for exploring on foot. The tapas restaurant is perfect for quick meals, the breakfast was divine, and the concierge got us into Estimar last minute, which everyone told us was impossible. The bedding was luxurious and I slept the best I had in weeks in the cool, silent environment. I wish we had planned to stay a few more days. It’s the only place I’ll ever stay in Barcelona. Not inexpensive, but worth every euro. ",5,2023,06,28
15,Beautiful,"A beautiful & charming hotel located on a quiet street in the Gothic district in the heart of downtown. The service was gracious and professional. I loved the modern decor mixed with original architecture like the exposed stone walls. My favorite spot is the outdoor courtyard breakfast room. It is a quiet and peaceful sanctuary, the perfect spot to start the day before going out to the busy city. The Mercer suite was gorgeous and comfortable. Thank you all for a memorable and luxurious visit. ",5,2023,06,24
15,Lovely boutique-hotel in the Barri Gothic,"Perfect location to explore Barcelona. Lovely building with ancient findings and modern comfort. Room  very quiet and comfortably cool. Classy furniture and very well planned layout. Very friendly stuff.
Memorable breakfast in the green patio.",5,2023,06,17
15,The Staff and Location is everything!,"My husband and I stayed 6 nights , the staff was very attentive and helpful with everything we asked . The location was fantastic we walked every where there were no need for taxi. we found a lot of good places to eat( locals choice )   away from the tourist area so food was good and reasonably price ! I know is a bit pricey but trust me a good night sleep . good shower and no need to pay for transportation will equal every out . If I was going to point a flaw will be I just wish I knew their roof deck was being repaired and I wish there was an early check up option for people traveling from over seas and as my husband request they need to invest on new mattresses the bed was ok but for the price per night it could be way better . ",4,2023,06,10
15,Exceptional service in a beautiful hotel,"We arrived in central Barcelona on a very busy Saturday morning but reaching the hotel was like finding an oasis. This is a beautiful hotel which has been built very sympathetically into the old ruin walls in the Gothic Quarter, a charming quiet spot which is a great retreat from the busy streets. Every spot in the hotel is lovely, the bar, the longe area, the outside spaces and the dining areas. Breakfast is a real treat. However, what makes this hotel special is the staff. They are all so friendly and welcoming and are a real team.  The concierge welcomed us on check in and took us on a little tour proudly telling us about the building’s history.  The next day I saw him helping out in the tapas restaurant. I just felt they all worked together so well and took great pride in their work. We did have an issue with noise in our room and they dealt with it impeccably. Nothing was too much trouble for them. They just wanted to make sure everything was right and kept checking in with us throughout our stay. When asking for a lunch recommendation one day the guy called through to the restaurant to make sure it was still open and then took us there. It wasn’t far but how amazing! We ate in the hotel’s formal restaurant one evening and again the waiter was so charming we would have been happy for him to join us!  We didn’t get any of the staff’s names but all of them were amazing and I’d like to thank them for a wonderful stay. We look forward to coming back. ",5,2023,06,07
15,Fantastic experience!,"Located in the Gothic district, the Mercer is walking distance from many things to do and see. The property is very stylish and the atrium in the center is a wonderful calm place to have a meal or just sit. Our room was large, comfortable, and included bottled water (still and sparkling), and several sodas each day. The staff were so friendly and attentive that this posh hotel maintained a homey and welcoming atmosphere.",5,2023,06,05
15,Perfect Stay,"had a two night three day stop in Barcelona.  Staff and amenities were exceptional, perfect location.  Staff was amazing and breakfast was the best of our trip.  I would highly recommend this hotel to all.  Hope to return someday!!!!!!!!!! ",5,2023,06,05
15,Excellence at every turn," A first class hotel with top-of-the-line services and guest relations. The location of the hotel is perfect to access multiple parts of the city. The hotel also has phenomenal restaurants with delicious and creative cuisine and great wines. Thank you to the entire staff.",5,2023,06,04
15,Beautiful Boutique Hotel in Barcelona,"The hotel is located in an awesome location, tucked away from a Main Street. The entire staff was very helpful and rooms were amazing! We could easily walk around the city from this hotel and it was a very safe area. We will definitely stay here again!",5,2023,05,29
15,Hidden Treasure,"We had been traveling Europe for 2 weeks and as it was coming to an end we wanted to stay in the Heart of a community, we couldn’t have chosen a better place. 
The Hotel is nestled in Old Barcelona with many allies and Cathedrals all around. It is an easy walk to the Rumbula and the Port. To top it off the restaurant is easily a 5 star gourmet treasure. You won’t go wrong with this stay.",5,2023,05,29
15,Barcelona trip,"My wife and I stayed 4 nights at the Mercer and had a great experience for many reasons.  The location was perfect for what we were doing, in very close proximity to the food tour, bike tours, museums, etc. that we chose to do.  Off the beaten path but that was a good thing when you want to escape the throngs of other tourists visiting. We ate and enjoyed drinks at Le Bouchon a couple of nights; staff was very friendly and attentive.  Breakfast was included in our room rate and a great way to start the day. We stayed in room 305, which was labeled as a deluxe room and overlooked the inner courtyard.  Really quiet and had everything we needed.  This is a 5-star hotel but we never encountered any aloofness by the staff, they were all very warm and welcoming.
Special recognition to Facundo (? spelling) from Argentenia; outstanding customer service!  This is an expensive hotel but it made our stay in Barcelona a memorable one. 
Would definitely stay here again!",5,2023,05,27
15,May Stay 2023,"A good stay but could be better - The pillows are way too soft and feathers are not hygenic as they can't be washed, mini bar awful not even any still water, shower was old, silicon very dirty and heat control was broken off , no USB point anywhere which is so out of date - the rooms need upgrading and just feel a bit tired and basic. Tapas bar food was delicious, breakfast staff a bit unfriendly. ",4,2023,05,27
15,Exceptional service,"The property itself is 5 star - ancient ruins, modern furniture, well-appointed rooms and very clean.  The rooftop patio reserved for hotel guests is a nice treat.  The stand-out at this hotel is the service - the waitstaff and bartenders, and the exceptional concierge.  The concierge went out of her way to ensure that our three-day stay was memorable. Booking restaurant reservations, tickets and securing the best city guide we've ever had.

While we loved the location (tucked away among the narrow streets), if someone has mobility issues they may wish to inquire for assistance with luggage and/or transport to/from the hotel.  

We would definitely return to this hotel. ",5,2023,05,26
15,Stunning,"This hotel was so fabulous. It was a perfect location, beautiful architecture, wonderful bar, gorgeous room. The rooftop bar blew us all the way. I highly recommend it. Every single person that worked there was professional from the doorman to the front desk folks to the bartender to housekeeping.",5,2023,05,21
15,Great hotel,The hotel was in a perfect location in the Gothic district.  Very updated with really nice rooms.  The breakfasts were wonderful.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. Jenina was particularly terrific.,5,2023,05,19
15,"Beautiful, but with some functional issues","This is a lovely hotel which has a central garden patio and Roman walls along the backside, so it is historic and interesting.  There is a rooftop bar with pool which looked nice, but was not staffed.  We did not see any guest using it and the phone which could be used for ordering food and drinks was missing.  The staff and food were good in the attached cafe, Le Bouchon, where we had lunch several times.  We did not have dinner at the in-house Mercer restaurant, as it was fancier and more expensive than we wanted.  We wanted to explore tapas restaurants in the area instead.  We did eat in the dining room for breakfast and it was really nice, both in terms of food options, quality and service (especially Simona!).  The front desk staff, concierge, housekeepers and bell persons were friendly and helpful.  I do wish that they wore name tags so that we could laud them here personally.  The only downside was the room.  It was beautiful looking, clean and had a floor-to-ceiling view of a rock wall covered with greenery.  However, there were a number of issues with the operations of the room which proved a frustration:  you had to constantly hold down a button on the heavy hairdryer to make it operate; the toilet paper holder made it difficult to use; the bathroom electrical outlet said it accepted 110 voltage but it did not (had to use an adapter); bathroom lights were on only one side of the sink/mirror area so you did not get good light on both sides of your face; they still use those wasteful tiny shampoo, etc., bottles (instead of refillable ones) which many hotels have stopped using; the shower floor was slippery and weird with plastic planks that felt unsteady; the bathroom make-up mirror kept drooping and had to be tightened to stay in place; the shower temperature adjustment was difficult to operate and keep at a selected heat; some drawers were difficult to keep closed (they were push-to-open types).  Despite the many positives, due to these frustrating elements, we probably would try a different hotel if we return to Barcelona.",4,2023,05,17
15,Average for 5 star hotel,"Looking at different Dimensions, we would give 5 stars for the personelle, 5 stars for location and 5 stars for the building itself. 
Our room was well designed but the table was not in the best shape, the bathroom door was affected by water, it felt like they skipped 1-2 renovation circles. 
The rooftop was nice but i was afraid to break through the wooden floor when walking which is just not what i would expect for a 5 star hotel and is in a way unseen so far. 
We also did not like the breakfast to the full extend - it was way to steril for our taste and not cosy/welcoming.",3,2023,05,14
15,Best Customer Service I Have Ever Had,"The hotel had a few 'quirks', but the friendliness of the employees, the restaurant, the vibe, the history, and the thoughtfulness of the staff made our stay over the top. The restaurants here are are stellar.  Great food, ambiance and service.  When we needed to find a market, one of the staff personally escorted my husband around the corner to show him where it was.  They gladly arranged cars, helped us get tickets to tourist attractions and just generally helped us out while we were there.  The staff works as one big family, that is clear.  There were a few times where, the shower wasnt warm or the bathroom door got stuck.  But its an old building and to be expected.  The rooms were wonderful and spacious.  The plant walls and modern yet historic vibe made our trip just right.  AND, its very centrally located to many areas of the city.  Recommend this place without any hesitation.  you can walk right out the front door and find coffee, restaurants, bars, stores and many of the tourist sites. ",5,2023,05,10
15,Fabulous,"What a special place.  The attention to service was one of the best I have ever seen. Wonderfully peaceful property with top notch details in furnishings, art and food. Great location in the Gothic Quarter. Definite do again for us!

The staff made us feel so welcome and grateful we were there.",5,2023,05,08
15,Loved it!,"Absolutely beautiful hotel, in a wonderful location and with fantastic service.  Went on recommendation of friends for 4 nights, and will recommend to others. Absolutely would stay again.  A+ start to our vacation.",5,2023,05,04
15,Amazing gem in the Gothic Quarter,"What a gem in the heart of the old gothic district.   We got in early from a flight and the street cleaner had to lead us to the hotel.  All boarded up the streets were ominous!  Walking into the hotel was a revelation!  Gorgeous with a huge courtyard and built into the old walls.  A mix of old and modern style.   
The staff was gracious and helpful - just lovely.
The room was nicely appointed, clean and modern/old like the lobby.  We did hear the children in the school next door early but they have lots of inside rooms.  Just ask.
We were tired and hungry when we returned to get to our room and tried their tiny tapas bar.  AWESOME!  The dishes were fabulous, the olives buttery and the wine, perfect.  It was so good that we canceled at another restaurant the last night to eat there again!  This time in the courtyard.
Really easy to get to and from BTW once you saw the markers.
Oh and the roof top area was lovely as well.  
We loved it all.   Going to have to stay in the one in Seville when we go back to Spain.
",5,2023,04,30
15,Can't Wait to Return,"We couldn't have been more pleased with the Mercer. Located in the lively Gothic Quarter, it was convenient yet totally quiet. Our room and bath were large and extremely comfortable. The staff was so gracious and helpful, with great recommendations for restaurants. We look forward to returning.",5,2023,04,28
15,Very Good Hotel,"Very good hotel, fantastic location, just a few small things that let the place down. We booked a premier room which was seriously expensive, but nicely equipped. The shower floor was however bizarre! plastic strips which were not secured and felt very unsafe, totally destroyed any pleasure in having a shower! The metal framed bed squeaked horrendously every time we moved :( .
We, nor two of the room attendants could find any TV channels that showed english speaking channels. In fact the TVs do not appear to have any aerial or satellite dish connection - all options are internet based, so if you dont take your netflix or amazon prime logins, you are stumped. This wasn't a huge problem for us but when you pay Euro 1,350 per night, being able to catch the BBC World news now and then is not unreasonable?  Having said all this we had a great stay and the staff were brilliant!",4,2023,04,26
15,A TEN Out of Five Stars,"You will not find more attentive and nurturing service than at the Mercer, nor a more satisfying stay in Barcelona. Impossible.

The moment we checked in, we were given a quick tour, showing how this modern hotel was built into a Roman wall - a zen fusion of modern meets ancient. Nestled in the Gothic quarter passageways, it's an ideal location - restaurants and shops galore, but also quiet and charming. The taxi may have a hard time finding it, but it's well worth any confusion - trust me.

We booked a junior suite with a nice layout, great water pressure in the shower, and complimentary restocking of the mini bar  - flat and sparkling waters, Cokes and juice. The room had a lovely window that opened to the courtyard and nice sitting areas. (The only slight ""negative"" was that the bed wasn't as firm as we like - a tad ""springy."" But still well within a good comfort range.)

At the Mercer, the entire hotel staff gets to know you, greeting you when you enter and exit. (All speak perfect English btw.) 

After we got settled, we needed to go to a pharmacy. The doorman said he'd walk us there, which was surprising. He made sure we found what we needed. Later when we needed a recommendation for dinner, he once again walked us to an amazing Michelan quality tapas restaurant and made sure they seated us for the reservation the hotel had made for us. Who does that?

Unfortunately, my partner got quite sick during our stay. When the hotel heard he wasn't feeling well, they sent hot tea to the room. And when we asked about doctors, they had a one at our hotel room within an hour. The staff continually asked about his well-being during our stay. 

Because he was too sick to go on the next leg of our trip to Rome, we had to extend our stay in Barcelona. Unfortunately the hotel had no rooms available for the days we required, so we had to change hotels - an arduous task for my partner who was still not feeling great. The concierge offered us a late check out at 2pm so that we could go right to our next hotel without much wait to check in. We booked another highly regarded hotel, but it was worlds apart from the Mercer - kind of a shock to the system after having been spoiled at the Mercer.

We can't thank the staff enough. The Mercer has a special place in our heart forever. We miss everyone already!:(:(",5,2023,04,23
15,Fantastic Mercer Hotel!,"Absolutely loved our stay at the Mercer Hotel. Such a great location that is quiet and relaxing. All of the staff were very friendly and welcoming and couldn't do enough for us. I loved that it's not a big and bustling hotel that could be overwhelming. This place is really cosy and nice. Our room was really nice with a great balcony to sit out on that even had a little tree with a nesting Collared Dove sat on chicks. My wife loved that! All in all, a great stay and we will definitely be back soon.",5,2023,04,22
15,Hidden gem with a great location in an incredible city,Stayed here during our past three visits to Barcelona. The staff treats you like it is your home. The rooms and facilities are great. Breakfast is special. Room 108 is incredible...recently remodeled huge balcony...wonderful experience...once again.,5,2023,04,17
15,Rhett,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Mercer Hotel in Barcelona and would highly recommend it to others. The location is excellent, allowing easy walking access around the Gothic area and down to the marina / port. The friendliness and service from the staff was exceptional whilst the hotel was quiet, well appointed and had a pool / bar / lounging area on the roof which was great on the hot days.",5,2023,04,12
15,Beautiful Hotel with Outstanding Customer Service!,"WOW is the best way to describe Hotel Mercer Barcelona.  This modern gem is tucked away on a quiet side street in the Gothic Quarter, this modern hotel was the perfect pick for our birthday get away. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and I never had to open my own door! Customer service was amazing. We absolutely loved our late nights with Louis and Mariam at the bar! Great way to unwind after sight seeing. Room was very comfortable and even had a small balcony to relax on after a busy day. The history of the building is so cool. Highly recommend a stay if you are looking for a 5 star in a great location, with top notch customer service!",5,2023,04,08
15,Perfect in every way!,I absolutely loved my recent stay at Mercer Hotel Barcelona. The location in the Gothic Quarter is excellent and the service level is impeccable. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. I loved the rooftop and all of the dining options. I can't say enough good things about this hotel and the staff. I recently returned to Barcelona and stayed here again. My go to hotel for Barcelona!,5,2023,04,07
15,"Beautiful, quiet boutique hotel in a nice location; great staff","The moment we arrived at the hotel, a pleasant doorman greeted us and took care of our luggage.  Checking-in was a breeze.  Staff offered us water and then a glass of Cava (sparkling wine). The decor is modern, sophisticated, and relaxing.  Our room was similarly decorated.  The bed was very comfortable.  Bathroom was new, white, and spotless which is important to me.  We had a junior suite and it was very spacious.  It overlooked a lovely courtyard. We’d open our windows and enjoy the breeze. The hotel has a small rooftop bar area with a small pool.  In the lobby area there are 2 bars and a restaurant.  Breakfast was a delicious combination of made-to-order eggs and a buffet.  The location is in the Gothic Quarter and near the Cathedral.  Lots of places to dine and enjoy the unique area with its small, winding streets. Staff was pleasant, friendly, and professional. Definitely would return to this wonderful hotel.",5,2023,04,02
15,Kind and thoughtful staff made the stay so enjoyable!,"Wonderful, warm friendly staff who made our stay so enjoyable. Everyone was so attentive and helpful, even for small things. Super thoughtful staff helped us get taxis, plan and book activities which made our trip so easy! Tapas bar food was also delicious. Would love to return one day!",5,2023,04,02
15,Perfection,"First class accommodations.  Love the location in the Gothic Quarter. I've stayed here many times and its consistently good.  I didn't eat in the restaurant on this trip but I have in the past and its fairly good.  However, there's so many good restaurants in Barcelona that eating in the hotel seems odd to me plus getting out walking in that area is just wonderful.",5,2023,03,30
15,An Excellent Experience,"Super Satisfied with the Staff and Ambiance of the property. Danny the Concierge was very helpful and always up beat, Happy. Our room had a Roman Wall, the bathroom was well designed, floor plan was lovely.",5,2023,03,29

15,10/10 recommend,"Cute hotel, walkable to major attractions, delicious and friendly restaurant, and by far the best service we have ever had at a hotel. The concierge was so helpful with the small details to ensure a pleasant stay. ",5,2023,03,20
15,High quality service and facility,"We only met very forthcoming positive staff at the Mercer Hotel from start to finish. 
The room was super beautiful, spacious and really nice.
The team reacted quickly on any request we had.
Breakfast was great and served in their beautiful restaurant - with an option to sit in the courtyard  ",5,2023,03,17
15,"Extra charges, so-so service but good location","2/5. Be careful with extra charges. Location is great if you want to be in the old town and walk a lot. Service - although concierge was trying hard to welcome us then it was okay, nothing outstanding. 

But the worst service we received from the housekeeping team. Wow, never I experienced such a bad attitude - they were trying to come in early in the morning each day, after we told them a bit later please they rudely were saying “then put a card on the door” ~ wtf? Just some in a bit later not like 9 am. Okay, so they were coming back again after noon, and can you imagine when we were checking out we were charged extra 75 euros for late housekeeping services. The bad attitude from them plus the charge really made a sour feeling about hotel  after we left. Plus we were charged for some water that we asked in the room, despite the fact they told us when checking in that it’s free and if we need more (than a tiny bottle for a person a day) we should just ask. Well I think they should’ve mentioned that you may be charged for that.

Rooms are small, not so clean or new but okay. Modern style which I liked. To sum up property is nice, some of the stuff members in the lobby were welcoming, but not all, and other things were not perfect.",2,2023,03,14
15,A perfect stay,"We had a fantastic stay at the most wonderful boutique hotel. This is a must if you are a foodie and enjoy first class service. Design, location, service etc was just world class. We will be back soon",5,2023,03,13

15,Great Place!  I highly recommend it.,Top Notch!!!  I would recommend this property to anyone visiting Barcelona.  Excellent staff service.  The staff went above and beyond to welcome me to their beautiful hotel and Barcelona.   Great location for walking around and visiting cute shops and restaurants.  Hotel is historic and well done.  Great layout.  ,5,2023,03,11
15,Birthday at Mercer,"Since my arrival I have been welcomed in an excellent way and then everything was perfect. The dinner at the  restaurant was excellent  and  breakfast is a unique experience.
I reccomend a stay at Mercer",5,2023,03,10
15,Mercer Hotel Stay Review,"I can't recommend this hotel enough. I stayed here in August too and I think it might be one of the best experiences I've ever had at a hotel. The food is great at the Tapas restaurant attached and makes for a perfect dinner. The room cleaning is pristine alongside the restocking of the included waters and juices. The rooftop pool and lounge area gives a beautiful view of the city. Lastly, every single member of the staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. They're more than willing to go the extra mile to make your stay in the city memorable whether that includes helping you with transportation or making reservations for dinner or activities. If you are looking for a relaxing, clean, and enjoyable place to stay with beautiful decor and views this is the place!",5,2023,03,06
15,Extraordinary attention to detail!,"From the moment we arrived, we felt like we were in a special place. The hotel's location in the gothic district of Barcelona, the incredibly astute team members who welcomed us and gave us a fabulous hotel overview, the beautiful lobby, the well-appointed rooms, and the thoughtful touches that the room attendants put into their work was truly wonderful. We will be back for sure!",5,2023,02,27
15,The Perfect Hotel,"Me and my 2 daughters stayed 4 nights and love it. The Hotell is in great location and beautiful designed. The breakfast was fantastic and I fell in love with the porcelain. But the very best with this hotel is the staff, amazing people that really makes you feel welcome. And so helpful in every way.
My daughter get fever on checkout day and they were very helpful. 
Thank you for an amazing stay at your hotel.

15,Pros and cons,"The pros.   Great location and good looking property.   The staff was mostly very professional.  Mario was a standout the first weekend although he seemed to not work there during the week.  If I wanted tickets to anything they would be delivered almost immediately.   Terrific service.  

The cons.   The room really was not up to par.  The bathroom was a makeshift area that was no better than an ikea do it yourself.   The lighting was horrible, the floors need to be republished, and the shower never seemed to get hot enough.  Plus the floor of the shower moved a lot and was a lawsuit waiting to happen.

Also, the waitress bar tender tricked us by pushing a more expensive wine on us.  I think her name was marrielle, but I can’t remember.   On the dinner menu, every bottle is about 20+ euro.  We only wanted a glass but she brought a bottle and said it was a great bottle for a great deal.   She said, “I buy it for myself all the time.”   We thought we were getting a glass but she opened the bottle.   When the bill came it was over 60 euro.   My complaint is not the cost, it was the pushiness and the deception.   We looked up the bottle online and it retailed for about $15 euro.  I felt cheated.   The experience took away from the class of the place.  

Would I return?   Probably for the convenience and service, but they have work to do.   ",4,2023,02,19
15,"Great, great, great!","What a fantastic small luxury hotel.  Our travel agent recommended the Mercer as a hotel with a great location and top notch service.  Was she ever right! The hotel is right in the Gothic quarter, nestled amongst  the cool small streets with galleries, cafes and all manner of interesting and strange shops.  The service was outstanding - in particular, Mauro, head of guest services could not have been more helpful, gracious and engaging.  Also, big shoutout to Miriam in the restaurant for being so much fun!  The breakfast is great and the beds were among the most comfortable hotel beds we have ever slept in.  Do yourself a favor and book a room at the Mercer.",5,2023,02,18
15,Excellent Boutique Hotel,"The Mercer is absolutely a class act from beginning to end.  A very impressive stay, and my husband and I stay in hotels constantly for work, so a hotel really has to be excellent to stand out.  The hotel facilitated an early check in, referred to us by name and generally delivered extremely charming and personalised service for us from the moment we arrived.  An excellent tapas restaurant and beautiful rooms makes this such a great place to stay in the old town in Barcelona.  Already looking forward to our return in May.  Thank you again to everyone at the Mercer team who looked after us and made us feel special.  You all are impressively great at what you do!  ",5,2023,02,15
15,Barcelona trip Feb 23,"I cannot recommend this hotel enough, the staff were so helpful and made our special weekend that much better. 
The food at the hotel was amazing, we had dinner and breakfast and both were very tasty. 
The room was very clean and well presented. 
We got engaged this weekend and when the staff found out they went above and beyond. 
Thanks again to the amazing staff.

",5,2023,02,06
15,Everything was amazing,The staff was incredible. The rooms were nice and clean. The location was fantastic. If you visit Barcelona this hotel should not be overlooked. The Mercer Hotel is where I would stay again if I have the opportunity to return to Barcelona. ,5,2023,02,03
15,The Mercer family hotel,Mario is a gentleman and always there in need. Mario recommends the best restaurants and very attention to detail in the Hotel.  A gentleman!!  The staff overall is always pleasant.  Stop by at the bar where the bartenders are wonderful.  Great spot within Barcelona close to it all!! Mercer is a place to stay!!  Clean rooms and lovely people.,5,2023,02,03
15,First Stay but Not the Last,"Great location, and facilities, The rooms were modern and comfortable. And the staff is outstandingly friendly and helpful. Location in the gothic quarter is very convenient and fun. Only challenge to the location is getting a taxi to the hotel but you can easily walk everywhere.",5,2023,01,29
15,"Beautiful hotel, superb location and super helpful staff","Beautiful hotel, combining the old with the new. Superbly situated in the old gothic part of the city, yet very close to all important city jewels and museums. The staff was excellent and very helpful and efficient ",5,2023,01,16

The breakfast was very good and the service was excellent. 

Thank you very much for your help Mauro… He recommended us the best restaurant and places for our activities, which have been memorable on our visit to the city.
",5,2023,01,11
15,Spectacular boutique hotel,"a fabulous boutique hotel tucked in the gothic quarter of barcelona. service was fantastic, breakfast was incredible and the rooms amazing. a little difficult to get to as taxis cannot approach and drop off so it means a little walking. beautiful rooftop and our room had its own beautiful patio. I highly recommend Mercer Hotel Barcelona.",5,2023,01,09
15,A Beautiful Experience,"We stayed at the Mercer around the holidays. It is a visually stunning hotel. Stone walls mixed with moody deep velvet tones throughout. This was our last stop from a 2-week vacation to Spain & France. Our hotel room was bigger than I expected, which was a plus. It was quite luxurious and the bed was very plush and comfortable. We enjoyed delicious lunch and breakfast at the hotel. The staff was extremely professional, polished & friendly. I would recommend consulting with the front desk to schedule any needed taxis as the ones they call are familiar with the tight narrow roads and how to navigate all the way to the front door. All in all, a wonderful stay and we hope to return one day!",5,2023,01,06
15,Wonderful Experience!,"Wonderful experience, modern luxury, personalized service, first class facilities, totally recommended.
Located in the Gothic Quarter, just a few steps from the Cathedral, is this unique 5*GL Boutique hotel.
Elegance and infinite passion for the culture of service.
Special mention for Mr. Mauro! Head Concierge! A true professional and inexhaustible source of knowledge of Barcelona. Thank you very much for all the efforts and wonderful recommendations.
We hope to return as soon as possible.",5,2022,12,01
15,I slept two nights at this hotel.,"What a super experience! The hotel is charming and cosy, and tastefully decorated. The breakfast offerings are great, with fresh bakery every day. The hotel staff went above and beyond to accommodate us, and made our experience incredibly special.",5,2022,11,23
15,Excellent,"I loved the service of the hotel, located in the old part of the city, the silence of the hotel caught my attention to rest and sleep peacefully in a chaotic city, the breakfast was very good, as they say, the quality with the perfect service,Thank you very much for your help Mauro, he recommended us the best restaurants and places for our activities, which have been memorable during our visit to the city",5,2022,11,20
15,Great place to stay in Barcelona,Stylish rooms in the historic setting of a house connecting to the Roman wall. Staff is extremely friendly and helpfull. The location within in the historic Barri Gotic district is fantastic. Great plce to stay in Barcelona.,5,2022,11,19
15,Absolutely mesmerising experience,"What can I say more than that it was absolutely perfect. The level of detail all of the staff put into the stay is truly amazing. We had something to celebrate and the staff went all out to maximise our stay. 

From check in to Mario who was excellent in welcoming us and guiding us. Special mention to the people of the cocktailbar and Bouchon Tapas bar as they were a true complement to our stay. 

The room itself was beautiful and well equipped (best hotel bed and sheets ever). Nice view of the vertical gardens as well. As the weather was still more than ok we enjoyed as well a drink on the private rooftop which gives you relaxing feel. 

Can’t state enough the level of friendliness, kindness and personal detail. It’s a luxury hotel but on a personal scale. If you have something to celebrate or you want to spoil yourself then Mercer Barcelona is the way to go!",5,2022,11,15
15,Lovely Hotel,The Mercer was a lovely place for our business/pleasure stay. The staff was excellent and very helpful. The hotel is a small boutique hotel. It’s quiet and very clean. There are two places to get something to eat…a cute bar and a lovely restaurant. Location was great for us. We walked nearly every place we wanted to go. Highly recommend!,5,2022,11,14
15,Great location and good food,"We love it! Especially the Mercer restaurant, and “Le Bouchon” restaurant.

We stayed at the second floor with a window facing the inside garden. The room has an accessible bathroom which a bit odd, but it is spacious. Location was great - at the heart of the old town and easy to walk to everywhere. Nice services, very responsive and friendly. However one thing can be improved is the soap/shampoo/shower gel selection, it was Molton Brown but feels different from the ones used before, maybe it’s a different formula. The rooftop is absolutely lovely - we worked from hotel for one morning and had coffee & pastry there, it has good WiFi coverage and very quiet. 

Breakfast is a must try, it definitely worth the price (attaching pictures speaks for themselves).

Le bouchon is surprisingly good, we had our first meal in Spain there and set a very high bar. After trying a number of other restaurants in the city, we chose to spend our last meal there before leaving the city.",5,2022,11,13
15,Very nice hotel and friendly staff,"Very nice, small and quiet hotel with friendly staff. Good quality, nice design, peaceful and nice rooftop terrace for relaxing. Food very variable, even if it allways looks good. Perfect coffee and juices, and a plus that the minibar is for free at the room.",5,2022,11,13
15,such an exceptional place,"We had such a lovely 3 day stay. First the design by Rafael Monea- the remodel of this building with Roman roots, is so pleasing to be in,  an oasis.The rooms, the common spaces, and the fixtures all harmonious.  Second, Its location on a quiet street  of the Barrii Gotic was a perfect place from which to explore Barcelona on foot. Third,  the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly. Can't recommend any place more highly ",5,2022,11,11
15,Highly recommend this hotel,A luxury hotel at good value. Service and quality of accomodations was exceptional. Restaurant and food quality were as good as any luxury hotel we have stayed in around the world. We recommend this hotel to anyone looking for the best Barcelona has to offer.,5,2022,11,08
15,An amazing trip,My wife and I stayed for a week at this excellent hotel. Those were pleasant days. The staff is excellent. A special thanks to the concierge Mauro. He is certainly the best concierge in the world.  It was an amazing trip.,5,2022,10,31
15,Bring Earplugs,"The Mercer in Barcelona is in a wonderful location in the Gothic section of the city - the hotel is gorgeous, with incredibly high ceilings, a stunning central courtyard  that serves as a common space with plenty of tables and chairs.  A large number of rooms in the hotel are interior facing, with large windows/doors leading to terraces onto this courtyard.  Staff are very charming and helpful, and the rooms were extremely comfortable.  Also the food is good.  There are even nice little amenities like a complimentary non-alcoholic mini-bar in the rooms and little petit fours at the front desk.

Here's the issue, and the unfortunate reason for a 1 star review:  Staff are completely unwilling to manage the central courtyard space, which acts as an echo chamber that amplifies sound into every room that fronts onto it, and in fact, we received conflicting information from different staff members about how that space is treated.  Some staff members indicated that the courtyard closes at midnight.  Others seems to believe that there were no restrictions.  On our first night at the hotel, we found ourselves in the unfortunate position of being privy to a loud, drunken argument being held by a couple in the courtyard at 1:30 AM.  While the louder female was apologetic, the male was belligerent and aggressive.

The next day, hotel staff seemed bewildered by our complaints, but also eager to find a solution.  Unfortunately, the only other room available had air-conditioning that was malfunctioning, and wifi that didn't seem to have ever been functional, though we were left to find that out for ourselves.  We ended up staying in our original room, secure in the reassurance that the courtyard should have been closed at midnight, that the hotel shouldn't have continued to serve the guests alcohol in the courtyard after midnight, and that this was an aberration.  And sure enough, we had a quiet and restful night's sleep.  

The third night, we were awakened at 3:30 am by another couple having an extremely loud conversation in the courtyard.  Calls to the front desk went unanswered, and unfortunately, I was put in the position of confronting this couple on my own.  And in their defense, there was no oversight from the hotel, no signage for the courtyard doors, and the doors are left open.  So while this couple is most definitely stupid and inconsiderate, they also aren't getting anything in the way of guidance from a hotel that most definitely should be providing it.

The primary purpose of a hotel, especially a hotel of this caliber and at this price point, is to give you a good night's sleep.  The Mercer failed in this regard, failed repeatedly, and there is zero excuse for it.",1,2022,10,13
15,Gem in Barri Gotic,"Lovely oasis with all the modern touches hidden Barcelona's Gothic quarter.  Ideally situated for enjoying the city's history and culture.  It was warm when we were there and the pool on the roof was very welcome.  Lovely garden spot in the center of the hotel for a delightful breakfast; they even have tiny sandwiches prepack for one to take on any rambles.  Concierge was wonderful with recommendations, information.  ",5,2022,09,23
15,A beautiful hotel in the Gothic quarter,"The Mercer is very charming and well located to explore Barcelona. The patio where breakfast was served was lovely and the breakfast was among the best we have had at a European hotel. Special kudos to Bellman Andy, who was so pleasant and helpful.",5,2022,09,18
15,Wonderful hotel in the heart of the gothic district,"We very much loved our stay here. This boutique hotel contains spacious rooms, tummy tapas, cocktails and a cute, albeit shallow, rooftop pool. Its location was everything. We could walk to so many restaurants and attractions.  We will absolutely stay there again. Fingers crossed!",5,2022,09,07
15,Stunning Hotel,"The Mercer in Barcelona is quite the unique hotel experience set within a historic Roman building and renovated meticulously capturing the magic of when modern contemporary design meets historic architecture perfectly. We caught a taxi to the the front door, (through the gothic quarter ) and knew we had found a relaxed yet sophisticated hotel. The Mercer has created nothing short of an oasis seemingly effortlessly. A perfect encapsulation of what is creative and cool with singular attention to detail - beautiful bedding, a stocked bar, coffee machine, modern comfortable furniture, a pool to retreat to on the roof, soft towels in the bathroom all make this truly one of the best hotels I have stayed in. I would highly recommend booking this hotel as it’s truely one of the best hotels to date I have had a vacationed in. Highly recommend, the staff and hotel manager took it to another level. Book if you can secure a room !",5,2022,09,05
15,The absolute best!,"I almost don’t want to tell everyone how good this hotel is so that I can keep it for myself. My husband and I stayed there for our honeymoon. The staff was incredible, hospitable and so accommodating. This truly is the best hotel I have ever stayed at in Barcelona, where I have visited many times. ",5,2022,09,02
15,Amazing hotel and staff in great location in Barcelona.,"An amazing hotel in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona, which was within walking distance to great food venue's as well as many historic landmarks. The staff couldn't do enough for us and nothing was a problem when responding to any of our requests. The rooftop pool and bar was an excellent spot to relax in after a big day of sightseeing and the tapas restaurant served great food and drinks. My wife and I have traveled to many places and countries and have stayed in many hotels and our 3 night experience at the Mercer is up there as being one of the best stays we have had anywhere. Don't waste your time looking anywhere else to stay in Barcelona as I believe you won't find better.",5,2022,08,27
15,Pamela Yao,A wonderfully beautiful and charming property. Amazing service. Very responsive staff. Great restaurant. Great location. Beautiful rooftop pool and bar. I would definitely recommend and would stay here again.,5,2022,08,17
15,Fantastic stay in the Gothic Quarter!,"We looked at a number of high-end hotels before settling on the Mercer and couldn't be happier with the choice.  This tiny, boutique hotel with 28 rooms is an oasis of relaxation and understated style tucked with the ancient walls of this area.  Extraordinary staff and service provided.  Beautiful spaces.  A small rooftop pool patio where we spent hours sipping excellent Spanish rose.  Couldn't have asked for a better place.  ",5,2022,08,16
15,Beautiful Boutique Hotel in the heart of Barcelona,Everything was perfect! Our junior suite was very nice and spacious. The staff was extremely friendly. The location is perfect especially if you would like to explore the city by foot. Maybe the comfort of the bed/mattress could be slightly improved. We will definitely recommend this hotel to our friends.,5,2022,08,07
15,Great botique hotel,"A chic and highend hotel without being tacky. All furniture is well designed and the location and hospitality is warm and welcoming. Rooftop terrace only for hotel guests makes it private and attractive as its not over crowded. Area is interesting with cosy, small tapas places and bars all around.",5,2022,08,01
15,A good hotel let down by its service levels,A well located hotel in the midst of the Gothic quarter with nice rooms albeit poor in terms of natural light.  For those with a discerning eye one will notice wear and tear despite being relatively - showing that whoever picked materials did not think of its longevity.   Overall my main disappointment was the level of service .  We interacted with at least 10 members of staff and 3 of them were excellent but the vast majority seemed a bit lost on the concept of service.  Service is the main criteria that brings you back to a 5 star brand - and in this respect the Mercer has yet a lot to learn.  ,3,2022,08,01
15,The Perfect Stay in Barcelona,"My family and I spent 8 wonderful nights in Barcelona, at the Mercer Hotel. Everything about this property...from the rooms to the rooftop pool, to the food and (most especially) the service is truly incredible. I cannot recommend the Mercer Hotel more...it is a perfect location, within walking distance to most all attractions and transportation. Their concierge, Maulo, is just lovely and so helpful. If you are traveling to Barcelona, either as a family or for business, this is the place to be!",5,2022,07,20
15,Gorgeous hotel tucked away in Gothic Quarter,"We spent 3 nights here. The bed is super comfortable and luxurious and the bathroom is very, very roomy for being in the Gothic Quarter. The staff was fantastic and helpful. And we loved the roof deck, gorgeous views! My only negative would be that the room itself (we were on the 2nd floor, garden facing) could be a little dark as it didn't get a ton of natural light.",5,2022,07,19
15,"Very Good, extraordinary design and breakfast","Very nice rooms, high ceilings, great concierge and service, super friendly. Outstanding breakfast!!! Nice bar, just a very good experience and good location in old town. Beautiful pool and all of it very luxurous",5,2022,07,13
15,Excellent hotel; lovely people; great location.,"We loved our stay at the Mercer.  In a beautifully restored / repurposed building dating to the Roman times in the very heart of the Gothic quarter.   Oozing with charm and character  matched only by the wonderfully helpful, thoughtful staff.  Will stay her again without hesitation.  ",5,2022,07,12
15,Overall good.,"Overall the hotel experience was good. The hotel is pretty with a nicely done restoration job. Inside the hotel it is calm, welcoming. The patio and bar are quite nice and enjoyable. I did not give it a 5 rating as there are a few things I did not like/could be improved, specially for the price we paid: the entrance black carpet is very stained, it should be either cleaned or replaced as it gives a poor impression, breakfast is overall nice but too slow and coffee was always cold by the time it reached the table, room services…. We had to order water several times as they kept forgetting … the staff that serves room needs such as replenishing the water or proving and iron is slow and not friendly, last the Gothic Quarter which is where the hotel is located is very dirty. The hotel should at least invest in keeping the streets around its entrance clean…!",4,2022,07,10
15,4 Days in Barcelona,Conveniently located to all Old Town sights.  Friendly and helpful staff. Travelled with two teenage daughters that loved it.  Made special memories.   Hope to be back soon. Thin floor meant the room could be a little noisy at night.  ,5,2022,07,09
15,Winderful Experience,"Really enjoyed a 4 night stay at the Mercer, all aspects of our stay were exceptional. Excellent location, brilliant staff. Modern but very tasteful design. Rooftop pool area is a real treat and exclusive to inhouse guests. We return.",5,2022,07,04
15,Summer 2022,"This is our second stay with Mercer in the last 2 years, and each time we’ve found our experience to be exemplary. While the location, cleanliness and accommodations are great, it is the personnel and staff that make a huge difference. So long as they continue to maintain the level of professionalism, care and congeniality, we will continue to make the Mercer our principal choice for accommodations in Barcelona. Merci…",5,2022,07,03
15,Sophisticated Luxury in the Gothic Qtr.,"The Hotel staff was amazing. After a short time, Florencia, Made us feel so welcome.
The hotel is in a great location, away from crowds and close to the Key parts of the Gothic section.
Comfortable room.
We enjoyed the roof, pool deck and Le Bouchon",5,2022,07,03
15,Gracious Old-World Hotel,"From the moment we stepped into the hotel, we were treated like honored guests. Our every need was attended to by the thoughtful staff. Mauro Torres, the concierge, was particularly helpful in arranging for our fabulous guide, Carmen Salvador. He also provided us with wonderful restaurant reservations. Each morning the delicious breakfast full of homemade delights on the patio got our day off to the perfect start. We will definitely return to Barcelona and to the Hotel Mercer.",5,2022,06,29
15,Beautiful Location and Excellent Staff,The hotel was very beautiful is perfectly located in the Gothic quarters. Not too far from the city nightlife and not too close either. The staff at the hotel were very accomadating and made the stay at Mercer even better. Always smiling and looking to assist with the smallest things. I definitely will be staying there for the next time I'm in Barcelona,5,2022,06,29
15,…,"
Overall the hotel was very good and I. A very central and historical part of town. As for value I’m not sure it was worth it’s nightly rate. The tapas in the  attached bar was mediocre at best,     Overall the stay was ok……",4,2022,06,28
15,Wonderful staff and Beautiful Setting,The staff is professional and knowledgeable. The breakfast is delicious and the seating in the courtyard made the start of day special. Our concern over our first room was quickly addressed and we were upgraded to a very nice room. One feedback we would like to offer is that there were a few areas in the first room that need attention by maintenance and management. Possibly a remodel to update the usual wear and tear of use. Our second room was lovely. Nice location. We enjoyed our stay and especially the staff.,4,2022,06,24
15,June trip to Barcelona,"great hotel, extremely great staff and service.  very clean.
the neighborhood is bad.  homeless people right outside the door of hotel. graffiti everywhere. smell of garbage and worse.
the food was almost not edible.",3,2022,06,22

Pleasant. The Tapas restaurant was great and has delicious food. Rooms were comfortable and included complimentary water and sodas. Beds were very comfortable as well. Great stay overall.",5,2022,06,21
15,Can’t wait to return!,"Everything about this hotel is thoroughly enjoyable! Wonderful location tucked away on a quiet alley in the charming Gothic Corner, convenient walk to everywhere.  Exceptional service, both with pre-visit planning and in person during our stay.  Beautiful room and modern fantastic bathroom.  Wonderfully comfortable bed.  Lovely little interior garden, for breakfast, afternoon cocktails or late night hanging out.  Beautiful roof terrace with a quiet bar and small pool.   Truly this hotel has it all. We can’t wait to return!",5,2022,06,17
15,Beautiful,"Beautiful room with very comfortable bed and updated bathroom, excellent food, terrific staff, lovely pool terrace, and wonderful location in Gothic quarter.  My only negative was the pool requiring chemicals and not as clear as our pool at home.  Otherwise, highly recommended.",5,2022,06,16
15,Perfection,"A very special and beautiful hotel. Sophisticated but relaxed and welcoming. The staff was amazing; attentive but not intrusive. The location feels private and tucked away but step outside and you’re well situated to explore Barcelona. Loved it and hope to be back someday!

15,"Lovely hotel, exceptional service, great location","Loved this hotel - in the Gothic Quarter easy walk to many sights.  Staff above and beyond, both restaurants were exceptional, and the lovely bar, rooftop pool, garden made it all very special.  highly recommended.",5,2022,06,08
15,Gem in the Gothic quarter,We loved this boutique hotel. It was located “off the beaten path” in a lovely part of town. We were treated like family whenever we left and returned by the warm and friendly concierge. Great breakfast served by hard working staff who remembered us each time we arrived. ,5,2022,06,01
15,Great Barcelona Getaway,"Our first time in Barcelona. Stayed at Mercer Hotel due to its location within the Gothic Quarter. It did not disappoint. Great location. Beware though that getting taxis for either drop-off or pickup at the hotel is close to impossible due to how narrow the surrounding alleys are. A bellman was always happily available to walk with us to the next larger street to fetch a cab when needed (we mostly walked anyway). Pool Roof Deck is quaint and offers relaxation after a busy day of exploring. We walked to Segrada Familia, Park Guell and all the other sites. One night we dined at Cocina Hermanos Torres which was absolutely amazing (made the reservations several months in advance). Overall would stay at Mercer again. Service was attentive and due to the size of the hotel (28 rooms we were told) always ready to focus on you.  ",5,2022,05,30
15,A bit hit and miss,"Visited for a short break as part of our honeymoon in March. A beautiful building and most staff very nice. There were issues with the first room (wifi not working) and totally unexpectedly we were offered a new room, which we took. There were then further issues with breakfast including a very rude member of staff that told us we didn’t have it included (when we did) and deliveries to the room that weren’t for us. Mistakes that you wouldn’t expect in this standard of hotel. The staff were very apologetic and did their best to make up for all the mix ups. There was a very large protest close to the hotel the day of our departure and we very nearly missed our flight due to the transfer car not being able to get through. The transfer was arranged by the hotel so I did feel like they could have allowed more time as they seemed to know the protest was happening. Overall a pleasant stay, but unfortunately memorable for the wrong reasons.",4,2022,05,29
15,Beautiful Intimate Hotel,"This boutique hotel on a small street in the Gothic area Is quiet, away from the tourist rush and oh so welcoming. The Roman walls add a special ambiance to go with the superb service. The rooms were modern and well appointed. The breakfast area was particularly inviting. The whole staff went out of their way to satisfy our every need. This made our stay very special.",5,2022,05,29
15,Extraordinary Hospitality,"Staff was professional, amazing service from check-in to check-out. I especially enjoyed the turn-down service and truffles. I would definitely return to The Mercer Barcelona. Thank you for an experience ",5,2022,05,27
15,Highly Recommend,"The staff went above and beyond to assist with our experience in Barcelona. It was our first trip to the city and they walked us through the best locations and how to get to and from there. Scheduled our taxis to and from the hotel and have fantastic reservations!!

Highly recommend!!",5,2022,05,27
15,Very nice hotel,"The hotel is very cozy and beautiful building. The service by the hotel members was so nice that we felt very comfortable. Most importantly, the breakfast was amazing. The furnitures were very beautiful as well ",5,2022,05,24
15,Hasn’t skipped a beat!,"This was our first time back since COVID, and it was great! Same attention to detail. Same amazing team. Interestingly, they were fully staffed. It seems like everyone is deeply understaffed these days (at least in the U.S.).

I had botched some rather complex transport logistics, and the concierge crew managed to solve everything at the last minute. Well done, and thank you again!

The food here is out of this world.",5,2022,05,24
15,Awesome hotel,Absolutely faultless. The room was beautiful and spotlessly clean. All staff friendly and super attentive. The food in both the bar area and the restaurant was incredible. We loved our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel,5,2022,05,21
15,Excellence in Barcelona,The Mercer Hotel is a wonderful oasis in the heart of the Gothic quarter in Barcelona. Just steps from the centre of town and great for exploring the wynds and alleys of the old town. Lovely local bars and tapas restaurants are a few minutes walk. The staff were fabulous and made our stay complete.,5,2022,05,02
15,Quietly elegant hotel in the bustling city,"The Mercer Hotel was a welcome respite to our busy days (and nights) exploring Barcelona. The attention to providing an excellent experience was evident in every interaction with the staff. We were greeted with cava and small pastries when we arrived, and our luggage quickly taken out of our hands, making check-in a breeze. Unlike many hotels where you are given a key card and vague directions, we were escorted to our room and shown all the amenities. 

All requests were taken care of with courtesy and efficiency...things like printing travel documents for return to US, arranging transport, restaurant reservations....all were effortless and absolutely done to perfection. 

We stayed in two rooms at the Mercer...for our first stay we had the junior suite for four nights, and then on our return to Barcelona from wine country we stayed in a superior room for one night. Both were lovely, though obviously the junior suite was larger and therefore more comfortable...but for a short stay the smaller rooms are more than adequate. 

One of my favorite things about this hotel (aside from the excellent and attentive staff) was how quiet it was. I rarely heard anyone in the hallways and the sounds of the busy Gothic Quarter melted away the moment we walked through the doors...the whole experience was so relaxing and comfortable...would definitely stay here again! 

We didn't eat at the restaurant, but we did have a few meals from the small tavern (try the tomato bread!) and the breakfasts were fantastic..wish I knew how they got their omelettes so fluffy! 

We also utilized the private transfer which I am SO GLAD we did. After a very long travel day from California, it was lovely to arrive to a waiting car...definitely worth the extra cost (though I think if you book one of the larger rooms, it may include transfer). 

Overall, this hotel was simply wonderful in all regards. If I am ever in Barcelona again, I will definitely visit them again!",5,2022,04,26
15,Great to be back,"Perfect venue to experience Barcelona, staff always very accommodating and look forward to the next time. Enjoyed the Signature bar and ate once in the Restaurant and it was superb but lots of dining and bar options around",5,2022,04,26
15,My Stay At Mercer Barcelona,AT the suggestion of my friend that lives in Barcelona I stayed at the Mercer and it lived up to all the positive accolades my friend gave me. The staff is extremely nice and always helpful in anyway. Their suggestions on restaurants outside the hotel were perfect and the food at the hotel VERY good.  The hotel itself is beautiful and rich in history and ideally located. I highly recomend!!!,5,2022,04,21
15,Best hotel staff ever,"There are a number of reasons to stay at the Mercer. I'll start with the staff. They were incredible, just a very helpful, warm, engaging group of people. They are impeccably trained and it shows. The hotel is small so after a few days you all come to know each other which creates a really positive vibe throughout the hotel.

The hotel itself is very well located, a quick walk down to the marina/beach area, an equally quick walk to Las Ramblas and all the activities around it. Even when it was a busy day as we moved closer back to the hotel it got quieter and more restful which we appreciated. We stayed in the premier junior suite and the space was very big by European standards with a large bedroom, large bathroom and an absolutely huge private deck. It's definitely a special room, a little oasis in the city. 

I'm hopeful we'll be back someday.",5,2022,04,15
15,Gem tucked away,The Mercer was a luxurious respite in the charming Gothic quarter. The service was excellent and I loved my room. Lobby was chic and rooftop was one of a kind. Price felt so reasonable for such a quality experience. Would go back!,5,2022,04,13
15,5 Star experience,"Mercer is one of the top boutique hotels I’ve stayed at. Located in the gothic quarter of Barcelona, it is encased in history. The rooms are beautifully appointed with all the comfort and amenities you’ll need for a comfortable stay. The staff are wonderfully friendly and eager to assist with any request, nothing was difficult. We were able to book multiple excursions through the hotel. 
The mercer is a wonderful walk from the beach which offer a myriad of eating places. Great shops, museums, galleries  and historical sites all in walking distance. 
Will definitely be back.",5,2022,04,13
15,Magnificent stay,"The hotel is cute and modern, rooms are comfortable specially the bed. Location is fantastic! exactly in the middle of all the top attractions and the service provided by the chief concierge Mauro Torres is magnificent. He helped us with reservations in the most trendy and modern restaurants and bars of this city, we want to thank him to made us our stay memorable. We will be back!",5,2022,04,12
15,Boutique hotel with best location,"This boutique hotel is simply the best in Barcelona.  We stayed here for 3 days and wished we could stay more. Located in the hart of the Gothic district, you will be close to everything from this place. Concierge, and hotel staff were excellent and helpful. We got VIP treatment every day. A must stay for any couple or friends.",5,2022,04,10
15,Exceptional in every way,"This hotel, the location, the staff and service have been absolutely sensational. 

From the beautiful character of the hotel in the Gothic district, to the comfort of the room, and the extremely helpful staff, we could not have asked for a better experience. In particular, the Sommelier, Lluis, made our stay so memorable. His knowledge of wine and food, and his approachability and generosity of time  made the whole experience unforgettable. Thank you.",5,2022,04,01
15,One of the best!!!,"There are so many compliments I could give this beautiful hotel located in the old city of Barcelona. The location is superb, the staff is impeccable in all areas of hospitality, and the food is a culinary delight. If I could give the hotel a rating between 0 and 10, it would be an easy 11! Many wonderful memories..",5,2022,03,25
15,Wonderful hotel,"A great hotel, perfectly situated for sightseeing, with the nicest staff of any hotel I have ever stayed in!  They went out of their way to help with anything and everything and were so warm and friendly. Breakfast was excellent too, well worth paying for it to be included. A really wonderful hotel all round, just be aware there is no vehicle access but it is only a short walk ",5,2022,03,22

15,Great experience!,"The staff at the Mercer Hotel Barcelona were incredibly friendly and helpful in every way!  The location and quality of the room were great.  We were in Barcelona for only a few days, and staying at this hotel really added to our short, but special experience.  I would definitely go back!",5,2022,03,13
15,Service and Serenity,"This impressive, historic property is incredible on its own in an ideal location, but the service of the Mercer is the real standout. Champagne upon arrival, complimentary in-room beverages restocked daily, kind and accommodating staff who will walk with you if you’re not sure of directions, and much more create a remarkable experience. ",5,2022,03,13
15,A haven in the Gothic Quarter,"From the moment I walked into the Mercer I felt at home; the service, the attention to detail, to luxurious but welcoming decor, the food,, the drink.  All impeccable.  The location is superb, and surprisingly quiet at night.",5,2022,03,12
15,Four Days in Barcelona,Spent four days at the Mercer in early March (2-5th).  All staff were very professional and friendly throughout our stay.  We had breakfast three days and dinner one night in the hotel.  Food quality and service were again excellent.  The concierge Mauro(?) was extremely helpful with all aspects of stay and made great dinner recommendations and reservations outside of the hotel.  ,5,2022,03,07
15,Best hotel in Barcelona,"So far the best hotel where I've stayed. I would even say it's in my Top 3 hotels in Barcelona. I love the way it's beautifully designed, the location? the best. The staff is awesome,always making sure that you feel like home, specially Mauro who is incredibly friendly. The attention they give to their guests is literally perfect, I honestly felt really comfortable. If i could live there for the rest of my life, I would. When I return to Barcelona, I will stay there for sure. ",5,2022,03,06
15,"Awesome staff, beautiful historic building, fantastic location, glorious food and drink","The Mercer is a magical building, restored with immaculate attention to detail, a marvellous space to be in with fantastic catering from breakfast, to tapas, to evening cocktails. A special shout out to the staff - they are professional and attentive, but so much more - with them, its personal, getting everything right for us, going the extra mile and making us feel at home and one of the family. We'll be back as soon as I can. Thanks so much.",5,2022,02,24
15,Amazing hotel in the perfect location,"The Mercer is definitely one of my favourite hotels in the world. Beautifully and sympathetically designed, a perfect mix of old and new. Loads of character and a staff that is second to none, in particular Maria who is just amazing.",5,2022,02,24
15,A gem in Barcelona,"This was our first stay in this hotel.
A very quiet hotel, only 28 rooms. Perfect service, fantastic staff!
Very nice restaurant and bar. Had the best Vodka Martini ever!
The atmospehre in this historic building is outstanding. We will return for sure.",5,2022,02,13
15,Simply amazing ,"We stayed at this beautiful hotel during a short break in Barcelona. We wanted a Hotel that captured the history of Barcelona, set within walking distance to all the attractions and boutique and family oriented….we couldn’t have picked a better hotel

The staff are incredible, the details such as the little snacks pre wrapped for your day trips, the drinks and canapés as you arrive and the beautiful roof top pool make such a difference. The breakfast is probably one of the best we’ve had in a city hotel…ever!

You won’t find a better hotel in Barcelona ",5,2022,01,14
15,No value for money,"If you ask 500 euros per night you have to make sure that all aspects of the hotel are at five star level, and that was not the case.

We have already stayed in other five star hotels in London (Connaught and Langham), Paris (Le Meurice), Denmark (Nimb), Sweden (Grand Hotel), and they are of a higher standard.

Especially the level of the food/kitchen was disappointing..and also little atmosphere in the hotel. We also missed flowers in the hallway.

And there were also some comments about the room (moisture stains on the floor and wall near the bath + peeling paint) and noisy fridge for example.",3,2022,01,07
15,A beautiful hotel,"We stayed at the Mercer for two nights during the holidays. The hotel is beautiful, centrally located and the staff was superb! Sergio and Maria were attentive, kind and always willing to help. Thank you!",5,2022,01,05
15,Excellent Stay at a World-Class Hotel,"I am finally getting around to writing this review, but we just recently returned from a 5 night stay at the Mercer Barcelona. It was our family’s first trip to Barcelona and I spent a lot of time looking at different hotel options. We were very happy with our decision to stay at Mercer Barcelona. The location was fantastic for sight-seeing but also secluded enough to feel like the room was a wonderful quiet sanctuary. The breakfast was excellent - we really enjoyed the options. The service at the hotel was also just top notch. By way of example, I somehow jammed a zipper on my coat with my cell phone and glasses conveniently locked inside of the pocket. After many of my own attempts to fix the problem without damaging my coat, the hotel manager noticed I was having an issue and took my coat and had it fixed with no hassle - just fantastic service in my mind. The concierge also made excellent restaurant recommendations that we booked in advance - important feature for a foodie family. The hotel arranged in room covid tests for our return - absolutely no problem at all. I would not hesitate to return to this hotel and would recommend to anyone looking for a luxury boutique hotel in Barcelona.",5,2022,01,02
15,Unforgettable stay!,"My husband and I recently had a wonderful four night stay at the Mercer Hotel in Barcelona.  We were celebrating my husband's 60th birthday and we wanted to stay in a memorable hotel.  We were not disappointed.  From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel welcome from the fresh juice to being able to check into our room early.  Our junior suite (Room 304) was spacious with three windows that opened onto a beautiful interior courtyard.  Our room had a sitting area with a couch, chair and small table and spacious bathroom with large oval tube and glass shower.  The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable and the room quiet.  We had the ample breakfast every morning in the dining room and barely needed to eat any lunch.

As great as the hotel was, it was the service that made the Mercer stand apart from other five star hotels.  The concierges - Sergio and Maria - could not do enough for us.  They were always available to offer restaurant suggestions, order taxis and they even surprised us with a bottle of cava and small cake on my husband's actual birthday.  The breakfast staff was lovely as was the doorman, Andreas, who was willing to help in any way possible.

The Gothic Quarter was a fantastic place to stay and you could walk to numerous museums, churches and throngs of restaurants.  One of our favorite museums was the Barcelona History Museum (MUHBA) and one of our favorite restaurants was the nearby El Salon.  We were there in December so the St. Lucia Christmas market was a pleasure to wander through.

I highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for an unforgettable stay in Barcelona.  I hope to return again soon.",5,2021,12,06
15,All about the service,"This is physically a truly spectacular hotel -- the photos and descriptions here and elsewhere are completely accurate.  I'd also add that the hotel is QUIET -- despite being in the middle of a touristy part of Barcelona.  What was most exceptional for us, though, was the service: we felt like the entire staff was genuinely happy to see us and personally invested in making sure we were well taken care of and getting the most out of our trip.  (Can't overstate this; only once before -- in Paris decades ago -- have we experienced this level of service at a hotel.  Maybe it's a European thing, but as Americans, it was touching and VERY much appreciated to be taken care of this way.)  Special kudos go to Joan the concierge ... who exemplifed the gold keys he wears on his lapel. Our trip would have been much less memorable without him.",5,2021,11,24
15,More than excellent,"We stayed 3 nights and 4 days in the Barcelona. It was not our first time in the city and although we always stay in small  luxury hotels, this little gem of a hotel out won them all. The situation between the ancient walls, the beautiful architecture and meticulous planning is stunningly elegant and fuss free. I am an interior decorator and could well appreciate the fine tuning  and luxurious detailing, Everything about this small hotels says sophistication and comfort.
We stayed in a deluxe room which was very spacious and filled with every amenity to make us feel welcome and comfortable. the terrace on the roof is an excellent place to relax after a long day in the city.
but above all I would like to praise the flawless service which we received from Joan Maner the director and his wonderful team who waited on our every request or question.
We travel a lot and are used to great hotels but it is not every day that one comes across wonderful service that doesn't impose itself. Here we met this rare commodity and it made our stay (especially in this strange Covid 19 days), a unique experience. we would definitely  return here on our next trip to Barcelona",5,2021,09,19
15,A Perfect Stay in Barcelona!,"My wife, Christine, booked this hotel for four nights as the starting point for our European trip. We could not have been happier with the quality of service we received. Every question and need we had was eagerly addressed. Upon arrival, the manager, Joan Manel, greeted us and made sure we were comfortable. His and his team’s ability to help us with every detail, but also give us our space to relax, was absolutely top notch.  Their restaurant recommendations were on point.

The breakfasts were high quality, with plenty of options, and served with a smile. The standard room we had was very spacious, with extra high ceilings and ceiling to floor windows. The bed was very comfortable and helped us with our jet lag transition.

We found the location in the Gothic Quarter perfect - walking distance to the best restaurants and sites, but also tucked into the history of the city.

If you’re planning a trip to Barcelona, don’t think twice about booking at the Mercer! Everything from the top down is high quality!",5,2021,09,08
15,Unforgettable experience!,"We had the absolute best time in this beautiful gem of a hotel located in historical Barri Gotic. There was absolutely nothing to even mention that was not perfect. Beautifullly designed hotel with a spacious room, great beds, Molton Brown toiletries, a pool on the rooftop and the most friendly staff you can imagine. ",5,2021,08,17
15,Only place I would stay in Barcelona,I have been lucky to stay at some of the best hotels in the world. I prefer small boutique hotels when possible. This one is a gem. The service is on par with any five star hotel. Location couldnt be better for wandering the city. ,5,2021,08,04
15,A gem in the heart of Barcelona Old Town,"The Mercer Hotel is exactly what you want, if you are looking for a luxurious, calm, peaceful yet central stay in Barcelona.

The beds are crazy comfortable. We haven‘t slept that well in quite some time. So was the whole roome. The staff is very friendly and helpful. What excited us the most, was the roof terrace with the pool. No, it does not have a Olympic size, but it‘s perfect to cool down during summertime.

We have been to BCN several times and have seen almost everything, you should see, when you‘re there for a city trip. However, having stayed at the Mercer Hotel for the first time added additional value to our trip. I mean, we were having drinks in a pool right above the busy Via Laietana, just to hit said road in a glimpse again. That was quite cool.

Would totally recommend the Mercer Hotel to friends and family.",5,2021,08,02
15,What a gem!,"Just had a 5 day stay for the first time at Mercer. The experience starts already at the front door with the welcome that you get from a super friendly, helpful and highly professional team. The room was so nice, the rooftop with deck chairs + a pool + a bar is awesome and the dining facilities are really cozy as well. It’s an oasis of tranquility and sets a very high bar. Definitely coming back and a new obvious place to stay when in Barcelona. ",5,2021,07,28
15,Definitely a favourite!,"This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in so far! Such an incredible stay and would definitely come back.
From the moment of contact  with the hotel and right through our entire trip everything was excellent.  The hotel itself is luxurious with such a fantastic wow factor!  The rooms are spacious and in top order - very very comfortable and peaceful and clean. The terrace is beautiful, has great style and is private.  The food is a treat and the service is incredible. The friendliness and exceptional service from the team keeps me smiling, even now! The Hotel Mercer Team have been excellent  and very accommodating. Special thanks to Joan and Simona for being so brilliant with everything. Only positive things to say about our stay here.  Look forward to staying here again and recommend this 100%. Thank you Mercer Barcelona team for help making our stay so fantastic!",5,2021,07,20
15,OUTSTANDING HOTEL AND SERVICE!!!!,"The hotel is absolutely beautiful however the service is unparalleled. Simona and Xenia along with all of the attentive staff made us feel so welcome, like family.

The breakfast is absolutely fantastic. The mattress and sheets and towels are luxurious. We look forward to returning, we wouldn't stay anywhere else.

Thank you Hotel Mercer!

The Price Family",5,2021,06,21
15,Top service,"Immediately upon entering you understand the space is a special one. The service is top notch. Elegant, personal and professional. 
The rooms are minimal and elegant but the bed is the best sleep I’ve had in years. 
The only reason for my 4 stars is that for the price, the hotel lacks in amenities on its premises for example spa, private pool (not one exposed on the rooftop next to bar) or gym. 
Otherwise, a very special experience indeed.",4,2021,05,23
15,Outstanding Boutique Hotel,"We chose this hotel for our first trip in more than a year due to Covid restrictions, we were lucky because our stay was fantastic. The hotel architecture is very nice, build in the historical Roman part of the city center.

More than the hotel the staff has been more than nice with us and very professional.

The hotel food is unbelievably good, we tried Le Bouchon and the Mercer restaurant for diners, both were delicious. We'd highly recommend trying the Mercer, it is probably the best food i've ever had in Barcelona.
We had the pleasure to talk to the chef Xavier Lahuerta who is passionate about Spanish gastronomy and local products. 
Besides that the breakfasts are amazings with home made breads, pastries, jams,.. its worth going there only to have breakfast.",5,2021,05,03
15,My Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"Beautiful boutique hotel in the old gothic part of the city. The staff from the very first treated you like family and made you fell that nothing was too much trouble. They put the extra touch to make you feel part of the family and special. 
The rooms were comfortable and beautifully designed and clean. The maid service was in top form. 
The breakfast was amazing. We had dinner there as well and had one of our nicest meals in the city. 
I highly recommend it.  ",5,2020,04,14
15,A Perfect Stay!,"I wish Barcelona for everyone.. And with that, I will always recommend the Mercer Hotel Barcelona. My stay was perfect. Thank you for the warm welcome, the beautiful atmosphere, the inspiring conversations, and for genuinely having my best interests at heart. Truly, Thank You. xo! Nicole",5,2020,03,26
15,Holidays in Barcelona,Nice hotel in historical centre of Barcelona. Very suitable for walks and tourist walking tours.Real atmosphere of history of the city. Many interesting  places around and small shops with stuff for tourists. A lot of good cafes and restaurants in a close destination,4,2020,02,28
15,Maria from Sweden,"Wonderful hotel with excellent service! By far one of our best hotelexperiences ever. The staff was welcoming and serviceminded at all times. Beautiful rooms, clean and comfortable. Amazing breakfast. This charming hotel is perfectly located with walking distance to restaurants, shopping and the water. We are definetly coming back!",5,2020,02,26
15,Barcelona at its best,"There are certainly other great hotels in a city like Barcelona, but the Mercer is without any doubt a class apart. The staff members at all levels are highly professional and friendly as can be, exceeding our high expectations; the location in the Gothic District is ideal (the Picasso museum is around the corner), and the gorgeous building is a protected city monument; the tasteful decoration combines perfectly with the old stones, and there is an island of serenity on the roof terrace - to the extent that we found it hard to leave the hotel to dine or make visits. I can only recommend the hotel very highly.",5,2020,02,24
15,The Mercer is a Gem in Gothic Quarter,"My daughter and I booked four nights at The Mercer hotel, based on internet reviews, location, and the desire to have a unique stay for her first visit to the city.  The charming location delivered perfectly.  We enjoyed a lovely stay at the Mercer, which each night was we returned to the oasis from our days touring the city.  The hotel is a beautifully designed within the centuries old space mixing old and new.  Having booked directly on their website, due to the availability, on our arrival we were upgraded rooms to a lovely junior suite which was quite roomy, and extremely comfortable.  We enjoyed the interior courtyard with window/doors opening into within.  The hotel was very calm, peaceful and quiet.  The staff on arrival, departure, and during each portion of our stay were extremely attentive, and lovely to speak with.  Both the casual tapas space, and more fine dining room were of the best food quality we had over our four day visit.  Would return.  ",5,2020,02,21
15,Little Gem on the Edge of the Gothic Quarter,"Fabulous hotel and staff couldn’t have been more helpful or friendly. Boutique style, nice bar and adjacent tapas restaurant, lots to do and see within walking distance. Fantastic tapas and pinxos bars everywhere you look, and higher end restaurants as well.",5,2020,02,18
15,Excellent Location and Staff,"Above all else the staff was excellent.  Attentive, friendly and helpful at all levels from start to finish.  The Mercer is in a perfect, tucked away location in the Gothic Quarter.  The property is lovely.  We stayed in a Junior Suite room, which was spacious and had large comfortable bed.  It overlooked the interior courtyard, which keep the room very quiet and dark once the wooden shutters were closed.  We also enjoyed the rooftop terrace as we happened to have a sunny and warm winter days.",5,2020,02,15
15,Exceptional Weekend.,"My wife and me spent a weekend in Barcelona and stayed at the Mercer Hotel.
As I am an airline pilot, I know some really nice hotels all over Europe.
I must say, that the Mercer is one of the best hotels I´ve ever been to.
The kindness of the staff is absolutely outstanding. They really treat you as a highly welcomed guest.
The house itself is perfectly located in the gothic quarter. Just a few steps away from major sightseeing spots. Some really nice Tapas Bars and Restaurants are just around the corner.
I read the other comments about the rooms lighting concept. The hotel is in a really old building in a very narrow street. These buildings didn´t have large windows at that time. And that was for a good reason. We found the room lit properly. Who would stay in his room at daylight in a wonderful city like Barcelona anyway ;-)
I would stay at Mercers again, no doubt. Thanks again for the perfect weekend.",5,2020,02,02
15,excellent!!,"Satisfied in all respects. All staff members were very friendly and helpful, the room is clean and cozy. 
And excellent location. Convenient to go anywhere.
Everyone should go to Mercer Hotel Barcelona !!",5,2020,01,26
15,Organized and beautiful,"For a weekend we stopped over in Barcelona. This hotel is located in Got quarter. With a nice historic building. staff is well trained, rooms are clean and the bathrooms are equipped with all that you need.",5,2020,01,17
15,"Great location, helpful staff, spacious rooms","Fantastic location in the Gothic quarter, discreet and quiet hotel, spacious rooms, prompt action taken by staff when we mentioned showers were cold, nice toiletries and excellent, friendly and knowledgeable staff.",5,2020,01,04
15,wonderful romantic weekend,"We had a wonderful weekend at Mercer Hotel, organised as a surprise for my girlfriend and with full cooperation of the staff to make this an unforgettable experience. It comes at a price but the service is perfect.",5,2019,12,22
15,Nice hotel well managed,Very nice and new hotel. Food quality very good but breakfast too expensive. Staff at every level very very good. I think the room should have a separate zone from the shower to the bathroom both for privacy and to permit a comfortable sleep.,4,2019,12,22
15,Perfect hotel,"The hotel is stunning, with modern amenities and rooms in an ancient building on a charming little street in the oldest part of the city. The food in the restaurants is excellent; you would be missing out if you don’t eat there. And the staff was so friendly and helpful. Really, we couldn’t have had a better experience at this hotel, and we highly recommend it.",5,2019,12,19
15,Small bedroom but cosy,"very class Hotel and huge walk entrance, staff were very nice and welcoming. Sweets always present :) Swimming pool and bar at the discretion to the traveler.A swimming pool was also available on the highest floor.
Barcelona was a great Stay to be in.
",4,2019,12,10
15,What a treasure!,"Our stay during Thanksgiving Week was simply spectacular.  We loved the small boutique hotel hidden in on a small street. Every single interaction with the staff was genuine and pleasant, from requests for warm milk to booking reservations at hard-to-get restaurants to suggestions for local patisseries. We will certainly be back! ",5,2019,12,02
15,Winter Family Vacation,"Excellent staff, very friendly and helpful, hotel is beautiful, in the center of the gothic quarter, net to metro and major streets, restaurants, bars and shopping. Free soft drinks greatly appreciated!",5,2019,12,02
15,November 2019,"This hotel will go down as one of my favorites of all time. We took a cab to the hotel and when we were dropped off it seemed scary at first glance. But we got out in a community party and all the locals were so helpful to find the entrance. The location could not have been better, access to all the main sites and restaurants. The hotel was safe, quiet and breakfast was my favorite ever(included). The bar and staff were amazing and i wish i could go back every year to this boutique hotel. This hotel is by far my top 3 hotels in the world i have stayed at.",5,2019,11,27
15,Incredible staff; Rooms could use freshening up,"4.5 stars. The incredible staff at the Mercer was accommodating, friendly, helpful and overall fun to deal with.  The attached tapas restaurant was great (both food and staff).  The location of the hotel is absolutely ideal. Right by the cathedral, less than a 10 minute walk to Las Ramblas and 5 minutes to the metro.  All the alleys of the gothic quarter have great ambience and plenty of good restaurants. I would give this hotel 5 stars if it weren't for the room itself.  We were in a junior suite which was a great space, quiet and very modern.  Lighting however was not ideal. Also, several pieces of furniture had chips, the wallpaper was peeling in spots and the paint was stained in some areas.  Nothing a coat of paint and some updated furniture couldn't fix, but for the price I wouldn't expect any of these issues.  Overall, great place.",4,2019,11,22
15,Gothic quarter gem.,As the result of a 20k race through the downtown we had to walk a couple of blocks to the hotel.  A staff person heard our trundling suitcases and hurried town the street to meet us and help with the luggage.  That was a great first impression.  The hotel sits on a narrow street  (taxis come and go)  with a beautiful stone facade.  It is a great walking area with many restaurants to  choose from.  Check-in was quick and we were off to our room all the while getting a commentary on information related to the hotel's services.  Our room was modern with a a wall to wall glass view of a stone and ivy inner courtyard.  Breakfast had hot choices to go with fresh fruit and bakery items.  We would definitely return here on our next visit.,5,2019,11,20
15,Amazing Staff!,"Beautiful property and great location, but the staff was phenomenal! Very attentive and warm and friendly. The location was well maintained and the room was spacious. I would love to come back here again or stay at another one of the properties they own.",5,2019,11,20
15,I LOVE Hotel Mercer,"What else can I say, 10s all across the board. Perfection!!  Staff - friendly, welcoming, professional.  Decor- sublime.  The food !!!! Fantastic!!!  From now on I will only stay at the Hotel Mercer when I visit Barcelona ",5,2019,11,15
15,Outstanding Boutique Hotel,"We were only in Barcelona for a weekend and were looking for somewhat relatively central to stay to see the sights in a small amount of time. We settled on the Mercer Hotel in the Gothic Quarter, and could not have been more pleased by our choice. The location is great, the staff is friendly and welcoming, the hotel and rooms are lovely. The  rooftop terrace and pool are beautiful with great views over the city. I will be staying here again the next time we're in the city.",5,2019,11,13
15,Barcelona for the win!!!!,"I ended a 3 week European vacation in Barcelona and stayed at the Mercer Hotel.  I LOVED it!!  The perfect way to end this trip. Everything exceeded my expectations. The bed was so comfortable I didn’t want to get out of it. The food was fantastic all around. But above all was the service. I cannot express how professional, kind, and welcoming everyone was.  I am already planning my next visit ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",5,2019,11,12
15,Perfect start to our honeymoon,"We stayed here for three nights at the beginning of our honeymoon. The property is beautiful and in a great location in the gothic quarter. Staff were exceptionally helpful and courteous. We ate at the tapas bar our first night, which was excellent. ",5,2019,11,09
15,Highly Recommend the Mercer Hotel Barcelona,This was our first time in Barcelona and we're so glad we chose to stay at the Mercer Hotel. The hotel is situatated perfectly in the Gotic center and easy to walk to all the great restaurants and shops. The staff at the hotel were amazing and very helpful with suggestions and advise during our stay. The room was wonderful as well and everything was perfect and clean as expected. Highly recommend it and we will be back again. ,5,2019,10,29
15,"Wonderful hotel, with exceptional service.","We can not recommend the Mercer Hotel more highly, the property is well located, has great services, but of most significance was the friendliness, high service offering and exceptional staff. Everybody was empowered and sought to provide each guest with a personalised and exceptional experience.",5,2019,10,29
15,the best place in Barcelona!,"We stayed at the Mercer for our usual October get away.  A once a year Mom and Dad reconnect.  The Mercer was ideal.  An incredibly friendly and responsive staff, a location from which you could easily walk to museums, the waterfront, many superb restaurants, the Cathedral next door, all kinds of Barri Gotic nightlife, and launch all kinds of architectural excursions.  With a really cool vibe/design, rooftop pool and garden, and excellent food, the Mercer has it all!",5,2019,10,25
15,A wonderful hidden gem of a hotel in central Barcelona,"We were fortunate to find this wonderful small luxury hotel close to the main street but quietly hidden behind an ancient wall. Our bed was very comfortable and the bathroom area was large and modern. The concierge was exceptionally helpful with taxis, restaurants and events. We also enjoyed the lobby happy hour. The hotel is close to small restaurants and shops and a short walk from sights. You may need to walk a block to the main street to get a taxi.",5,2019,10,23
15,Unforgettable Mercer Experience,"I don’t typically add to Trip Advisor reviews, but in this case I feel compelled to compliment this hotel. I have traveled the world and have occasionally been fooled by the photos and promises of the internet when it comes to hotels, but the Hotel Mercer in Barcelona was everything that the internet promised it to be and more. A convenient and charming location on a very quiet alley in the Gothic Quarter, cute shops and little cafés abound, and it was a pleasure to leave the bustle of the city behind to enter the quiet zone.  The hotel is beautiful, modern and yet built on ancient Roman walls, and is oh, so peaceful. Our room (a junior suite) was spacious, beautiful, and had every amenity…and a lovely and comfortable bed and phenomenal bathtub. I do not understand why some reviews criticized the lighting in the rooms….ours was well-lit and the lighting perfectly complimented the décor. We enjoyed the pretty rooftop space immensely….a wonderful way to wind down outdoors in the moonlight without the hub-bub of the city.  I highly recommend a cool glass of cava and one of the gourmet tidbits from the restaurant under the Barcelonian stars before bed. The concierge staff and front desk personnel performed above and beyond expectations.  Our stay in Barcelona was unfortunately complicated by completely unprecedented protests/riots that most likely (hopefully) will never occur again. However, the staff gave us every support needed to navigate the city around the massive demonstrations, kept us safe, and efficiently assisted with changes in our flights and other unexpected problems that came up because of the protests. Barcelona is a relaxing, laid back city, but run with perfect precision and every tour or dinner or reservation we had was precisely on time. Highlights for us in tourist attractions were the Gaudi Sagrada Familia cathedral – I have seen dozens of gothic cathedrals, but this one is truly a magnificent tribute to the divinity found in nature and the human race. Definitely get the audio guide, as it would be impossible to understand the symbolism of Gaudi’s work without it. As recommended by the hotel, we used the Barcelona Guide Bureau for tours to the Dali museum/Girona and Montserrat, and it was well worth the cost for the convenience, knowledge, and timeliness of the tour guides.  On a scale of 0-10, we give the Hotel Mercer, Barcelona, and the Barcelona Guide Bureau a 10++!",5,2019,10,21
15,Barcelona Getaway,The hotel was located in a perfect spot within the Gòtic quarter.  There were so many great restaurants and eateries in close walking distance.  We were able to either walk or take the tour bus to all the attractions in the city.  Hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful throughout our stay.  Could not be happier with the accommodations.,5,2019,10,20
15,Our happy place,"I wrote a 5 star review after our first visit and now after our 5th, I just want to reiterate what a fantastic Hotel this is. The staff are all just great. Extremely attentive without being intrusive. Bedrooms extremely comfortable, breakfasts amazing (always have a glass of cava) all set in a magnificent ancient building with modern amenities. A real oasis in the Gothic. As soon as we leave we want to plan our next visit. This hotel never disappoints us and we are always made to feel special",5,2019,10,16
15,"Great hotel, location, food and service ","Stayed in this hotel with my wife and toddler for 6 days, from the moment we stepped out of the cab staff was so welcoming and pleasant. 
I don’t remember everyone’s names but all of them made great impressions, were so helpful and made our trip more enjoyable. 
Small boutique hotel in the middle of the action, yet very quiet and comfortable, short walks to a lot of attractions, 15-20 min walk to the beach.
Ate breakfast there everyday, food was great, not a ton of options but whatever they had was made to perfection.
Room was clean and spacious.
We enjoyed our stay, if we came back to Barcelona would only stay at Mercer, highly recommend it. ",5,2019,10,05
15,Magnificent Mercer!,"We recently spent 4 nights at The Mercer and had a wonderful experience. Our junior suite was spacious and the bathroom was well designed. The hotel is on the edge of the atmospheric Gothic quarter and the rooms are quiet with no street noise. Wandering around the narrow streets was our favorite part of Barcelona. We ate at both restaurants and enjoyed the charming rooftop deck. The hotel staff really shines, from the concierge to the waiters and bartenders. They were friendly and helpful with restaurant suggestions and had great ideas for our visit. You can’t go wrong with choosing The Mercer.",5,2019,10,02
15,Super find!,This hotel is a real gem!  Staff is very accommodating and friendly.  Super clean and great amenities!  In a quiet are a but within walking distance to all the action in the Gothic Area.  We will be back!,5,2019,10,02
15,Bari Gotic gem,"Stayed here with my wife for our 20th anniversary. Love the Gothic quarter location. Tastefully renovated hotel. Quiet in our room with terrace off central courtyard (not private so we didn't use). Breakfasts were outstanding. Help with restaurant booking from staff was outstanding. Room service for extra coffee pods, milk for coffee was on the slow slide. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,09,29
15,Take me back! ,"This has got to be one of my favorite hotels ever! The walls were still kept from the old building, so much history is associated with this Boutique hotel, I found that stunning! The friendliest staff ever, so helpful and welcoming.
The decor was gorgeous, and the bed has got to be the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on #nojoke

The only downside to the hotel was that it was located behind the main street, it was a bit hard to find, and the area felt a bit creepy at night. The taxi can’t drop you in that location as its a narrow ally. 
",4,2019,09,27
15,A true gem,"This is one of my all time favourite hotels. 
The staff were all so warm and professional and would do anything to help. 
The rooms were clean and the beds very comfortable, a great nights sleep. 
Breakfast on the terrace a delight, both in terms of the food and the beautiful courtyard setting and then there’s the rooftop terrace and bar, perfect to finish the day. 
I highly recommend this hotel and just hope it’s not too long before we can revisit.",5,2019,09,25
15,Excellent Experience,"I had an excellent experience at the Mercer Hotel Barcelona.  The building is beautifully stylish and impeccably maintained.  The staff was helpful, friendly, knowledgeable and prompt throughout my stay.",5,2019,09,23
15,A Must See (Stay),"The Mercer is a little difficult to find and access.   We were traveling with another couple and our van could not make it down the street to the hotel.  The Concierge send a staff member down to the next large street to meet us and transport our excessive amount of luggage.   The historic build has been brilliantly transformed.  The best part about our stay is the staff.   They are ALL amazing.  They make you feel safe and cared for.   The rooms are spacious but unfortunately not well lighted.  The shower if huge but be careful of the slippery floor.  All In all, we found the location to be very convenient to many of Barcelona’s best sites.  I am sad that we only had one day at the Marcer.  We will return.  Congratulations to the staff of the Mercer, you have a great property and do an amazing job.",5,2019,09,21
15,Boutique hotel with old world charm yet modern styling,"I would have rated this boutique hotel 5 stars if it was located in a more accessible area. Very hard to locate. The staff is very friendly and welcoming.  Property is modern and immaculate. If you don’t enjoy a cookie cutter hotel chain , this one is an option ",4,2019,09,17
15,"Gorgeous property, amazing staff, great location","I was traveling alone, picked this hotel as my splurge of the trip and am SO glad I did.  It's beautiful and in a great location , but the real ""wows"" here are the staff and customer service.  Every person I interacted with, from the door to the desk to the bar to the concierge was above and beyond courteous, attentive, thoughtful and professional.  Often times anticipating my needs.  I felt appreciated and cared for by all.  The room was beautiful, very clean and comfortable with fantastic amenities.  Loved this hotel and hope to be back! ",5,2019,09,15
15,Chic Boutique in Perfect Location ,"Nestled on one of the winding streets of the Gothic Quarter, the Mercer offers amazing hospitality and impeccable service. The location is ideal for walking, and the architecture is a chic and impressive conversion of former palace. The front desk and attendants are very personable and knowledgeable. The Suite was amazing and big. It will be hard to find another 5-star property like the Mercer in the Gothic Qtr.",5,2019,09,11
15,We had a both experience at both of your locations in Barcelona and Seville. We definitely look forward to future stays.,We had a great experience staying at both locations in Barcelona and Seville. We look forward to coming back to Barcelona as well as trying out your other locations. We enjoyed the service as well as the food a lot. Thank you! ,5,2019,09,08
15,Charming hotel in great location with warm staff,"From the moment we checked in to this hotel, the friendly service and quality could not have been better. We were greeted with a glass of cava, snacks and an escort around the hotel with explanations.  The Mercer is in the gothic section of Barcelona, in walking distance to almost anything you could ask for.  The staff was always warm, helpful and knowledgable.  Special shout out to the concierge, Victor, for his gracious help with everything, his gentle manner and patience in allowing me to practice my Spanish. He was never flustered by my on the fly, last minute requests from museum tours to Flamenco guitar events. Great seats. Thank you Victor and EVERYONE at the Mercer. Hope to be back again this year.",5,2019,09,05
15,Best place to stay in Barcelona ,My husband and I have been traveling for the past few weeks and hands down this hotel has been my favorite. The staff is amazing. My birthday fell over this trip and we were sent a cake and champagne to celebrate. Our room has one of the old Roman brick walls and the location is perfect. Thank you Mercer Hotel.  You exceeded my expectations. ,5,2019,09,05
15,Sweet boutique hotel in the heart of the old part of town,"Wonderful hotel in the heart of the old part of the city where one can easily walk to hundreds of restaurants and tourist activities. The narrow stone streets and old buildings add to the charm where this building is located, but still small taxis can reach it from/to the airport. The room in the summer can be quite warm when checking in until the keycard operates the air conditioner for a few hours. The service is super warm and friendly and they will do whatever it takes to make their guests have a good stay. We asked them for a reservation for two at one of the busiest restaurants that doesn't take reservations for two (Cañele), and the Mercer concierge got us one during prime time so when we arrived we were seated quickly and had a wonderful birthday dinner! The complimentary bottle of sparkling wine (cava) for my birthday with candy was also a very sweet treat. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel for anyone wishing to have a comfortable and convenient experience with great service. After leaving an item in the hotel and coming back a few days later to retrieve it they were just as warm and friendly as could be and we have good memories of our stay. Due to our flight times they gave us complimentary early check-in and slightly later check-out which was very nice of them, too.",5,2019,09,04
15,Great boutique Hotel in Gothic Quarter with excellent servie,"We loved the location of this 28 room hotel on a narrow lane in the Gothic quarter.  There are a number of interesting shops on this street.   We had a nice sized suite facing the quiet inner courtyard and a plant wall.  The hotel has a nice roof deck which we used a couple of times.  The pool is very small and about 2.5 feet deep but it's nice that they have it.  There is a casual tapas restaurant which was very good, and a more formal restaurant which we didn't try.  
We especially enjoyed the friendly service.  All of the staff members are very pleasant, and we were welcomed back each time we returned to the hotel.  This is an excellent choice for travelers who prefer a more personal touch.  
",5,2019,09,03
15,Nice . . . but well below expectations,"Location was excellent. Common areas were very nice.

Junior Suite was not very comfortable. Layout was odd . . . just a big room really. Natural light was scarce and lighting was minimalist at best . . . made it hard to read or see what was in the suitcase. 
Open bathroom was unimpressive

Just didn't measure up to the rave reviews I read . . . lots of better choices I think",3,2019,09,03
15,Honored guests,"My husband & I travel often both in the US & internationally. We usually stay in 5* & luxury boutique hotels during our vacation trips. The warm welcome we received, coupled with the professional & friendly service from everyone at Mercer made our one night stay truly memorable. We felt like honored guests staying at the home of a close friend. The staff could not do enough to make our stay as pleasant & comfy as possible.
Hotel location is a bit tricky (close to attractions though) since the entrance is off a very narrow alley. We had private transfers coming & going so finding the hotel was not an issue. Hotel staff helps with the luggage as well. Our Jr Suite was comfy, clean, & well appointed. Rooftop Bar was great. We also tried the tapas restaurant & downstairs bar, also great. Breakfast was very good.
It was the genuinely warm & caring guest services that set Mercer apart. Easily the best we’ve experienced at a hotel! Both my husband & I were delighted with our stay & would not hesitate to stay again if we visit Barcelona in the future.",5,2019,08,30
15,"Luxury at it's maximum, incredible service, tremendous experience!","Loved staying at the Mercer Hotel; the beds are probably made of clouds, they are that comfortable. The rooms themselves use Molton Brown amenities, and are fully equipped like how a five star hotel should be. The design of the room itself is incredibly unique, one that you'll definitely enjoy staying in.

The staff are also incredibly friendly, and are always helpful, going out of their way to help you.  

My only advice is that the location of this hotel is very inner Gothic Quarter, where even some taxi's will refuse to go into, due to the narrowness of the roads. We were driving and were not told of the challenges of getting to the hotel, however, the hotel sent their bell-boys with a trolley to a square near-by, where they took the car from us to valet, and took all our bags - once again, the level of service is impeccable!

I would definitely stay at the Mercer Hotel again, and would recommend anyone looking for a quality, five star, luxurious hotel, to consider the Mercer, they'll take care of you, and you'll love the property!",5,2019,08,26
15,Perfecte!,"The location, staff and beautiful simplicity of this hotel made our 7 day stay perfect! Every amenity is available. The towels are big and fluffy (always a true test of a good hotel). My only wish would be to stay again some day. ",5,2019,08,20
15,Best stay in BCN (and we been 8 times:)),"We came in the middle of the night with a baby so after a long trip, we were really looking forward to relax. Easy facilitated and straight forwarded check in procedures made our arrival easy. 

Now for the specifics!

Food at the hotel: excellent breakfast menu. Personally I never order breakfast on hotel because I find the traditional morning buffets lame so it was delightful  to have a proper breakfast disguised in  gourmet plate served by a staff who apparently spoke more languages total than I could count . 

Personel: absolutely amazing portfolio of staff. My kid was so happy playing around with the staff who showed no shortage of enthusiasm.
Staff was also very helpful and flexible when we asked for a suite because my wife conplained over my constant walking out for a cigarette. And this was in the very busy season.

Standard: bed and linen very good quality something I value as much skin is sensitive. Clean up of room very discreet and attentive. Exceptional cleanliness

Misc: great and homely atmosphere whilst giving a truly enriching and classic appearance. 

Overally perfect place for a bcn getaway. location is very central whilst not being bothered by the very busy nightlife of barcelona. People are the greatest asset and the staff really made some nice recommendations to everything we wanted to inquire about  cant thank u guys enough. 

One love",5,2019,08,17
15,Exceptional experience,"Exceptional service, food, facility, and location. Cant be beat! Staff went out of their way to make an exceptional experience. Only regret was that we could not stay longer, this is a quiet oasis in the middle of Barcelona",5,2019,08,16
15,"A stunning decor/setting, excellent service and food","Nestled in the gothic quarter very close to “el born” quarter, the Mercer hotel is ideally located for those wanting to “live” the city and buzzing experience of this unique area. 
Very quiet jewel, carefully crafted and decorated using the raw and simple beauty from the gothic times combined with simple and elegant furniture both modern and cosy, a warm color palette integrating light wood, the light color of the big rocks and some curated artworks inspired by Basquiat and Soulage.
A patio surrounded by giant glasses brings light together with nature and plants.
In the patio we had our breakfast al fresco every morning protected from the sun by trees. The Mercer breakfast is as the rest of the hotel: tasty, looking good, generous and very elegant. Pastries, fresh fruits, made on order eggs and other delicacies, a  vast choice.
On the rooftop, a quaint terrace with a small swimming pool and bar. Just what’s needed to make you feel one of a kind, in a quiet yet vibrant feel. Low music, good service and excellent mojito 
We had the premium suite: fabulous with an enormous private terrace. Generous space and taste everywhere. Very comfy.
The Bouchon : a tapas restaurant of the the Mercer is delicious as well, not highly priced.
Lastly the staff is efficient, warm, helpful, smiling . A delight. Special thanks to Jose Manel and the 3 receptionists we had the pleasure to meet during our stay.

15,Sublime ,"Delightful staff, great atmosphere,  fantastic breakfast, lovely terrace;in a word sublime - an oasis of calm in the gothic quarter of a buzzing city. Merits its 5 stars completely would highly recommend. ",5,2019,08,10
15,Fantastic hotel,"I stayed her for 4 nights with my 16 year old niece and we thoroughly loved staying here - everything from the location, the staff, the rooms and the food was excellent (hence my rating). I prefer small, boutique hotels with character, and the Mercer was definitely all three, plus more. ",5,2019,08,06
15,Hotel saved my sanity!!!,"What a lovely hotel -- gracious staff, HUGE room, lovely setting.  We were there during the super heat wave of July and the plunge pool on the roof literally saved our sanity.  There's a cute sitting area with chaise longues and bar -- great place to hang in the evening and recuperate from the intense heat and very large crowds of Barcelona.  Overall, a haven of grace in what has become a overly busy, overly touristy city full of youngsters partying . . . and the room sound-proofing was superbe!",5,2019,08,06
15,Amazing week celebrating our 3rd wedding anniversary!,"The Mercer Hotel really exceeded our expectations. We spent a full week with them at one of their Mercer Suites, and it was amazing. I have to give a special shout out to Joan, a phenomenal concierge who organized everything from a wine tour and a hot air balloon tour to massages in the room and reservations at exclusive restaurants like Enigma. He is sooo well connected. Not only that, he is friendly and always helpful with a smile. Their breakfast is to die for, and it's served in their gorgeous indoor patio, which makes you feel you're miles from the city (but you're right in the Gothic quarter!). Aleij was a particularly phenomenal waiter for breakfast - we loved him. Their rooftop is super relaxing as well, and we had some amazing drinks there. The attention to detail is fantastic. They left us a cake and a bottle of champagne for our wedding anniversary (as a surprise), and they would randomly leave typed-up messages wishing us a great day. All in all, it was perfect. We definitely want to come back and have no reservations in recommending this hotel (and this comes from two picky Northeast medical professionals who have traveled to 50+ countries). Nicely done Mercer team!!",5,2019,08,04
15,Summer place to go,Staffs are welcoming. 310 Room was beautiful and clean. But some weird smell comes from a drain. Swimming pool was beautiful but needs to be cleaned more often. Food was good. House keeping and complimentary food was good too. ,5,2019,08,04
15,"Charming boutique, perfect location","
This hotel has a great location within walking distance to a plethora of restaurants, shops and attractions. The hotel employs very friendly, and service-oriented staff.  Our ""superior"" room (#102 overlooking Lledo Street) was spacious and comfortable w/AC, nice amenities/toiletries and strong, reliable wifi that is always ""on"".  However, while lending to a sense of space, the sink/shower were open to the room so not ideal. Unfortunately, we did not have an opportunity to experience the terrace or plunge pool which was very charming and always in use.  We did not eat at the hotel but took advantage of nearby Michelin star restaurants.  

For those sensitive to light, be selective in the room booked.  The nighttime uplighting to the front of the building requires you to close the blackout shutters; this, coupled with no direct sunlight in the morning or throughout the day causes the room to always be dark and it's occupants to potentially oversleep.

We would not hesitate to stay in this hotel again (in a different room) and recommend to friends due to the exceptional location and the staff.

15,Mercer Hotel is a truly special place,"The Mercer Hotel is a wonderful boutique hotel with only 20 or so rooms.  It is built on top of / into a section of  the Barcino wall of the Roman city allowing guests to see the actual ancient towers & wall remnants.  Further, the staff is most accommodating and the food is incredible.  If in Barcelona, this is the place to stay!",5,2019,08,03
15,Anniversary trip,My wife and I spent four wonderful days at this hotel. The staff were super friendly and helpful. Concierge was very knowledgeable and helpful. The hotel is located in the perfect location within the Gothic quarter. Very nice and quiet. Would highly recommend this hotel and return for another stay.,5,2019,07,30
15,Best hotel in Barcelona!,"Wonderful boutique hotel with perfect location!   Every staff member was kind, helpful and truly wanted to make our stay perfect. The rooms were beautifully appointed, great layout, size and amenities.  The concierge and front desk staff were incredibly knowledgeable and were able to assist with everything including tickets to Sagrada Família and Park Guell. We would definitely recommend this hotel - super family friendly and perfect location close to everything. ",5,2019,07,30
15,"Lovely Boutique Hotel in Gothic Quarter, Barcelona","My husband and I just loved this boutique hotel.  The location was fantastic, the room was nice and spacious, and the rooftop pool area was very relaxing after a day of sightseeing.  Best of all was the extremely attentive, friendly and helpful staff who helped answer every question and request.  Definitely recommend the Mercer Hotel!",5,2019,07,24
15,World Class,"The facilities are world class here. The hotel in built into two palaces and it’s been executed extremely we booked one of the entry level rooms (hoping to get an upgrade, but they were fully booked), and even that room was amazing. 

Common areas open up to an amazing court yard, and the roof top deck/pool is a great spot to relax in the afternoon.

The hotel bar/bartender is excellent. She makes some excellent cocktails and recommended several great cocktail bar recommendations to us throughout the city. 

Overall it’s a great central location with amazing customer service. We’ll be back to the Mercer next time we visit Barcelona.",5,2019,07,24
15,Best hotel and hotel staff,"We are currently staying at the hotel and our experience has been amazing so far. The hotel is unique, the location is very convenient to all historical points of interests, restaurants and shopping. The best of all is the cozy atmosphere and very friendly and professional personal that knows al the guests by name. Bogdan gave us a nice historical tour of the hotel and gave us grate information about the city. My husband was nicely surprised by the hotel management with elegant dessert and Cava for his birthday. We will definitely comeback since the experience has been noting, but excellent.",5,2019,07,23
15,Great Boutique hotel,"From the minute we walked in, to the time we left the hotel staff could not have been more accommodating and friendly.  They provided great food and sights recommendations while in Barcelona.  They took the time to get to know us during our stay.  Very personable and helpful, above and beyond!   The location is great, off the main road but easy walk to marina area, beach, and sights. I would recommend this hotel and return here on our next visit.",5,2019,07,21
15,A superb hotel,"If you get the chance to visit wonderful Barcelona this hotel in the Gothic Quarter is absolutely stunning . It’s small and perfectly designed to fit into one of the many amazing narrow streets and alleyways of this ancient part of the city . Our room ( 207) was spacious chic and modern and looked out towards the more open space at the rear . 
We ate breakfasts here on a couple of occasions , they were fresh , delicious but rather expensive. We never ate here in the evening ,preferring instead to eat at some of the lovely bars and restaurants within 100m of the hotel . As you return to the hotel and walk through the front doors you enter an oasis of calm . The staff here are brilliant, without exception they are friendly and helpful . Guests are addressed by name , an excellent touch . Concierge service is top notch . Carmen mixes brilliant cocktails at the bar , try them . 
The roof top plunge pool and sun loungers are an excellent facility . 
We tend always to move on and never visit the same place twice . The Mercer will be an exception . We will definitely return . So much more to see and do in Barcelona and  it has to be this hotel that we must return too .",5,2019,07,21
15,Best Hotel !!!,"I’ve always been a huge fan of five star well known brands such as the Ritz Carleton, however the Mercer far exceeds these hotels. The hotel itself is beautiful, the room was spacious, bed comfortable and a great design. Bar was nice, great roof top pool but most of all the hotel staff was spectacular. The staff here is the best I have ever encountered before and I have traveled a lot. The bartenders and waitresses are extremely attentive. Housekeeping comes twice a day stocking the mini bar, bringing fresh fruit and chocolates! Btw these are all complimentary. I wish I knew everyone of the staffs name but sadly I do not . However there are two members of the staff that need to be personally recognized and that’s Marcos and Victor who truly went above and beyond every single day of our stay .They were truly remarkable and made our stay very special. Also Luis the Bartender was amazing and made our time there enjoyable and lots of fun! Thank you for a wonderful stay Mercer Hotel!",5,2019,07,17
15,Superb Hotel,"My husband and I stayed 4 nights at this wonderful hotel. We were warmly welcomed upon arrival and offered a glass of champagne. The rooms are well equipped and have plenty of storage. The bed is extremely comfortable with fine linens. The hotel offers turn down service and leaves little treats in the evening. Breakfast is exceptional. If you can book a room with breakfast included, do it. It’s a 5 star breakfast experience. Best thing about hotel is the service. Joan Manel was extremely helpful in arranging a last minute tour. All the staff in fact was excellent. They had water and towels waiting for us at the front when they noticed us going for our morning jog.. who does that? The Mercer Hotel does!! Fantastic hotel, excellent staff, good area, luxurious breakfast. ",5,2019,07,14
15,Lovely boutique hotel,"Lovely boutique hotel in the Gothic quarter. Well-appointed, quiet rooms and a very attentive staff. Great location. We loved the rooftop terrace and pool after a hot day of touring. Would definitely stay there again. ",5,2019,07,08
15,Over the top,"The hotel is in an excellent location in the Old Quarter, within walking distance to the port, las Ramblas the high end retail district (well within 15 minutes of walking). The staff is extremely helpful and professional. We only had breakfasts and used the bar. Both were excellent. The breakfast is one of the most wide ranging offering we have seen. The roof top terrace with the small pool is another great amenity where the staff will serve anything you desire even after or before the hours.
We will definitely be back.",5,2019,07,07
15,Architectural gem in the heart of Barcelona,"Definitely a 5 star hotel, with wonderful staff and food. Everyone was very helpful and professional. The suite was lovely and very private and quiet (except for the fireworks during Mid Summers Eve)! And the tours that were set up for us were well done and informative. We had a great first trip to Barcelona.We will return here soon!",5,2019,07,02
15,The greatest boutique hotel I ever stayed aT,"The hotel is located in a renovated apartment building at the old city wall of Barcelona. The hotel has only 28 guest rooms and is thus very intimate. It is located in the Gothic quarter, in an almost pedestrian area.
The service is impeccable, each employee knew my name at the end of the first day. The staff take care of every wish of mine, and I really felt great. the room was well-equipped, except for the bath lighting. I had light from the ceiling only on the left side of my face, the mirror or the ceiling had no light that would help me shave the right side of my face. Furniture was modern, floors were covered with designer acrylic in wood optic.
The only other thing I was missing was an electrical outlet near the writing table. As I was by myself, I charged my iphone and ipad at the other bedside table. If there were two guests, this would not work.
Furniture was styled in a modern almost minimalistic way.
The bed was comfortable and the windows were sound-isolated, which let me sleep on St. John's day in Barcelona with firecrackers all night.
The beds and pillows were of good quality. There was free coffee and tea in the room, the minibar was free for nonalcoholic drinks.
The windows are rather small, but this was prescribed by the history of the building.
All hotel staff were super friendly.
The breakfast was in a patio with trees providing shade, and the quality of the food was very good, too. 
Altogether, a great experience.",5,2019,07,01
15,Love this hotel!,"This is the perfect spot - great location, beautiful hotel, friendly and helpful staff .  We so enjoyed the day trip to Montserrat followed by a visit to a local winery - all arranged for us by the concierge.  This hotel is our favorite place to stay in Barcelona!",5,2019,06,29
15,Mercer Hotel Barcelona,"The Mercer Hotel is a charming, restored property in Barcelona's Gothic Quarter. Upon entering the property, guests are greeted by the warmth of the Mercer's staff which is complimented by the property's stone, mortar and wood architecture. The quality of the property extends to the guests rooms, and let's guests know that they are at a special property. Conveniently located in the Gothic Quarter, there is plenty of shopping, tours and street performers within walking distance of the hotel. If there is any downside staying at the property, it is the convenience to shopping that may result in an overspent budget if you have a travel companion who is inclined to shop. Other than this, the Mercer is a welcoming respite. After a busy day of touring the city, be sure to relax on the roof's sun deck where you can enjoy tapas, the sun and a small dipping pool. The Mercer Hotel was well worth the investment and will be a go-to choice in the future upon my next visit to Barcelona.",5,2019,06,28
15,"Travelling with my sons, 10 & 6.","The staff at the Mercer treated us all so beautifully on our recent trip to Barcelona. From check in, & arranging transport & city tours, they where absolutely amazing. My boys loved the breakfast, especially the eggs benedict, & the handmade chocolates.
Swimming in the rooftop pool was the perfect wind down to busy street of Barcelona.
Excellent cure for jet lag after a long flight from Australia ",5,2019,06,27
15,Best hotel experience ever,"The Mercer is located in the midst of Barcelona's Gothic Quarter, and is build around Roman ruins.  Lovely facility, small hotel, staff are outstanding.  Concierge set up great personal tours.  Definitely plan to have breakfast at the Mercer.  Bar, Tapas room and main restaurant are first class.  This hotel really made our trip.",5,2019,06,24
15,Superior Hotel,What. Wonderful hotel. The location was perfect. I loved being right in the middle of the oldest part of town. Just gorgeous. The staff is extremely helpful and the concierge team is TOPS!  Breakfast in the garden was a fabulous start to the day!  It was absolutely delicious. Drinks before dinner in the bar is also a must! Lunch on the rooftop terrace was also a nice way to unwind after a morning at the Picasso Museum. Loved this hotel!!,5,2019,06,23
15,Unique Luxury,"The Mercer Hotel is stunning. It is intimate with a history unmatched in our other stays in Barcelona. We loved the property, neighborhood, and team at the hotel. This has become our first choice whenever we go to Barcelona. There is simply nothing like it and we feel lucky to have found the Mercer.",5,2019,06,22
15,A superbly comfortable oasis of quiet in the centre of Barcelona,"An oasis of quiet and tranquility in a beautifully restored building in the heart of Barcelona's Gothic Quarter with attentive and friendly staff, surrounded by the action of one of the buzziest cities on Europe.",5,2019,06,21
15,Highly recommend,"This is truly a 5 star boutique hotel. Quality was evident everywhere, from the glass of cava at check-in to the turn down service at night, to the beautiful furnishings & fabrics, to the (free) mini bar in the room. The breakfast is worth getting - and the rooftop bar is adorablely Private (only for guests of the hotel, and there are <30 rooms. Did you know this hotel is built into the Roman Wall surrounding Barcelona? This respect for history is immediately evident in its rooms, with their clean Scandinavian design.Finally, the hotel location in the Gothic Quarter is just perfect. We were able to walk everywhere. However, if you don’t like walking, the hotel will order a taxi for you.",5,2019,06,20
15,Felt like royalty,My husband and I came here for our anniversary while on a vacation in Spain.  The staff went above and beyond to make us feel special.  Our room was upgraded and they provided us with a welcome bottle of cava and an anniversary treat!  I don't think we will ever be able to find a hotel that tops Mercer Barcelona.,5,2019,06,19

Only One ""Suggestion/Recommendation"" for Bath Towels: If you use some sort of light fragrance during wash. Thank You.",5,2019,06,18
15,Outstanding Boutique Hotel,"If this is a price range you are looking for and you prefer a boutique hotel setting (approximately 30 rooms) you won't be disappointed.  The staff went out of their way to make sure your every need is taken care of.  They had excellent suggestions for tapas location, shopping (where locals go and local items are sold), distance and timing to various locations and suggestions on walking versus riding.  The hotel is about 10 small blocks, easily walkable, from the Ramblas in a quiet area.  
One suggestion have the hotel set up your taxi for your arrival, they have a company that comes to their front door.  The hotel is about two blocks from a major road and many taxi drivers don't know how to get to their front door.
It is about 3 blocks to the waterfront commercial area if that is of interest.  They will set dinner reservations, which I suggest, as local restaurants give sitting preference to reservations over walk-ins.",5,2019,06,16
15,Flawless!!,"Tucked away in one of the small alleys of the Gothic Quarter, the Mercer Hotel is one of the most charming boutique hotels we’ve ever been to. 
The hotel itself, while being very Modern, transports you to Medieval times with its ancient Roman walls and beautiful Arches.... it’s a perfect combination of Past and Present. It also has the most beautiful courtyard filled with orange trees!.  
We stayed in a  junior suite which was extremely spacious 
( we fit in 2 extra rollaway beds very comfortably), very clean and well appointed.  

What makes the Mercer hotel exceptional is its Amazing Staff and their Impeccable Service... and I mean impeccable!!!:
The front desk team made our check- In/Out Seamless. 
Excellent guest services; Breakfast service was amazing, Housekeeping, Porters... Thank you all!. 
Fantastic Concierge service!!!. A big shoutout and a huge Thank you to Jose Manel and Marcus for making our vacation Memorable!! ( my kids want to move there:) ).

Thank you for a fantastic stay and can’t wait to be back!!",5,2019,06,12
15,Barcelona Magic,"Just stayed at this wonderful hotel. Couldn’t fault a thing. Everything from the staff to the rooms, the amenities, the location, the food/breakfast, the cleanliness was exemplary. Special mention to Juan Manuel, the concierge, who was most helpful, engaging and full of knowledge of the area, a true asset!
We wouldn’t hesitate to return and would recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona, thank you Mercer Hotel for a fabulous visit.",5,2019,06,06

15,The Mercer Hotel! The best!!,"The absolute best experience and friendliness! We will always remember the friends we made at the Mercer and how welcoming they were!!! They gave us a honeymoon cake and cava and let us enjoy the bar area for friends and breakfast and dinner. They were the absolute best. The food was amazing, thank you chef! The management was perfection and the staff was as well. ",5,2019,06,02
15,Best service I've ever experienced!!!,"I travel rather frequently, and the people at Mercer, hands down, made this the best hotel experience I have ever had. I wish I could name every single staff member for their unprecedented service. From running down the street to get us a cab, to incredible dining and turndown services, I will only stay at the Mercer when I travel to any city in which they are located. I wish I could give a six-star rating because that is the level of service they offered. Second to none. Muchas gracias por todos!",5,2019,06,01
15,Amazing Hotel!,"We had an absolutely amazing stay at the Mercer. From the moment we walked toward the front doors the staff were friendly, inviting, and welcoming. We felt special and important immediately. The front desk staff made us feel special when we arrived and greeted us with a glass of cava and small cake bites. The concierge recommended an amazing location for dinner and was extremely helpful. The location in the Gothic Quarter is perfect. Our room was clean, quiet, and beautiful. We loved the mini-fridge with free water and juices. We also loved the coffee machine and tea in the room as well. The hotel has such a lovely boutique feel. If we have the opportunity to return to Barcelona we will definitely want to stay at the Mercer again! Thank you for an amazing stay! ",5,2019,05,30
15,Would stay again & again,"The entire staff are friendly and helpful, from check in with champagne to the housekeeping staff. The room was very clean and well appointed with a nespresso, free mini fridge, etc., what you would expect from a high end hotel. Our room was 209, which was spacious and had an inner courtyard view. We loved that the hotel truly is part of a fortress wall and has made portions of the wall visible. We had great tappas at their wine bar, Le Bouchon. We arranged for a car service pick up from the airport through the hotel. I would highly recommend this since the hotel is located in a small alley in the middle of the gothic area. The location is perfect and quiet. There is a metro stop close by making the location even more convenient. We definitely would stay here again.",5,2019,05,29
15,A Quiet Respite in a Vibrant City,"Located in the heart of the romantic Gothic Quarter, Hotel Mercer is chic, beautiful yet very  comfortable. There is a lot to see and do in Barcelona and we were thrilled to come back to our cozy retreat (super plush bed) at the end of our very busy days and nights. The hotel provided outstanding customer service from beginning to end - starting with a welcoming glass of cava to the spot-on recommendations from the concierge; the staff absolutely elevated our stay in amazing Barcelona.",5,2019,05,27
15,"Mercer Hotel, Barcelona","Fantastic hotel. Lovely, quiet location just a short walk to local attractions. V warm welcome and nothing is too much trouble for staff who can’t do enough to help.  Would definitely stay there again when I return to the city.",5,2019,05,23
15,Our stay could not have been better,Our welcome was warm and generous. The room was beautifully appointed and full of character. The staff were exceptional. The tapas gastrobar had great atmosphere and the food was good. We returned to a bottle of champagne and birthday wishes in our room - I can only imagine this was noticed when our passports were handed in at check-in. Amazing lovely hotel. ,5,2019,05,22
15,Second to none,"This hotel is one of a number of high-end hotels I've stayed at in Barcelona, and this is by far the best. The staff really made the experience - they couldn't do enough to help and were incredibly pleasant and helpful. The architecture of the hotel is stunning - the room had a gorgeous mix of old and new. The hotel smelt AMAZING and was a real oasis of calm. I'll never stay at another hotel when I'm in Barcelona, I can't wait to return to The Mercer.",5,2019,05,21
15,Great Hotel!,"Wonderful stay. The Mercer Hotel offers great service , marvelous location, and warm friendly staff. We enjoyed our room, the rooftop pool area, and nice meals. We will absolutely return to this excellent hotel and look forward to another great vacation in Barcelona.",5,2019,05,20
15,New & Old Perfectly Combined,This hotel in the heart of the Gothic Quarter is the perfect combination between old and new. We loved the roman origins and the modern touches. The service and food were excellent. It reminded us of the B2 Hotel in Zurich which is another gem.,5,2019,05,18
15,Amazing stay,Beautiful hotel well located with helpful staff all around...in particular I have to say the concierge was always friendly and always made me feel at home ....the room was a very good size and all drinks and coffee in the fridge were included and replaced everyday which was nice,5,2019,05,17
15,beautiful boutique luxury hotel,"The whole hotel is stunning! It is central but hidden and the modern furniture goes extremely well with the ancient building. We had a junior suite, perfect size, nice wooden floors and everything was provided for. Breakfast is great although a little ‚complicated‘. 
The rooftop provides a stylish yet cosy and beautiful atmosphere. Very friendly staff!",5,2019,05,14
15,Spectacular In Every Way,"What a tremendous property based in an ancient first century Roman fort.

Then there are the Staff.... Juan who was just exceptional.It was our wedding anniversary and he supplied us with his excellent local knowledge in telling us about Calente (probably the best tapas experience) in Barcelona. Then he got us seats ( close to the stage) in an amazing theatre to see an awesome Flamenco and classic Spanish guitar show. Nothing was too much trouble for Juan. The other staff worth a mention were the lady behind the bar and also the Ukrainian guy , sorry if I have forgotten your names.

The roof top terrace was delightful with a plunge pool.Unfortunately we could not avail ourselves of this as the weather made the pool a tad cold.The beds were very comfortable . My husband loved the breakfasts, the food was well thought out and delicious.The hotel is well situated being close to all major attractions and tucked away in the Gothic quarter amongst the quaint little alleyways.

Needless to say if we are back in Barcelona we shall return. This hotel comes highly recommended and I am sure the “other” Mercer properties will not fail to disappoint. If you are in Barcelona stay here other hotels won’t compare !",5,2019,05,13
15,Top in Barcelona,"This Hotel is a bijoux for modern travelers who estimate to combine Culture with modern styling.
We felt us at home und as e member of the Hotels Family.
The Hotel ist not easy to find in the old Town of Barcelona. ",5,2019,05,13
15,Amazing Barcelona Experience,"Stayed  for one night (Barcelona FC game)  the whole experience from check in to check out was perfect.
Located IN the roman walls of the city, the hotel is beautifully stone build, our suite had a large terrace, and was equipped with very high end amenities. Highly recommended.",5,2019,05,11
15,Best Barcelona Hotel!,Excellent staff- clean- great value! So helpful. Will return! Great room! Best bed! Close to great locations. The staff was friendliest by far! Room service fast! Great intro to hotel. Highly recommend.,5,2019,05,11
15,Beautiful hotel in the Bari Gotic,"This is a gorgeous hotel built on top of Roman ruins in the old section of the City, full of architectural character.  The staff is fantastically helpful and the rooms are clean and modern with everything you would need.  Highly recommended.  We only ate there once, for breakfast, and it was very good.  There's a great coffee place 2 blocks away and a number of little cafes and restaurants in the area. ",5,2019,05,10
15,Amazing Hotel - Incredible Staff!,HIGHLY recommend this hotel especially if looking for a boutique vibe on a quiet street (but very central/incredible neighborhood in Gothic District).  Hotel is very well designed as part of an ancient Roman ruin (Bogdan gives a great historical tour if you want one!). Pool top roof deck is very well done.  Can't say enough about the staff we had during our 3 night stay:  Silvina; Bogdan and Edward!,5,2019,05,07
15,Home away from home!,"We had an absolutely amazing experience at the Mercer and will definitely make this our home away from home when we visit Barcelona next.  The service was top notch and we really felt like we were extended family being spoiled at someone's home.  Food, the room, and common areas all exceeded expectations.  Thanks so much to everyone who made our trip some memorable.",5,2019,05,03
15,Avoid Agoda for hotel booking!,"We have not yet had the pleasure of visiting this hotel, and so cannot yet rate the experience.  I can, however, warn all prospective visitors to avoid booking this — or any — property using the Agoda website.  We were seriously misled by the firm as to the price of our accommodation.  A $1425 booking turned into a $2200 gouging.  The difference was explained as taxes, fees and currency conversion costs.  We tried to cancel as soon as we discovered the mistake, but were told we were already past the cancellation period.  Agoda customer service, when finally located, was rude and aggressive.  Lesson learned.  We are still looking forward to celebrating our 30th anniversary at what looks to be a fine establishment in a great city, but will make future reservations through other means.",5,2019,05,01
15,PERFECTION,"I can´t say enough good things about this hotel. From the moment you walk in you are in the best hands. Friendly, attentive stuff taking care of everything you might need.  We stayed in the Suite where you had about 95 m2 in the middle of the Gothic Quarter and we really felt at home. The bed was extremely comfortable, the level of cleanliness was unreal, the overall attention to detail and tasteful decor has made our stay just perfect. It was my boyfriends birthday and I didn´t even mention it to the staff but when we arrived from dinner we had such a cute cake and cava waiting for us in the room with birthday wishes. I would definitely recommend staying in this hotel as the location is unbeatable if you want to be in the middle of everything but like to be in a quiet authentic area.",5,2019,05,01
15,MAGNIFICENT MERCER HOTEL BARCELONA,"We stayed at this fabulous boutique hotel for 6 days and thoroughly enjoyed our time here. The location in the old Gothic Quarter is just perfect for soaking up the history and culture that seeps up through the narrow, stone alleyways that the hotel is in the centre of. A wonderful experience to be surrounded by ancient history as soon as you step outside the hotel doors!
But besides the location, this hotel deserves the highest recommendation for the exceptional standard of service it provides. All the staff (from the doorman to the reception, the concierge to the dining staff) were so pleasant and obliging - they constantly went out of their way to be helpful. We find that when we are away in a foreign city, in a foreign country it is the care and service provided by people that really enhance our stay and experience of a trip. When we return from a full day of business/conference/sightseeing, it is so much more pleasant to be welcomed back to a hotel that is more like a luxurious home. We feel safe and well-cared for and it wraps up the day nicely for us.
That is how such excellent staff and service can enhance a hotel stay - and that is exactly what the Mercer did for us. We highly recommend this premium quality boutique hotel experience!
Many thanks to Mercer management and staff for looking after us.
We hope to return again sometime!

15,Cannot be better!,"It was a perfect hotel we choose as a last destination of our 10 days trip to Europe. Yes, it was quite a price but very much worth it. I highly recommend to anyone around the world. From arrival to dinner course and bath and court yard experiences, I totally enjoyed my stay there.",5,2019,04,30
15,Beautiful and Historic hotel,"Loved this hotel. The location in Barcelona was great! Part of the old Roman city in every room. The decor is stark and really compliments the Old part. The staff was wonderful. Could not have been nicer, willing to please. I loved being in the old part of the city ..it was charming. The narrow streets and bars and cafes were amazing...something new around each corner. I loved this place. We will stay here when we go back to Barcelona.
Our weather was not conducive to being on the outdoor roof area, so I cannot comment on it. The indoor bar and doing areas were lovely. I loved the breakfast too. The Eggs, ordered the way you like them, were amazing.",5,2019,04,28
15,Very good experience in the Gòtic district of Barcelona,"Very good in every way!
Staff was very friendly and helpful. 
I loved my room with a part of the ancient Roman wall inside. 
Breakfast was good but not as complete as announced on the menu (I didn’t ask why). Dinner was exquisite and very tasty (at the Mercer Restaurant). Loved the various tapas and the coziness of the gastrobar (we went there twice). 
Nice rooftop with chairs and a small swimming pool (that we didn’t use because of a bad weather). 
Even if the city was too touristic and a bit dirty to me, the hotel was excellent and if I happen to come back to Barcelona, I ll choose the Mercer for sure. ",5,2019,04,28
15,A hidden gem in Barcelona ,Had a great three nights at the Mercer Hotel. Its a beautiful hotel tucked away from the busy streets of Barcelona. Their staff are friendly and helpful in every way. They made our stay very comfortable and helped us book restaurants that were very popular. Very quiet hotel which I really liked despite being around busy streets full of locals and tourists. ,5,2019,04,28
15,Wonderful hotel,"Highly recommend this hotel.  From the minute we arrived, the staff was so incredible.  We had a very long international flight that had us arriving to the hotel at 7am.  The front desk staff graciously offered us a room to nap/freshen up for a few hours before we started our day in the city and then moved our luggage to our room later in the day.  We had booked one of the suites which was a beautiful room, though the noise from the restaurant below can be loud on certain nights.  Other than the noise (which is not a reflection of this great hotel), our staff was absolutely perfect.  ",5,2019,04,25
15,"Mercer Hotel, Barcelona","Wonderful, elegant hotel with a very attentive staff who went out of their way to make arrangements for football tickets, concerts, and dinner reservations at some top restaurants.

15,Exquisite boutique hotel is great neighborhood,"This beautiful hotel is tucked in a historic section of Barcelona's Gothic Quarter. Its a wonderful neighborhood to explore, day and night. Inside the hotel, remnants of the old city walls have been left exposed in some of the interior spaces. We loved all the art work and interior design. Our room looked out into a light well with a wall of plants cascading several stories down.  The staff was incredibly kind and attentive, from the moment we entered into the hotel to every question we had about the neighborhood, restaurants to recommend, and directions we needed. We also loved the roof deck. We found ourselves up there after a long day of walking all over the city, for a well-needed respite. Don't miss the little library and reading space, filled with books on art, architecture and cooking. ",5,2019,04,18
15,European Charm at its Finest!,"This was our first visit to Barcelona and we booked this hotel based on other Trip Advisor reviews, and a recommendation from a friend to stay in the Bari Gotic quarter.  Wow!  Not much else to say other than that.  The location, quality of the hotel furnishings and amenities, and friendliness of the ENTIRE hotel staff made for a truly memorable experience.  All expectations were exceeded, and this city, and this hotel in particular, is a place we truly hope to visit again one day!",5,2019,04,18

15,Beyond Perfect. ,"Put simply, this is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at and we have nothing but extremely good, positive things to say about it, and everyone who works there. We travelled as a very loved up couple. 

The Mercer is situated in the very heart of the gothic quarter of Barcelona and has been built inside medieval walls and a palace. This is demonstrated to you by the ever-helpful staff once you check in, where you are also offered free cava or orange juice, and some deliciously tasty sweet petit fours. When you are shown around the hotel and to your room by the concierge you will be blown away; not just be the history of the place, but also the way it has been tastefully converted into a luxury hotel, replete with delightfully soothing and subtle decorations, without ruining any of the original features.

We stayed in a Queen room and were extremely impressed with the layout and size of it. Two of the walls were the original Roman ones, and the ceiling was a 300 year old (I think) wooden beamed affair which was absolutely stunning. The room had an amazing rainfall shower in a wet room (other reviewers have commented on the floor being loose in here. It is slatted so designed to drain the water away. It isn’t loose to the point where you’d fall over!), a separate toilet, and an open plan sink and make up area which opened out into the room itself. Once again, all of the room fixtures and fittings were really tasteful, of high quality and matched the soothing history of the hotel perfectly. The bed itself was huge, and fitted with the most luxurious bedding and pillows you could possibly imagine. 

Because our room was located at the front of the hotel, and therefore overlooking one of the very narrow medieval streets, it was pleasantly shaded, but had a lovely balcony and some huge walk-through patio doors opening onto it if you wanted to enjoy the atmosphere of the street in the comfort of the room. We were more than happy with the level of light in the room (it was beautiful and romantic) but there were plenty of lights available in the room itself should you want to brighten things up a little. There is a free mini bar (stocked with Cola, two fruit juices, two sparkling waters and two still waters) and enough Molton Brown toiletries to keep even the cleanest of people happy. There is also a coffee pod machine and a flat screen television (which we didn’t watch once!).

In terms of the other areas of the hotel, we had several firm favourites....

Firstly, the cocktail bar at the rear of the ground floor (and which is adjacent to a beautiful internal courtyard filled with orange trees and lovely seating) and the wonderful Carmen who works there. We found Carmen to be an absolute delight throughout our holiday and we left our cocktail choices entirely to her. She never failed to produce something absolutely delicious and tailor made to my girlfriend and I, and she was extremely warm and friendly at all times too. 

Occasionally when staying at hotels you meet a member of staff who goes above and beyond, and who is a total credit to the hotel in question. Carmen was and is definitely that, and she really enhanced what was already a truly amazing, memorable holiday for us. I hope the management of the hotel read this and give her the credit she deserves.

Our next favourite place was Le Bouchon, the informal tapas/wine bar attached the hotel. We ordered plenty of food from here during our stay, and plenty of wine, and it was all absolutely delicious and in the case of the food, freshly cooked. The young gentleman serving in there (we didn’t catch his name sadly) was another credit to the hotel and could not have been more friendly and helpful. 

Lastly, the roof terrace was a stunning area for us to relax and soak up the sun. There is a pool up there too but with it being off season it was not filled. There is also a bar but again, with it being off season, the bar staff were replaced with a phone to ring downstairs. This worked really well and our drinks arrived in no time at all. 

We ate breakfast on one day in the hotel and were served with tea, coffee, a delicious fresh fruit salad, a buffet of pastries, cakes etc and hot food cooked to order; poached eggs in our case. This breakfast was served in the other restaurant hotel which also offers evening meals. We prefer more informal dining so did not try it so cannot review that aspect of the hotel at all. 

To summarise, this is an absolutely stunning hotel in every way. It is perfectly located (Las Ramblas is 5 minutes away, the beach 10 minutes away and we walked to the Sagrada Familia in 25 minutes and Park Guell in 35 minutes), the rooms and hotel in general are beautiful, the staff can’t do enough for you (especially Carmen) and are unerringly lovely and polite and we really, really cannot find a single fault. We will absolutely be back when we fancy another romantic Barcelona adventure. ",5,2019,04,08
15,Perfection!,"Everything about our stay was excellent. The hotel felt like a respite from the city- the wide hallways and high ceilings were a pleasant change from the narrow corridors of the gothic quarter. The staff was so kind and eager to help. The rooms were big, quiet and nicely appointed. It was no doubt a 5* hotel but felt much more like staying at a good friends house- welcoming, comfortable and relaxed. I will stay here every time I come back to Barcelona. It is my absolute favorite hotel. Thank you for a wonderful stay!!",5,2019,04,08

15,Absolutely Amazing,"My travel in Barcelona was for business and I was lucky enough to of stayed in this hotel. The pictures online are great, however I did not anticipate how nice it would actually be.

I arrived late and was greeted with a lovely glass of Cava and great staff. I was in a junior suite - The room was amazing, bright, spacious, free mini bar and very comfy bed! 

The location is also superb, right in the centre but tucked away from the noise. I can not fault a thing, the staff really make the hotel they cannot do enough for you. In my opinion, the price is pretty great for the overall experience. I am planning to come back in the next few weeks with my partner to the hotel and look forward to showing her the fantastic service I had the pleasure to encounter here!

Thank you Mercer hotel",5,2019,04,04
15,My favorite hotel in a long time,"Absolutely amazing staff! 
Location is fabulous and I loved my room and the serenity of the decor.

I’d highly recommend to anyone considering a boutique, quiet, tasteful hotel in the heart of the Gothic quarter",5,2019,03,27
15,Fabulous hotel 😀👍🏼,Mercer is a charming hotel in the back alleys of the gothic quarter.  The property is completely updated but retains the local mystique.  Staff is fabulous and warm.  Our room was wonderful: my wife and I could have just moved in!,5,2019,03,22
15,"Lovely Hotel, Great Service!","There is absolutely nothing I could complain about at this hotel. The rooms were spacious, the food was excellent, and the staff were knowledgeable + friendly. Although we weren't able to eat in the restaurant for dinner, I thoroughly enjoyed their breakfast. Moreover, the hotel is arguably in one of the best locations in the city. Probably within a 30-minute walking distance of anything you'd want to see! 

Would 100% stay again. ",5,2019,03,22
15,Fabulous hotel in the gothic quarter,"We loved the Mercer. It’s a lovely renovation, with bright, spacious rooms and super comfy beds. Excellent breakfast, one of the best hotel breakfast we have ever had.

We have no hesitation recommending it. We will be back!",5,2019,03,16
15,Heaven on earth,We stayed here for 7 nights. The staff was over the top. The room was delightful and so quiet. The breakfast was superb each morning.

15,Wonderful Hotel in the middle of the Gothic center,"We spent two days in Barcelona to discover the city. The hotel was perfectly placed in the middle of the old town with a lot of places worth visiting in Walking distance. The hotel staff is extremly friendly and helpful, the room was perfect, with a window to the inner courtyard, absolutely quiet!
There are many nice bars, restaurants and shopping possibilities very close to the hotel.
The breakfast was very good, with a nice choice of fresh dishes and the serving persona very frindly and hellpful and allways at our disposition when needed. 
The hotel is quite expensive but worth the price. For a short trip we would highly recommend this high standard hotel.

Food is beautifully presented and delicious. Above all the staff is friendly and helpful. Overall a lovely stay we hope to repeat.,5,2019,03,01
15,Outstanding Hotel,"If you are going to visit Barcelona and want to stay in the Gothic area then this is your place - great location to walk around to shopping, dining, parks and the water.  Roof top deck is beautiful and relaxing on top of the wonderful rooms and general/common space.",5,2019,03,01
15,AMAZING!!!,"My family and I recently stayed in this hotel during our 3-day visit to Barcelona.  All I can say is WOW...from the moment we walked into the door.  A lovely doorman saw us down the street with our luggage and realized we were lost.  He made the correct assumption we were looking for the Mercer Hotel.  He came to find us and escorted us a very short distance to the hotel.  Once inside, the place was GORGEOUS!  The lobby was stunning, yet quaint, with a very European feel.  The rooms were large and comfortable, the bed was superb!!  Let's talk about hospitality and customer service...what a delight.  Everyone at the hotel bent over backwards for us and made sure we had absolutely everything we needed!  They even made gluten-free croissants for my son, which is nearly impossible to find.  I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone considering a trip to Barcelona.  The location of the hotel is perfect too for all the sightseeing you may want to do.",5,2019,02,28
15,Absolutely Perfect,"This hotel was beautiful and the staff was amazing.. You were in the center of town so very close to everything.  My husband wasn't feeling well and we were looking for something very bland to eat and the hotel went out of their way to make it even though it wasn't something they typically make.  Thank you, thank you and thank you. ",5,2019,02,25
15,Wonderful hotel,We had a very pleasant 3 day break. The service was second to none. Staff very friendly and helpful. The attention to detail is superb. Breakfast is to die for. The location is good and we would definitely staff here again. ,5,2019,02,24
15,Beautiful trip,"This hotel was perfect for our little trip. The hotel staff were so accommodating and helpful. They helped us with tickets, family restaurants nearby and even helped retrieve my bag from leaving it in the taxi upon arrival! Perfect little location for walks around the Gothic Quarter and to catch the bus for the tours! There's lots to explore here - then finish with a nice cocktail in the hotel bar! ",5,2019,02,18
15,Mercer Hotel Barcelona: Mui Bueno!,"Great location (but some cab drivers reluctant to drive all the way to the front door.....walk is a couple of blocks), great service, lovely rooms, good food in Bistro and Restaurant.  5-Star in my opinion.",5,2019,02,16
15,A genuine pearl nestled in the most unique location,"The Mercer offered us a unique experience for a romantic week-end in Barcelona. 
Nestled in the Ghotic area, the richest and most authentic part of the city, the Mercer is a combination of Elegant Luxury, refinement, outstanding architecture and design, served by the most professional,  generous, discrete and efficient service.
No other luxury boutique hotel in Barcelona reaches this high level of comfort and elegance.
We will happily come again very soon!

15,Short BreaK,Wonderful hotel with exceptional serviceWell worth the price of the hotel you couldn't beat the service and location.It is well worth going on a saints day as there was music in the  square in the evening and day time on the weekend. Lovely to listen to and to see everyone dancing in the street. A real treat.,5,2019,02,11
15,Weekend Getaway,"It was the most amazing stay we ever had! I have to start how nice the customer service was. We value a lot of human connection, we felt cared, important and thought trough everything we could need. Everything else was just stunning - beautiful, comfortable, quiet, clean and so on. Thank you!",5,2019,02,09
15,The Mercer Hotel a Gem!,Tricking to find but worth the journey. Joan Manuel is the best!!!!! This gem located in the heart of Gothic area of Barcelona is a great hotel with an outstanding staff.  The rooms are elegant and the hotel is well appointed. ,5,2019,02,04
15,Everything is about the service,"Beyond location which is at the heart of the Gothic Square, nearby Cathedral an other places of interest, the quality of service is superb. Personally, it is difficult these days, even in places where tip is customary, to find real/true customer service. Personnel is well trained. They meet and greet, they asked how you are doing and how they can be of service to you. I would have not depend on them to get advise on places to visit or restaurants to eat at if it was not because they were always curious to ask and help out. ",5,2019,02,04
15,Outstanding quality and service,Stayed here for a special birthday. From the moment we arrived until we left the service was brilliant. Beautiful hotel in a perfect location. One of the best hotels I’ve stayed in - and we are in the hospitality business. Advice to other travellers- pay a little more for this exceptional hotel - it’s worth it!,5,2019,02,02
15,Best Hotel Staff in Barcelona,"The entire staff at the Mercer was amazing! Unfortunately, my mom fell down some stairs and broke her shoulder while we were in Barcelona. The staff was very attentive and made sure my mom had ice packs for her shoulder and even arranged the ambulance to take us to the hospital to get her checked out. Marcos, Edward, and Louis were so kind and wonderful to me and my mom throughout our stay in Barcelona. My mom was highly impressed with the customer service at the Mercer, as was I. The hotel itself is beautiful, clean, and the food is exceptional! It's perfectly nestled in the Gothic Quarter and is centrally located in the city. Best hotel experience I have ever received! We look forward to staying at the Mercer again in the future! There is no other hotel we would stay at in Barcelona, Mercer is your best bet!",5,2019,01,29

I would highly recommend this for a special hotel experience,5,2019,01,21
15,Perfect in every way,"The Mercer is an outstanding place to stay.  A hotel of the highest quality from the wonderful welcome we received on arrival, the historic location and setting, the beautiful internal and external design of the hotel and the sense of quiet relaxation that it instills from the beginning to the end of our stay.We stayed in a junior suite which was quiet, very spacious, beautifully designed and furnished - giving an instant sense of calm and wellbeing - and spotlessly maintained.  Like having your own super luxury flat in the heart of Barcelona.  The in house restaurant was not operating for dinner (we stayed in early January) but recommened restsurants Pla and Cafe de L’Academia were first class and within 2 minutes walk of the hotel.  It all added up to a truly wonderful and memorable stay and we look forward to coming back again soon.  Highly recommended.",5,2019,01,19
15,Exceptionally warm and caring staff made out stay very special. The hotel was beautiful the staff caring and compassiona,"
This boutique hotel and staff provided one of or the finest travel experience we have experienced around the world.  The hotel was charming; the desk staff  housekeeping and concierge magnificent! We can’t wait to come back.   The help in providing details dinners. Things to do. Safe advice. Exciting adventures demonstrated a great fund of knowledge. Everyday juice pastries in morning and cava as well as deserts complementary pastries. We loved everyone and can’t wait to come back ",5,2019,01,10
15,Best night of sleep ever!!!!!," The hotel was all we hope for,  great location,the beds were fantastic!! The intimacy of a small hotel was great! Rooms where large  compared to most we have stayed in Europe in the Mediterranean .  Location is in heart of the old town which was perfect for sightseeing and shopping.  The hotel is in a Historical building  so it feels as if you have step back in time, just amazing.  The staff especially the concierge are five star. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona looking to relax, we can’t wait to go back! ",5,2019,01,04
15,Perfect stay,"Great location for walking around Barcelona, amazing architecture and very nice and helpful staff, concierge knows the area pretty well. Breakfast was very good as well. Tapas bar ist good too, but restaurants in the area are better.",5,2018,12,28
15,Best hotel in Barcelona,"So we stayed in 2 different 5 star hotels during our stay.  The Mercer and hotel Neri.  Both were great!  The location of the Mercer is amazing.  Built in the castle, 12th century wall in the library that I touched.  So to start, we walked up to the hotel and they had a designated door man (Neri did not).  I don't think we opened the door once ourselves.  Check in was a nice experience, as I was met with a choice of water, fresh squeezed oj, or cava (sparking wine).  While I was checking in, one of the employees took our bags up to our room.  I believe they had a separate staircase for the employees.  I don't think that was nessesary, but the person carrying our bags might have appreciated it so he could curse us for our too heavy of bags, without us ever knowing lol.  We are escorted up to our room and we walk into our massive room with beautiful Decor.  The couch was comfy and separate from the bedroom.  Lots of space, beautiful ceiling.  Great coffee.  The whole min bar (all non alcoholic) was complementary.  Which was very nice.  Our bedroom had a designated Canadian power plug in beside the bed.  The bed and pillows was extremely comfy.  The bathroom is off the bedroom.  It was a glass wall which I didn't love because I couldn't go showered without waking my husband.  Otherwise the bathroom was perfect!  The toilet was in a separate room, beautiful bathtub with bath bomb available.  Big counter, nice lighting, great shower separate from the bathtub.  Perfect!  I also live the rooftop patio, comfy chairs, great space.  Not a great view.  Overall this hotel was absolutely amazing!  Thanks to the staff and the decor and all the thought that was put into it.  Even the perfect display of flowers.  LOVED it!",5,2018,12,11
15,Great location,Great location!!! Staff was very friendly and always went the extra mile to try and take care of our wants and needs.  Breakfast was great but not having a lunch or dinner option and a lack of personality in the area called the bar was not in keeping with the hotels overall rating. I would definitely recommend the Mercer for it's location. ,4,2018,12,11
15,an absolutely wonderful experience,"everything about our stay was absolutely wonderful. 
we emailed the concierge ahead of time to book us restaurants, they were very responsive and snagged us reservations at some great places (some we had requested, some suggested by them). 
every employee we encountered went above and beyond, from the doormen to the bartenders to the guest relations staff, these people know how to make guests feel welcome and important. 
our room was lovely, comfortable and well appointed with a great bathroom and quality linens. 
it was our tenth wedding anniversary and they surprised us with rose petals scattered on our bed, a beautiful cake and a bottle of cava when we returned from dinner.
one night the bartender suggested a cocktail for my wife and she loved it. the next night a different bartender was on duty and my wife tried to describe the drink, the bartender said "" don't worry, I know what it is, last nights bartender left me a message telling me what she made for you"", that's what I call great service !!!!!  
the location is great, on a quiet alley in the gothic quarter, within walking distance of just about everything we wanted to visit in Barcelona. 
I cannot find fault with anything about our stay.  
Bravo Mercer Barcelona, you made our stay very special indeed.",5,2018,11,26
15,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"What a treasure this hotel is!!  We found this hotel on Trip Advisor and it had excellent reviews so we decided to book it for our 3 night stay in Barcelona before our cruise.  We printed the hotel directions off their web site so we could give them to our taxi driver but he refused to take them.  He dropped us off at the bottom of a narrow street and told us to walk straight and then turn left.  Hotel will be right there.  He failed to mention the steep hill we had to go up before we reached the hotel,  As we were struggling up the hill (we don't pack lightly...) a man came running down the street towards us...its was the concierge from the hotel asking if we were looking for the Mercer Hotel.  He immediately took our luggage to the hotel.
The hotel was amazing...we were welcomed by friendly staff and a glass of Cava.  
Our room was fantastic and with a wonderful walk in shower.  We had tapas for dinner in the hotel that night.  Our Concierge recommended two fabulous restaurants for our other two evenings.
The hotel is in an excellent location for walking around the Gothic area.
Breakfast was very good and the breakfast room was lovely.
We loved our stay in Barcelona very much and if we should find ourselves planning another trip to Barcelona, we will stay at the Mercer.",5,2018,11,21
15,Contemporary restoration of old world charm in Bari Gotic,"Lovely hotel on a narrow street tucked away in the Gothic Quarter. The service was impeccable, the concierge extremely helpful and the courtyard and rooftop terrace were stunning. We stayed three days and walked the city each day from our hotel. It was a very authentic stay in Barcelona, and I would recommend this hotel to those looking for quality and service.",5,2018,11,16
15,our feedback,"A plus for location, services, comfort and convenience. We were celebrating my wife's 70th birthday and the staff went beyond the call of duty to make this celebration special. It exceeded our expectations. Thank you!!",5,2018,11,09
15,Excellent service! Fantastic rooms ,"It goes without saying that I am impressed by the level of service the team showed during my stay. Hearing that my flight was late at night and since it was the start of the low season, the hotel offered me a late checkout without any fuss. Doormen and concierge were a great team suggesting where to go and where to eat without pushing the hotel’s own restaurant. Staff would immediately attend to any concerns and even send somebody to the room to clarify how the room works. Everybody knows your name and addresses you nicely. Kudos to the hotel’s team! 

The hotel facilities are superb. Our room faced the courtyard and was quiet. Interiors are tastefully decorated and blends perfectly to the the old structure of the building that is also attached to the old Roman walls of the old city. Beds were very big California King size beds perfect for real grown people. Location was also nice since it’s inside the gothic quarter. ",5,2018,11,07
15,Probably the best hotel we’ve ever stayed in!,We had the most amazing stay at your hotel. Check in was a delight especially the lovely glass of cava after a long and tiring journey. It’s an absolutely stunning building and so lovely to see how the old and new have been merged to create such a wonderful space. The staff are incredible. They took so much pride in the building and explained the history of it to us. They welcomed us by name and made us feel very special. A special mention must go to Marcos and Edward. They are both a credit to your company. Edward was amazingly helpful. He recommended the best places for us to have a drink or to have a meal and quite often would walk with us to show us the way when they were close to the hotel. Both Marcos and Edward recommended great places and would book them for us without us even asking. It was very hard to leave and I hope to visit again soon. If only all hotels could be like The Mercer!,5,2018,11,04
15,Absolutely wonderful boutique hotel!,"Everything about this place is charming ... the location, the facility and the staff.  All lovely   If you would enjoy being in the old city in walking distance to practically all of the things that make Barcelona interesting, this is the place to stay. Cozy, quaint old world surround you in every direction. I highly recommend this property!",5,2018,11,04

15,Honeymoon in Barce,"The only place to stay in Barcelona! My wife and I stayed at the Mercer for our honeymoon and were very impressed by the level of service of the hotel staff, the hotel decor and ambience, and very convenient location in the old city. Strongly recommend staying here for business or pleasure!",5,2018,10,31

15,Vacation in Barcelona,"A wonderful hotel. It is quiet, clean and all the staff are friendly and extremely helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

15,BCN 2018,4 day sweet stay at Mercer is the heart of the Gothic Quarter of BCN.  Walking distance to everything you want to do while there.  Check out the Born neighborhood and other surrounding areas soo though. Follow the signs for the history of mid evil BCN info! ,5,2018,10,15
15,Wonderful Hotel - Wonderful Staff,"We stayed at this beautiful hotel - conveniently located in the heart of the atmospheric Gothic Quarter - for 5 nights.  From the moment we arrived the door and reception staff were welcoming, helpful and extremely charming.  Our room, overlooking a central courtyard, was quiet and tranquil, pale walls and painted beams of the original building contrasting with all the contemporary, personal touches associated with a top class boutique hotel.  (After asking for fresh milk for our tea on day one, this appeared in our fridge each day thereafter).  The breakfasts, served in an intimate restaurant space, were delicious - small culinary works of art on a plate, beautifully presented and served by attentive waiting staff.  We also ate at La Bouchon, the hotel's tapas bar, which offered a good selection of wines and small plates in an informal atmosphere at very fair prices.  I simply cannot praise the staff highly enough for their courteous service.  We were greeted personally, by name, each day.  The concierge service was second to none with helpful tailored recommendations for itineraries and dining out.  Special thanks go to Silvina who welcomed us with glasses of cava, gave us a short tour of the hotel - including the delightful roof terrace - engaged us in conversation about art, architecture and fashion, and greeted us like old friends whenever she was on duty.  This is a very special hotel in a wonderful city.  We can't wait to visit again.",5,2018,10,14
15,Great location with excellent service,I stayed 3 nights in the Mercer. The location is bang in the middle of the Gotic quarter and is ideal for exploring Barcelona. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. I would rate the service excellent. One minor point is that the Wifi in the rooms is not very strong/stable. They should make an investment in improving that. But as soon as I complained about it a separate dongle was arranged for me that I could use for the rest of my stay.,5,2018,10,13
15,Perfection,"I can't say enough about how much I loved this hotel: it's location, it's amazing architecture and design, and above all, it's superlative staff, which were absolutely one-of-a-kind and on a level I've never experienced. It's location in the Barri Gotic just adds to the magic. Our room was a blend of ancient and sleek, as was the entire hotel. Breakfast in the courtyard was unforgettable - breakfast!  It's a special, special place in my favorite city in the world and I can't wait to return.",5,2018,09,30
15,Wonderful hotel,"Excellent location, food was delicious and extremely comfortable bed with modern spacious room but still keeping the integrity of the building. The staff could not have been more helpful or friendly.   I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.",5,2018,09,27
15,Boutique hotel - fantastic ,"Beautiful hotel set in the old part of Barcelona. No cars in this part of the city. Five star service but only a small hotel so feels quiet. Clientele were more mature without being old and crusty. 

Only disappointment was the rooftop pool is only a plunge pool. I was expecting bigger. 

Definitely return. ",5,2018,09,26
15,Best Hotel in Barcelona,Excellent stay from arrival to departure.   Incredible staff who made us feel very welcome and cared for.   We appreciated all they did to make our stay at the hotel and visit to Barcelona the best ever . ,5,2018,09,24
15,"Wonderful location, excellent staff, expensive.","This was our second stay in three years so I’m a fan of this boutique hotel right in the centre of the Gothic Quarter. The staff are the perfect mix of professional, proactive and friendly with a special mention for the guy who manages the tapas bar.  It does feel, on occasion, that the demanding American clients who proliferate, get the most attention. Even the junior suite rooms are compact and the lighting levels are abysmal. I understand this is a historic building in a historic area which impacts natural light levels but there is no reason not to have addressed this internally. There is no point in a seating area if you can’t see to read there! That said, I suspect we’ll be back again as for me the combination of location and service levels are worth the pretty hefty price tag.",4,2018,09,22
15,Hotel,Amazing staff who were so helpful and were there to cater for all your needs. Great location. Exceptional service. Check in friendly and very efficient with a welcome glass of champagne. Highly recommend ,5,2018,09,22
15,Superb hotel,Beautiful setting and absolutely brilliant staff. Welcomed with a glass of Champagne on arrival from the incredible staff and then checked into our beautiful room. Rooftop bar was another highlight as was the service by Sam the bartender and his signature cocktail. Very memorable experience ,5,2018,09,19
15,Could Easily Be A 5*,"As well described in the TA reviews, the Mercer Hotel indeed has some very fine qualities. We particularly liked the location in the Gothic section, as well as the very creative blend of Roman, Gothic, and contemporary design and construction. The common areas of the hotel are truly stunning. 

The location of the hotel in the ancient Gothic section is a definite major plus, but many of very narrow streets around the Mercer are blocked to vehicles. While a taxi driver who knows the correct path can come directly to the front door. But without specific instructions, taxis often  discharge passengers several blocks from the hotel. A simple solution would be to prominently include specific instructions with room confirmations for arriving guest to provide taxi drivers. It would also be handy to have a small preprinted card in each guestroom with clear instructions for guests returning to the hotel during their stay to provide to taxi drivers during the stay.

A significant flaw for us was our $935/day Junior Suite was dark, actually cave-like. There are other complaints on TA reviews about the Mercer’s dark rooms with management responding that they can bring in additional lights upon request, so I also made this request. This was a clumsy solution given that the entire suite was short on receptacles. Placing a single extra floor lamp (so we could see the cloths in our closet) required stringing a cord across the floor. 

Some recessed puck lights in the ceiling and/or a couple of sconce lights, plus a couple of puck lights in the closet, would greatly improve the ambiance of the suite. Also dark awnings block a large part of the natural lighting that would otherwise come through the windows. The awnings need to be retracted or a lighter, translucent fabric used. 

Ending on a positive note, we agree with the many TA reviews mentioning the courteous, helpful, and friendly staff. Our interactions with the reception staff, the two concierge, the bartender (Carmen) were all very positive. Now, let there be light. 

I rate the Mercer a 4 out of 5, with a 5 easily attainable with some added lighting in the guest rooms.",4,2018,09,19
15,Great place to stay in Barcelona ,We stayed at the Mercer Hotel for 8 days and had great service throughout our stay. The hotel is a great location - walking distance to most things. The breakfast was one of the best we’ve ever had. I’d stay here again,5,2018,09,16
15,25th wedding Anniversary,"This place was perfect for celebrating our 25th. The staff was impeccable and anticipated our every need. The concierge services were exceptional. Each restaurant recommendation exceeded our expectations. From the lovely arrival amenity to the champagne toast on our actual Anniversay, I could not ask for anything more. It was truly the most romantic getaway!",5,2018,09,13
15,TOP Hotel with TOP Staff!!,We come again to the Hotel Mercer in Barcelona!!We enjoyed the great atmosphere in the hotel.The staff in the hotel was very helpful and very friendly.The location of the hotel is very central and many can be reached on foot.,5,2018,09,08
15,A gem in the Gothic quarter,"We came here already twice for a long weekend in Barcelona. We are totally in love with the place, the staff, the food and the atmosphere. It is a little paradise in the center of Barcelona. Everything from the rooftop terrace to the spacious room was just perfect. We were both times very warmly welcomed and enjoyed an impeccable service from every single staff member. Not only are they very attentive and kind, they also got out of their way to satisfy any of our wishes. We will definitely come back on another visit and can highly recommend this place. Outstanding!",5,2018,09,03
15,Stay at the Mercer,"On the positive side, the location was great and the staff couldn't have been better! If it wasn't for them, I think I would have been very disappointed.I got a basic room, and was sad to see how dark it was, but understood because the buildings are close together that face the street, so causing shadows. But the lighting in the room was terrible. There was a mix of florescent and amber. This needs work, as it can make your room feel more dingy. I also didn't like walking into the room and seeing the sink. The smaller rooms have the sink (vanity) right in your room. I have stayed at many small hotels in New York and they seem to work the layout better. I think some of the decor was questionable, so over all I think the price is a bit overrated for the room.",3,2018,09,02
15,Perfect charming hotel,Perfect hotel with very friendly service. Extremely nice rooms. The beds and furniture are extreely comfortable.The roof top terrace and swimming pool is very nice with perfect cocktails served between the green plants. ,5,2018,09,02
15,Boutique luxury with fantastic location,"My partner and I stayed at the Mercer for 6 nights in August. 

Our room was both thoughtfully designed and elegantly furnished. The location was absolutely perfect for us to head out on foot to a new location each day, all within walking distance if you are so inclined. If you prefer, despite the narrow streets, the adept and helpful concierges are able to arrange taxis to the hotel's front door. They also arranged a wonderful day trip for us on our last day to Aigua Blava, a stunning beach on the Costa Brava.

For comparison, we have stayed in several wonderful hotels over the years (including the Datai Langkawi, Liku Liku Lagoon Fiji, Capella Lodge Lord Howe Island) and on this trip the Henrietta Hotel Covent Garden and La Divine Comedie Avignon, which I have reviewed also. Our experience at the Mercer was easily on par with these hotels.",5,2018,08,31
15,Unbeatable experience- they spoiled us,The staff made this place. So helpful and nice. They booked us tours. Ordered us cans and made sure the drivers knew exactly where to take us. Their tips were excellent. Beautiful hotel in a perfect location. I did not want to leave. I thought check out was at 3Pm which it was at noon. At 2PM I received a very nice call asking if we wanted to extend our stay. I was very embarrassed at my mistake but they made me feel very comfortable and not awkward. Awesome beginning to our honeymoon.,5,2018,08,30
15,Beautiful Boutique Hotel That Will Take You Back In Time,"This hotel was amazing from the first moment we arrived. It is literally tucked away down a narrow street that even our taxi driver looked back at us in the rearview mirror! But the staff was expecting us and came out even before we reached the door. From that moment we knew we had chosen well! Not only did they honor a price change from when we booked they upgraded us to a beautiful Junior Suite. We had the most wonderful breakfasts, a delightful afternoon tapas on our balcony overlooking the quaint courtyard, a beautiful confection and bottle of champagne found in our room for our anniversary, 2 extremely friendly and knowledgeable concierges who took care of everything for us, (one even sent us to a speakeasy in a charcuterie shop that served the MOST delightful cocktails in the MOST amazing environment!), all within the walls of the Barrio Gotic which transformed us back in time! Thank you to all of the staff at the Mercer Hotel! There can be no finer choice!",5,2018,08,29
15,Great hotel!,"Located in the Gothic area, and built on a Roman wall, this place is amazing. All through the building you can see the history pop out. Staff is really friendly and the guest rooms are very comfortable. The quiet rooftop area is very pleasant after a hot day in the city. it seems to be for hotel guests only, so you don't have the crowds you sometimes see at other hotel rooftops. Don't leave without enjoying their amazing breakfast.",5,2018,08,28
15,"Memorable Hotel, Staff, and Location","Everything at this unique boutique hotel was top notch.  The concierge was so helpful and found us a rental stroller delivery after our unsuccessful attempt to buy one.  They surprised our kids with two platters of cookies goodies and milk on our first night, which made them feel very special.  The staff are all warm and welcoming. The breakfast was absolutely amazing.  The location is quite unique.  We'd stay there again in a heartbeat.",5,2018,08,26
15,Beautiful Barcelona,"Best hotel in Barcelona! amazing, great location, staff are fantastic! roof top pool, bar, restaurant all great. Rooms were great too.This hotel exudes boutique luxury, a quiet oasis in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. ",5,2018,08,21
15,Awesome hotel in perfect location,We stayed at this awesome hotel for 2 nights during our recent visit to Barcelona. We had requested early checkin and we got it. The hotel is located in gothic quarter and is perfectly centrally located . It is within 5 minutes of many key attractions including great restaurants.  We loved our stay here and in Barcelona and would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2018,08,20
15,Wonderful hotel,"The Mercer Hotel was excellent service and quality. The location is perfect within the gothic quarter, the hotel itself is wonderfully designed and the staff were extremely helpful with dining recommendations around the city",5,2018,08,20
15,Fabulous,"Great hotel in the Gothic Quarter.  Its expensive and it fills up fast.  I try and book 4-5 months ahead if I need to make a trip to Barcelona. 

Its located on a tiny street and I personally love the quiet nature of its location after a day of business meetings.  Superb restaurants nearby.  My favorite hotel in Barcelona.

Rooms are comfortable and well set up in all respects.  Staff is first rate.  Very attentive.  You get what you paid for.",5,2018,08,18
15,Great location and amazing staff,"My wife and I arrived at the Mercer hotel prior to check-in our room wasn’t ready but the accommodated us with beach towels, snacks, and instructions for a prime beach location. Our stay continued to have this amazing service and the restaurant recommendations were great! Next time we return to Barcelona we are definitely staying at the Mercer.",5,2018,08,17
15,Perfect weekend!!!!,"Great hotel, perfect location, very friendly and competent staff! We had a wonderful breakfast and delicious snacks at the rooftop bar with a great view over the City! We will come again in this beautiful place!!! ",5,2018,08,16
15,Absolutely the best hotel!,"My family stayed there for 2 nights. Everything is the highest quality. The staff was so excellent. Their smiles are from the bottom of their hearts, not the service smiles. For a well travelled person and family, we place this hotel absolutely on top of places we have stayed around the world!",5,2018,08,15
15,Five Star Service & Stay,"Having vacationed at some of the best hotels, we did our research when choosing the Mercer based on reviews and location.  But our stay far exceeded our expectations. The service provided by the caring and accomodating staff truly made our first trip to Barcelona one to remember for years to come. 

While the hotel is pristine and full of charm and character, the staff is what really makes this hotel top notch.  Upon entering you are immediately greeted with friendly smiles and warm welcomes.  This continues throughout your stay, with staff remembering your names and going above and beyond to make sure you are enjoying

My husband briefly mentioned that I was pregnant and they surprised us in our room with pregnancy themed desserts and a lovely card. They really go the extra mile to add that extra special touch that differentiates them from any other hotel. 

Our stay was not long enough but thats even better so that now we can now have a reason to return to this fabulous hotel and once again enjoy all it has to offer.",5,2018,08,15
15,A little Gem in the city,"I can't say enough about this boutique hotel.  The hotel is built in the old roman aqueduct which gives it a wonderful character. The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  The roof top pool is a amazing get-a-way in the heart of the bustling old city.  The location is coveninet to may shops, museums and churches.  It is a short walk to the ocean also.  I highly recommend a couple nights stay at this hotel if you are coming to Barcelona. ",5,2018,08,14
15,just points about dissatisfaction.,"location is good but not good with taxi. no speaker in a room. restaurants close 11:00pm. it’s early time to drink wine in spain. 
breackfast is not spanish style and too much formal. not cosy with high uttanded staffs.",3,2018,08,13
15,Fantastic staff,"I can't say enough about how great the staff was.  Always available, always cheerful, helped with luggage, laundry, dinner recommendations and reservatioins, taxis, tours, directions, etc.  Even though it was my first stay, they made me feel like I was an honored guest.  

The facility was a perfect blend of old and new; located in the Barri Gotti, but everything was new.  Despite record setting hot temperatures, the room was deliciously cool, and the mattress and linens were very high quality and super comfortable.  

The location is also quite convenient--close enough to walk to the beach, La Rambla, Santa Maria del Mar, the bouqeria, Placa Reial, etc..  I liked the fact that the hotel is on a narrow, somewhat hidden side street, so it was very intimate and quiet.  

I would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,08,07
15,Outstanding!,"From start to finish my experience at the Mercer Hotel Barcelona was fantastic. The staff is so genuinely friendly and welcoming and everyone was so attentive to every last detail. The Mercer hotel is a gem located in the gothic district. The taxis and Uber were on strike during my stay, but the hotel is only a block away from a Metro station. I found the Metro extremely easy to use to get around. The concierge helped me buy tickets to all of the things that I wanted to do and had excellent recommendations for restaurants and things to do during my stay. The room was lovely and the bed and bedding was top quality. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,08,06
15,The Best!!,"We began our 3 week European vacation in Barcelona! This Hotel was had the best service, staff from all of the luxury hotels we visited! They helped us with our pre arranged drivers, from making sure they were on their way to driving the van down the street because the driver couldn't! They had water and towels for us when we returned from a walk in the heat. Made a last minuet reservation for us just by asking if they new of certain place for dinner.
 The breakfast every morning was wonderful! We had dinner there once and it was fantastic with excellent service. We also went to the Tapas bar they had. It had wonderful items! 
 I have recommended this hotel to others already!",5,2018,07,30
15,Extraordinary service - great people and perfect location.,"We stayed at the Mercer as a family - 2 adults and 2 teenage daughters on our first visit to Barcelona and it was amazing.
As many reviews have noted, the staff are totally customer focused and nothing seems too difficult to manage and they went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable - booking ours, restaurants, suggesting walks etc.
The hotel location is in the Gothic area amidst the old Roman City with lovel cool narrow streets and small shops and eateries. Great location to launch Bercelona exploration - close to the beach, parks and zoo and an easy taxi ride (or bike ride) to tourist locations.
Inside the hotel you are greeted with high ceilings, exposed ancient stone courtesy of the old city and large rooms. It is a beautiful, airy hotel witha great feel.
We would stay here again in a heartbeat ... amazing hotel !!",5,2018,07,28
15,A Tranquil Refuge in Bustling Barcelona,"We were initially booked at another hotel by the water but after waiting there for our room to be ready in a hellishly loud environment for over an hour and 1/2 I had had enough, demanded a refund and then looked for a high end, boutique hotel on line. Mercer Hotel had 1 room left and I booked it asap! As soon as we got there I knew it was the right place for us. We were welcomed with a complimentary Cava (Spanish Champagne), lots of peace and quiet and an immaculately clean room.
Every single staff member at The Mercer went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and welcome. They were all so friendly and helpful. We don't speak a spec of Spanish (sadly) but they did not seem to be disturbed by this at all. It was so quiet and peaceful inside but once you step out into the street you had everything at your fingertips. The location was fabulous - near restaurants, activities, amazing gothic architecture, etc. We took our breakfast daily in their Orange Tree Courtyard which is open to the sky and such a rejuvenating way to start your day. The food and drinks they serve here are excellent as was the Concierge Team's full service doting on our needs. 
I really can't say enough positive things about The Mercer Barcelona. They saved our trip to Barcelona and I am forever grateful.
",5,2018,07,26
15,Lovely stay!,Me and my daughter stayed for 4 nights and vi had a lovely time. The hotel was perfectly located in the Gotic quarters. Wonderful staff and beautiful environment. The terass was wonderful. I can highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2018,07,26
15,A truly awe-inspiring hotel,"I and my friend had a great time at the hotel. The location is great(It's in the quiet street in Barri Gotic which is most beautiful district in Barcelona and it's close to the catheral, many bars, restaurants and shops). All of the staffs were very helpful and nice. They are excellent. The hotel itself is beautiful. l  It's a truly awe-inspiring hotel!! ",5,2018,07,24
15,Fantastic experience,"From the moment we stepped through the doors of the hotel, we felt welcome and taken care of by the incredibly helpful staff at the Mercer. The concierges were always available with advice and answers to any of our questions. They arranged a guided tour of Sagrida Familia, recommended stellar restaurants, and made travel arrangements. The atmosphere of the hotel was quiet and and a nice break from the hustle and bustle in the streets. The location of the hotel is perfect. Central and close to the Born district where we explored quaint streets and artisan shops. The roof top pool offered a much needed cooling plunge at the end of each day. Our room was well designed, the beds soft and comfortable and the turn down service with the nightly treats and complementary mini bar was above all expectations. Look no further.. this hotel has everything you thought you needed plus so much more!!!!",5,2018,07,21
15,4 day stay in late June,"This is a fantastic hotel. It is small and intimate, with the key positive points being the outstanding service which is the best I have experienced anywhere. It has a great vibe to it and everything about it exudes quality and great customer care. The hotel food is outstanding, with the breakfast offering something to really look forward to. It has a terrific location in the Old City but close enough to normal services such as taxis and restaurants. The concierge service was personal, attentive and gave great advice.",5,2018,07,18
15,Incredible Experience,"Hotel staff is the friendliest and most helpful I've ever experienced.  They absolutely go the extra mile to arrange tours and dinners.  Further, a terrific location to walk the entire town.  Would highly recommend to everyone.  Thank you for making our experience so enjoyable!!!",5,2018,07,18
15,Barcelona Gem,"We booked the Mercer Barcelona for a three night stay in Barcelona with our 15 year old daughter.   Prior to arrival, the concierge was helpful in recommending restaurants and assisting with any questions.  Upon arrival, he helped secure a truly amazing walking tour of the gothic quarter and provided recommendations for other sights to see during our short stay.  The rooms were quiet — beds super comfortable — and breakfast amazing.  The hotel and its staff made our stay relaxing and memorable.  Highly recommend.  ",5,2018,07,17
15,Best service ever!,Everyone gave 100% From confirming our tour reservations or ordering rides..even driving the cab down the tight street when the driver panicked..food was great from breakfast to tapas and dinner. Handing us towels and water after a day of exploring...,5,2018,07,16
15,Best Location and Service,"You cannot ask for more in terms of service.  The most courteous, kind and helpful staff.  Even brought me cake and cava for my birthday!  The location is excellent and cannot be better.
A very special place indeed.",5,2018,07,15
15,Boutique hotel in charming building,"As many reviewers have commented what really makes this property special is the professional care of all the staff.We had 2 issues while we were here and they were dealt with in a very efficient way.
The breakfast was amazing and the food quality was excellent.You really sense the food was made with love.
The rooftop terrace was small yet charming and was a quiet spot to switch off from the town below.
Bedrooms were clean and comfortable.Only negative comment was the size of the toiletries -one squeeze and they were finished.",4,2018,07,15
15,A wonderful stay in Barcelona!,"We were in Barcelona for two nights and loved staying at the Mercer Hotel.  The rooms were lovely and clean (the espresso machine and free drinks in the fridge were a nice bonus), and the staff were warm and super helpful.  Breakfast in the courtyard was delicious.  The location of the hotel in the Gothic Quarter was excellent.  We will definitely stay here again if our travels bring us to Barcelona. ",5,2018,07,14
15,Fabulous Hotel in Historic Quarter,"Everything about our pre-cruise stay at Mercer Hotel was outstanding. It's a beautiful contemporary hotel located on a narrow pedestrian street and built right into the ancient Roman walls of the original part of the city.  Breakfast is served in a gorgeous central open-air courtyard, with many rooms' balconies opening directly onto it. Our suite had the prettiest walled terrace I've ever seen. Service was superb -- gracious yet friendly and accommodating -- with every staff member we encountered genuinely anxious to be of service. The rooftop pool area was a standout and never felt crowded even when fully populated due to its clever configuration with several different seating areas. While the pool is only waist-deep, it's large enough to be a welcoming place to cool off while admiring the Barcelona skyline. The rooftop lounge chairs were exceptionally comfortable and I could have easily spent the entire day on one. The hotel's main bar is also excellent; the generous snacks provided with our evening cocktails could have substituted for our dinner. My only regret is that the restaurant was closed both nights of our stay so we did not have the opportunity to dine there. Oh well, that's just a good excuse for a return visit.",5,2018,07,14
15,Great hotel choice.,Excellent location within walking distance of Ramblas and waterfront. Very friendly and professional staff and attractive rooms. On narrow street so cabs prefer to drop off a short distance away. Not a problem. Great hotel choice. ,5,2018,07,12
15,Lovely Property with Superior Service,"While the Mercer is anchored in history (there's a Roman wall in the restaurant), it's modern, elegant decor and personal touches make it a standout among BCN's newest luxury properties.   Many hotels claim superior service, but the Mercer delivers.  From breakfast in a verdant garden to roof-top cocktails, personalized check-in to incredible concierge attention, the Mercer never disappointed.   For weeks prior to our arrival, we connected with the concierge team of Xavier Sanchis and Joan Manel Salamanca to arrange a private tour of La Sagrada and dinner bookings.  ALL of their recommendations were spot on.   Once on property, they helped us navigate the museum closure schedule and confirm advance tickets (note:  rolling strikes were being held throughout the city, and we could see tourists being turned away from the Picasso Museum daily).   Suffice it to say, by the time our 5 nights were over, we were exchanging hugs rather than hand shakes.  

In addition to service, the food and beverage program is excellent and the location cannot be beat.  Rooms are quiet despite the Gothic location.  

We've stayed at The Serras (and very much enjoyed it, too), but The Mercer is now our go-to in Barcelona.

Tip:  When traveling in from BCN airport some taxi drivers don't like to navigate the narrow streets of the Gothic.  If you've luggage, kindly ask that they take you to hotel the door.   They can do it...  they just might not want to.  The Mercer works with a taxi company who is more than happy to drive to the airport on your departure.  We left at 5:30am, and the car was early.  ",5,2018,07,11
15,Beautiful property in a wonderful neighborhood.,"We stayed at the Mercer for 5 days — it was gorgeous and clean and unique, and such a high touch was placed on every detail and interaction. All of the staff were so classy and kind and friendly, and took care of our every need, down to free sparkling water every day in our room, beautiful robes to relax in, and a lovely turn down service. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. The breakfast was incredible and we also enjoyed the bar. One of our favorite places we have ever stayed!",5,2018,07,11
15,Mercer Barcelona,"A hidden gem in the Gothic hood. Excellent service, very private and quiet. Please make sure your clients understand how to get in and out of the area. It is a very difficult area to understand. Keep up the good service.",4,2018,07,10
15,Loved the Mercer,"Great experience at the Mercer.  Staff was execellent, great room and the hotel is perfectly located in The heart of the Gothic area.  The interior of the hotel is beautiful.   Also, rooftop pool is very nice.",5,2018,07,08
15,The Most Luxurious,"Wow. We had an amazing experience at the Mercer. The staff is unsurpassed - they are efficient and professional while still being warm, friendly, and welcoming. The concierge was always at hand to assist with amazing recommendations and help curate our experience. Architecturally stunning, perfect location, and amazing staff made for a memorable stay that we hope to repeat soon. And, we're still dreaming over the luxurious morning breakfast.",5,2018,07,08
15,Great stay,We only stayed at the Mercer one night on our way back through Barcelona but wished we could have stayed longer. Top notch location and very nice staff. Will definitely stay here when we return to Spain.,5,2018,07,06
15,Flawless Hotel,"We spent a fantastic week at the Mercer in June. Couldn't have been happier with the detailed, attentive service and the gorgeous property -- especially the beautiful, peaceful roof pool. We were there at the peak of the season and never, ever felt crowded or hassled.",5,2018,07,03
15,Exceptional and unique,"I only stayed one night at the Mercer in Barcelona and I was amazed. I booked a junior suite. It had a big balcony facing parts of the Barri Gotic, the old city center. 

The junor suite was roomy and lovely furnished. All was of great elegance but not oppulent which I like a lot. 

I had dinner on the patio of the hotel. Food provided was of superb quality and freshnesss.

Staff was outstanding. Especially Mr Mago Cedeño from the front desk did a great job.

Will come again and recommend to friends and family.",5,2018,07,02
15,Elegant but not ornate or pretentious; Great location,"The entrance, along one of the many narrow alleys in the Gothic quarter, is not grand, and neither is the rest of the hotel, but the modern chic style is pleasant and inviting. The staff are friendly and helpful.  Our room was reasonably spacious and the modern design was both pleasant and highly functional.  It's a short walk to fine restaurants, tourist sites, and the metro.",5,2018,07,01
15,Exceptional Experience,"This hotel is better than advertised in every way.  While one would expect an exceptional experience, given the price, the staff deliver beyond expectations.  If you can afford the high end cost, it's absolutely worth it.",5,2018,06,24
15,Our second home in Barcelona...,"Dear Hotel Mercer & Staff,
We are always greeted in the small street out front like an old friend that you were waiting for and it is a welcomed arrival after a long plane ride. Fresh OJ please :) 

I wanted to thank you for providing the best trip to Barcelona of the 6 trips we have had with you. All visits have been incredible which is why we keep coming back, but this time was over the top amazing!!!! We enjoy exploring new areas of Barcelona each trip and the Mercer hidden location is ideal for this. Close to the sea, metro, walk to El Born,  Exiample,Gracia, El Raval, Sant Antoni Market,
 
We have stayed in a different room each time and there truly is not a bad one. Some have more space then others, but they really execute an authentic feel and modern designs in a rare combination.. Room #301 can’t be beat. You like a king! I could just live there forever. My wife was so happy and the room was so comfortable, like staying at your good friends penthouse while they are out of town, complete with an outstanding collection of books. I wish I had moire time in the room.
 
Knowing how much we love food the concierge staff was spectacular with food recommendations. I have come to fully trust them on almost every meal we have there by planning ahead of time with them. They truly know the city and what Barcelona offers. Canete lunch just wow!, Succulent, Estimar, LLamber,  All walking distance and stunning. The tasting menu at Uma was just incredible, delicious, and fun. These memories would not have been possible without the concierge help of Joan Manel and everyone else who works at Mercer. We miss talking to them each day and after staying for 6 nights it did feel like home. Not a single complaint at all, just perfection.
 
You have customers for life in us and if anyone ever mentions Barcelona Hotels I tell them don’t even think about staying anywhere else.",5,2018,06,23
15,A hidden gem in the old city,"Stay here, you won’t regret it. 
This is a lovely little hotel in the Gotic area of Barcelona, a bit of a challenge to find initially, but with a patient driver it is possible. The rooms are comfortable and spacious and have the added appeal of having been incorporated into the original Roman wall of the old city. The rooftop patio offers a quiet refuge with great views (late night view noted in attached photo). The staff were all helpful and knowledgeable, and special note needs to be made of the ever smiling and well informed concierge, Michael.
We had our first meal in their tapas restaurant and were impressed by the variety and deliciousness of the menu.",5,2018,06,18
15,Excerpt Hotel,"Great. Location and charming setting. The staff was the best. From  our greeting to when we arrived until departure they were great. Th concierge Michael was outstanding. We would certainly stay there again. 

",5,2018,06,15
15,Amazing in every way!,"The Mercer hotel is a gem located in the Gothic Quarter, which in my opinion is the place to be in Barcelona. From the moment you arrive, all of the staff are friendly and available to help you with anything you may need. The concierges (Joan, Xavier excuse me if I spelled your names wrong!) are truly wonderful and made our experience in Barcelona unforgettable. They reached out to us ahead of our trip with information of activities and restaurants and when we arrived they were very helpful in setting up anything we may have wanted to do. Every restaurant they sent us to was amazing, from tapas to fine dining, they are truly experts! 
The rooms are comfortable and modern and have everything you may need, the rooftop is beautiful if you go during the warmer months. They even have a relaxing courtyard you would never know you’re right in the heart of a bustling city! The location is perfect you can walk to a lot of great shops and restaurants. 

We loved Barcelona and can’t wait to return next year, and we will definitely stay at the Mercer again.  Thank you! ",5,2018,06,14
15,Excellent hotel staff and location,We had a wonderful stay at The Mercer! The concierge staff was so helpfu setting up tours and arranging transportation. The bar staff makes wicked drinks. The rooms are very large and comfortable. We will be back! ,5,2018,06,07
15,Fantastic!,"My kiddos (15 and 12 years old) and I stayed here for several nights. We were in one of the larger rooms with a rollaway bed. Even with that setup we were all fairly comfortable hanging out in the room itself, though we generally hung out in the lobby or on the rooftop deck when we were chilling at the hotel.

Rooftop deck and pool (more of a plunge pool rather than deep/long lap pool (though you can do laps)) are amazing! Staff up there was super attentive and helpful.

Concierge was always ready/willing to help out with cars/tours/suggestions/reservations/etc.

Breakfast service in the courtyard was awesome.

We had a great time thanks to the team and facilities!",5,2018,06,06
15,Honeymoon,"We ended our 2 week honeymoon in Barcelona and we were absolutely blown away by the Mercer Hotel. It was the best ending to our trip. They upgraded us to their premier suite and wow! Not only did they upgrade us, they had flower petals on the bed (the most amazing bed) and when we returned from the beach later that evening there was a bottle of cava and desert waiting for us. :) It was the best hotel experience we have ever had. We can't thank the staff enough for the amazing service. we will definitely be staying again at the Mercer Hotel if we visit Barcelona again. 

Mr. & Mrs. Solomon",5,2018,06,05
15,Excellent room and very central for old town,"We wanted an atmospheric hotel in the Gothic old town close to some of the interesting architecture. This hotel provides this perfectly.  Quietly elegant with a wonderful blend of modern and ancient it is chic in every sense. You pay accordingly!
The staff were very helpful pre booking to reassure us that we would have a room to meet our mobility needs making a walk in shower essential - it was excellent. Very good nights sleep in comfortable large bed. Our room had a bath too in a novel ‘open’ wall between the two rooms.
Room service were swift and efficient. Good and inclusive mini bar and coffee machine which as we’re English we adapted to produce hot water for our tea! 
We didn’t bother with booking breakfast but explored the old town to try some cafes there. 
The Gothic old town streets are very narrow and complex at first sight and so expect occasional rough sleepers in door ways close to the hotel and lots of graffiti around there and across the city. These things are off putting and make you feel nervous but we wandered around the old town back to the hotel about 11pm through the tiny back streets on a Saturday evening and are clearly older tourists and we were fine.  
A few small boutiques near Hotel plus the usual tourist shops. The ancient Cathedral ( not Gaudí) nearby plus so many numerous medieval buildings that you feel like you are back in time. 
Convenient for walking to La Rambla and exploring the wider Barcelona on foot or catching the hop on hop off tour bus close to the Cathedral. A taxi to the main upmarket shopping areas is a must as they are at a distance. 
The hotel has a small tapas bar immediately next door which we tried. Good service and tasty portions - as was the snack we had on the roof top terrace which is small but stylish with s tiny pool. 
The only small negatives were that we had asked for advice about what to do in the city on a specific Sunday and we were told there was nothing really was other than to try the bus tour or museums whereas we discovered the Corpus Christi parade with giants, beasts, bands and acrobats and a wonderful religious procession and out door mass and floral displays in open house ancient buildings!! How can the concierge of a quality hotel not know this when it was all a few meters away?! Second moan is that the quirky modern lighting does mean the bedroom is very dim so you cannot see to do makeup or easily get dressed and the hanging space is too short for dresses and long trousers. ",4,2018,06,04
15,Amazing Hotel in Barcelona!,"The hotel is perfectly located in the city, the staff is extremely nice and helpful,  beautiful hotel design ... overall great stay.  Would stay here again and certainly recommend this hotel to others!!",5,2018,06,04
15,Great stay in Barcelona,Beautiful small boutique hotel in Gothic quarter.  Well located and well designed renovation of historic building.  Varied and stylish excellent breakfast.  Staff was most helpful. Pool and terrasse on top of building. Great amenities. ,5,2018,06,03
15,Fantastic!,Great Location in the heart of Barcelona.  Mercer has an amazing staff that will assist you with every need.  Spacious rooms with great roof top deck.  Enjoyed  smoking a cigar with an Old Fashion in the outdoor patio. Stayed in 4 hotels during the stay in Spain; Mercer was by far the best.,5,2018,06,01
15,Second Wonderful Stay at the Mercer,"When we found out that we'd be going back to Barcelona, we didn't think have to think twice about where to stay. The Mercer just gets better and better. Our last visit was in winter so we didn't get to enjoy the fabulous rooftop bar. What a treat.

The location is amazing. Staying in the Gothic Quarter is so much more fun than staying in other areas of Barcelona where the majority of the luxury hotels are located.
 
The service was excellent, kind and helpful. We had to leave after three days but my lucky daughter and her husband extended their stay by four more days because they loved it so much. Thanks for taking such good care of us!",5,2018,05,31
15,Barcelona vacation,Beautiful hotel in very central location.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Room was spacious and well adorned.  Bed was spectacular.  Cab driver didn't know how to get to the hotel as it is on a very small street so we ended up walking from the square where he dropped us off.,5,2018,05,26
15,The Place for TLC in BCN,This was the perfect spot for some TLC following 5 weeks of travel in Spain. Fantastic location and all the staff are really warm and helpful.  Room is spacious and comfortable.  I counldn’t decide which I loved more...the bed or huge shower. Paula on the terrace was wonderful and Juan Manuel never failed to give excellent recommendations. I appreciated the effort made to accomodate my dietary prefernces. The breakfast is lovely (for someone who can eat gluten and dairy) but I do agree with others’ that the price for breakfast is quite high.,5,2018,05,26

It was a fantastic stay. The hotel staff was incredibly attentive and helpful. Everything was clean. The location was also amazing - right in the heart of the gothic quarter. The food and drinks were great also.",5,2018,05,26
15,"beautiful, serene space in the middle of it all","beautiful hotel, great staff, extraordinary suites, and the hotel is nestled into a fantastic neighborhood of the gothic quarter. it's like a secret oasis in the middle of narrow, urban streets. totally recommend it.",5,2018,05,25
15,"Excellent location, friendly, informed Staff, great food and drinks and unusual, comfortable rooms!","My wife and I visited Barcelona for the first time in late April. We picked the Mercer Hotel purely by reviews, not knowing anything about the town or the hotel. And we were VERY much pleased, too! The location is perfect - right near the border of the Gothic Quarter and the Born District, with their narrow streets, quirky/interesting shops and abundant, fun restaurants and bars mixed in with the Chocolate and Picasso Museums and several beautiful, historic churches. Our room was comfortable and had a lot of interesting character. The breakfast buffet was excellent, and the bartender was fun and creative and making us some drinks after an afternoon's walk and shopping. But the greatest part of our visit was the Concierges. Not knowing anything about Barcelona, we were at their mercy for suggestions. But after listening to our interests, they provided us with some great ideas of what to do (almost entirely by foot!), restaurants to visit and things to see. We had SUCH a great time, thanks very much to their suggestions. Will DEFINITELY be going back to the Mercer Hotel!",5,2018,05,24
15,A little paradise in the heart of the Gothic neighborhood,"We stayed here for a long weekend and fell in love with the place. The building is unique, a perfect balance between cosy and stylish, with a nice inner courtyard and an amazing rooftop terrace (where we enjoyed some delicious drinks and snacks). The room was beautiful, very comfortable bed and amazing shower. You can feel that the staff pays a lot of attention to details.
The breakfast was delicious, with just the right choice of things and served in the beautiful courtyard. But what really made our stay so perfect was the staff. We received a very warm welcome, and throughout our days at Mercer everyone of the staff went out of their way to help us. We really felt spoiled by all of them and wish to send them again our thanks for all their help. We hope to be back some day soon!",5,2018,05,22
15,Quaint and Quiet,"We celebrated our 20th year wedding anniversary in Barcelona and decided to treat ourselves by staying at the Mercer in the Gothic quarter.  Firstly, the location of this hotel was ideal....in the heart of the Gothic Quarter, minutes from the Born quarter and 15 mins walk to Barcelonetta...the beach.  Secondly, the service at this boutique hotel was impeccable....attentive but not overbearing.  Since the hotel doesn't have a lot of rooms, we felt at times that we had the hotel all to ourselves...it was so nice and relaxing.  The rooms were so quiet...the beds super comfortable that we had such great sleeps during our 5 night stay.  The drinks at the Pool Bar were fantastic - Thanks Paola!  Thanks to the whole team at the Mercer.  We hope we can return someday soon.",5,2018,05,21
15,Great hotel in Barcelona!,The Mercer Hotel is pure luxury! Our room was huge and super quiet. We slept great! It's the details that matter and the Mercer nailed them. Super friendly and helpful staff too. The concierge helped us arrange tickets and had amazing food recommendations. Would definiely stay here again. ,5,2018,05,21
15,The Mercer Hotel is a great place to stay in Barsalona.  to stay.  They go out of their way to make you feel welcome.,"Great hotel, very friendly staff - they went out of their way to assist us and make us feel welcome.  Very comfortable rooms. Great showers.   Close to most major sites in Barsalona.   You can walk to most places.  ",5,2018,05,21
15,Very well located in the old city,"Well located and attractive accommodations. Great staff. Due to narrow streets some taxis won’t or can’t drive directly to the hotel. Ask them before you get in. This is not an issue when you want to leave from the hotel. The staff will call taxis that drive directly to it.
The breakfast is ridiculously overpriced for the buffet and ala carte.",4,2018,05,20
15,Small expensive rooms at a great location,"I just don't understand these places. Super expensive, beautiful hotels and then they make these tiny rooms...
Staff is super friendly, every single person was great. The hotel is perfectly clean and well maintained.",4,2018,05,16
15,Very fine hotel in Gothic quarter,We stayed at this hotel for three nights. It is a luxury hotel for sure with excellent amenities and beautiful rooms. Great location tucked into the narrow streets of the gothic quarter and we walked to most things we wanted to see. The service was as good as it gets - especially appreciated all the help the concierge staff provided before we arrived to book tours and restaurant reservations. ,5,2018,05,11
15,"First class service in a quiet, elegant hotel in the Barri Gotic area","Lovely hotel in the warren of narrow streets in the old Roman section of the city. Architecturally incorporates parts of the original Roman walls and arches, so pretty stunning. We had amazing service--great breakfasts, QUIET rooms, comfortable beds, free bottled water/juices/snacks in the minibar, lots of beautiful small nooks and rooms to have drinks, read, etc. We had a tapas meal in the Le Bouchon restaurant our first night, which was very nice. Concierges all superb and helpful. Staff welcoming and warm. 

Only downside at all was that the lighting in the rooms is modern but not quite adequate in the sink/vanity area and that the floating floor in the excellent shower clinks as you shift your weight, which would wake your traveling partner if they were still trying to sleep. That's being picky though!",5,2018,05,10
15,"Quiet, modern, architecturally interesting hotel with excellent service in the Gothic Quarter","We spent three enjoyable nights at the Mercer Hotel which is in a convenient (for walking)/inconvenient (the closest a cab can get to it is a couple of blocks away) location in the heart of the city.  Javier, the concierge was particularly helpful in arranging for a private architectural tour for a group of our friends, dinner reservations and tickets to Segrada Familia, etc.  Our room was very nice, big with a high ceiling and balcony into the interior courtyard and there is a small pool with a lovely sundeck on the roof which we enjoyed.  The only thing that was less than perfect was the design of the shower floor which had movable slats, like an outdoor shower at a beach house.  But it made it weirdly unstable which I think might be difficult for an older person.",5,2018,05,08
15,Perfect stay in Barcelona,"We had a perfect stay in Barcelona. The transfer from the airport, the guided tour, the restaurants, ... - everything was perfectly organized by the extremely helpful staff. All in all a great experience!",5,2018,05,06
15,"Great location, terrific people.","My wife and I really loved this hotel.  The location isn't the easiest to find, but that's okay because it found us.  In the heart of the Gothic Quarter, the history surrounds, with charming streets that meander with you to Barcelona's treasures just beyond. The staff couldn't have been better -- warm, welcoming, professional.",5,2018,05,03
15,Excellent hotel.,"Well designed space, perfect location, professional and attentive staff who understand that great hospitality is about making guests feel comfortable and welcome. 

Would have given this hotel a full 5 star rating but we weren't completely happy with our room: ours felt dark, the phone charging and international outlets in the room were not working, and a loud guest near us kept awake past 2am one night.",4,2018,05,02
15,In and out of Barcelona,"Super comfortable beds, good lighting, very clean, serene and minimalist. Attentive and friendly service and a most delicious breakfast. We had a junior suite that only had a shower so if baths are your thing be aware of that, but plenty of space and hot water and most of all closet space!  Do not go here for a fast scene but do go for a cool sanctuary within the oldest part of town. NIce roof terrace with pool too!",5,2018,05,01
15,Spanish Gem,"Over the top staff on all fronts. Excellent bar and restaurant. Great location. Wonderful room. Yes some rooms in this boutique hotel are bit pricey, particularly when you add a daily breakfast, but worth every penny. A hotel can make or break your experience when traveling and this one delivers hands down some of the finest.",5,2018,04,29
15,"Elegant, friendly and food-perfect","Rooms very well appointed, breakfast fresh, delicious with freshly made gluten free options and Le Bouchon was very good. The rooftop area is a lovey option for morning coffee. The staff is very friendly and professional. We’ll be back. ",5,2018,04,29
15,"Excellent (service, location and property)!","Mercer BCN is sublimely located in a car free alley in the best part of the BCN gotic neighbourhood.
No cars can get there, so you have to walk a little from where the taxi or driver can leave you.
The building - which you almost don’t see from the street if you don’t pay attention- is magnificent and makes a great mix between the old and the contemporary.
Welcome was very friendly - maybe a little too much (I always find it annoying when staff tries hard to be friendly) - and check in went fluidly.
The design and decoration of the hotel is awesome and sublime. Lots of eye for detail. Very original and wanting to be different from the norm.
My room, a junior suite, had a window to the inner courtyard, and was a great mix of old bricks and wooden beams, and design furniture, lighting and shower. Nice and plenty amenities in the design bathroom. Comfortable dressing. The bed was of excellent quality, the sheets were snow white and crisp clean. The pillows were top. The room felt very zen and tranquil, thanks to the design and display of bed, desk and daybed/chairs.
The atmosphere in the hotel and in my room, combined with hearing the church bells, felt like being in a timeless monastery.
There is a small but comfortable upper floor with small swimming pool, sun deck and sunbeds.
I unfortunately didn’t have time to take breakfast (which wasn’t included in the already quite expensive price) as I had an early start.
What I found great about the service was the easiness where with I was offered a 3pm check out (I had a meeting until about two and wanted upon return to take a shower and relax a little).
I found the big plus the location in the heart of the marvellous gotic barrio. There are plenty of interesting places and numerous bars and restaurants just around the corner. But the part of the street where the hotel is located is super quiet.
I want to go back with my partner, despite the upmarket (too high!?) price for a night.
Highly recommended a place!

15,Hotel Blogger,"If location is important and you're looking for a place away from traffic and tourist, yet still be in walking distance to everything-than The Mercer Hotel is it. From the minute you walk it, the staff and ambience greets you like no other. It feels like you are really on vacation. Our room was spacious and clean. The window was wall to wall, floor to ceiling and the view to a garden foliage which extends from the ground to the heavenly sky- at least that's how it felt whenever I looked out. It even had the best expresso maker and provided a fridge with complimentary drinks. I didn't even want to explore the city as the hotel itself is one to explore. It's so beautiful and the staff gives you a tour and gives you history of the hotel which I think is an added treat. They have the nicest doorman-I forgot his name. But I believe he is Croatian or Ukranian. I apologize for forgetting his name, but I will never forget what he did for us. He walked us to the restaurant we had rsvp for so we would not get lost. And then another day, he walked over 200 feet to fetch us a cab because the street the hotel is in is so secluded from traffic. He didn't have to do that, but he did. He is so kind. To think how lucky The Mercer must feel to have this doorman be the first and last person that every guest see's is a treat to all. I never return to the same hotel as there are so many to experience, but I honestly think, The Mercer is a rare exception to the rule. I will look forward to re-visiting my favorite hotel thus far in my Europe Vacation. ",5,2018,04,22

15,Wonderful Hotel,"We visited Mercer Hotel for 2 nights in April to celebrate my husbands birthday. It is a fantastic hotel in a great location. The staff are excellent. Nothing is too much trouble and they are all really friendly but not intrusive. We didn't eat in the Restaurant, but had some lovely tapas in Le Bouchon. The cocktail bar was great...as were the drinks and our waitress, who suggested some fab cocktails. The room was a good size and well laid out. We would definitely come back.",5,2018,04,18

15,The Fabulous Mercer Hotel Barcelona,"The Mercer Hotel Barcelona went far beyond our expectations. The setting is such a beautiful combination of old city and modern chic design. The food was superb, especially the delicious breakfast. The concierge was unbelievable! From coordinating a birthday cake, to arranging three excellent tours (Old City, Gaudi, City Highlights), to dinner reservations, a flamenco show, and last minute rock concert tickets. The whole trip was perfect. The staff went well beyond our expectations to make us feel pampered and at home.",5,2018,04,10

15,Perfecto,"Just returning from an amazing stay at Hotel Mercer. It is one of the finest hotels I have had the pleasure of visiting. Great location in the Gothic Quarter, and amazing that the hotel literally includes part of the ancient Roman walls that surround the oldest part of Barcelona. Rooms are elegant, comfortable and spotlessly clean. Service is impeccable and friendly. The price is a bit on the steep side but well worth what you get for it. We didn’t try their restaurant so cant comment on it but the concierge staff gave great recommendations nearby. 

I hope to return sometime and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Hotel Mercer. ",5,2018,04,02

15,My favorite hotel ever,"Amazing. 

We absolutely loved our weekend trip to this hotel.

The location is fantastic. Right in the old city. Just perfect to walk out of the front door and explore Barcelona. It is such a beautiful part of the city. 

There is something about this hotel that was just so relaxing.  

The room was small but beautiful and luxuriously comfortable.  

The service was friendly, relaxed but very professional.

Breakfast is served in a small central garden / patio.  Its completely private and fully shaded. An amazing way to start the day.

We spent the mornings exploring. Would have lunch out and about, then head back and enjoy the roof top pool looking out over the city.  A cocktail as the sun went down and then walk back into town for dinner. 

The is the best hotel I have ever stayed in. It just hits a perfect balance of high quality, professional service, luxurious and yet a charm that is super relaxed.",5,2018,03,26
15,PERFECTION IN EVERYWAY,"This hotel is it! everything about it is fantastic. We were incredibly sick when we stayed here after having food poisoning when we were in Greece. The staff did EVERYTHING in their power to assist us and make our stay as comfortable as ever. The rooms are lovely. Very clean lines and modern in appearance yet keeping in with the Gothic Quarter with the internal stone walls. It is in a fantastic location in the Gothic Quarter and the rooms are very quiet. Can't wait to get back here and enjoy our time a little better next time. Thank you to all the staff, you are wonderful wonderful people.",5,2018,03,25
15,Great little hotel in the gothic quarter!,"Fabulous find. Loved our stay. Walkable distance to all must see spots in Barcelona.

15,Luxurious boutique hotel,"The Mercer Hotel was amazing in every way.  The room was beautiful and very comfortable.  The food delicious.  The staff, exceptional.  So helpful and accommodating.  The location is very convenient to the cathedral, the beach, shops, restaurants, yet it’s on a quiet, secluded street. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,03,23
15,Great experience," From first arriving at the hotel our experience at the Mercer was wonderful. Everyone was extremely helpful, friendly and courteous. The location was convenient and we were able to walk most places right out the front door. The rooms were very comfortable and well appointed. The only limitation was that the restaurant only served breakfast. It would have been nice to have a full service restaurant  in the hotel. ",5,2018,03,22
15,Impeccable hotel and staff,"Great location - very easy access to all major Barcelona neighborhoods.

Superb hotel, architecture/design and history.  Bar and top floor deck great.  Breakfast a bit pricey but lovely.  

Staff are SUPREMELY helpful and knowledgeable.  Can't say enough about how great all of them were.  

Room was very nice.  Modern.  Not a lot of spots to hang a used towel.  How's that for desperately searching for one criticism!",5,2018,03,20
15,Great hotel in a great location. Awesome staff,We loved the location of this boutique hotel in the Gothic Quarter. Close to lots of great sites in Barcelona. The location on a narrow street added to the allure. The staff was terrific. Only slight negative is that the taxicabs couldn’t always find it or weren’t willing to drive down the narrow street to get there. But that shouldn’t scare anyone away. ,5,2018,03,18
15,Mercer Hotel - a wonderful place to stay,"We loved our stay at the Mercer.  The staff was wonderful, friendly and very helpful.  Your location in the Gothic Quarter is just wonderful and it was easy to find our way around Barcelona because of the information given to us by Mercer's employees.",5,2018,03,10
15,Excellent,"We stayed for 2 nights this weekend, and felt at home from the moment we arrived.
We have visited Barcelona many times, so knew the hotel location, although it may not be the easiest to find, tucked away in the old town. The taxis would not take us to the door because of the narrow streets, but it was no problem for us.
The staff were all very welcoming, and efficient, and the room was gorgeous. They also looked after our friends who came to visit it in the hotel.
We upgraded so had the balcony room, and it was nice to have the door open into the courtyard. The bed was so comfortable, which is quite difficult to find in Spain. Pure luxury.
On Saturday evening there were some rowdy Danish people in the bar, and we were impressed with how efficiently and firmly the hotel dealt with them to cause least inconvenience to guests.
I wish we had been able to stay longer ! A wonderful short break. Thank you",5,2018,03,05
15,A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE,"On a short trip to Barceloan, I was pleasantly surprised by the Mercer Hotel. Located in the old Ghothic quarter. The Boutique hotel with 28 rooms is built on a multitude of plots that were originally small buildings and at the corner an ancient tower has been turned into a small dinning room.",5,2018,03,05
15,Quaint hotel with a friendly staff,"I would rate this hotel a 4 1/2 star. It’s not the best hotel I have ever stayed at, but this is very close to a five star hotel. This hotel is a hidden gem in the Gothic quarter and a bit of a struggle for most taxis to find, but we soon found a good drop off-point down the street. The gothic quarter is close enough to most locations and yet just far enough away to be nice and quiet. This was our 4th visit to Barcelona, and best accommodation so far.

We loved their breakfast, it was one of the best we ever had included in a hotel in Europe. The hotel’s bars were nice and the common area perfect. The architecture of the hotel and the rooms are a nice blend of old and new. Concierge was very helpful and the front desk extremely friendly. It was a very quiet hotel, so if you are looking for some action, this is not the place. Perfect for couples. The room was larger than I expected and there was plenty of room for all our stuff.

There are so many places to stay in Barcelona and it’s such a fun city to explore, it’s hard to choose a hotel. The Mercer hotel offered a good start point to explore Barcelona and staff was extremely attentive and helpful. Highly recommend.",4,2018,03,03
15,Great place to stay in Barcelona,"Great hotel.  Perfectly located.  Interesting history and architecture.   Very comfortable bed and room.  The best thing about it?  The incredible staff.  Friendly, helpful and would go out of their way to help you with any request.   They made you feel so welcome and comfortable.",5,2018,02,25
15,Great Stay,Very good hotel .I needed some meds for my baby at 2 am and the concierge arranged a can driver to go pick it up for me! The rooms are nice and location is excellent . Highly recommended. The breakfast is a bit pricey - you can walk around and go to the many nice cafes .,5,2018,02,20
15,A discrete and understated Catalonian gem,"We visited the hotel for a long weekend having read about it online.  It was the location that first of all attracted us to the establishment: right in the centre of the gothic area.  But when we then started to read about the design and nature of the building we decided we had to stay there.  It was everything we hoped for and more.  This is one of the most impressive hotels at which we have ever stayed.  It is built in part on Roman remains and also on a converted twelfth century building.  The finish is both fascinating and exquisitely executed.  The only thing that could compete with the building and its fabric is the staff: they were without exception first class in their quietly understated attentiveness and helpfulness.  The concierge staff were particularly helpful and knowledgeable, without in any way detracting from their colleagues.  And of course the food.  As one might expect in such an establishment it was perfect.  If you want to make the most of a visit to this beautiful, vibrant city then you really should book into this superb hotel.",5,2018,02,15
15,Amazing Luxury Hotel in the heart of the Gothic Quarter,We have just returned from a four night stay in Barcelona. The Mercer was a fantastic find! What a great hotel - perfect location for exploring Barcelona - right in the heart of the Gothic Quarter and yet really quiet at night. The rooms were beautiful and the beds among the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept in. The staff were all super friendly - giving us great tips on the sights and restaurants and where to shop. We will be back for sure and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a special place to stay in Barcelona.,5,2018,02,14
15,"Perfect location, beautiful rooms, and wonderful staff","I chose it based on the excellent reviews and its location right in the heart of the Gothic district.  It's a short walk to the Cathedral, to La Rambla, to the waterfront, and to some of the city's finest restaurants. What I loved about it was its quiet location, down a narrow street, and away from the madness of the crowds.  The staff was unfailingly helpful, and seemed disappointed that we didn't ask more of them.  Plus, there's that lovely welcoming glass of cava when you check in.",5,2018,02,09
15,Fantastic hotel,"Located in the heart of the Gothic district this is a unique property with easy access to other parts of the city (some cabs are hesitant about the narrow streets).  There are 28 rooms, very comfortable and stylish.  Good tapas/wine area adjacent to the hotel.  What really stands out is the people who work there -- especially the head concierge (who's name I unfortunately forget!).  Truly professional and upbeat.  Thanks!",5,2018,02,06
15,A Great Place to Stay!,"Once you find the Mercer (it is in a lane not frequented by traffic) you are immediately greeted by the concierge. From there the experience begins. The service is exceptional. The rooms are a modern design in a historic building fabric, with everything you need. The hotel is conveniently located with restaurants and transport within a few minutes walk. But it was the staff who made it special, organizing day trips, recommendations for restaurants, advice on transport, and anything else you need to know. Oh, and irrespective that the lane does not have cars, they did arrange for a taxi to drive to the door. How, we are not sure. Highly recommended.",5,2018,02,03
15,The Mercer Hotel is a must stay in Barcelona,"Even before our arrival at the Mercer we were contacted by Guest Relations, Mr. Xavier Sanchis, with a request to personalize our stay.  We requested tour information, dinner reservations and tickets to a FC Barcelona soccer match.  All requests were handled very quickly and professionally.  That was only the beginning of the incredible service we received at the Mercer Hotel.  Every detail of our stay from contacting the airport about missing luggage, making dinner reservations, directions to attractions, confirming shuttle arrangements, and special touches for our 25th wedding anniversary were handled by the concierge Mr. Joan Manel. We've stayed at many five star hotels and his service is by far the best ever.  Almost every morning we were fortunate enough to be served breakfast by Julia, who was no less than perfect.  She served the most delicious breakfast every morning.  Her charming personality and attention to detail was second to none.  Thank you Julia!  We loved this hotel and will definitely be back.",5,2018,01,30
15,A True Gem!,"A Fantastic Stay. The hotel was spotless, the rooms stunning, and the public areas serene. Some of the most accommodating, professional, and service oriented personnel we've ever enjoyed! When in Barcelona, you must stay here!",5,2018,01,24

15,Fine location and great service,Excellent care and attention. A fine location inside the old walls from which to explore the city and an easy walk to the sea. Service was first class with real support after a minor accident. Personally we pefer when a bathroom is separated from the bedroom but this did not matter when overall quality was so high. We will recommend actively. ,5,2018,01,07
15,An excellent experience,As good as it gets.Thats our simple conclusion after a six days vacation at the wonderful designed hotel in Barcelona. Perfect in any perspective and our new preferred choice for Barcelona. We would recommend this hotel for anyone.,5,2018,01,04
15,Great experience in BCN,"A really beautiful hotel, the staff is really competent and nice, the location is really perfect in the gothic area and near everything.
The hotel is really peacefull and beautiful.
The terrace is so nice also.

Maybe the breakfast could be improved a bit.",5,2017,12,29
15,Excellence in Comfort and Friendliness,"We arrived at the Mercer early morning after a long flight from Australia, somewhat weary and needing to get acclimatised.  The welcome from the Mercer staff was overwhelmingly friendly and empathetic.  The staff had gone to some effort to ensure an early room was available for us, and to ensure a quick check-in experience.  It was marvellous and deeply appreciated.

The hotel itself is secluded and set in the old watch towers and walls that were once the walls of the city.  The room setting was beautiful - keeping in touch with its historic past while also providing a level of luxury that the Mercer sets out to provide its guests.

The service at the Hotel was exceptional.  The staff were very welcoming and warm, and enthusiastically sought to make our experience at the hotel memorable.  They were successful.  The concierge (Jean) went out of his way to provide advice and organise tickets, and accomplished this with uncommon efficiency.  His warmth and care toward us was commendable.  The Matre D for the restaurant, (Raul) was also exceptional in his attention and service he afforded us at every opportunity.  His anticipation of our needs and the manner in which he attempted to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable was really appreciated.

Of all the boutique hotels we have stayed at many locations around the world, the Mercer in Barcelona is a standout high achiever.  This reflects the professionalism and warmth that all the staff provided throughout our stay.  The Mercer is a leader in luxury boutique hotels and well worthy of our first choice of hotel in Barcelona.  We will be looking to return to the Mercer in the future.

For those choosing to stay at the Mercer, I recommend that you research the final few streets to approach the hotel before you set out of your journey.  Vehicular access is not easy and you should not assume the taxi driver will know how to get to the front door.  The street frontage is narrow in the Gothic area, and not easily navigated by cars.  Our taxi dropped us close by, and we were able to make the short walk in to the hotel because we had familiarised ourselves with the streets before we started our journey.  It would have been somewhat harder and frustrating if we had not done our homework.",5,2017,12,26
15,Lovely Hotel in the Historic Gothic Centre,"This hotel is tucked away down a narrow street in the heart of the historic centre of Barcelona. A warm welcome awaits you with easy check in.  The building is beautiful and has the charm of old Barcelona but the rooms are large, light, airy, modern and clean, a very peaceful environment. The bed was very comfortable and complimentary treats left in the room with water and coffee making facilities were very welcome. The room was nice and quiet even though you are in the heart of the city. The hotel is walking distance to many attractions including the Picasso Museum and Park so ideally placed. There is a small cocktail lounge where you can enjoy a pre-dinner drink made by friendly staff. The hotel has a restaurant and whilst we did not have a chance to eat dinner there, the breakfast was really good.  A very nice selection with eggs cooked to order to your preference. There is also a good buffet selection available. There is a lovely courtyard where you can sit and have either breakfast or dinner which is a very pretty and relaxing environment. Staff are very helpful and knowledgeable and service is personal to each guest. The hotel has a rooftop terrace with sun beds, a small pool and bar area.  There are lovely views across the city.",4,2017,12,23
15,Barcelona Excellence,We were at the Mercer st the end of our Trip to Spain and the experience could not have been better.  The hotel is an island of peace in a busy area.  The rooms are simple but elegant and incredibly comfortable.  We did not have breakfast there but really enjoyed the tapas cafe.  Perhaps the best feature of all is the incredible staff.  We could not have felt more welcomed and really missed some of their faces when we returned home.  ,5,2017,12,22
15,A perfect stay,We arrived in Barcelona for the first time and it was magical to stay at The Mercer because of the location but because of the hotel itself. The attention to every detail was immaculate and thoughtful and beautifully designed. ,5,2017,12,21
15,Beautiful hotel in the Gothic Quarter!,"We had a great stay at the Mercer Hotel! It's a beautiful hotel located in the Gothic Quarter and central to all the major sights, tour buses, walking tours, La Ramblas, etc. 

We had a little trouble at first finding the hotel as it is not off a main street or courtyard so lugging 3 suitcases through the cobblestone corridors was a little confusing and tiring (especially at night). We got a little lost at night and made a wrong turn but that could also have been due to Google Maps. 

One other small thing is the first night there was a lot of noise either above us or next to us. Someone was walking around in high heels and moving furniture. It could have been guests or the hotel staff doing some light construction but it was fairly loud. It was gone the next couple of nights though.

Those two things did not in anyway hinder the overall experience. The staff was extremely helpful and could not have been more accommodating. They gave us recommendations, directions, purchased event tickets for us and even received a delivery on our behalf before we arrived. I would highly recommend this hotel and would love to stay here again the next time I'm in Barcelona!",5,2017,12,13
15,Excellent choice,"The perfect place. Beautiful room, impeccably clean, with quality amenities, very friendly and knowledgeable staff. The hotel has a wonderful location and the building itself is impressive. Try the restaurant located downstairs! Fine dinning experience and relaxed atmosphere.",5,2017,12,12
15,Incredible Service,"My fiancee and I had an amazing experience at Mercer Hotel. From the moment we were picked up at the airport via shuttle to when it came time to check-out, we felt like guests of honor at Mercer. The staff were incredibly helpful with recommendations, and the service at the on-site restaurants and bar was perfect.

We will definitely stay at the Mercer during our next visit. Five stars.",5,2017,12,06
15,Loved the staff,"Really enjoyed this hotel.  We loved the room, with a few small caveats.  The lighting in the room is a bit dim, the bathroom lighting with the open floor plan a bit bright if you are not alone (I did find that most of the hotels we stayed at in Spain had some lighting plan issues, so maybe this is a thing?).  Otherwise, we found the room extremely comfortable, and the amenities very nice.  I appreciate the small but charming detail of providing a selection of beverages in the mini bar free.  Those moments of generosity are such a welcoming touch.  The common areas were well done, and we did not have breakfast there, but did enjoy the bar.  What made the Mercer for us was the staff, who were incredibly helpful and charming, and go out of their way to make their guests comfortable.  The location in the Gothic quarter is in a touristy area, but just off the most beaten path, making for a pleasantly quiet stay.",5,2017,12,05
15,Family Trip for Thanksgiving,"This was the perfect hotel for our family.  The staff could not have been nicer, the location excellent, the rooms incredibly comfortable and clean.  We would love to go back!  We found the hotel to be incredibly charming and would love to visit again sometime in the future!",5,2017,12,02
15,Fantastic Hotel in Gothic Quarter,Great hotel in the gothic quarter.  Fantastic service and stylish property. Only downside (which is a function of location not the property) is the lack of natural light in rooms because of the warren-like nature of the neighboorhood.  ,5,2017,12,02
15,A first class hotel with great service,"This is a beautiful hotel on a quiet street in the historic and charming Gothic area of Barcelona. There are several excellent restaurants (tapas, traditional and contemporary Catalan) within a stone's throw. Las Ramblas and Plaça de Catalunya are short walks away (10–15 minutes max). 
Inside, the hotel cleverly mixes the historic gothic building with modern elements to create an impressive lobby and beautiful rooms.

The staff are genuinely very friendly, and their service is first class. From purchasing tickets and travel advice to excellent restaurant recommendations, they'll go out of their way to make you feel at home and help you enjoy Barcelona fully. I can't speak highly enough of them.

This is a superb hotel. When I return to Barcelona, I will stay here.",5,2017,12,01
15,My favorite ,"The architecture is amazing, celebrating history and new style. Had a such lovely stay at this hotel, will definitely be back. The service was great and staff was very friendly.

The door man saw us and opened the door from down the alley. Room was really nice as well, and service otherwise was great. Tapas in the bar were good as well.",5,2017,11,16
15,Outstanding,"We can find nothing for the Mercer to improve on.  It was a perfect experience.  The location  was ideal, the service was very professional and your staff went out of their way to accommodate our needs.  We look forward to our return visit",5,2017,11,15
15,Fantastic Hotel and Service,"We really enjoyed our 3 night stay at this hotel in Barcelona. The location is great - in the historic city center. The sites of Barcelona are easily accessible. Our room was very comfortable and clean. We slept well and felt at ease. The service was excellent. All the staff went out of their way to greet us and ask us if we needed anything. The concierge made our reservations and printed our tickets to La Sagrada Familia when we decided, kind of spur of the moment, to go there. Also, we had to leave the hotel at 5:00 a.m. after our last night and would have missed the breakfast. The concierge arranged for a 4:30 delivery of breakfast to our room. It came right on time with everything I had ordered. The only problem we had was with the wifi which was very sporadic when trying to connect in the room. We went downstairs to the business center to connect and this worked much better. It would have been nice to to have to leave the room. Other than that, the stay was superb and I would highly recommend Mercer Barcelona to other travelers.",5,2017,11,12
15,Mercer delivered excellence in every way!,"The Mercer Hotel is a fabulous, boutique hotel in the gothic quarter. We stayed there for 4 nights and couldn't be more pleased with the accommodations, the service, the food and the location.  It was a peaceful and quiet place to stay, yet just a short walk to the main sites and shopping areas in Barcelona. The rooms were spacious and the service and staff were outstanding.

Excellent breakfast. 

Not cheap but value for money was there. ",5,2017,11,03
15,Beautiful boutique hotel in the heart of the gothic quarters,From check-in to check-out our experience was just fab.  The staff had a lot to do with this. Nothing was ever a problem.  They were helpful in finding things for us to do (booked opera at the Palau de la musica) and restaurants.  The rooms and the hotel decor is contemporary edging on chic.  Our room (305) on the top floor overlooked the courtyard which was great as it was quiet.  High ceilings and comfy bed.  Great for cocktails as well.,5,2017,11,01
15,Great stay,"Knowledgeable and friendly staff. We stayed there two years ago and really loved it, so we decided to stay there again. Great rooms and service, and wonderful location. We had a great time and looking forward to staying again.",5,2017,11,01

Staff was helpful in pointing out key area highlights and in getting our cab.",5,2017,11,01
15,Can't Miss at Mercer,"This boutique hotel is exactly the experience I look for when I travel.  Small, intimate, personal and stylish.  Perfect location on small alley in the heart of the Gothic Quarter.  Walk to many attractions, restaurants and shops.  The staff was attentive and friendly.  The concierge trio bent over backwards to orchestrate many excursions and recommended several spectacular restaurants.  I couldn't imagine having a better experience than we did at the Mercer.",5,2017,10,31
15,Best Boutique Hotel in Barcelona!,At the Mercer Hotel you will be greeted by an awesome reception and concierge staff that will do everything in their power to make you feel right 'at home' at the Mercer. Where else have you stayed that the room comes equipped with a spare toothbrush and toothpaste? Only at the Mercer! The location is ideal for site seeing many of the great attractions that Barcelona has to offer. The food and drink is marvelous. The roof top pool and outdoor patio area is beautifully landscaped with large potted plants that leave you feeling like you are in the midst of a tropical paradise. Many comfortable chaise lounges and umbrellas exist for you to sip on a drink from the roof top bar. This is one of the best boutique hotels that we've ever stayed at. Everyone should give them a try. You won't be disappointed! ,5,2017,10,30
15,Amazing Experience - Thank You Juan Manuel Salamanca Sánchez,"The hotel is in an amazing location tucked away in one of Barcelona's beautiful Gothic streets. Mercer has done an incredible job renovating the historic building to create a luxurious atmosphere within ancient stone walls. This is truly one of my favorite hotels in the world, not because of the previously described attributes, but because of the world-class hospitality displayed by Juan Manuel Salamanca Sánchez and his team. He truly makes your stay feel extremely special. ",5,2017,10,30
15,Definitely will return: great way to stay in the Gothic Quarter,"Catalonian independence declared two blocks from the Mercer yet our stay was an oasis of calm. Public spaces are beautiful and interestingly varied. The hotel makes the most of an ""interior"" experience highlighted by the room with the living plan wall. Staff was ever at the ready to assist with any need proactively checking in but not intruding on our experience. Spent time on rooftop, in the tapas restaurant, the hotel bar and the breakfast courtyard. Each spot offered a difference way to enjoy the stay. 

Worked with several of the concierges and all were helpful with spot on recommendations based our our requests.",5,2017,10,30

15,"good hotel, expensive and poor breakfast","the hotel itself was good, room on the small side but fair enough for a 2 days short stay. we left disappointed with breakfast. was not included in the room, was extremely expensive and the service poor. we have been waiting 15minutes for our order to be taken and then eggs came after 15 more minutes.",3,2017,10,23

15,Charming professional staff combined with amazing location," This lovely boutique hotel maintains a staff that is warm and personal while maintaining utmost professionalism. The hotel itself is authentic ,immaculate and exceedingly comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel. All  rooms seemed quiet. The junior suite was amazing.

15,Gem in Gothic District,This hotel provides top notch service in an elegant old-world atmosphere.  It's centrally located in beautiful Gothic District with good access to tourist sites.  Only slight is that the breakfast was very pricey.,5,2017,10,21
15,AMAZING HOTEL!!!!,I have to say this was an amazing hotel right int he center of the gothic area of Barcelona.  Amazing hotel which exceeded expectations.  It is a short stroll to verything and everywhere you need to go.  Las Ramblas is about 10 minutes away.,5,2017,10,20
15,A perfect hotel for an October Getaway,"The Mercer Hotel is located in an ideal area of Barcelona and is within walking distance to all the sites. It is a small, boutique hotel that incorporates the charm of the city (particularly highlighting the ancient city walls) with beautiful modern design. Our room was very comfortable. The staff is friendly and accommodating. We will definitely stay here again and have already recommended it to others!",5,2017,10,19
15,Mercer Hotel in Barcelona,"We had the most lovely stay at the Mercer Hotel in Barcelona.  Quite honestly, we were blown away by the attention to detail by every member of the staff.  From the minute we walked in to the minute we left, everyone was incredibly kind and helpful.  The concierge was spot on with everything they recommended.  We happened to be there at a time when there was some political unrest and there were demonstrations going on.  The staff was incredibly forthcoming and more than willing to aid us in making the most out of our short stay in Barcelona.  They made us feel safe, gave us great recommendations and were extremely helpful in making sure we had the best experience.  If you are looking for a top notch experience at a beautiful boutique hotel in the heart of the gothic district, Mercer Hotel should be on the top of your list.  We will absolutely be back.  Thank you for making our stay so lovely!",5,2017,10,18
15,Mercer,The Mercer is the perfect home base for travels to Barcelona. The concierge was very helpful before and during our trip. The hotel is quiet with only 20 rooms.  It is in the perfect location for walking to cafes and shops. ,5,2017,10,17
15,One of the best Hotels in Barcelona!,"My sister and I went to the Mercer for our last night in Spain after 9 days traveling around Spain. Our only regret is that we didn't have more time to enjoy the hotel more. We were greeted with glasses of cava and amazing hospitality. The staff was top notch throughout the trip and extremely helpful. To top it all off, the location is extremely ideal. There is a very good reason that this hotel is rated highly on TripAdvisor. If you can afford to stay here or find a great deal, stay at this hotel!",5,2017,10,15
15,Perfect place to stay,"The hotel's modern aesthetic is the perfect complement to the beautiful Gothic Quarter. We loved the rooftop deck and pool area, and our sleek space. The soaking tub and shower were really lovely. The location is perfect--steps from the Basilica and on the most charming street. Finally, the staff made our stay. Everyone was so friendly and helpful and the service was impeccable. We're so glad we chose the Mercer for our honeymoon--it was perfect! ",5,2017,10,15
15,Gracious and Welcoming Staff at the Mercer Hotel,"From the moment we checked in the staff could not have been more gracious and helpful The location cannot be beat, in the heart of the Barri Gotic. We were upgraded to beautiful room with a private patio - #108. The hotel and the rooms evoke a sense of calm in the midst of the busy, bustling gothic quarter. The breakfast buffet was delicious and plentiful.  At the last minute, exhausted from our plane trip, we decided to stay in and eat at the hotel's restaurant. The food was delicious with extremely attentive service. Incredible hotel and you would be wise to book a room here when you come to Barcelona!",5,2017,10,15
15,Absolutely unique hotel mixing history and modernity,"What an experience! While even experienced Barcelona drivers may find it hard to navigate to, the hotel is well worth visitting. It is a small 20+ rooms boutique place built upon walls from the 4th century and from the medieval times. We actually had a tower's side wall and two windows as our suite wall. The service is super friendly. The concierge from Ukraine spoke perfect Polish and had great historic tales about the place. We got a nice upgrade to a room with private patio and sunbeds. There was a fridge with complimentary beverages. The bed had sets of charging cables to accommodate many phone types. Most importantly it was large and comfortable. We relied on the hotel to arrange transportation, recommend places and provide in-room extras. All worked well. The breakfast had many options. It probably was too formal and a bit too slow. But the stay was overall a fantastic experience in old town Barcelona.",5,2017,10,15
15,5 star at its best,"Mercer is a perfect place to stay while in Barcelona! The location is near everywhere you want to visit, including the amazing cathedral. We were able to walk to everything from here. The staff make it the best place to stay. Marcos and Xavier were especially helpful and most courteous! Our room was a quiet retreat, and the amenities were perfect. We would definitely stay here on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2017,10,14
15,Great Hotel & Excellent Service,"Fantastic service, staff, and accommodations. We received first class service from everyone - front desk,
Concierge, restaurant. Everyone greets you warmly and will attend to any need you have. Rooms were attractive and clean, good central location, nice restaurant, and relaxing rooftop area.",5,2017,10,14
15,Best hotel in Spain!,"Mercer was incredible! Location couldn't be beat, atmosphere was a lovely mixture of gothic and modern, service was top notch (like, super great) and our room was spacious and very comfortable. 

We had a room overlooking the breakfast area, and we thought the noise would be an issue, but then realized the windows have and extra layer of closure that blocked out the sound. 

Barcelona is a gorgeous city, and the Mercer was a real highlight. Enjoy!",5,2017,10,12
15,Couldn't have asked for a better experience.,Absolutely lovely hotel in every aspect. The staff was very professional and warm. The attention to detail superb and they went out of their way to make all aspects of our visit flawless. The location in the midst of the Gothic quarter was perfect. I highly recommend this hotel.,5,2017,10,12
15,Excellent stay,"Beautiful boutique hotel - just as shown in photos. Lovely breakfast area with buffet as well as individual selections available. Everything is top notch. But what really makes Mercer stand out is the personal service and attention to each guest.  They take care of anything you need and are always available to help with planning, transportation, or advice. Very quiet in the heart of the Gothic Quarter.",5,2017,10,11
15,Luxury at its Best! ,"We spent 3 nights at this stunning hotel.... It is a hidden gem within the narrow streets of the Gothic part of town. The Mercer has great facilities including a tapas bar, pool and restaurant. The rooftop with bar and pool was certainly our favourable part of the hotel.The rooms are large and beautifully appointed. We recommend the Mercer Breakfast which was a great way to start the day and the tapas bar is a great spot for happy hour. What makes this hotel special are the staff, nothing was too much trouble. A big thank-you to the Conceirge Team, Doormen, and the Bar Staff - you made our stay in Barcelona effortless and enjoyable. If you are looking for a beautiful boutique hotel with personalised service in a historic part of Barcelona, you can’t look past the Mercer. TG&DD",5,2017,10,11
15,Great Boutique offer in Gothic Quarter,The hotel has a great location to walk out from and explore. The staff are very helpful and the ambience of the hotel is relaxing. The roof terrace is a great place to rest after a day of walking. Its a boutique experience so its best for couples. We enjoyed the breakfast in the courtyard each morning as a way to walkup to Barcelona. ,4,2017,10,11
15,"Mercer understands, appreciate, and delivers.","An absolutely first rate hotel experience inane extraordinarily historic property with genuine Roman walls. The food, staff, amenities, and service is exceptional. An the location cannot be better for seeing the old sections of Barcelona. Everything from Las Ramblas to the seaport is within walking distance.",5,2017,10,11
15,Excellent!,"If you ever want to experience the Gothic area in style, this is the place to go to! The staff is wonderful, going through lengths to make your stay as wonderful as they can. The breakfast is sublime, so many choices of eggs and pastries. Great coffee too! The beds are nice and firm, very soft sheets and a wonderful rainshower. The cocktail bars serves good cocktails. Although the hotel is in the middle of the Gothic area, it is quiet. The hotel was once a midievel palace and remains of the ancient Roman city wall are still visible. We were totally relaxt there and very well taken care of by the friendly staff.",5,2017,10,10
15,Expensive but lovely,Wonderful special occasion hotel in spectacular old city setting. Staff were key to making our first visit to Barcelona a great experience. It is an intimate very modern hotel in an ancient space. Don’t skip the breakfast which was nicest we have experienced in Europe. Layouts of rooms a bit “funky” but lovely. Concierge staff a big plus.,5,2017,10,10
15,Wonderful hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"The staff at this hotel are so hardworking and took such great care of us. They set up a wonderful tour of the city at our request with an amazing tour guide. We loved staying at the Mercer hotel- it was walking distance to the Cathedral of Barcelona, St. Mary by the Sea Church, many shops and restaurants. It is in a very quiet area. We loved it!",5,2017,10,09
15,Mercer Hotel experience,"Excellent in every way. The hotel is clean, the decor beautiful and rooms clean and creatively designed. The staff were incredibly helpful with all questions and requests I had. There is a rooftop terrace and pool with a great view and planting areas to enhance the experience. The hotel is small, efficient and breakfast creative and healthy. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Very impressive.
",5,2017,10,08
15,One of the best,"What a gem!  Beautifully appointed, lovely quiet room, ideal location and innovative restaurant. The service is impeccable with a special thank you to Xavier for all his help. An ideal spot for exploring Barcelona and recuperating from your busy day.",5,2017,10,08
15,Great hotel,"I love this hotel and would not hesitate to come back. The location in the Gothic area is perfect, however the tapas restaurant was disappointing.
The bed comfort I give a 10/10 and design of the rooms is stunning mixing modern fittings to the old roman/ medieval walls.

15,Perfect Stay,"My wife & I stayed here for 5 nights at the end of September.This hotel is perfect in every sense.

15,Best hotel in Barcelona,"This hotel is not only gorgeous, it’s amazing staff is what truly sets it apart. Every single employee could not be more gracious or friendly.  We frequently stay in luxury boutique hotels and The Mercer has the best staff of them all. They made our vacation even better than we imagined. Can’t say enough great things about this beautiful hotel and it’s staff. We can’t wait to get back!",5,2017,10,05
15,Fantastic!!,"We stayed at the Mercer Hotel on our recent visit to Barcelona. We were wowed from the moment we entered the hotel. We were greeted by friendly, helpful staff and shown to our lovely room. The room was very clean, which is a top priority for us. We loved the location of the Mercer, as it is tucked away in a quiet location, with zero disruptive noise while we were sleeping. During the day, we would open our windows and enjoy the clean, fresh air and climate, and look at the happy activity on the narrow, charming street below (few, if any, cars). We recommend that you treat yourself and book a room with a completely separate bathroom. Our room flowed directly into a shower area (with a half-wall), and although fine and serviceable, next time we will spring for the next level room up. The best compliment we can give this hotel is this.....We are planning to stay there again, the next time we visit Barcelona!",5,2017,10,04
15,"Historical, Beautiful, Amazing Accommodations!","The Mercer Barcelona is a beautiful, historically significant property, located on a quiet corridor of the Gothic District. Everyone working at the hotel was a joy, the entire staff goes out of their way to make sure that you, as a guest, are well taken care of. The Rooftop is the icing on the cake, the views are stunning!",5,2017,10,04
15,Our trip would not have been the same.,"Everything from arrival, check in, reconditions, housekeeping and facilities, food and beverage to checkout was phenomenal. We seek and enjoy gems like The Mercer. Look no further! Worth every penny...",5,2017,10,03
15,Perfect stay,"Gorgeous property in historic Gothic Quarter. We loved the location for exploring Barcelona on foot. Incredibly friendly and helpful staff. We felt welcomed immediately. Ultra clean, spacious, comfortable and quiet room. Delicious full breakfast each morning in the beautiful courtyard. Love the roof terrace and dipping pool. ",5,2017,10,01
15,Hotel Mercer Barcelona,"A beautiful ancient building remarkably well restored, in the middle of everything.
The staff was very friendly, hospitable, and helpful in every aspect. If you are looking for just the right place from which to base your multi day visit to Barcelona, this is it! ",5,2017,09,30
15,Disappointing,"We were very excited to get a room for 3 nights at the Mercer in September 2017 since it had such amazing reviews. We had high expectations and were quite disappointed. Yes, the staff are very friendly but the vibe of the hotel was a bit strange to us. Quite cool. Our first room felt like being in a cave since it looked into an interior wall 10 feet away. Yes, it was very quiet however the room was very dark despite the large window. The bathroom lighting and set up was terrible......shower had wooden slats on the floor that kept coming apart, there was only one sink and there weren't enough bathroom lights or power outlets in the room. The hotel moved us to another room which was much better (and more money) but at least it looked into a street. It was good to know we were actually in Barcelona. The historical aspect was nice but breakfast was mostly served outside in an interior courtyard so we could hear everyone else there because it echoed so much. The breakfast organization was ridiculous. If you didn't want the hot buffet for €39.00 each you could order a la carte and they brought you things piecemeal from inside. My husband's eggs one morning were practically raw. I ordered the muesli and a plain yogurt each morning which was good but crazy expensive. I guess we should have just had the buffet. The whole breakfast service was awkward. We have stayed at many hotels around the world and this was by far the strangest breakfast scene. In fact, we had just come from London where we stayed at the Charlotte Street hotel in a smaller room but everything was so much better organized and user friendly. It was expensive but we felt it was worth it. We felt ripped off at the Mercer. Also, be aware that cabs in Barcelona don't like to drive in the Gothic area since the streets are so narrow. It can be difficult to find a cab if you need one for a dinner reservation on a Saturday so start very early on your search.",2,2017,09,29
15,Memorable stay at the Mercer Hotel in Barcelona,"Home from our recent 6 night stay in Barcelona at the fabulous Mercer Hotel. Everything from the day of our arrival until our departure was pretty much perfect. The hotel in general with only 28 rooms felt intimate and very welcoming. Our room was extremely comfortable with all amenities that make for a first class experience. We found the location in the Gothic Quarter to be ideal for navigating the city. We could not have asked for a more central and charming place to stay.  I could go on forever extolling the virtues of this most wonderful boutique hotel. However, in the interest of keeping this brief, let me say that what truly sets this five star property apart from others we have visited in Europe is most definitely the amazing staff. Everyone (and I mean everyone) was warm and attentive. From breakfast until we said our last goodnights to staff at the end of the day, we felt really special and well taken care of at all times.

15,Fabulous hotel,"Fabulous boutique hotel in Gothic Quarter.  Perfect location walk to Las Ramblas, Picasso Museo, La Barceloneta, Catedral, El Born. Gorgeous modern rooms, great beds, sheets, pillows. Large bathroom, large closet. wonderful small pool and deck on top for lounging. Staff was the best of the best. Juan best concierge and so so helpful. Carmen at the bar was wonderful. Did not eat here but the restaurant looked full most nights.

15,"5 Stars, yes, yes, yes!!!!",We enjoyed our short but sweet stay at the Mercer Barcelona. We had stayed at the Mercer hotel in Seville for 3 nights and enjoyed it so much that we booked our last nights stay @ the Barcelona location. The hotel is full of history and we enjoyed our private tour of the grounds. It is a 5 star property in every way from the well appointed rooms to the attentive staff...couldn't have asked for a better place to spend our last night in Spain! This is an outstanding hotel and it's location is amazing. ,5,2017,09,27

My suitcase was delayed by our airline and the staff was incredibly helpful in tracking it down and helping make my stay comfortable despite the inconvenience. Could not recommend this hotel enough. ",5,2017,09,22
15,Amazing Stay,We stayed here on our Honeymoon and had such an amazing experience that we wanted to come back for our 10 year Anniversary. The hotel is just as incredible as we remembered! The staff goes out of their way to help you navigate the beautiful city of Barcelona. We love the modern feel in this historic building. And you simply cannot beat the location.

More than 5* service. 
Definitely recommend.",5,2017,09,20
15,Charming Hospitality in Barcelona,"We loved every minute of our 3 night stay! This small boutique hotel is tucked away, right in the heart of the Gothic quarter. It's a great choice for exploring Barcelona. Our room was the standard option, facing the street and included everything that we needed. Wonderful king sized bed with luxury bedding, a sitting area, spacious bathroom with rain shower and separate toilet room. We especially loved the Nespresso machine and the Molton Brown toiletries. When we were in our room (not out enjoying the city), having the window open meant that we could enjoy the sounds of the streets- I always appreciate feeling connected to a place. The rooftop area was lovely and we did enjoy a bit of sunning along with a couple of drinks on our first day...what a great little retreat. 
I really can't say enough about the CHARM of this unique property but most importantly, the staff were OUTSTANDING!!! From the moment that we arrived, we were greeted with sincere, genuine hospitality by everyone we encountered. Staff went out of their way to be attentive and helpful. One evening we had drinks and a bite in the tapas bar. I explained my gluten allergy and the server assured me that the kitchen would change the oil for a dish so that it would be safe for me to eat. Wow! We received multiple recommendations for local restaurants, all of which we absolutely loved! 
You can't go wrong with the Mercer! I only wish that we could have stayed longer. This will definitely be our first choice on our next visit to Barcelona!!!!
Thank you Mercer for making our stay so memorable...we will be back ;-)",5,2017,09,19
15,"Outstanding, one day all hotels will be like this..........","We stayed at the hotel for four days, celebrating my wife's special birthday. On arrival the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful and to add to what was already a wonderful experience the hotel decided to upgrade us to a large suite. The suite was extremely well appointed, king sized bed, free standing bath, large separate shower, vanity suite, all of top quality.
Breakfast was included in our package and a wise decision that was with a large selection of hot and cold items.
The hotel was located in the Gothic quarter and although there were plenty of bars and restaurants nearby the hotel was not affected in any way in terms of noise. The cathedral and Las Ramblas were within easy walking distance as was the waterfront.
I cannot say there was anything I disliked about our stay but there was much to be happy about in terms of the amazing staff and the quality of the hotel.
I would sincerely recommend this hotel and hopefully we may get the opportunity to return one day",5,2017,09,19
15,Barca's Best,"Stunning property in a location that is hard to beat. From breakfast on the patio to drinks on the rooftop, it is impossible not to relax here. Aside from everything the Mercer Barcelona has to offer, it is the amazing staff that ensures a return visit. ",5,2017,09,18
15,Exceptional stay,"My husband and I stayed at the Mercer prior to our cruise for one evening. We loved the hotel so much that we canceled our reservation for another hotel following the cruise just so we could stay at the Mercer again. Beautiful hotel, attentive staff and the restaurant was exceptional as well. Because of our stay at the Mercer we plan on visiting Barcelona again in the near future and plan to stay at the Mercer. Wonderful boutique hotel and truly a gem. ",5,2017,09,17
15,Best Location in Barcelona,"HIgh end hotel in one of the best locations in Barcelona, far enough away from the tourist traps to give you a more genuine experience yet within short walking distance of the major attractions.    Staff is incredibly helpful and proactive in helping you with whatever is needed.   Highly recommend using cars provided by the hotel on arrival and departure as the hotel is hard to find and many taxi drivers do not know how to get there.",5,2017,09,15
15,Kick off for Our Seabourn Cruise,"The location in the Gothic Quarter was critical in our selection of The Mercer. On arrival the greetings and assistance by all staff members created an exceptionally warming experience. The beauty of the hotel, a comfortable small suite, and the rooftop terrace was a delightful retreat from a very busy area!",5,2017,09,15
15,peace and quiet,"We stayed at the Mercer for a week in late August. The hotel is situated only one block from Via Laietana in the Gothic Quarter but a world away from the bustle of central Barcelona. The rooms are spaceous and well appointed. House keeping is as expected in a quality hotel.The breakfasts, served in the courtyard or restaurant are very good with a full selection of cereals,cakes, pastries and cooked options available. We did not eat dinner at the hotel but the tapas served in the bar is good. The mussels in particular were exceptional. 
Perhaps the best feature of this hotel is the staff and the quality of the service they offer. It's all about personalised service. 
I recommend this hotel unreservedly.",5,2017,09,13
15,Family stay,"Excellent boutique hotel in Barri Gotic. Beautifully renovated old building, respecting the original structure. Very large room, especially by European standards, with space enough for two roll away beds for our children so we could stay together, which was important to us. Roof top area is lovely for a quick dip and relaxing few hours. Hotel staff and concierges were incredibly kind and helpful. Within short walking distance of much of Barcelona's sights, and metro stop just a few blocks away. Expensive, but worth it.",5,2017,09,07
15,"Superb staff, terrific location","As soon as I booked my stay at the Mercer Hotel the staff was ready to start helping me have a great visit.  The response to any request was ""I'll take care of that for you"", to any question was ""I'll find out for you.""",5,2017,09,06
15,Wonderful!,"Outstanding Staff's performance. 
Great attention to detail and personalized service.
Wonderful hotel's architecture.
Breakfast and meals were absolutely delicious.
Looking forward to our next stay at The Mercer!",5,2017,09,04
15,Oasis in the City -,"Amazing property and staff!   The rooms were large and well appointed and the location was superb.  The rooftop was an amazing place to unwind from the hustle of the Gothic District.  I also love how we were not nickel-ed and dimed for all the small touches (water, wi-fi, etc) Stay here - you will not regret it!",5,2017,09,04
15,Amazing Stay in Barcelona,We stayed at the Mercer for 4 nights recently and loved every minutes of our stay.  The location was exceptional and the concierge wonderful with recommending local bars and restaurants.  Rooms were spacious and well designed.  Overall we highly recommend this hotel and cant wait to return.,5,2017,09,03
15,Great hotel,"Lovely, friendly and helpful staff. Good clean room. Great location, only 10 minutes walk to port in one direction and 10 minutes walk to Las Ramblas in opposite direction. The only down side was that the breakfast and the food in the main restaurant was expensive so we only ate in their tapas bar once. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2017,08,29
15,Amazing Hotel,"As we arrived we were greeted by three members of staff who were waiting to take our luggage and walk us in. We were taken into a private area where we checked in. We were offered a glass of Cava and all the staff knew our name. 
The location in my opinion is the best location in Barcelona as it is down a quiet small street in the gothic area, minutes’ walk to the major museums and the Cathedral. 
The hotel is both historic and modern. The best part for me was that even though the hotel was full it seems empty. The pool area on the roof was quiet and there was only ever a few other people there at the same time. 
We stayed in a junior suite with a balcony that was both spacious and modern.
The Breakfast was amazing with fresh fruit and a full cooked menu to choose from, all of which was very good. 
We went with two children 8, 10 and we were the only family we could see were staying there. Therefore the hotel is very quiet. When we went out to the water park the front desk handed us two bags with beach towels and sun tan lotion. All in all a great experience that I would highly recommend and although is expensive do get what you pay for. 
",5,2017,08,29
15,"Great location, very friendly staff at top notch hotel","We truly enjoyed staying at the Mercer in the heart of Gothic quarter. Very quiet location. The staff of the hotel were super friendly, impeccable service. Great contemporary design in a historic building. A bit pricey but worth every penny.",5,2017,08,29
15,Great Hotel!!,It has amazing decor and the staff is extremely helpful.  The concierge gave us a great dinner recommendation.  The hotel has a great rooftop terrace on the 4th floor with a small plunge pool.  The location is within walking distance to the the core of the city.  I would definitely go back!,5,2017,08,28
15,Beautiful hotel in great location.,"We recently stayed 3 nights in this gorgeous hotel for our Silver Wedding anniversary. Not only is it super stylish, it has the most amazing staff running it and nothing was ever too much trouble. Rooftop bar and splash pool a real treat. Hotel is in Gothic Quarter up a narrow cobbled street, great central area and perfect for exploring the city.  We're definitely coming back. ",5,2017,08,28
15,best hotel in town,"Everything was perfect about this hotel, our stay, the helpness of the staff, the location, the room, the decoration and the rooftop pool. We enjoy our stay and highly recommended  the Mercer Barcelona",5,2017,08,27
15,Wonderful stay!,We stayed at he mercer for four days and loved every minute of it. Perfect location with no external noise. incredible concierge staff helped arrange FC Barcelona tickets last minute. Would love to return. ,5,2017,08,25
15,Great hotel,"We stayed there the weekend of the 11th, 12th checkout 13th August. Staff can't do enough for you, rooms are small but funky, and very quiet.  The roof top bar is very pleasant with a small pool. We ate in the main restaurant, the food was great and the wine was really good and not eye wateringly expensive. The area of Barcelona it's in is lovely, lots of narrow streets and small bars. Definitely recommend it!!",5,2017,08,25
15,Barcelona holiday,"Perfect hotel! The staff was amazing, food was great and the rooms were beautiful. We had a last minute booking with 3 kids and this was no problem at all. I would highly recommend this hotel. Perfect location in Barcelona.",5,2017,08,24
15,Incredible stay,"A very unique, elegant and authentic Barcelona hotel.  Wonderful staff across the board.  Great rooms and beautiful rooftop.  I would never stay anywhere else in Barcelona.  Quiet and relaxing.  Perfect for a couple or family.  Can't wait to come back.  ",5,2017,08,23
15,Best hotel I've been to in Spain. Period.,"This hotel is truly special, superior to all the other luxury hotels I've stayed at in Barcelona (or elsewhere in Spain).  
Night and day compared to the Mandarin Oriental, with its small (very) noisy rooms and impersonal feeling. 
It's not brand new so rooms show a little bit of wear and tear but the space is well optimized, it's part of the charm and the whole building oozes a rare kind of chic throughout, unlike the standard ""faux designer"" stuff you find everywhere in the city. 
Maybe the TVs could be updated, and a plug for laptops added. Not sure it made a huge difference as you can't get a real black out with these anyway- but the curtains weren't as wide as the windows - a bit strange. 
Very few rooms so you feel a true sense of exclusivity and serenity. 
Rooftop is fab. 

Only note I can think of about the room, which is 100% quiet and spacious: it faced the service room, in which the staff elevator is located - its door was constantly banging in the morning. We heard a lot of yelling and raucus, and I doubted it would be the very professional housekeepers. 
After mentioning this to the reception, it got noticeably quiet - impressive, and confirmed the ""noise"" was rather coming from the neighbors. 

Icing on the cake: we were granted a 5pm checkout for a reasonable fee, during the highest season, which made our last day relaxing. 

Congrats to all the staff, can't wait to come back.",5,2017,08,20
15,Wonderful stay,"Such a wonderful hotel located in a very charming area a bit further away from crowded Barcelona. The service was amazing, and delicious food served in a superbe interior. The breakfast on the outside terrace and relaxing at the roof swimming pool, were our personal highlights. An absolute recommendation that made our Barcelona visit just perfect!",5,2017,08,20
15,Perfect,"I loved my 4 day stay at The Mercer Barcelona. From the location, to design, to atmosphere, to rooftop pool, the lovely room and above all the super staff. I recommend The Mercer wholeheartedly and look forward to returning.",5,2017,08,16
15,The best,"Mercer Barcelona is truly a wonderful Hotel with professional ,Knowledgeable and friendly Staff.. We loved our stay there and Highly recommend to anyone who wants a great experience when in Barcelona,Spain",5,2017,08,14
15,Outstanding experience,"Great service. Great location. Great experience. Highly recommend. The concierges provided great recommendations, made restaurant reservations at places where we thought it was impossible to get a table. They made our visit extra special. Thank you! ",5,2017,08,14
15,Fantastic location,"The hotel is nice and understated - the rooms are decent but not special ...but ultimately it is the location that sells it . It is in an amazing location with easy access to multiple bars , restaurants and shops . Furthermore easy access to many of the top sightseeing attractions . 

The concierge Marcos may be the best concierge I have ever dealt with . Not only was he attentive but knowledgeable and his restaurant reccs were spot on. I can certainly say that our stay was better because of Marcos and his team 

Ultimately I would recommend staying here for the great location and the staff all of whom were superb .",5,2017,08,12
15,Great Hotel,"Everything about the experience was first rate from staff attitude to food. Would definitely stay here again. Difficult to fault it. Service, food and location were first class.  The staff made you welcome from the start and nothing was too difficult for them.
",5,2017,08,11
15,Absolute perfection ,"Stayed here for 3 nights with my wife as part of a break for her 40th birthday. A beautifully appointed hotel in the gothic quarter, the decor is stunning and our room was amazing. Enjoyed the roof terrace and pool every day of our stay. Breakfast was delicious and cocktails in the bar were fabulous. Reception staff, waiters/waitresses, and especially the charming concierge were incredibly helpful, booking taxis and excursions. I have only experienced this level of service once before and that was in Bali. 

As has been mentioned by others, taxis have some difficulty accessing the hotel due to very narrow streets. The driver who drove us here from the airport was not at all happy with our choice of hotel and insisted on dropping us off on a nearby street. That said, on the occasions that the Mercer staff ordered at taxi for us, they were very punctual and waited right outside the front door. 

Overall I cannot recommend the Mercer highly enough. Expensive but very much worth the cost for a brilliant short break. ",5,2017,08,11
15,Perfect Experience,I took my 11 year old nephew for five nights to Barcelona and wanted a small boutique hotel in a good location.  This hotel was absolutely perfect from start to finish.  I forgot my tour guide and the wonderful concierge gave us a map and itinerary which was perfect.  ,5,2017,08,10
15,Tranquility within the Gothic Quarter,"We loved our stay at the Mercer Hotel. The staff were extremely helpful,polite and informative. We really felt like we'd stepped into a Hotel that cared for it's guests. The hotel is in an ideal location in the heart of the Gothic Quarter and I can't recommend this hotel high enough. ",5,2017,08,08
15,"Gorgeous hotel, tremendous service, and great location just inside Bario Gotic","Stayed in the Mercer BCN in early-August 2017).  

Bottom line: The entire experience was wonderful.  I can't recommend the hotel enough as a luxury option in BCN.

Property: The Mercer is just inside the Gothic Quarter, with El Born about a block away.  That makes it easy for car access, and very convenient for walking, both to the historic sights and to more local-type food in Born.  The building is a renovated apartment complex with an old exterior but contemporary interior with elegant courtyard.

Service: Guest services staff were extremely solicitous and helpful with setting our itinerary--including a great walking tour guide, Mark--and making restaurant recommendations.  I can't say enough good things about the entire team.  They were also responsive to email requests in advance.

Room: We stayed in the Mercer Suite, which has a very large living room and smallish bedroom.  The decor in the living room was brilliant, bright, and airy, despite the low light levels you tend to get with the narrow streets in the Bario Gotic.  The only complaint I have it bathroom design.  Awkward doors took away usable space and detracted somewhat from the look.

Food: We had a small tapas snack (good, though not great) on arrival, and the included breakfast, which was excellent.",5,2017,08,08
15,"Beautiful hotel, great location, wonderful service","Stayed at the Mercer just after New Year. The location is perfect for exploring the Barrio Gotic, Ramblas and Barcelonetta.

Being foodies, we wanted to visit some nice restaurants so we emailed a few weeks before our stay. The concierge were really helpful in organizing reservations at 'hard to reserve' restaurants in Barcelona. After our arrival, Juan, at the concierge helped us every day with directions, maps, reservations, advice on restaurants and sightseeing. He is one of the best concierges I've had the pleasure of staying with. 

The rooms are large with high ceilings, well fitted out with very comfortable beds. 

If we go back to Barcelona - perhaps at a warmer time of year, we will stay at the Mercer again.",5,2017,08,07
15,Exceptional Hotel Experience!,"We had a wonderful experience at The Mercer.  I would highly recommend it.  The whole experience was wonderful.  Great people , really awesome team .  We would return to a Mercer Hotel in Spain on our next trip 
",5,2017,08,07
15,Silence in the City,"The Mercer Barcelona is fantastic, right in the centre of the Gothic Quarter within walking distance of the main attractions and yet within the hotel there is a sense of peace and calm that takes you away from where you actually are. Breakfast in the glazed courtyard was the perfect start to the day and the roof terrace was a relaxing place to go after a days exploring and also a lovely pre-drink venue before an evening out. All this could only be achieved with people who have a passion for what they do and all the Mercer staff went out of there way to make our stay memorable.",5,2017,08,07
15,Beautiful boutique hotel in the heart of the Gothic district,"We stayed at this hotel for four nights as a family of four. We stayed in a suite and had 2 roll away beds added to the room and still had plenty of room. The service was impeccable, the linens were beautiful, and the artwork in each room and in the corridors were inspiring. Most of all, we loved how the hotel treated us and took care of our every need. A few things to consider before staying there - the rooms are a little dark with several spot lights that are well appointed in the room so please note this if you are a big reader. The pool on the roof is very small, so the photo is a bit misleading. Having said this, our two boys went up there each day to take dip while we ordered glasses of wine and looked out over the city. In addition, it is much quieter to stay in the Gothic quarter than in a hotel that faces a bustling street, but this means that a taxi can barely squeeze through. Finally, there is the price tag - it is definitely luxury pricing, but you are getting what you are paying for.",5,2017,08,05
15,Superb service ,"We really enjoyed the Mercer, the rooms are beautiful- but the staff is what makes this hotel unique and superb. The breakfast was delicious and quite beautifully prepared each morning. We had a couple of hick-ups with the broken A/C, but overall a great location to wander around the Gothic Quarter from. ",5,2017,08,04
15,First class,"Great facilities, love the roof terrace, very accommodating, breakfast was amazing, so much choice and try everything!! Cocktails outstanding. Would recommend to anyone that wants a relaxing break and has cash to burn!! ",5,2017,08,04
15,The perfect hotel,"We stayed at this hotel and will never stay anywhere else in Barcelona again! Service is beyond, rooms are beautify and rooftop is to die for. With only 28 rooms this is genuinely a boutique hotel bliss",5,2017,08,04
15,Real luxury in the city center,"This is a really beautiful hotel. The staff really do everything they can to make your stay pleasant and stress-free.

Upon check-in we were told that our superior room had been given a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe room, which was beautiful, a frequently restocked, complimentary minibar, and lovely Molton Brown cosmetics. We were also given some complimentary patisseries when returning to our room after our first night out.

The location is really perfect for sightseeing and is situated very close to the Gothic Cathedral, and the Born district with its great botiques.

There is a small pool situated on the gorgeous rooftop terrace, and the Mercer Breakfast is not to be missed!

My fiancée and I had a really wonderful trip, and I'd recommend anyone who wants a plush experience ",5,2017,08,03
15,Top notch small hotel,Everything was on point here. Refined to excellence. We had a suite and it was worth every penny. The bed was beyond comfort and the hotel is perfect in every way. Highly recommended! The main restaurant was closed the day we went there but Le Bouchon was a nice way for us to ease into our week in Barcelona!,5,2017,08,02
15,A dreamy oasis!,"The Mercer Barcelona is a stellar hotel with superb service and a kind and friendly staff. Our family of five ranging across three generations stayed for 8 nights and had to pry ourselves away from this lovely property. The beds are extremely comfortable and the rooftop terrace pool is an oasis to stretch and refresh in at the end of the day. The breakfasts are elegant and delicious. The room service team is up at your door in a snap, even remembers your breakfast order from the day before. The hotel is extremely quiet yet steps from almost everything you might want to see in Barcelona.
Special thanks to the polished and professional front desk team, the savvy concierge and kind Tania and sparkling Aleix in the restaurant and bar team. 
We cannot wait to return and will savor the memories from our dreamy stay with you.",5,2017,08,01
15,Highly enjoyable stay!,"We enjoyed our stay at the Mercer, Barcelona, very much! The staff were very friendly and helpful and the food was fantastic. The Mercer was a beautiful palce to stay and end our holiday in Barcelona:",5,2017,07,29
15,Europe Vacation,"Service was phenomenal. The staff knows the area, what to do, where to eat, and how to assist you any way you need. All of our tickets and reservations and activities were coordinated by the staff at the Mercer hotel. All we had to do was choose what we wanted to do.",5,2017,07,27
15,Long Weekend,"This is an excellently run boutique hotel in a quiet and central location in the Gothic part of Barcelona with good-sized, clean, modern rooms, a very good kitchen and friendly, efficient staff.   The roof terrace and plunge pool is a bonus in that location.",5,2017,07,26
15,Perfect,"You would think it's hard to write a review for a place that has received so much praise and love already, but let me tell you, it is quite possible. My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Mercer Barcelona during the length of our honeymoon this past May. Though it's been close to 3 months since we've returned from our trip, we find ourselves talking about the Mercer on a daily basis. We miss it all. 

It's not hard to fall in love with a city like Barcelona, for us, it's become a clear favorite. But rarely, if ever, do you feel that the hotel you stayed in almost supersedes the location it's in. We are avid travelers. Yet every day, we found it nearly impossible to find the motivation to leave the hotel so we could go out and explore the city. Plenty has been said about the Mercer's understated elegance and history, all well deserved. The location, in Barri Gòtic, speaks for itself. The true beauty of this hotel, though, lies wholly in its staff. The attention to detail that goes behind every thoughtful note we found in our room each day, the Cava left for us as a surprise, the perfect room service delivery at 2 a.m., this is what makes a hotel memorable. Though it was never mentioned, the staffed figured out I would be celebrating my birthday during our stay and surprised me with cake during breakfast. My husband hasn't been able to eat pan con tomate since... nothing has come close to that 2 a.m. pan con tomate delivery. 

As honeymoons go, you know the time spent with your significant other will be an experience you'll remember for the rest of your life.  In our case, our honeymoon became THE experience of a lifetime. We only have to thank the Mercer for helping make this happen. A huge thank you goes out to Joan Manel, Borja and Jose, at Le Bouchon (espero haya escrito tú nombre correctamente!). 

A todo el personal del Mercer, se les agradece enormemente. Esperamos poder verlos pronto.",5,2017,07,25
15,"Exprensive perfection, hard to get to","This hotel, while pricey, is one of those hotels that gets everything right. Quiet, elegant, tucked away on a quiet street in a bustling tourist neighborhood, the Mercer has it all. The staff is smart and accommodating. The roof deck has a stunning view and tiny swimming pool. The restaurants serve clever takes of traditional food. All the key sites are within walking distance.
 The rooms exemplify Catalan chic and are also well thought out and well designed.  Although the building is ancient and was remodeled when it became a hotel the architects and interior designers provided all the essentials: kettle, closet space, reading lights while still keeping the unique historical character. It took me a few days to realize we had no natural light in the room as our balcony looked onto the interior courtyard.

One warning: the hotel didn’t tell us that it’s hard for taxis to find. Coming in from the airport, our cab driver gave up and dropped us at via Laeitana.  We didn’t have heavy bags and were able to carry them but if you need to be dropped off at the door then bring instructions to show your driver.  Leaving is easy as the concierge can call a taxi when you go and they have a special map with walking instructions from the main squares nearby.",5,2017,07,22
15,Lovely boutique luxury hotel in the centre of the old part of the city,"Wonderful hidden away hotel in a great location within walking distance of many places of interest in the city. 5 Star luxury with a lovely combination of modern and ancient. All staff very friendly, welcoming and professional. Lovely bedroom. Breakfast was the only meals we had at the hotel but that was very good. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,07,20
15,Ideal location for exploring central Barcelona,"Ideal for couples. Staff extremely helpful and friendly. Short walk to the main sights of central Barcelona but in a nice quiet alley, so great for undisturbed nights sleep.
Roof top pool and bar area which could be made of by the hotel, but a nice place to relax of exploring prior to dinner.
Ideal for couples.",4,2017,07,19
15,Great,The Mercer is so wonderful that I want to keep it my little secret! We had such a pleasant experience. The rooms are well kept. The hotel is stunning. The breakfast was perfect every day.

15,Hidden hotel gem in the old part of Barcelona,The hotel is excellent and their staff are really friendly. The historic building is really beautiful. Like enjoying a piece of medieval history. It is in the middle of historic Barcelona and close to all the important sites.  ,5,2017,07,18
15,Honeymoon Stay,"Wonderful hotel, highly recommend. The entire staff is friendly and makes you feel right at home, even learning your names. Great location in the Gothic Quarter, walking distance or a short taxi to most of the great spots. ",5,2017,07,15
15,Fantastic hotel in El Gotic area of Barcelona,"Stayed in this hotel again for 6 nights. Great location, superb, comfortable hotel with amazingly attentive and pleasant staff.  Quiet rooms, unobtrusive air-conditioning and excellent beds ensure peaceful night's sleep.  Expensive but totally worth it!

15,Mother-Daughter Trip,"In the perfect spot to access all aspects of Barcelona.  We could walk, bike and tour and then return to the rooftop pool for a dip in the afternoon.  The staff was gracious and welcoming of both me as well as my daughter.  Wonderful visit!",5,2017,07,12
15,Cute boutique hotel in prime location.,"This was the first visit to Spain for my wife and me.  We visited Barcelona, San Sebastian, and Seville.  The Mercer hotel is in the Gothic District, a perfect location for walking to numerous restaurants and the beach.  The hotel staff is exceptional, very friendly and helpful.  Our first room was small, but had everything we needed.  Upon our return after a week of traveling before returning to the U.S., our second room was quite large and well-equipped.  We would not hesitate returning to this hotel if/when we return to Barcelona.  ",5,2017,07,11
15,Nice spot in the heart of the Gotic area,"This is a nice old building in the heart of the old area of Barcelona. The room was large with high ceilings and great light during the day. Nice if not luxuriant. The staff was very professional. We are twice at their tapas bar which was good. Only minor complaint was the bathroom. The shower had these weird panels as a floor that were rickety and wobbled when you walked on them, and the shower was glass which offered no privacy - we had our teenager with us so we needed to work around that constraint.",4,2017,07,11
15,GREAT CHOICE,"Our travel agent recommended the Mercer Hotel
and she was right to do so.  We spent 6 wonderful
nights at the Mercer which is perfectly situated
and offers very comfortable rooms with excellent 
beds.  The staff was both professional and friendly.
The breakfasts were great and we enjoyed having 
dinner in the restaurant as well as drinks at the bar.
The rooftop offered a restful change of pace and
a pool for those inclined to cool off.  Would absolutely 
recommend this hotel and hope to stay here again 
during a future visit.",5,2017,07,10
15,Mercer was amazing!,Everything about our stay exceeded our expectations! Superb staff treats each guest with exceptional care. Fantastic location. My family loved the Tapas Restaurant. I highly recommend this hotel. Thank you!,5,2017,07,10

15,Great Boutique Hotel in the middle of Old Town,"Only 28 rooms and ours was cool,modern style with modern bathroom and king bed on the internal courtyard which wa so quiet...AC was effective and the service is amazing.
The manager /concierge met us as we got close to the hotel by car but then got lost.
He handled the parking ,the bag and even organised a breakfast at a nearby Irish pub so we could watch the Rugby game in NZ on TV!!
This i Costes style meet Barcelona and Spanish warmth !!",4,2017,07,07
15,Not enough value for the cost,"Beautiful rehabbed building in the Gothic Quarter. Great customer service. But the rooms are just average, not large enough or quiet enough for the price (we could hear people in room above us and in the hallway). They took good care of us, but for that price we expected our junior suite to be really special, and it was adequate.",3,2017,07,07
15,Great place with friendly and knowledgeable staff,This place is in the Gothic quarter -a great walking area. Fantastic staff that are responsive friendly and knowledgeable. Rooms are quite comfortable and very nice breakfast. All staff were very friendly without exception. ,5,2017,07,07

15,Perfection!!!,"This boutique hotel is absolute perfection!  Located in the Gothic district which is perfectly located to walk to most attractions and Barceloneta beach.  The staff here is exceptional in every way and the most attentive I've ever seen. Chavier, Marco and Christina are amazing as is the entire staff.  Muchos gracias to all, you made our trip exceptional!  ",5,2017,07,06
15,Family Trip July 2017,We just spent 6 nights in this awesome hotel!!!!! We had 3 rooms and all were perfect!!!! The staff is one of the friendliest I have encountered. My family enjoyed a great breakfast every morning in the beautiful courtyard and every morning after my son and I went for a run they had water and towels waiting. I can not say enough great things about this place!!!! Also the location was excellent!! Thank you and we will certainly be back!!!!!,5,2017,07,05
15,Elegant oasis ,"We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in a deluxe room with a rolled away bed added for my daughter. It was a wonderful experience.  The hotel is very elegant and the service was excellent!  

Room:  I have read most of the reviews on TA and was concerned about the lighting and the size of the room!  But once we checked into our room the concerns were evaporated!  Our room was spacious with lots of natural light, at night the room lighting was quite acceptable too !  Our room was very quiet and the bed was comfy!  The only minor complaint is the shower area is a bit tiny and the tiles on the shower floor wobble - some thing for the management to look into! 

Service: Everyone was very friendly, helpful and sincere!  

Breakfast:  Very nice breakfast and the settings were beautiful with white table clothes, flowers and ambient lighting! the courtyard setting was very romantic and quaint!  highly recommended!  

We dined at the hotel's tapas bar one night and really enjoyed it - food was really good!  Did not try the fine dining restaurant!  

Will I stay here again? definitely! ",4,2017,07,04
15,Comments,"Overall lovely Hotel, great location and staff were exceptional in all areas. This does make the difference between a average hotel and a top Hotel. We thought the breakfast was pricey, do you really need thar amount to eat in the morning although being very nice, it would have been nice to pay for what you want, ( separate items )
J Burt",5,2017,07,03
15,We will be back ,"This is a proper Small Luxury Hotel. 
All the staff has proven very dedicated, savvy and friendly. 
2 small negative but it's better to know if you don't want to be disappointed. The swimming pool really isn't unless you're 6 years old. The other one : as the hotel is really an old Palace totally rebuilt and redesigned, the rooms get the natural light or lack thereof of old Barcelona. For us it wasn't a big deal as we spent most of the time outside but if you re caught on a rainy day don't expect a lot of natural light flooding in. We had a first floor room and I suspect a third floor might have felt a little more airy. 
That said the room we had was large enough and beautifully decorated. There are dozens of little details we loved from the molton Brown's products to the complimentary soft mini bar. 
Again what for me is the essence of luxury is the traveller's experience, as such, everything and everyone in the hotel is dedicated to that end. From the smiling doorman to the great maître d', even the maid are smiling and always polite. 
I had to mention the tiny swimming pool but that was unfair to the rather beautiful rooftop terrace where it stands. We spent a lot of interludes between visits and it proved to be a relaxing oasis to relax in between our long walks. ",5,2017,06,25
15,Best hotel ever,"Peaceful, elegant, friendly - the Mercer is quite simply the best hotel we've ever stayed in.  An oasis of calm after a hot, busy day sight-seeing and the staff are second to none.  It felt as if they were there simply to ensure our comfort and happiness - a very personal experience.  And the food is excellent.  The pool is small so gets a bit crowded if there are families of children but this is the only downside.  Perfectly adequate for a quick dip to cool off.  We loved every minute of our first trip to Barcelona.",5,2017,06,25
15,Great location and service,Wonderful small hotel in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. We loved the service and location. There was a heat wave and we were thankful for the plunge pool on the roof top deck. Rooms were beautiful but dark - need more light in the bathroom. Breakfast in the atrium each morning was absolutely lovely. Would never stay anywhere else when we come back.,5,2017,06,25
15,Wonderful hotel!,From our arrival to our departure we could not have asked for a more friendly or professional staff.  The Mercer also has a great location only steps away from the Cathedral Barcelona in the heart of the old town. ,5,2017,06,23
15,Quiet Private Comfort,"Wonderful stay in Barcelona at the Mercer Hotel. Like belonging to an exclusive private club. Attentive personal service throughout our visit. Great location and concierge advice was flawless. Rooftop pool and bar, the best! We hope to return.",5,2017,06,22
15,Most obliging staff ever,"We stayed here twice in June and we were amazed by the retention of ancient buildings built into this modern hotel. The staff are exceptional, especially head waiter Jonathan whose knowledge of the menu and produce used in the kitchen was so impressive. He knew every component of our ten course degustation. ",5,2017,06,22

15,Hidden Gem,This amazing boutique hotel was such a hidden gem in the gothic quarter. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a sweet escape in the heart of the city! Easy walking access. Wonderfully helpful and welcoming staff. Beautifully appointed rooms. And it's own piece of Roman history! We'll be back... ,5,2017,06,19
15,Luxurious and restful,"This was our third stay at the Mercer and the staff welcomed us with open arms. The quiet, luxurious and friendly atmosphere is why we stay here. The amenities, the personalized service, and location are just an added bonus!",5,2017,06,19
15,Best hotel in Barcelona with an amazing staff!,"We recently had a great stay at the Mercer hotel.  We found this hotel online based on reviews and it did not disappoint.  From the minute we checked in the staff was very attentive and handled all our requests with great recommendations for touring, dining, etc.  We had two days of private tours with the ""We Barcelona"" group that the Mercer staff set up for us.  Wonderful.  This is a boutique hotel so very easy to have breakfast (in a beautiful courtyard), or a drink on their rooftop which has a quaint setting that views historic buildings surrounding the Mercer.  Hands down in all our travels (Europe and America) we have never experienced such top notch concierge service.  Rooms are great too!  Highly recommend this hotel.  We hope to return some day!",5,2017,06,16
15,Great location within walking distance of what I wanted to visit,"Beautiful hotel with historical significance based on location within the Roman wall area.  Distinctive architecture from the Roman days with Roman artifacts, in particular the Roman bath that is now a restaurant. ",5,2017,06,14
15,Incredible Hotel Experience,"Conveniently located for walking and exploring.  Upon arrival, the entire staff went out of their way and exceeded all of our expectations.  The concierge gave excellent recommendations and set up several excursions and amazing meals for us.  Do not pass up the chance to dine at the hotel restaurant for dinner...We live in New Orleans and have high expectations for food.  The restaurant did not disappoint.  One of the most unique and delicious meals we had in Spain.",5,2017,06,13
15,Beautiful and quaint. Amazing service,"The hotel is perfectly situated in the middle of the Gothic quarters with only a short walk from las ramblas, the beach and several restaurants and bars. 

The hotel is absolutely stunning and the staff go above and beyond to ensure your stay in Barcelona is well prepared and extremely enjoyable. 

I will definitely stay there again.",5,2017,06,13
15,Mercer Hotel,Andrew Harper made the recommendation. The bathrooms were superb as were the comfortable beds. Staff is most eager to please. Location might deter some although we enjoyed it. Several taxi cabs had difficulty identifying the hotel location. ,5,2017,06,11
15,Subdued first class elegance.......,"The hotel is excellent if you like small boutique style.  The hotel is quiet, classy and the staff are wonderful and attentive.  The building itself is historic and the roof top deck and pool are to die for.  The location is excellent as well in the Gothic Quarter two blocks from the cathedral.  Worth every penny.  I would stay again.",5,2017,06,11
15,A great location in the Gothic sector,"We only stayed 1 night here prior to boarding our cruise ship but the staff was very friendly, accommodating and knowledgeable of local sites, resturants ,etc.The hotel is within walking distance of Las Ramblas, the Picasso museum  and the the marina area. The area is full of excellent tappas places and the surrounding areas make for an interesting walkabout. Very nice place and we will stay there if we return to Barcelona.",5,2017,06,09
15,Perfect choice in Barcelona,"A wondereful intimate hotel in a perfect location.
The staff is very professionnal and attentive and the hotel architecture, design and comfort are absolutely fantastic. Highly recommended for a romantic stay in Barcelona.",5,2017,06,09
15,"Elegant, well located hotel","The Mercer is a beautiful small hotel.  Decor is tasteful, elegant and understated, and the rooms are quiet and comfortable with excellent amenities.  It is very well located in the picturesque, old section of Barcelona within walking distance to sights and excellent dining.  The restaurant is good,  and the breakfasts are lavish.  Staff was very attentive and small tasty treats are provided in the room every day.  There is a small pool and lovely sun deck on the roof.",5,2017,06,07
15,"Beautiful hotel, phenomenal staff, incredible location!","The Mercer Hotel was truly an exceptional hotel experience. The hotel has a lovely interior and exterior, with very spacious rooms and excellent amenities. These have been the largest rooms we have ever had in a European hotel thus far - perfect for our three-year-old! The bedding at the Mercer is also extremely comfortable, we slept so well! The hotel is nearby to most everything (beach, marina, Gaudi houses, Barcelona cathedral, Ciutadella Park, etc.) and very walkable. The breakfast is delicious with a good variety of options, we did not eat other meals here, but I imagine they would also be excellent. The staff is extremely thoughtful, attentive, and quick. I have never had my luggage arrive at my room so quickly and when I came in from a run, the concierge handed me a towel and a water bottle. Not only were they so on top of everything, they were just very kind. There is not one thing we disliked about this hotel, our room, the location, or the staff. We have honestly and truly never experience such warm and attentive service! We thank you for making our stay in Barcelona so comfortable and enjoyable!",5,2017,06,06
15,Exceptional hotel located in wonderful neighborhood.,"The hotel is intimate and the staff so professional and helpful there is nothing to complain about. Just relax and enjoy the whole experience. The neighborhood's around the hotel are charming and allow you to,see a different Barcelona than the large shopping streets with generic stores you find all over the world.",5,2017,06,06
15,Fabulous hotel,Lovely boutique hotel in delightful area close to the Cathedral - perfect for exploring the city on foot. High standard of service and food. Impressive contemporary design incorporates old city walls.,4,2017,06,05
15,Very stylish!,"This is a small modern. boutique hotel in the gothic section of Barcelona. Each guest is treated as though you are staying at someone's home, including the wait staff remembering your coffee preference in the morning.  The consiege was very helpful in suggesting and making reservation to various music venues. This is a luxurious hotel in a great location. We walked virtually everywhere and we're happy to return to this special and stylish place. ",5,2017,06,03
15,Great hotel and even better staff,"The Mercer was highly recommended to us by some friends and we were not disappointed. everything about the hotel was great, location, ammenities, restaurant, bar, room and most importantly staff.  Everyone of the 10 or so staff we interacted with were exceptional, nothing was a problem and they always had smiles on their faces.",5,2017,06,03
15,Perfect Hotel!,"This hotel had it all for me and my husband.  Authentic, historic, impeccably designed, attentive to detail, modern. The staff was friendly and ready to assist.  The location was magical, close to everything we wanted to see.  The roof top bar was a perfect place to have an appetizer and drink when we arrived.  We loved the preserved Roman wall that made up the back wall of the hotel.  Absolutely beautiful in every way.",5,2017,06,01
15,One of our all-time favorites.,"From start to finish an A+ experience. My wife and I had a wonderful room in this wonderful hotel. The front desk was exceptional (thanks Marlene) as were entire staff. Due to a convention, cabs were impossible to get. Twice the doorman went some blocks to the busy street and actually flagged cabs down and brought them to hotel so I did not have to wait. Somehow, the staff knew it was my birthday and surprised us with cake and cava in the room. I hosted a business dinner for 20 and the food and service was outstanding...better than some Michelin star restaurants--Thank you Nataly. Also, we enjoyed drinks and tapas at the little bar and at the rooftop pool. Really outstanding service. We will try Mercer Madrid based on this so positive experience.",5,2017,05,30
15,Service with a Smile,"The Mercer Hotel is a beautiful property located in the heart of the Gothic Quarter.  As they say, location, location, location.  Service is outstanding – virtually all the people we spoke with, from the doorman, to the check-in-attendant, to the concierge, were responsive, solicitous and helpful.  Rooms are comfortable, if a little dark, and the bathroom fixtures are groovy, with fancy schmancy health & beauty aids.  There’s a great courtyard in the middle of the lobby, a welcome and beautiful surprise.  We were only there for one night, and greatly enjoyed our stay.  Tip #1:  cabs have trouble finding the hotel and you may need to walk a few blocks from where you get dropped off.  The hotel has a good map, or of course there’s always your smartphone if you’re willing to pony up for international data plans (we’re not). Tip #2:  La Taverna del Pla, a new, hip, reasonably priced restaurant recently well-reviewed in the New York Times, is right around the corner.  Go there.  Tip #3 – the hotel has cool-looking wood reading lights by the bed that we couldn’t figure out how to turn on – wave your hand over the little dots. Presto!",5,2017,05,26
15,Gothic Gem,"The Mercer Barcelona is a wonderful boutique hotel. Tucked on a quiet street on the edge of the Gothic Quarter, this hotel delivers old-world charm, modern amenities, great location and an oasis of a rooftop patio. The check-in was swift and welcoming with champagne and a warm smile. Our room, though small, had period features blended well with contemporary decor. We took advantage of the rooftop patio and enjoyed some sangria delivered by the lobby/restaurant bar. There are comfortable shaded lounges and a small plunge pool with great views of the surrounding buildings in the quarter.
The small tapas bar connected to the hotel, seems to be popular with guests and locals, and we enjoyed several meals here.
Barcelona is a large city, and you cannot walk everywhere, but the location of this hotel affords you the luxury of being able to walk to many. 
I have already recommended this hotel to friends who are travelling to Barcelona, and we plan to stay there again when we return to the city.",5,2017,05,25
15,The best hotel we stayed at in Spain. ,"What we loved:

-It's a perfect location in gothic quarter and walking distance to the best sites. 

-It's a beautiful hotel and historical with the back part of the hotel made up of Roman era walls. 

-Staff was genuinely friendly and helpful. 

-Breakfast was fantastic. ",5,2017,05,20
15,Everything was Exceptional!!,We had a great experience at the Mercer.  They catered to our every need and beyond.  Couldn't have asked for better treatment or service.  Breakfast was terrific and the location was amazing.  Everything was exceptional!,5,2017,05,16
15,wonderful place! Amazing service and a stunning conversion of a historic building,"From the moment we arrived we could not have been treated better. The staff, service, cleanliness of the hotel and location could not be bettered!  The tapas bar was superb and we enjoyed some amazing food and wine. Thoroughly recommend this venue *****",5,2017,05,14
15,Safe travels :),"Fabulous hotel and wonderful people. My mother, Anne, her sister, and their father went to Barcelona, Spain. Looking forward to visiting this country and many other countries. Stay young and travel on.",5,2017,05,12

Central location, extremely attentive and polite personal, customized service, clean, quiet and top of the line cuisine. We can highly recommend this hotel!",5,2017,05,12
15,Excellent boutique hotel,"We enjoyed a lovely honeymoon in Barcelona and a stay at the Mercer Hotel in the Gothic Quarter was a highlight. 
The staff were courteous, efficient and went out of their way to make us feel welcome. 
The location of this unassuming boutique hotel is excellent, situated near the Picasso Museum and the shopping and restaurant districts of Gothic & Borne quarters. 
We hope to return soon!",5,2017,05,08
15,Above and beyond,"I used TripAdvisor to find this hotel and the reviews are spot on. This place is a special gem. The location is in el barrio Gótico which is the old city center of Barcelona. Super unique. Loads of amazing restaurants and bars steps away. Far enough from the touristy Ramblas. More character than say the Mandarin or a place up on el diagonal. 

The staff was incredible. From the minute we arrived, a doorman saw us down the street and ran to help us. (It's a tricky place to find if you've never been there before). The room had a little toiletry bag of kid soaps, shampoos, etc for my daughter. 

The breakfast is so good. The tapas place in the hotel is so good. The staff is amazingly helpful. The rooms were super clean. 

I'm honestly trying to think of one thing I'd improve and I can't come up with anything. Would highly recommend this place. It deserves its spot at the top of TripAdvisor. ",5,2017,05,07
15,Fabulous hotel we loved it ,"A beautiful boutique hotel in the Gothic quarter of the city. The hotel is quiet and away from the hectic side of Barcelona. The staff are exceptional and cannot do enough to help without being intrusive. The concierge service is one of the best I've experienced. 

Excellent breakfast and dinner should not be missed. 

Thank you for a truly wonderful stay.",5,2017,05,05
15,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location, Incredible Staff!","The friendly, helpful, and thoughtful staff is second to no other hotel in which we've stayed.

15,Beautiful escape in Gothic Quarter,"we did relax in this boutique hotel where attractions are within walking distance. The staff is perfect, rooms beautiful , everything you need for a great long weekend in Barcelona. Bring your GPS when coming late at night , we were getting lost all the time! :)
We will be back",4,2017,04,26
15,Lovely modern hotel in Gothic Quarter,"This was a short break for our wedding anniversary. On arrival was greeted very warmly by name and offered a cold drink whilst we booked in. Room was facing the front of the hotel which means the view is only of the narrow lane outside. Room was comfortable with a good size bed. There is a roof terrace which is very enjoyable at any time of day with complimentary water & you can order drinks. The bar is great with an excellent bar man who loves to put on a show when creating cocktails. Only blip on our stay was the poor breakfast and service which is extremely over priced. I have to avoid dairy and therefore couldn't have the continental, unfortunately the a la carte was limited and we waited after requesting toast three times. I did complain at Reception and wasn't charged for this. Overall we would stay again and would recommend the hotel.",4,2017,04,24
15,Incredible hotel in Gothic Quarter,"This is hands down the best hotel I've ever stayed in. It's absolutely beautiful, with state of the art appliances and furniture with a clean looking minimalist style. Parts of the hotel date back to the first century, which is lovely that the owners of the hotel took time to preserve the space and are excited to communicate the history of the building to customers. Mercer is in a perfect location in the Gothic Quarter, where there are other older, well-preserved buildings from different parts of Barcelona's history, and is very close to great restaurants and historical sites in the city. What truly made this experience, however, was the impeccable service of the staff. They took care of meal reservations, getting us cabs, and really treated us with respect. We were staying in the hotel over my birthday and the hotel staff greeted me by saying ""happy birthday"" AND had a delicious cake and champagne delivered to the room. This personal touch truly makes this hotel remarkable and made our stay the trip of our lives.",5,2017,04,19
15,One of the best hotels,"This is an amazing place. The welcome alone told us that we would enjoy a very special stay here. Our bags were taken immediately, a glass of prosecco offered and our checkin was efficiently completed in the blink of an eye.
We were upgraded and enjoyed a suite which was clean, modern, comfortable and well serviced each day. Nothing was too much for the staff, be it booking a visit to Park Guell, recommending places to visit or giving directions. 
The hotel is well-placed in the Gothic Quarter and we found it easily. It boasts a rooftop terrace which has comfortable loungers and a smallish plunge pool.
Breakfast was amazing. Fresh fruit juice and fruits, cereals, croissants, and cooked breakfast on offer - and again superb service.
Mercer hotel is not cheap but we felt that the number of superlatives made it good value for money.",5,2017,04,14
15,Amazing hotel in the heart of Barcelona!,"We absolutely loved our four nights here.  The location is ideal, the rooms and furnishings are divine, and the service is world-class.  The staff helped make our visit to Barcelona truly memorable.  Would recommend it without reservation!",5,2017,04,14
15,Nice stay but a little in convince,"Room is very clear and staffs are very kind.
However, room is tiny. Hotel located in old Gotic area is not easy when I arrived at the mid-night and the driver did not take off us in front of hotel, which was not inconvenient. ",4,2017,04,11
15,Amazing Service,"The location and amenities were excellent but the service by the staff is what really set this hotel apart. This was our first visit to Europe and although we have traveled extensively we have never received this level of service before. From making recommendations and reservations, Looking after our every need and anticipating it before we even asked they made it a very positive experience. I cant recommend this hotel highly enough. ",5,2017,04,10
15,Priceless!,"It's difficult to find enough superlatives about this boutique hotel.  Everything from the home made jams at breakfast, to the attention to detail in the rooms, to the haven of the rooftop terrace, is surpassed by the service culture of the staff.  We have never experienced anything like it.  It's not cheap but there are only 28 rooms and the warm intimacy of this well-placed hotel in the Gothic Quarter is priceless.",5,2017,04,09
15,I'd like to come back here!,"Wonderful place in the Gothic district of Barcelona. The hotel has a good location, very close to the popular attractions and metro. Mercer's staff is very friendly. They know all guests they have at the moment and try to help them in any questions. The hotel has Russian speaking staff. We liked the breakfast here very much. It was delicious  and beautiful. I'd like to come back here!",5,2017,04,05
15,Gem in Gothic section,"Great hotel in the middle of old Barcelona. It was a great location with so many things to see, great restaurants and cute tapas bars. There is also great shopping in the area.The rooms were clean and very  comfortable. The dining areas were pretty and the food was very good. The service was terrific and very helpful. I will stay there the next time i am in Barcelona.",5,2017,04,04
15,Superb Stay,"The staff were the most helpful and friendly group from top to bottom. The recommendations from the concierge team were excellent, the restaurant staff remembered all of our favorites each day and the rooms and building were all a very cool mix of new and old. ",5,2017,04,04
15,Perfectly Friendly and Beautiful Hotel in an Amazing Location,"Hotel Mercer is a stunning simple modern hotel in a old palace (and more recently paper factory) in the heart of the Gotic Quarter. The rooms, amenities, and especially the staff were incredible, always supportive and very friendly. Everyone working at Hotel Mercer went out of their way to be helpful. The rooms are beautiful, well appointed and very quiet. Our stay was relaxing and the access to the best part of Barcelona made walking and dining easy! We strongly recommend this Hotel!",5,2017,04,03
15,Perfect hotel for a busy city,"Part constructed from the old roman walls of the Barri Gothic, Mercer is a very cool, stylish hotel. Located down a very quiet road in the Gothic quarter, it is hard to get a taxi to do anything other than drop you nearby. The walk late at night (inevitable if you go out in Barcelona) might be a bit intimidating for someone on their own.

Location is great as you are so close to everything but off any main drag.

The initial welcome was perfect and there is always someone on the door to welcome you or offer sound restaurant and bar advice. 

We were upgraded to a junior suite (more a very large room than a suite of rooms), which was very well furnished and blissfully quiet.  Huge bed, we slept until after 900am. Only gripe about the room was a shower that dribbled on you.....more reminiscent of an English country house hotel than an ultra cool European....tiny issue.

Free wifi and water.....in this day and age it is criminal that some still charge.

Not cheap but worth every penny.  We will definitely be back, which I guess is recommendation enough.

",5,2017,04,02
15,Mercer,Wonderful location. So delighted with our choice.  Helpful staff with great restaurant recomendations. Our room was spaciuos and thiugh lacked a balcony there were rooms with balconies.  Highly recommend !,5,2017,03,27
15,Well Executed Boutique Hotel,"Great location in Gothic Quarter, although travelers should let taxi drivers know that you can be dropped at entrance as it is surrounded by very narrow streets.  Staff was terrific with restaurant recommendations, and also provided special sick traveler room service to someone in our party.

Great rooftop deck plus rooms are decorated with very interesting modern furniture and design touches.  The building is great combination of the old with a modern minimalist interior design.

Our room has Funky shower with slatted wood floor and huge windows that rolled back overlooking internal courtyard with a vertical garden.

Great stay!",5,2017,03,26
15,6⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ hospitality ,"Easily the most friendly and competent service across the board at this gem of a hotel. From the front desk to expert concierge to food, this was our best experience in Europe. We will definitely be back here. Everyone went above and beyond to deliver an outstanding experience. Breakfast was delicious and coffee was fresh and dinner at the stroke of midnight was gourmet quality with the chef personally making sure our son got something *good* to eat after we came back soaked from FCBarcelona basketball game. 
Room was comfy - Esp beds, and quiet. No street noise or neighboring rooms. Wood shutter inside block out all light - helpful for our jet lagged 12 hour sleep first night. ",5,2017,03,26
15,Great place with great company,"We stayed here for a few days from new years eve. It is a beautiful hotel in a great location!

The staff were fantastic - Joan, Bruna, door men and the rest of staff! 

Thank you soo much for making our stay so pleasant!!!!",5,2017,03,16
15,Loved our 5 night stay,"My college age daughter and i stayed in a king room on the vertical garden. It was a perfect room for the two of us. We had never been to Barcelona and werent really sure where to stay. My daughter found this hotel on TA and suggested it because she knows how picky i am about hotels. This hotel is in a perfect location and we walked almost everywhere. I would recommend taking a taxi from the airport.  The hotel is very difficult to find the first time. The gothic quarter is amazing though and the doorman stands outside all the time so when we were walking back to the hotel we always looked for him. The service at the hotel is superior and the staff very friendly and helpful. It is a quaint, quiet boutique hotel. I think it's the street and surrounding stores/shops that make it quaint. The hotel decor was modern on the backdrop of old town, a nice compliment. We regret we did not eat at the hotel restaurant b/c we heard it was very good. Be sure to make all restaurant reservations. No matter what day of the week, it is difficult to walk into a good restaurant and get seated. Be sure to eat at Llamber. We already miss being at the Mercer.",5,2017,03,15
15,Worth every Euro,"Worth every euro best hotel I have stayed at, staff very helpful, rooms very clean at all times. Its the small details that this hotel is excellent at also. The concierges made the difference great knowledge of the centre, made all the arrangements and his selection of restaurant were 5 star, is short spend the extra and go to the Mercer hotel.",5,2017,03,14
15,Fabulous hotel with wonderful staff,"We have just spent three nights in this fantastic hotel, the hotel can be found in the gothic area and as soon as we arrived we were greeted by the concierge who invited us to have a glass of cava or water and a tasty treat while we checked in. The room was light and beautifully presented to us with a very large comfortable bed and a min bar stocked with complimentary non alcoholic drinks. All the bathroom products were Molton Brown and our view was the vertical garden wall, which was so interesting with all the different plants cascading down. The breakfast was a variety of fruits, yoghurts, pastries, cereals home made preserves, muffins and cakes, cheeses and hams. Several cooked items were available to order which we tried different ones each day, we were not disappointed cooked perfectly and presented well. Most of all was the excellent treatment we got from the staff, they assisted us in booking trips, recommending places to visit, taxis etc they are all a credit to this hotel. We are hoping to be back later in the year as Barcelona and this hotel has so much to offer x",5,2017,03,10
15,Amazing dinner in a medieval private dinner,"I have rented a private dining room for a business event a few times and the experience has been great. The building comes from the First Century and has been refurbished by Moneo: a true jewel. The menus are excellent although the price is in line: around 100€. The wines are also good and the service excellent.

Amazing smoked mussels, mushroom cream, urchins, seafood preparations and meat prepared with the highest quality. The service also in line.

",5,2017,03,02
15,Wonderful time at The Mercer,"This hotel is in a fantastic location in the heart of the Gothic Quarter but walking distance to shops, the beach and Barcelona Cathedral. I could not imagine a nicer hotel in the  whole of Barcelona, the rooms were very quiet and comfortable and the architecture of the hotel  and surrounding area was incredible. However, the best thing about this hotel is the friendliness of the staff. I traveled with my daughter and when she got ill on the last day, the concierge could not have been any kinder or more helpful about assisting us, from offering to take tea and toast to the room as she missed breakfast to giving us a complimentary late check out. We loved this hotel and would not hesitate to recommend it to others. Thank you to all the staff who made our stay so pleasant.",5,2017,02,26
15,"Small, fabulous and perfect!","If you are not on a tight budget or want to splurge for a special occasion, the Mercer Barcelona is the most satisfying hotel experience I have ever had. Just top notch from start to finish. Service, location, food, cleanliness and professionalism of staff, all memorable. ",5,2017,02,26
15,"excellent hotel, but a little hard to find for a first trip to Barcelona","We loved the hotel and chose it for its great location.  It is a little hard to find hidden in the gothic section, but That can be the charm as well.  The service was excellent and the rooms where well appointed and very clean.  I would highly recommend this hote.",4,2017,02,25
15,Modern hotel with antique touches,"Great location for this hotel in the Gothic quarter, all modern conveniences and terrific staff.  Historic touches in elegant setting.  Warm and knowledgeable personnel - could not be more helpful.  Superior restaurant.",5,2017,02,22
15,Warmest service in the heart of the city,"The warmth of the staff is what makes this lovely property, exceptional.  From arrival, when they provided me with an extended overview of this beautiful city while waiting for my room to be ready, to suggesting and arranging private tours that suited our needs, to recommending great food experiences, the staff here are at the top of the charts.  Wish I was back there already...",5,2017,02,17
15,Great Hotel,"I really enjoyed my stay in this hotel with my firends. The rooms were excellent, very clean and fresh. The interior of the hotel is amazing, friendly and helpful staff. I would really recommend this hotel to everyone vising Spain.",4,2017,02,15
15,A remarkable hotel in a remarkable city,"A unique hotel but what made our visit so special were the staff.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left they were welcoming, helpful and flexible. The location was perfect for exploring the city on foot during the day and for restaurants and bars in the evening.",5,2017,02,14
15,"Gorgeous, great location, but beware of the toilets","This hotel is almost perfect.  It's quiet and clean (although in the room there were very noticeable  crumbs in the crack of the desk chair).  We booked through Tabletplus.  We got some of the amenities promised, but had to request others.  Overall we had a great experience, the breakfast was especially nice.  But (butt!) the toilets are the most uncomfortable toilets ever. Big and SQUARE with very little seat.  Perfect for SpongeBob. Not for humans.  Easy for little kids to fall in.  Most of the staff was excellent and polite.  We were a group of six including a small child and a grandmother.  The concierge seemed to think getting tables in restaurants would not be a problem for us.  Not true.  Reservations absolutely required.  We had a terrible experience with one member of the concierge team who sent us on a trek looking for a place to have dinner.  Every place she recommended was completely full.  After walking on a cold night for well over an hour, maybe two, and trying every restaurant the concierge recommended, and a bunch of others, we ended up back in the hotel, exhausted and hungry.  The concierge was not only unapologetic, she was rude.  It was the end of our trip and really left us with a bad feeling after what had been a pretty extraordinary experience.",4,2017,02,14
15,A Fantastic Hotel Experience,"We have been lucky enough to stay at many great places around the world but this hotel is definitely in our top 3. From the warm welcoming, to heart felt goodbyes the full hotel experience was incredible. A lovely room, comfortable bed with all mod-cons and spacious setting. The hotel is perfectly located in the Gothic area of Barcelona with many sites close by. The concierge was the most accommodating man on the planet, always helpful and friendly (I've never met a man so happy in his job!). The bar staff and hotel staff were very attentive and fun to chat with making the whole experience truly enjoyable.",5,2017,02,13
15,Great location & Service,We had a great stay at this hotel. The location is fantastic and very handy to all the tourist sites. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food was also fantastic - we especially enjoyed the breakfasts!,5,2017,02,13
15,Two days in Barcelona,"We arrived early on a Sunday morning for a two evening stay. The staff was freindly and helpful. The location was perfect for our first time visit to Barcelona. We really liked the location in the Gothic quarter. It seemed we were close to everything we wanted to do. The Metro was handy. The property includes a rooftop patio and pool. Our room was clean, quiet, and comfortable. We would return and will recommend to friends. ",5,2017,02,12
15,Special hotel,The Mercer made our stay in Barcelona very special.   I would absolutely stay there again.  It's a beautiful hotel in a fantastic location.

15,"Friendliest, most attentive staff","Great hotel.  Superb location close to shopping, sea, tourist attractions, great restaurants, and a clean, outstanding facility.  Really enjoyed the friendly attentive staff that were always providing assistance.  ",5,2017,02,09
15,Nice hotel,"The hotel is located quite centrally next to La Ramblas, metro station, museums. The staff is really friendly and helpful. Excellent concierge service! What can become better is the breakfast service. The staff is friendly but the service is slow. It took quite long to be served, we had to ask about hot beverages and I would expect from a 5* hotel to replenish water and orange juice and not me wandering around to find what I need. 
The overall experience was great and we would probably come back.",4,2017,02,08
15,Wonderful Hotel,"Beautiful hotel with excellent restaurants, friendly staff, lovely large room and extraordinary Roman ruins. Located within easy walking distance to La Ramblas, museums, and the beach. Would stay here again.",5,2017,02,05
15,Chic & exceptional,"Our experience as guests at the Mercer Hotel Barcelona last August 2016 was exceptional. Our room, overlooking the courtyard, was a delight; modern, minimalist, chic, and very comfortable. We were enchanted by the hotel's location, nestled discreetly in the glorious Barrio Gotico, giving us excellent access on foot to many of the places and restaurants we wished to visit. But most importantly, my wife and I found the hotel staff to be at a level of sophisticated skill, and kindness, we seldom encounter. The charming, and highly efficient manager, Joan Manel, and his entire team, were the very essence of what a first rate hotel team should be.",5,2017,02,01
15,Brilliant weekend break,We stayed 2 nights for our 25th wedding anniversary and it was a wonderful experience. The hotel is in a surberb location and the staff were really helpful. We had a meal in the restaurant and I had a taster vegetarian meal which was excellent. Would go back and would recommend the hotel.,5,2017,01,31
15,Great Architecture!,"Small hotel in gotico. Good location.
Great staff, very friendly and helpfull. My hotel in Barcelona for the next and the next time to come.
Beautiful spaces designed by a great architect: Rafael Moneo.",5,2017,01,31

15,Wonderful  hotel,"We stayed two nights for our anniversary and it was an amazing experience: the staff was really kind and gentle, and gave us a lot of great tips and suggestions.Thank you  for the great surprise you did us for our 15 th anniverasy of marriage!!!! The rooms are very quiet and charming. We hope to come back soon.! Thank you very much to all the staff and in particular to the chief of the concierge !!!!!! ",5,2017,01,23
15,Excellent Boutique Hotel,We had a 4 night stay earlier this week. The hotel is very conveniently located to best enjoy the tourist attractions of Barcelona. The rooms are very quiet and the staff friendly and helpful. The provision of high quality Molton Brown toiletries was a real plusThe hotel is very tastefully furnished with much attention to detail - the décor and design reflects Spanish architectural excellence and would make Gaudi very proud.,5,2017,01,22
15,Amazing hotel,"From start to finish our stay was amazing.  The quality of the rooms, the beds, the service and the ambiance were unsurpassed.  Most of all, the employees make this luxury boutique hotel a sublime experience.  From Juan and his excellent restaurant recommendations, to Xavier and his ability to find us a last minute table at an exclusive establishment to Natalie (who met our every need in the hotel).  We Will definitely be back!  Excellent location too!  

Btw... I only review if the experience is exceptional , and this review is well deserved.  Thank you to the entire staff for this quality and memorable experience!!!

",5,2017,01,19
15,Wonderful boutique hotel in the Gotic,"Stayed for a few days with my wife, and we would definitely go back. Romantic location (and it is possible to drive up to the front door, but easier to stop the car around the back side on Carrer del Sots-Tinent Navarro, and have the hotel handle things from there).  And you must eat at the restaurant. ",4,2017,01,16
15,Amazing stay,"Amazing stay. Great staff so nice. The hotel is an haven of peace and luxury.
Breakfast is a must. The concierge service is also great, giving us great tips about things to see and do.
Very quiet hotel which is a plus especially in Barcelona.",5,2017,01,15
15,First time Barcelona,"This delightful property and friendly, helpful staff made our first visit to Barcelona an absolute pleasure.
Would most certainly recommend the hotel and will stay there again if we return to  Barcelona.",5,2017,01,13
15,Nice stay at Mercer Barcelona!!,"Great locations. City landmarks are in walking distance and with Metro located just 2 minute from the hotel, it is very convenient to travel throughout the city. Staffs are extremely helpful!! Recommended restaurants are superb. Arrival and departure arrangements are smooth. Highly recommended!!",4,2017,01,13
15,5 stars all the way! ,"""Neri or Mercer?"" That was the question that plagued my mind the last few days before leaving for Barcelona... If you are like me, picking a hotel can make or break my trip! So, I picked both... 3 nights there and 7 at the other... With tripadvisor I must be brutally honest... because that's what I would want to read about... the good, the bad and the ugly. Here's what I thought about the mercer...

1. The Room- 5/5 CLEAN, well sized, soft comfy mattress, amazingly soft bedding, black out curtains, tv with English/Spanish option, authentic artwork on the walls, nice complimentary beverages.
2. Hotel- 5/5 centrally located; close to everything! Short walk to sites, shopping, eating, train station. 
3. Staff - 5/5 extremely helpful! Any question you have they are happy to answer. Kind and friendly. The best! 

Bottom line... 
Excellence... that is what this hotel and it's staff exudes. Every employee does their job with amazing finesse and professionalism but maintains a kind and warm disposition. This hotel is truly a treasure. This is THE place to stay in Barcelona. You will not regret it!
 
Tips... ask for a room on top floor, Upgrade if you can the bathtub is blissful! Guest relations have great restaurant advice and can make reservations for you. 

Good luck travelers! Hope this advice helps!

15,Sophisticated hotel tucked away in enchanting Gothic district,"We spent 5 superb nights at the Mercer Barcelona including New Years Eve and enjoyed it immensely. It was our first time in Barcelona and we were elated with the hotel's location. The Mercer is nestled in a quiet, yet bustling neighborhood of the Gothic district surrounded by excellent restaurants, bars, cafes, museums and shops. The hotel exudes confidence and refinement with its union of gothic architecture and contemporary design. We welcomed the fine linens and relished in the lush toiletries provided by Molton Brown. The deluxe room was finely appointed with a spacious shower, deep soaking tub, ample storage and plentiful closet space. The Mercer delivers on everything expected from a five star hotel; however, its service and staff is what truly sets this brand apart. The head concierge Joan Manel was extensively helpful with all our dining and sight-seeing requests. His pleasant and gracious demeanor was always welcomed and appreciated. Even the guest relations team member Bogdan went above and beyond to make sure our needs were consistently met. We veritably cannot say enough positive things about our stay at the Mercer Barcelona, it was simply exceptional.",5,2017,01,07
15,Another Excellent Review for this Deserving Hotel,"We spent Christmas thru New Years at the Mercer in Barcelona. Trip Advisor reviews were on target with this property. The location is the Gothic Quarter for us (family of 4 two rooms) was the best choice. The Gothic quarter provides an excellent location for dining, sightseeing and shopping. The Medieval and even Roman walls and the charming feel in the Gothic Quarter is so unique it makes you feel like you are living in the past. 

The hotel is tucked away in one of the typical gothic quarter streets. The doorman is always waiting for you to assist when you arrive or depart. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by Mercer Concierge, doorman and front the desk as if they were waiting for us. They remembered and greeted us by name throughout the trip. The concierge (for most of our trip it was Xavier pronounced Javier) was more than happy to find you an excellent restaurant, book an excursion including a day trip to Girona, book New Years Eve, provide direction, etc... Most of all they cared about your experience. In the morning our room rate included a wonderful full breakfast, which was served in a charming restaurant on the first floor. Our server and soon to be our friend, Alache (spelling) was about the best host and server you could ask for. The breakfast was so good we looked forward to it. On to the rooms: We were upgraded to a suite prior to our arrival. Our children, ages 25 and 21 stayed in a deluxe room, the mid-level room at the 30 room property. Our room was spacious and had a delightful backyard (not a terrace, but a yard) which we hardly used because we were there in December (weather was in the 50's) but would be amazing during the summer.  The Deluxe room was a fairly standard size room with new furniture and a good layout. Rooms were always clean including a timely turn down service. Refreshments in the mini-bar were complimentary and filled 2x day. Ok, the only constructive criticism and I have seen it in other reviews: The lighting in the rooms is abysmal. The rooms are lit by lamps which generally are reading lamps and do an awful job of providing consistent lighting. It's hard to read in the room and if you don't like the darker atmosphere you are not going to be happy. I was not bothered by it. My wife was. I am guessing that the hotel desires that type of room atmosphere. I would suggest leaving it up to the guest and installing more functional lighting. 

We are a fairly difficult to please NY family. Mercer exceeded our expectations. Understand however, this property comes at a high price. It's a small property in the best location with 5 star service. You pay a price for this. Our rooms, including most of the taxes and breakfast were 567 Euros per night.  If you consider the taxes and breakfast as separate (as most advertised prices do) its a 495 euro per night property. There was no nickel and diming. My bill was absolutely as expected. I would rather pay an extra 100 Euro a night and leave with an experience we will remember. By all means if you can afford this property go for it. Thank you Mercer Hotel Barcelona!",5,2017,01,07
15,Superior Hotel and Location,We had excellent service in a great room in a perfect location to explore Barcelona. Thank you to the staff and to the chef for an incredible Christmas Eve Dinner. Barcelona was an enjoyable place to visit in December.,5,2017,01,04
15,nice hotel,"This was a very nice stay.
Hotel is very nice, the staff extremely helpfull, the room clean althouw quite expensive 
The location was superb, middle in the old town and from walking distance to the sea.

",5,2017,01,03
15,Excellent,"This is our first time giving a review. We are extensive travelers and have stayed at many high ranking hotels.  The service we received at the Mercer from the time of booking and for the duration of our stay was second to none.  It really made the world of difference from having a good stay to an excellent stay.
All the concierges, especially Bruna went out of their way to make sure we maximized our stay.  This is a quiet oasis in an excellent position, walking distance to many attractions and fabulous food. Do not hesitate.",5,2016,12,29
15,"Very, very nearly GREAT!","Having just spent Christmas there, we think The Mercer is … GREAT.

GREAT staff – absolutely everyone - how could they POSSIBLY be any more helpful or friendly or fun?
GREAT location.
GREAT and beautifully-restored building.
GREAT beds and bed-linen.
GREAT and v quiet heating & air-con.
GREAT food [and wine] both in the Restaurant and the Tapas Bar.
GREAT cleanliness - everywhere.
GREAT for Christmas – as of course is the whole of Barcelona.

So YES – we would v happily do it again.

[All the above said, one small but important thing wasn't great for us – and for us was simply unacceptable @ 450€ a night. We felt our room-lighting [room 310] was sad and in reality just silly – a VERY badly thought-through victim of trendy ""design"" over functionality. It meant that our otherwise GREAT and so-carefully-designed room was, after dark in December, pretty dismal. And worse, the lighting was so bad that we couldn't read our books, either in the 2 chairs or, and even worse, in bed - infuriating! I couldn't see to shave, the desk-light was daft, wobbling gloomily about 15cm above the page. This whole room-lighting issue, especially not being able to read our books, was a SERIOUS drawback for us. And we thought it odd, too, because the public spaces are well and carefully lit – the carefully angled fittings in the restaurant, for instance. We did complain about our room lighting and were told we weren’t at all alone. 
It's an easily-solvable issue. We think the Mercer should do it! And carefully. And A.S.A.P.]

Then EVERYTHING about The Mercer would be ... GREAT!",5,2016,12,28
15,Mercer for birthday,"We went to Barcelona to celebrate 40th birthday of my wife. We chose Merce for value and location, but we were positively surprised by the stuff. They were helpful, proactive and pleasant to talk with. They made us couple of nice surprises and made us feel at home. I strongly recomend this place when you want to have a great time with your loved ones!",5,2016,12,27
15,This is Where You Want to Stay!,"Don't let the overall size of the hotel bother you. The quality of the food,  rooms and service are huge! The staff will address every concern of the guest enthusiastically. It was on a par with every 5 star hotel I've stayed. ",5,2016,12,26
15,Excellent Location and friendly service,"We was greet by very friendly staff once we arrived. The hotel location is excellent in old town, very convenient and we can find everything we want within the walkable distance. The staff is very detail-minded all the times. Comfortable room, welll equipped with all basic necessarily. The breakfast is excellent in beautiful restaurant that make lots of good memories for our trip. We will definitely come back again. ",5,2016,12,26
15,Excellent hotel,It is hard to fault this hotel. The location is perfect if a little difficult to find. We were upgraded to junior suites which are large and very comfortable. In one room the shower area was not separated at all from the bedroom which some people may not like. The rooms are elegantly furnished. Modern without being tricky. Delicious breakfast. Excellent friendly helpful staff. ,5,2016,12,25
15,Loved the Mercer,"Historic and lovely hotel in the super cool Gothic Quarter. Really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend. Little hard to find your way in the local area, but got the hang of it after a couple days. Very close to the beautiful cathedral site. ",5,2016,12,21
15,Fantastic stay,"Forget the far and souless Mandarin, and come to the Mercer !
The good things :
- Location : in the center of the Barrio Gotico, the loveliest area of Barcelona. If you come with a taxi, insist to be dropped just in front of the hotel, they can do it, but do not like it as it's a pedestrian area.
- The building : historical building, beautifully renovated, with white, light beige and a gorgeous blue carpet in the corridors full of light (thanks God, they avoided the greyish look all contemporary hotels feel obliged to have nowadays) 
- The rooms : larger than expected in such an area, with large windows giving for the rooms we had on an inner courtyard covered by plants. We also had a suite giving on a tiny street. Beautiful !
- The calm : even if you're in THE touristic center, the sound isolation is well done and we were not disturbed by any noise coming from outside.
- The terrace : very nice to take a break with a great view on the Barcelona's roofs.
-The service : fast and efficient.
The flaws : 
- The bathroom's walls are in glass, which does not give a real intimacy. We would have prefered normal plain walls.
- The matress was too soft for us but they fixed the problem within 24hours. So if you like a firm matress, tell them when you make the reservation.
Conclusion : Marvelous hotel !",5,2016,12,19
15,Excellent hotel,"Enchanting stay at the hotel. the staff is Young and helpfull. I lové the ambiance and the décoration 
The tapas at bistro are original and excellentes. Good sleep in a quiet room. Nice top roof in summer ",5,2016,12,19
15,Superior Hotel,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Mercer Hotel.  This excellent boutique has a personable, professional and helpful staff.  They are as considerate and as accommodating as possible from the moment you arrive.  Though we customarily stay at more traditionally styled hotels, the modern design and decor was warm and the room well laid out.  
We were leaving early in the morning on our last day so they arranged for room service for breakfast.  Our private transportation to the rail station had difficulty arriving at our hotel.  As soon as the hotel became aware of a problem (the driver called the hotel), 2 staff members immediately went to locate the car and driver and then bring our luggage to the car.  They did this immediately and with smiles on the faces that they could resolve the situation for us.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,12,18
15,Great hotel in Gothic District,Wonderful boutique hotel in the gothic district. Excellent service and very comfortable rooms. Interesting area to walk and shop. Our room looked out onto wonderful hanging wall garden. Nice outdoor patio courtyard.,5,2016,12,10
15,A perfect Hotel,"The Mercer hotel is definitely one of the best hotels we've stayed at. Apart from being beautiful and in a great location, you can tell that every little detail has been treated in the most thoughtful approach. The staff is amazing, everyone! Breakfast is probably the best we ever had at a hotel, the room is specious and beautifully decorated, the common areas are  beautiful and charming, and the whole experience of staying at this hotel, in the heart of the old town, is just perfect. Planning to return here soon! ",5,2016,12,06
15,Best Hotel in town with extraordinary staff,"We would choose this hotel again. Excellent location, very friendly staff and cool design. The rooms were very clean, the restaurant great with special food. It was top of the top! We will come again. ",5,2016,12,06
15,Excellent Hotel with flawless hospitality.,"Juan and Joan Manuel and the team were exceptional in making our stay in Barcelona perfect. We celebrated our 22nd year anniversary and Juan was fantastic in suggesting a wonderful restaurant for our special day. Nothing was too difficult for the team and we were treated as the only guests staying at the hotel. The location was perfect and Joan Manuel suggested a number of great restaurants in the El Born area, which we spent a few nights dining at.

The complimentary bottle of cava and cake was a very kind gesture to further enhance our stay. The team were so considerate and thoughtful right to the point of having bottles of water available for us after my wife and I returned from a morning jog.

Keep up the exceptional hospitality and service and we’ll definetly be returning very soon",5,2016,12,04
15,Beautifully romantic,Excellent stay in one of the most beautiful hotel i've seen. The place is well located and is a mix of ancient and modern architecture. I would really recommend this hotel for a romantic stay in couple.,5,2016,12,04

15,Thanksgiving in Barcelona,What a wonderful hotel in the center of the city. The staff is extremely attentive and helpful. Would definitely recommend Mercer for anyone looking for personalized service and the intimacy of a boutique hotel. ,5,2016,11,29
15,Mercer pairs historic elements and a true boutique hotel together in Old Town,"We have stayed at the Mercer hotel 4 times now and would not consider any other hotel in Barcelona. The location, renovation, and rooms are unmatched. The service is always there and you will never have to open the front door as an attendant is always there. After morning runs the doorman would be waiting with a water and towel for me. The staff arranges anything we desire smoothly and the room design in each different room is something special. We are
Customers for life and can't wait to try the new hotel in Seville. ",5,2016,11,29
15,An expensive jewel in the old city,"The Mercer Hotel: has a great location, convenient to lots of sights in the city; the service is very accommodating. On the other hand, the value is marginal, the experience is very American, the style is more modern than I prefer with goofy lighting and too much classic rock on the sound track. Although we couldn’t check in early, the concierge was most willing to recommend activities and places to see and eat. . The room was quiet and spacious but I am no fan of the décor – the minimalist modern look which reminds me of the recovery room after prostate surgery. The breakfasts were exceptional, the location perfect; it’s just too damn expensive. Yet it’s fully booked. Overall, we enjoyed the visit.",4,2016,11,27
15,Excellent service in a great location,"When we checked in, we were greeted by cheerful staff and were offered a glass of Cava. The service from the moment we arrived was excellent, The hotel is located in the historic area and right on the old town wall. It is an easy area to walk around with a myriad of interesting shops and restaurants close by.
I can also highly recommend the hotel restaurant, the food is fantastic, i suggest you follow the maitre'd recommendation. 
We only stayed 1 night, we should have stayed longer. One area they can improve is the lighting in the room, it is a bit dark. Otherwise, it is comfortable and welcoming.",4,2016,11,26
15,Wonderful Barcelona visit,"We loved this hotel. Very classy in understated manner. On quiet street in Gothic Quarter which we loved exploring. Lovely staff always ready to help with directions, suggestions, tickets and reservations.
Could not ask for more!",5,2016,11,26
15,"A beautiful hotel, would definitely recommend","Expensive, but lovely.  Staff were young, attentive and completely professional.  Breakfast was exceptional, so beautifully presented.  I loved how modern features have been embedded in an historic building.  The best possible use has been made of all the spaces, with a vertical garden growing outside our window rather than looking at a wall, and a beautiful roof top pool area with sun loungers and bar (closed in November, but still nice to take a drink up there and sit out at the end of the day.)
Room was very nice.  Bathroom area was separated from sleeping area by a partition, not a completely separate room.  The toilet was a separate room however.  We wondered why there weren’t his and hers wash basins, as there was plenty of room for this. 
Nibbles in the room at turn down service on the first night were lovely, and I was disappointed that on subsequent nights all that we had were 2 little unexceptional chocolates.  Nibbles each night please.  Also, cava in the room would have been nice.  
We ate tapas in Le Bouchon, which were lovely.  A beautiful hotel, would definitely recommend.",4,2016,11,25
15,Second brilliant visit,"Came back for a second visit. Breakfast still a delight, comfortable room. Some of the most helpful staff you will ever meet. The concierge staff were particularly helpful. Just a delight. And the location is perfect for exploring the endless delights of Barcelona.",5,2016,11,24
15,An incredible luxury hotel,"Expensive, beautiful, stunning, professional and worth every single penny if you love and appreciate luxury and quality with attention to detail. 
This is an amazing hotel for personal or important business. It is small hotel so privacy is assured and inpersonally can't wait to return next year for a discreet private and quiet vacation in a beautiful city. Location in the mode also city is INCREDIBLE!!  ",5,2016,11,24
15,The perfect Barcelona home base ,"We had two nights here but could have stayed forever. The Mercer made our intro to Barcelona that much more special, with its impeccable service (thanks especially to the wisdom of Juan the concierge), its serene and fashion-forward rooms and overall design, its surprise and delight pastry for my daughter's birthday, and its ideal location in El Born. It's a boutique environment at its best. I could not recommend more highly. ",5,2016,11,23
15,Fantastic staff,"We chose this hotel primarily for it's location and its history,both of which were fantastic,but the real stars of this hotel are the staff.they couldn't do enough for us and always had a smile on there face and time to talk about the hotel,the city or just life in general.the hotel was amazing but the staff were the icing on the cake and my wife and I can't wait to come back to your marvellous city and fantastic hotel",5,2016,11,16
15,In Gothic Barca,Great hotel and service. The location is also adding to the experience.  The hotel has only 28 rooms so it makes the esperience quite personal.   Metro station is also 2 min from hotel very convenient to explore,4,2016,11,16
15,Mercer Barcelona,"This is a fantastic hotel, in a great location.  

The rooms are of a very high quality and the service from the friendly staff is second to none.  The in-hous restaurant was excellent.  We would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to anyone heading to Barcelona. ",5,2016,11,14
15,Exceptional Hotel and Service,On the whole an exceptional hotel with excellent and helpful staff.  We would definitely book again.  The only minor issues were lack of tea making facilities and there was some confusion on opening hours of restaurant where we booked a table for 7pm only to be advised on arrival that the restaurant did not open until 7.30pm.  This was only a minor issue and did not detract from the overall Hotel experience.,5,2016,11,13
15,Stunning experience in Gothic Quarter,"A great place to stay if you're looking for a luxurious base among Roman surroundings in the Gothic Quarter.  We went for it with a junior suite - expensive but worth it.  Impeccable service from start to finish, and we enjoyed an excellent dinner in the gourmet restaurant.  Great location within walking distance of several top attractions. Highly recommended.",5,2016,11,12
15,Pleasant but some services..,"We stayed in this beautiful hotel three nights and had a nice experience. The breakfast was very tasty and the pattio area next to the hall was amazingly cosy. Our disappointment was to know the hotel wanted to charge us 20€ per person for the gym. We knew in advance there was no fitness room in the hotel (when we called we were informed this was located 15min from there) but after paying around 2000€ for three nights we expected this service would be at least included in the rate. 2000€ is not a bad sum.. And even they needed it cash! Regardless of this fact we would come back to the Mercer. However, next time we will go jogging around the Marina instead.",3,2016,11,09
15,Great option in the Gothic Quarter,"Tucked away in a quiet corner of the Barri Gotic, this smart boutique hotel perfectly blends modern and ancient. The location is just about perfect, close to many tourist attractions, but still quiet and relaxing. The staff were the best I have come across in a long time, with every single one of them very helpful and welcoming. The concierges know us by name, and one of them would even escort us to the main road to make sure we can get a taxi, when the alley was closed due to celebrations. Breakfast was great with dishes made to order, all carefully prepared. There is also a tapas bar aside from the restaurant, which serves great cocktails and excellent tapas - very convenient after returning from a long sightseeing walk. Highly recommended!",5,2016,11,08
15,very good...,"good moment ... good place....very very good food
the breakfast is very good
the service is perfect
the tapas are very good also

ask a room not on the road beacuse its too dark but dont worry the road is quiet",4,2016,11,08
15,We booked our stay for the hotel and we will come back again and again for the service.,"The first thing that impressed us was the hotel itself… its architecture, layout and the many luxuries it provided us. What won us over however is their service… the best we every witnessed. The concierges (all 3 of them) got to know each person in our group. Their recommendations were spot on… each time. There was not a single request we made that was not fully granted. There are repairs in the alley and taxis cannot come to the door, James Bond walked with us the 2 minutes to the main street and made sure we were in a taxi before leaving (The women in our group called him James Bond because he looked like Daniel Craig). Even when we asked for the impossible – THIS IS A TRUE STORY - like last minute tickets to the Barcelona-Madrid soccer game, the tickets were in our room that same evening. We were not sure how to exit the stadium at the same time as 85,000 people and find our way to the hotel at 1am… our concierge managed to find a hotel employee that was at the same game, asked him to join us and made sure we got to the right underground station for the hotel. This story is so unbelievable that I attached a pic of our guide at the soccer game with us. By the end of our one week stay, Gloria – in charge of customers relation – knew each one on our group on a first name basis. Now we have a home in Barcelona. My advice is simple; if you can afford it… stay there!",5,2016,11,07
15,"Great service, stylish and comfortable room, plus gorgeous rooftop!","The transformation of this historic property into a gorgeous, stylish hotel preserved the stone walls and ceilings and created a very peaceful space.  Our room was small, but looked out at a living wall of plants.  The concierge staff was very helpful during our stay and gave us great recommendations on where to eat and visit, and offered to help with tickets to major attractions like Sagrada Familia.  Housekeeping provided turn-down service, and the location was perfect.  The rooftop pool and bar were deserted each night and provided an amazing spot to relax.  Would highly recommend!",5,2016,11,06
15,Modern elegance in an ancient city,Very comfortable space.  Excellent service and food with a great location to explore the gothic quarter of Barcelona.  Rooftop space is nice but only available in the summer months.  Hotel is located within a 13th century structure built on top of Roman ruins.  Overall good value given the ambience and service.,5,2016,11,06
15,Weekend,Mercer Hotel was a very nice and stylish hotel in a quiet part of the Gothic Quarters. Freindly and helpfull staff. Loved the roof terrace with the small plunge pool. Will definately go come here again.,4,2016,11,06
15,No restaurant!,If you think you are going to combine a great boutique hotel with a culinary experience think again. The hotel web site is all about the Mercer Rwstaurant and being an hotel restaurant you are never going to expect it to have closing days: 2 sunday and mondey! The alternative is a lousy bar de tapas. ,4,2016,11,04
15,Our stay could have been improved,"We stayed me and my husband a couple of nights early November. Overall we had a nice time in this gorgeus and historical hotel. Its origins go back to Roman times and the hotel succeeds in combining the original architecture with a minimalistic design. However, we faced several inconveniences during our stay which are the reason why we valued our review with three points. First of all, staff was generally friendly although concierge could have proposed better suggestions. Secondly, our room was extremely dim. We understood (as we were staying on a lower floor in the Gothic district) natural light was not one of the hotel strengths but even lights in the room were very few and really poor. My wife had difficulties when making-up and in general we had the feeling to be staying in a sort of cave rather than in a five star hotel's room. We were as well disappointed by the lack of a roof bar service. Certainly the views from the terrace are lovely and that's undoubtedly a great spot to relax. Nonethess, we hardly ever met staff upstairs so my husband ended up going downstairs for ordering some drinks. This lack of waitress and bar tender implied that dirty plates and glasses were around us. Obviously this gave us a very unpleasant impression. All in all, we would come back and hopefully everything would be perfect.",3,2016,11,02
15,New Favorite Hotel,"We were only there for one night but wish we could have stayed longer. Everything was wonderful starting with our welcome when we were greeted like kings but also somehow like old friends. The hotel is in a great location and the architecture and design are beautiful, chic but also comfortable and thoughtful. The staff was fantastic and provided excellent service, professional but not stuffy and very warm and welcoming. I was super impressed with the entire time from the doormen to reception to the concierge to the bar staff. I hope I have the chance to stay again.",5,2016,11,01
15,Lovely hotel with superb service,"We stayed for 3 nights at the Mercer Hotel during our recent visit to Barcelona.  The location of the hotel is perfect, within walking distance to many things and also very convenient to the metro.  Every member of the staff we came into contact with was extremely helpful and friendly.  Breakfast was delicious and the room was clean, comfortable, and stylish.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona!",5,2016,11,01
15,Gorgeous room,"Stayed in a deluxe room. Spacious, nicely furnished and an amazing bath!! I particularly loved how the bath was positioned so you could watch TV. As a solo traveller I was too frightened for the first two nights to get into the bath before bed in case I relaxed too much and fell asleep. It was a good blend of modernity inserted into an ancient facade. The staff were friendly. The breakfast was a little overpriced so I ate out in nearby cafes. The hotel is well positioned in the Gothic Quarter. It is very close to 5 star, but lacked a gym. Wifi worked well.",4,2016,11,01
15,Fantastic ,"Literally writing this on the morning I'm checking out. What a fantastic little hotel, the position is second to none, and the staff are so friendly and helpful. It has a really good tapas bar that is attached to it, and the main bar does a mean gin and tonic! I will definitely stay here again. ",5,2016,11,01
15,Excellent small luxury hotel in a great location.,"If you are looking for a smaller luxury hotel in the gothic quarter this is a fantastic choice.  Room was a fantastic mix of modern luxury and authentic detail.  Staff knew us by name from our first entry.  Concierge was friendly and effective.  Food was very good.  Great location with easy walk to Cathedral, waterfront, Ramblas.",5,2016,11,01
15,Gorgeous hotel for a special weekend ,"This is a great boutique hotel. The room was lovely, the staff friendly and helpful and the vibe relaxed.  Not only that, the location in the alleyways of the Gothic quarter makes it feel even more special, secret. In fact we were shown parts of the hotel that are the Roman city walls from 2,000 years ago. It mixes modern decor and old walls really well.

There are plenty of bars, cafes and restaurants nearby and it's lovely to be able to stroll to them. We had one dinner in the Mercer's restaurant. It is an expensive restaurant but the dinner was for a celebration and the food, wine and service were good value. For other dinners the staff were helpful in making recommendations and bookings.

All in all we liked the neighbourhood and the hotel and there's no doubt in my mind that if and when we come back to Barcelona we will stay at the Mercer. ",5,2016,10,30
15,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel, deep in the Gothic district of Barcelona. Absolutely ideal for tourists with much within walking distance, and an underground station within 150m.

Room was a little stark for the money we paid.  Incredibly dim , with very poor lighting, and a permanent ""blind"" on the outside of the window stopped virtually all natural light entering.  Well suited to a mole! Less well suited to my wife trying to put on make-up in the twilight zone.
Room was ""minimilistic"" , but furniture was disappointing quality, not in keeping with what they're trying to achieve here.
Front desk staff very helpful.  
Bed was very comfortable, and the room was very quiet. Didn't hear any noise from the rest of the hotel, or street at night.
We didn't eat at the hotel, as there are so many better reviewed places, with bundles more ambience.",4,2016,10,30
15,"Romantic, ace location but dark rooms","Fab location in gothic centre 3 mins from Metro.  Lovely decor but bedroom really really dark even with every light on, which was depressing.  Flickering light in bathroom. Super friendly but felt they could have been more helpful with restaurant suggestions plus had lunch on roof terrace whic took ages and they forgot cutlery and condiments and then took an age to bring and still forgot something. Wouldn't normally moan but it's not a cheap hotel.",3,2016,10,29
15,Celebrating our 10th Anniversary,"We spent one night at the Mercer Hotel Barcelona at the end of a 12-day Mediterranean cruise.  The hotel was spectacular and right in the heart of the Gothic Quarter -- walking distance to so many great places.  The staff was so friendly and helpful and made our day in Barcelona very memorable.  They surprised us with a complimentary bottle of champagne, a tasty dessert and lovely red rose to celebrate our anniversary.  Very nice touch!  ",5,2016,10,28
15,Fabulous weekend,"The Hotel couldn't have been nicer, great location, wonderful staff, our room was so quiet and spacious, and the breakfast was beautifully presented.  We were presented with a bottle of champagne and cake as it was our wedding anniversary trip.  ",5,2016,10,26
15,barcelona buzz,"fabulous location and extremely professional and friendly staff, 5* service without being over bearing.
Such an atmospheric building combining the architecture and style of Gothic Barcelona with all the comfort and amenities of a modern classy Hotel. Will return at warmer times to sample the roof top pool and bar, loved the relaxed Tapas bistro and the staff really made feel special. Well done!!",5,2016,10,25
15,Outstanding in all aspects,"Spent the weekend with my family to celebrate my wife's birthday.The reception by the staff in planing our stay was second to none.The location of the hotel, the quality of the rooms, interior decoration, restaurents and above all the positive and service minded attitude of the staff made our stay to a 100% success. Next time in Barcelona, Mercer is a given!/Jack Forsgren",5,2016,10,25
15,Historic hotel in central location,"We recently retuned from a trip to Barcelona staying at The Mercer. We chose this due to the amazing reviews on Trip Advisor. In our opinion it didn't quite live up to those reviews.
The hotel is in a great area in the old part of the city & close to many bars & excellent restaurants. It was also quiet at the time we visited. The hotel incorporates modern features with the historic ones in a tasteful and sympathetic way.
However we didn't enjoy the breakfasts, although it has to be said most reviewers did! First course was a beautifully presented fruit salad & then a choice of egg dishes. Each time the eggs were very undercooked, even when I asked for well done, & not very hot.The coffee was not very hot either & we had to wait a while for it to arrive. I personally would have preferred a buffet breakfast 
The roof top bar & pool area is lovely, although there was no bar service when we were there.
On the plus side the concierge service was excellent.
All in all I would stay again as the plus points definitely outweighed the negatives",4,2016,10,24
15,Sheer delight,"My wife and I spent a couple of nights here recently.  It was, quite simply, an amazing experience.

We treated ourselves to a hotel car pick up from the airport, so were whisked to the hotel in less than 30 minutes in the comfort of an S Class.  The hotel is wonderfully located in the Gothic Quarter, which, for the uninitiated, is a maze of streets and passageways, some so narrow that you'd never believe a car could get through.  But our driver did.

On arrival, the welcome is very warm and very friendly.  The hotel has only 28 rooms and the staff clearly invest their time in making sure that the relatively small number of guests receive as personal a service as possible - and they very definitely succeed in doing so.  We'd booked a deluxe room, but were upgraded to a junior suite.  The room was beautiful, the bed exceptionally comfortable.  The hotel itself is an incredible blend of architecture from as far back as Roman times, combined with modern simplicity and elegance.

The concierge took some time with us to suggest some places to go, the best recommendation being ""to lose yourself in the Gothic Quarter and Born"", which we did.  Barcelona is a beautiful city to walk around - we managed at least 10km per day.

Food was exceptional.  Breakfast is a three course affair, fruit salad, cooked, then cakes, and you could easily eat enough to not need lunch.  We dined twice in the restaurant in the evening.  Of note was the tasting menu, which the chef amended to suit our personal tastes.  The beef wellington was spectacularly good, and everything was supported by quite excellent service from a first class maitre d'.  I would also add that food and drink prices were excellent value.  You'll pay a lot more for materially lesser quality elsewhere in the world.

All in all, a superb couple of days.  A beautiful hotel in a beautiful city, with quite superb staff who made the trip truly memorable.",5,2016,10,21
15,Visit to Mercer Hotel Barcelona,"This was our first trip to Barcelona to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday and we decided to stay at Mercer, which is a boutique hotel in the Gothic section.  The location and service  was fantastic.  The employees at the hotel helped make our occasion very special.",5,2016,10,20
15,"Peace, luxury and great service in the centre of a fantastic City","We stayed for 5 nights in October basing our stay around a Champions League match at the Nou Camp. From the moment we were met in the street outside the hotel by a lovely gentleman we knew that this was going to be a special hotel and stay and we weren't disappointed. We have stayed at other top 5 rated hotels in Barcelona but put simply this is the best. Nothing is too much trouble for the very friendly and professional team at Mercer. Our room was perfect. Quiet, spacious, modern with fantastic design. The room was kept impeccably clean throughout our stay. Breakfast was just great. Fresh fruit, al la crate dishes, delicious tea and coffee and again friendly and professional service at all times. What we liked most was the sense of space and privacy which each table enjoyed. Breakfast is to be enjoyed at Mercer. In addition the Tapas bar and cocktail bar are also exceptional. We didn't try the fine dining because we liked the Tapas restaurant too much. We went 3 times during our stay. La Ramblas is just 5 minutes away, the sea 2 minutes yet once inside Mercer you would have no idea that you are so close to the centre of Barcelona. We also enjoyed the terrace on the top floor. Again very private this is a great place just to chill out. We would definitely like to return. Sometimes choosing a boutique hotel on Trip Adviser can be hit and miss but we are so glad we booked Mercer rather than one of the larger chain hotels. This is an exceptional hotel where history meets contemporary with peace luxury and tranquility in abundance. A special thank you too all the team especially Jordi and his colleagues who went the extra mile to help us with the planning of the Champions League game. They liaised in Spanish with Barcelona to ensure that our evening was perfect. This took them a lot of time but they did it from their heart with a smile on their faces. Thank you so much. Rob and Umie.  ",5,2016,10,20
15,Four Nights at the Mercer Hotel will Enhance your Barcelona Experience.,A quality nights sleep followed by a beautiful and refined Spanish style breakfast launched each day. Taking time out on the roof top terrace to watch the lights come on in the evening was magical. Mercers delightful staff made our stay perfect! We recommend the Mercer to enhance your visit to Barcelona!,5,2016,10,20
15,Outstanding Service in the Heart of Barcelona,"I have stayed in Luxury hotels across the world, and in its class, Mercer definitely ranks up there with the best of them. The staff and service was beyond outstanding, the location cannot be beat, and the rooms were clean and large. We will be back for sure.",5,2016,10,19
15,"As Tina Turner sang ""SIMPLY THE BEST""","Recently completed a five night stay at the Hotel Mercer.  Where do I begin with the superlatives!  The hotel has a unique design.  The rooms are quite well appointed and the bathrooms are excellent. I alerted the hotel prior to our arrival that my wife was celebrating a significant birthday ( no need for age ).  When we arrived in our room roses awaited both in a vase and spread through out the bed spread.
The hotel is located down a side street ( alleyway really) in the Gothic District, centrally located for all the ""must see attractions"" in the city. From the moment you check in begins an extraordinary stay.  The front desk personal, the concierge, the wait staff, and house keeping are all wonderful. Requests of the concierge were handled efficiently, with friendneless, and with excellent recommendations
The breakfast buffet was over the top.  When traveling my wife and I try to stay in Four Seasons Hotels. This hotel exceeded the Four Seasons experience",5,2016,10,19
15,Quiet Luxury and Grace,"As soon as you enter the Mercer you feel it, the hustle and bustle of the Gothic quarter is gone and you are met with a combination of ancient history accentuated by clean modern lines. Your heart beat will slow, your voice will drop down and you will know that you are somewhere special. even the scent of the hotel is intoxicating. 

If you want to fall in love or stay in love this is the place to stay. The kind of place that makes you feel special like you are the only person in the room, and the staff is there for you alone. They greet you by name and go out of there way to assist you. The concierge planned cooking classes and a personal tour for us that met my needs to shop as a designer and my husbands needs not to shop.

You will love it! 

The city is at your doorstep and you can easily reach any part from ",5,2016,10,19
15,One of the most beautiful and elegant boutique hotels ever!  With extremely friendly service to match!,"A family group of 6, ranging in age from early 80s to mid 20s, we stayed for three nights in early October and could not have found a more wonderful place to get together.  The hotel is built within Roman wall fragments and, yet, is as bright and modern as one can imagine.  There is a lovely outdoor court for breakfast and a terrific tapas bar, but also a lovely small bar.  Elegant, totally modern bedrooms, with great beds and baths. There is also a rooftop small pool and the terrace itself is beautiful.  And, most important, the staff are outstanding - always helpful, thinking ahead, thinking of the guests in every way imaginable.  As another reviewer said, this hotel is a gem.",5,2016,10,18
15,Great place to stay in gothic region,"I stayed here with my husband on our recent trip and throughly enjoyed it. The room was spacious, modern and clean. The location was excellent and close to many of the tourist attractions. The staff was accommodating and helpful . It is a little difficult to find. Our taxi from the airport had difficulty and dropped us off about a half mile away from the hotel.  I think I would recommend printing the map on the website to give to the taxi driver so there is no confusion:). I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,10,16
15,In the Heart Of Barcelona,"Beautiful hotel in the heart of the Gothic district but on a quaint side street so it is very quiet. The hotel is small and filled with charm. The staff was helpful and friendly. Concierge service top notch! Everything is close, and the Metro is just 2 blocks away. Loved it! ",5,2016,10,14
15,Great Jem in a unique setting and location.,Mercer Hotel Barcelona is a hidden jem found in a unique setting of the ancient Roman city right in the hheart of the Gothic Quarter. We enjoyed the impeccable room and service. Can not say we ate there as the food surrounding us was amazing. This deserves a five star rating!,5,2016,10,14
15,So much to like,"There are many things to like about this hotel:
Location. The hotel is centrally located and because it’s in the gothic quarter it’s quiet.
Decor. The hotel is built in a historic building with a grand entrance and lovely courtyard. The décor is modern and comfortable and blends with the historic setting.  
The room was spacious, well-appointed, had large amounts of counter space and room service was efficient and timely.
The reception staff, doormen, concierge and bartender all provided top-notch service.
The food at the restaurant was good and the service was impeccable.
There are only two negatives – breakfast and value.
I feel petty complaining about breakfast but it tainted our experience and it’s something the hotel can easily and inexpensively remedy.
Food – The quality of the food was very good, my suggestion is that the offerings on the buffet be adjusted and the burden on staff lightened. We liked that the buffet included cooked-to-order options (e.g., eggs and bacon) but the buffet was more of a dessert buffet than a breakfast buffet – cakes, cookies, etc. There was cheese, but no charcuterie and there were no jams, honey, nuts or fruit. The homemade yogurt was delicious but they ran out one morning. There was no bread, instead they brought a basket of pastries and slices of toast. This felt wasteful because we didn’t eat any of the pastries and would have liked more bread options. A bowl of cut fruit was brought to the table, but I think it would be more pleasing to patrons and more cost effective for the hotel to offer fruit on the buffet instead. 
Breakfast service –The staff seemed overwhelmed if there were more than a few tables full. The wait for coffee was far too long and it didn’t come with milk as requested. The bread basket was delivered with long delays as was the taking of and delivering of the egg/hot order. Jams, honey, salt and pepper were only available upon request, and delivery took very long. The staff were very pleasant and even remembered our preferences from morning to morning but the long wait times were disappointing.
I would hesitate to say this hotel is a good value. It is a luxury offering with a great location, modern and sizeable rooms and truly great staff but I think the per-night cost is high for the experience. 
We enjoyed our stay at The Mercer. We would recommend it to friends and strangers. However, I may explore other options or try to find a better deal on the Mercer’s nightly rate before re-booking.",5,2016,10,09
15,Boutique Hotel in a Great Location,"A quiet oasis in the busy Gothic area.  Our room was spacious and very clean with a large window overlooking a hanging garden.  As we had some difficulty navigating the cobble stoned alleys,we had to ask the concierge for advice on more than one occasion but they were always patient and helpful.  Extensive breakfast buffet served in the courtyard was very enjoyable.  Staff were always courteous and friendly.",5,2016,10,09
15,Gothic and great,"The perfect spot in Barca
Middle of everything
But quiet
Superb service

Breakfast elegantly served

You won't be sorry you chose it!

15,Beautiful Barcelona,"We enjoyed Immensely the facility, location and services of the Mercer Hotel.  Joan and his staff looked after us so well.  We highly recommend a stay there while you take in beautiful Barcelona.

Elaine & Dwight",5,2016,10,06
15,What A Great Holiday,"Fantastic Hotel merging Roman & Medieval History with Ultra Modern and Great Staff - nothing too much trouble and so Friendly and Attentive - We can't wait to return. Great Location in the Gothic Quarter, near the Old Cathedral and Port as well as the Town & The Ramblas - FAB!!",5,2016,10,04
15,"Oasis of calm, you get what you pay for!","Excellent service, comfortable room, nice atmosphere and good location - these were the positives and could just about justify the relatively high price per night. We had to complain about noise one night but this was dealt with promptly. We skipped the breakfast because very high cost - and did not fancy the rather sombre looking main restaurant for dinner, but enjoyed the Tapas bar one evening where the service is excellent. Overall highly recommended if you can afford the premium.",5,2016,10,01
15,Hmm...,"We returned to the Mercer for five nights having stayed previously last year. We had great memories. 

Our room on the third floor was nice (but cold) and we had paid the up front rate of €440 per night including breakfast. On arrival we went into Le Boucheron for some complimentary Tapas and they weren't amazing by any means, unlike last year. 

The next day we went out during he day and came back late afternoon. We thought we'd have a cup of tea in the room but realised there was just Nespresso. We decided to go onto the roof terrace and order tea. Unlike last year there was no waiter service up there so we rang down and they bought it up. One earl grey and one peppermint tea. The bill for this was €17 which included €4 for the tea milk. We did say that evening that we felt this was excessive and they took it off our bill but we really wished we'd not had to comment. 

There was a brochure in the room advertising a spa and gym (and hairdresser) so we enquired as to where they are as we do like to go to the gym whilst we are away. We were advised there's an agreement with a local gym ten minutes walk away and you can go in for €20 for the day. It's one thing popping into the gym after breakfast but it's quite another walking across town and it doesn't make it so readily usable. 

The concierge service is good and they helped us with the local train and advised on other trips which was helpful. Housekeeping on the other side was not. They came to do the turndown service every day at around 6pm. Just when we would be getting back from our day and preparing for our evening. We asked them to come back after 8pm but this wasn't possible. We therefore just got handed a weather card and two chocolates and that was it. I did ask them for replacement water for the minibar (soft drinks and water are complimentary) and the housekeeper did go and get them. 

On fourth day we went to the rooftop terrace late afternoon and my husband went down to order two drinks. There were three waiters all standing chatting and we did wonder why they couldn't come up and ask the guests on the terrace if they needed anything. We weren't the only ones up there as the weather was really sunny. My Louis Roederer was flat but we just couldn't face mentioning it. 

On our last morning we were leaving at 10am and came down for breakfast early. The service was at a glacial pace. Both coffees I ordered had spills in the saucer and I was bought the wrong breakfast. I sent it back and waited again.  My husband went back to the room as we weren't finished packing and left me waiting. We had a mad rush to finish packing and at 9.55 am we got a call to say our taxi had arrived. No offer to collect the luggage either and we rushed down with all our own suitcases to pay the bill. 

Overall we feel the standards have slipped at the Mercer which is a shame because its location in the gothic quarter is perfect. ",3,2016,09,29
15,Great stay,Lovely hotel with great amenities.  The roof top is a quiet oasis from the city.  The staff is quite helpful and generous with their time. We were there during festival de Merce so it was critical to have good advice. ,5,2016,09,29
15,Five star hotel in Gothic Quarter,"We stayed three nights in this hotel and received  excellent service . The staff could not have been more helpful . It  was our first time exploring the city and they were able to give lots of helpful advice .

15,Fantastic boutuique hotel in heart of gothic quarter,"Amazing boutuique hotel in heart of gothic quarter, Barcelona. The rooms, service, cleaning, food etc was excelent! Hotel is situated in a nice and quiet aerea. Breakfast was exelent but expencive. As a alternative there is many nice cafes nearby serving breakfast. Hard to find for the taxi driver so bring a map ;)   ",4,2016,09,28
15,"Great staff, excellent location, wonderful time",The location in the Gothic Quarter put us within walking distance of the best Barcelona has to offer.  We were there during the Merce festival and had close access to all the events in the city center.  The staff was extremely helpful.  We plan to go back and wouldn't stay anywhere else.,5,2016,09,27
15,Super attentive staff & great location ,"My husband and I are frequent visitors to Barcelona and we have stayed in a variety of places, apartments, hotels, with friends/family. Our stay here was a last minute decision and not one we regretted",5,2016,09,26

15,Review,The Mercer Barcelona was in a great location with great service!  A wonderful stay overall.  I would recommend it to all my friends who are planning to visit Barcelona.  The staff were very friendly and the decor was beautiful.,5,2016,09,26
15,"Location, Service and Class","Spent my 40th with wife in Barcelona.  The Mercer is a lovely property tucked away in a prime spot of the Gothic Quarter.  The room was great, the restaurants on site (Tapas bar, and an upscale restaurant) were delicious in case you wanted a chill night.

What gets it the 5th star for me is the excellent staff.  Everyone from the doorman to the Concierge team exceeded expectations.  Joan Manel, Joan and Xavi (Guest relations team) made it a trip to remember and we can't wait to come back to the Mercer Barcelona",5,2016,09,26
15,Continues to Impress,I have stayed at the hotel three times  - the first very soon after it opened.  The quality and service haven't changed one bit - it is still amazing.  The atmosphere is tranquil and luxurious.  Rooms are excellently equipped.  I will return!,5,2016,09,24
15,Good location,"we was loved our room it was big very comfortable .We had stayed 2 nights very enjoy and Mercer Hotel Barcelona was very good location ,The breakfast was nice and good services .all the staff are very polite.",5,2016,09,23
15,You cannot do better in Barcelona,"Located in the Gothic District, the Mercer is a short distance from whatever it is you want to do -- except the beach.  The service is incredible, the setting is historic and yet elegant and comfortable and the fantastic bars and restaurants (and shopping) nearby will complete the package.  Close to some of the best history of the city, and with a room we stayed in that actually includes part of an old tower wall from the Roman era, this hotel makes our list of best ever. Again, the service is outstanding -- you will be in heaven in a city that is heavenly. Highly recommend it.",5,2016,09,21
15,Outstanding,"Loved this hotel.  Location is great being right in heart of Gothic Quarter.  Loved leaving room and immediately being into ""old city"" with shops, restaurants, etc.  Could wonder for hours with easy return to room. Staff is of 5-star quality.",5,2016,09,18
15,A Gem,"A great boutique hotel in a perfect location. A new/modern design inside and an ancient structure.  Rooms are big, food is excellent, staff is The Best and the location can't be beat. Roof deck/plunge pool is a sweet spot. ",5,2016,09,18
15,Unique and excellent,"We can only echo all of the fantastic reviews for this hotel. We stayed for four nights over our 20th wedding anniversary, and had nothing but wonderful experiences. Every member of staff was extremely helpful and attentive, with countless personal touches that set the stay apart. The guided tour of the historical building upon arrival was fascinating. Both the restaurant and the tapas bar can be strongly recommended. The location is ideal, embedded in the old city wall on a quiet street in the Gothic Quarter. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2016,09,15
15,Outstanding hotel - top notch service!,"We selected the Mercer for our 25th Anniversary trip to Barcelona. This hotel exceeded every expectation! The setting is one of a kind - in the heart of the Gothic area, a modern top notch hotel set within ancient walls of a roman palace.  The staff were high attentive, anticipated our needs and surprised us with above-and-beyond details, help and service. The outstanding concierge staff helped us book private tours, make reservations, arranged taxis, and much,  much  more. We felt so pampered and welcomed in this friendly, romantic and delightful hotel.  After adventurous days, we relaxed in the roof-top pool - one of the loveliest places to be in all of Barcelona.  Come here for a one-of-a-kind experience!",5,2016,09,14
15,Amazing hotel,"Could not recommend this hotel highly enough . The whole experience was amazing . The staff were incredibly helpful , the location right in the middle of the gothic quarter was superb . Although you were so central it was still quiet and tranquil . The hotel itself and inparticular the rooftop pool and terrace were beautiful . Will definitely be returning . ",5,2016,09,13
15,"TOP hotel in Barcelona, Spain","Best hotel service experience in Spain (professional and swift)! Top hotel in terms of ambiance, decor, staff, location. Adore the modern design, great room amenities too. All that Plus the best Mr. Concierge (i'm so sorry i forgot to note down his name!), who is ever so helpful. We stayed as a family of 5 for 3 days at The Mercer in August 2016, we would have considered to stay longer in Barcelona because of The Mercer Hotel and the warm hospitality they've shown us:)",5,2016,09,13
15,A real gem,We had a wonderful three night stay - the hotel is a calm oasis from the hustle and bustle of the city - the rooftop pool/lounge area is a great place to unwind and re-charge after pounding the streets all day. The open air courtyard is perfect for Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner and all is wrapped up with contemporary decor and great service - a real gem. The location is also ideal for exploring the narrow streets and squares of the Gothic Quarter with some excellent local restaurants.,5,2016,09,12
15,Fantastic hotel.,"Great location. Excellent service. Very friendly staff. 
We spend our wedding anniversary so I ordered some flowers. The Mercer team surprised us with a bed of roses, bottle of Cava and a cake ( form of a heart). 
",5,2016,09,06
15,Exceptional hotel,"The Mercer is a hotel you won't ever want to leave. Located on a side street in the Gothic quarter, the hotel is perfectly situated close to the sights whilst also providing total peace and tranquility. Stepping inside, the historic building has been beautifully renovated and blends old charm with modern design to give an elegant and luxurious feel. The roof terrace is a gem, allowing you to unwind after time in the city or, as we did, take a day to catch some sun. As always though, what really makes the Mercer a special hotel are the staff. Faultlessly polite and helpful, every staff member manages to find the perfect balance of providing great service without being overbearing. A true five star experience.

TIP: be sure to try the delicious taster menu at the Mercer restaurant. Also, definitely ask the staff for restaurant recommendations when eating out - we did and they didn't disappoint.",5,2016,09,03
15,Too comfortable and hard to leave,"Feel the sense of old and modern atmosphere of the city at this hotel.  Not like a large hotel, staffs can care every guest.  Enjoy breakfast in the patio. Wanted to stay longer and sure to come back in near future.",5,2016,09,03
15,Calm oasis in Barcelona,"What a pleasure it was to step inside the lobby of this elegant hotel after a very long plane trip and be greeted by the wonderful staff. The hotel is perfectly situated in the busy Gothic area , close to everything but not close enough to be noisy and hectic. The staff are superb each and everyone of them , from the Manager to the concierge to the staff by the pool. Talking of the pool it was a lovely relief to spend a few hours at the end of each day swimming and relaxing on the rooftop bar. Our room was well,appointed looking out onto the garden wall , very comfortable bed . Breakfast very nice and the tapas at the next door bar the best we had in Barcelona. Would highly recommend the Mercer .",5,2016,09,03
15,"Old Town, Modern Wonder","The Mercer was our last stop before heading home after a 16 day roam through Spain.  (We had stayed at the Gallery Hotel for several days on an earlier pass through Barcelona.)  The 4-year old Mercer provided a wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trip.  Gorgeous, large modern rooms that are really unique.   Meticulous and respectful renovation blending old and new throughout hotel.  Smack in the middle of the best of old town, but you could have a wonderful authentic experience migrating from a siesta at the large roof top bar (with lots of umbrella shade and a spash pool) and then wandering down to the deep tapas restaurant off the lobby (with table at street edge in front for people watchers) without ever leaving the hotel.  I do recommend wandering out to one of the many excellent nearby restaurants to top off the day/night.  The staff was amazing from start to finish; they happily provided a full breakfast before the restaurant opened to get us feed before leaving for an early flight home.",5,2016,09,02
15,Really enjoyed our stay ,"Very comfortable hotel with great service and location. Room was really big with view of courtyard.
We got the breakfast with our room, which was delicious. Great selection of pastries, savories and eggs cooked to order. Service was also very attentive, plenty of beverage refills.
Rooftop pool and lounge was nice place to relax and enjoy a drink. 
We ate at tapas restaurant next door which was good but service a little slow. 
Overall, would highly recommend. A little tricky getting to and from by taxi but fine by foot.",5,2016,08,31
15,"Short stay, great stay!","Visited as an anniversary getaway mid june, the location is great with restaurants being only a short walk away. Our room was so clean and tidy with everything we needed. Food was fresh and tasty each morning at breakfast!",5,2016,08,31
15,Best service we experienced in Spain,I was on a trip with my old time friends and chose to stay in mercer in the last leg. I think the staff was fantastic from the word go! They showed genuine warmth and seemed to really care. The reception was great and so was the checking out process.  The location could not get better in barcelona as it was right in the middle of the gothic area. The rooms were contemporary and tastefully done. Over experience was excellent! Highly recommend. ,5,2016,08,31
15,Perfect Hotel for a great weekend!,We had a wonderful weekend in this Hotel. The location is great. People were very helpful and kind. The room was very clean and big. The bead was very confortable. The pool was so good after a long walk!,5,2016,08,30
15,Wonderful stay - elegant and unique ambience,"We stayed 5 nights and everything from the service to the atmosphere to the location was really amazing.

The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Breakfast each morning was so nice in a beautiful courtyard area. We had the option of ordering egg dishes and were always brought fresh toast, croissants, and fruit.They also played really nice music in the lobby/restaurant area.

Our room was modern, comfortable, and clean. The bed was comfortable with very nice sheets. The view overlooked one of the small narrow streets of the gothic quarter. This hotel is unique as it is built around old roman walls, combining such old walls with a modern atmosphere was very cool and different from any other hotel.

We loved the location since it was such a beautiful area and close walking distance to la rambla, picasso museum, the metro, as well as great restaurants in the gothic and el born neighborhoods. It is off on a quieter narrow street (tough to get to by taxi), but we liked that it was a bit tucked away and quieter.",5,2016,08,29
15,Impressive service,Amazing experience... Very impressive staff attention.. Great help in securing top tables..  I would give the hotel a solid 5 if it wasn't for the tough way for a car to get in to the door. Many Taxi drivers refused to get me to the door and left me to walk for 3-5 minutes,4,2016,08,26
15,Perfect stay for short trip in the city,"I made my reservation with this hotel because I saw it's been rated number 1 on TripAdvisor and it certainly matched its reputation!

I stayed here in one of the Deluxe Room with my aunt for three nights, the service from the moment I walked into the hotel throughout my stay had been top notch. The price is slightly more pricy than hotels I usually stay but with the experience I had in the hotel, it worths paying that much.

Design and decor of the hotel and the room was modern and had a comfortable tone. I love the fact that when I look out from my room there's a wall of plants. Everything in the room is complimentary and the shower gels and toiletries were from Molten Brown, one of my favourite brands. I didn't have breakfast at the hotel, yet I'm sure it's great.

Location-wise I have nothing to complain at all. It is at the heart of the city and it really is - 5-10 minutes on foot to Picasso Museum, Gothic quarter and other major sites. The marina is 15-20 minutes away if you fancy visiting the beach. You can also access to other sites by metro, there are two stations few minutes away. There are a lot of tapas bars in Gothic quarter so you don't really have to worry about where to get food.

In all, I will definitely return to this hotel. Lived up to what it charged and everything is 10/10.",5,2016,08,25
15,Best hotel in Barcelona,"My husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice hotel in Barcelona for our anniversary, but the Mercer was *beyond* nice in every way.  We got a little lost getting to the hotel, but we knew when we checked-in at the Mercer, we immediately knew we made the right choice to stay there after a lot of travel research.  Every bit of our experience with the Mercer was incredible!  We were even surprised that they've reached out to us even before our stay to make sure we had the best experience for our wedding anniversary.  I've never personally had that type of service from any hotel before and because of their great attention to detail, our stay was a complete success -- from the upgrade to the Master Suite, to making our dinner reservations at the exclusive OneOcean Club and for the getting us the best tickets in town for the the FC Barcelona Supercopa match where you felt like you can almost touch Lionel Messi on the pitch!  That was a once in a lifetime experience for us and the Mercer made this possible.  All of the staff at every level was professional, kind and attentive to all of their guests (and very accommodating to families who stayed there -- that was nice to see). More importantly, we were able to relax!  The concierge's recommendations were spot-on and top notch for shopping and eating -- very non-touristy and high quality suggestions.  We always felt taken care of even when we were outside of the hotel. The hotel is very centrally located in the Gothic Quarter and right next to El Born where there is fantastic shopping.  We only wish we could have stayed longer!  The Mercer took care of us every step of the way.  We can't stop talking about how fantastic our stay was in Barcelona! We definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barca and want to splurge on high quality relaxation. Oh and they have excellent rooftop pool! :-)",5,2016,08,25
15,A calming oasis in the bustling center of Barcelona,"A skip and a jump from the Plaça de l'Àngel, smack dab in center of the Gothic old-town section of Barcelona, the Mercer Hotel lies barely noticeable amidst the monumental hodge-podge of medieval stone buildings barely negotiated by a dizzying labyrinth of stick-skinny pebbled streets and the contrasting respite of the occasional plaza, typically chockablock with beckoning cafés and street performers. Once you walk through the hotel´s open doorway, however, the hectic street ambiance fades away, transitioning into an immersive soothing sanctum, starting with a lovely shaded central garden, in which a glorious breakfast is served every morning, replete with outstanding examples of the finest Spanish cheeses, fruits, and nuts, a myriad of egg dishes, and the wonderful tarts, breads and other such sumptuous baked goods created by the hotel´s incredibly talented pâtissier. The hotel´s calming decor skews toward a creamy modern style, punctuated with subtle references to historical Catalonian icons by Gaudi and others, rendered in stone. The rooms are ample, the bed was glorious, and the shower was so amazing I felt it must be is the most wonderful thing on the planet. The service was terrific, especially in terms of listening carefully and responding appropriately, but what was most gratifying was that our conversations with the staff, whether with reception, the concierge, the waitresses in the restaurant, the bellman, frankly with the entire hotel staff, were always, real, straightforward, frank, and mutually acknowledging, as though talking with friends or family. In short, the place is a tiny jewel, in a great location, within walking distance of countless major landmarks, museums, and places of interest in the neighborhood. During our future visits to Barcelona we will certainly choose the Mercer Hotel to be our home base.",5,2016,08,25
15,Love the Mercer,"We had a great stay the Mercer. Love the location in the Gothic quarter. The space is top notch.  Anchored by a Roman wall built in 300 A.D., the hotel infused the very old with modern design and architecture to create a very peaceful and elegant space. The staff is friendly, the rooms are very clean and nice and the location is hard to beat if you enjoy being in the Gothic Quarter. ",5,2016,08,25
15,Wonderful staff and location,I was very happy at the Mercer Barcelona. It is centrally located in the Old City. It was great to come back to for an afternoon siesta in between sightseeing. I would stay there again when I return to Barcelona.,5,2016,08,24
15,Loved this place!,Fantastic personalized service. Exclusive and Intimate setting.  Unique decor and style in an unbelievable location - Very memorable!  This is a destination hotel that is located in the heart of the Gothic Quarter and one of the best experiences in Spain.  ,5,2016,08,24
15,Upscale and chic,"Wonderful hotel with great staff.  Food and service was top notch.  Only criticism is location.  Although, located in the heart of the gothic quarter, walking distance from everything you need, the hotel is located in an alley way that was hard to get to by cabs.  So, expect to walk a bit.  We would consider stating again, however. ",4,2016,08,23
15,"Amazing hotel...location, service, facility and staff","Absolutely amazing hotel and experience. I stay at top tier hotels and the Mercer is one of the best. 

Location: best central location. 
Facility: comfortable suite, great roof top deck (wish they had a gym)
Service: top notch at every level. I'm a traveler that leverages the concierge and Juan was incredible. 
Food: ate lunch at Bouchons every day...amazing!!!!!!",5,2016,08,23
15,The Mercer is exceptional in every way.,"Fantastic hotel. Very well located and the help we got even before we arrived from Juan in arranging and booking tours and restaurants for us and then after when we got there, he and the staff were so very helpful and friendly. The Tapas bar was also very nice and breakfast was truly quite special.
We could not fault it and congratulate all the staff and management. It made our stay in Barcelona, a beautiful city, just that much more memorable.",5,2016,08,23
15,Great hotel in the Gothic Quarter.,"The  Mercer hotel was in a great location and everything about the hotel was lovely and inviting!  Nice rooms, great rooftop pool-bar area, yummy breakfast, gracious service all around.  We  would definitely go back next time we are in Barcelona!",5,2016,08,22
15,Superb Stay at the Mercer!,"This hotel is exquisite in every respect.  The location was perfect.  The rooms were beautiful.  My husband slept better at the Mercer than he has in months at home.  The pool area is so relaxing we stayed there more than we should have!  The staff is one of the friendliest and most accommodating we have ever met.  One staff member personally walked us blocks away to catch a taxi when ours did not arrive quickly enough to the hotel.  Another used her personal credit card to book us train tickets online (which only Spanish residents can do, for security purposes).  We will be back!",5,2016,08,22
15,Outstanding boutique hotel,"Gorgeous hotel with an unassuming entrance on a pedestrianised street in the Gothic Quarter. Our taxi had to drop us in another street (only a short walk away) and we would have walked past had the doorman not noticed us and our suitcases and asked us if we were staying there. Beautiful room offering a high standard of comfort and many luxurious touches like Molton Brown toiletries in he bathroom including a miniature bottle of facial wash. All the main sights of Barcelona are walkable from here. In all, this hotel is very highly recommended. ",5,2016,08,21
15,Mercer Barcelona - The Best!,"A wonderful Hotel well situated in the Gothic Centre of BARCELONA.
Everything about the Mercer was top class from the Service to the Facilities.
Breakfast in the courtyard was tranquil and the food was awesome .
Definitely will be back and highly recommend! ",5,2016,08,20
15,Can't top it!,"Beautiful hotel, amazing staff! A very relaxing and overall amazing experience. I booked this hotel as a surprise ending to my girlfriends birthday trip, and it ended up being the perfect choice! The staff was so welcoming and warm, attentive and helpful. The room was beautiful, and comfortable. The whole experience was perfect! The only probes is that I may have set the bar too high for our next trip... ",5,2016,08,19
15,Food,"We stumbled across this little gem whilst stomping around Barcelona s back streets. Originally we just needed somewhere to get away from the mid afternoon sun and some refreshments. Which resulted in us staying and having good some tapas , and we are glad that we did as it was delightful. Only realising that it too was a hotel, inside the reception was stunning. Some where my partner and I both agreed would love to stay if on a adult only city break. Beautiful.",5,2016,08,18
15,Great hotel for a special occasion,"This is quite possibly the best hotel experience we have ever had. We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and we could not have chosen a more perfect hotel. The location, right in the heart of the gothic quarter, was superb- we walked everywhere and absolutely loved the ambience of the streets all around us. Our room was just perfect- the bed was extremely comfortable and we slept really well. We had a small balcony too which was beautiful. The selection of food at breakfast was fantastic - everything we ate was delicious and was a really good start to the day. We had the tasting menu on our first evening which was truly divine. We loved spending time drinking cava on the roof terrace, meeting other guests who were also full of praise for the hotel. But the Mercer's very best feature is its staff. From the moment the doorman spotted us from a distance as we wandered along looking for the entrance (our taxi from the airport wouldn't take us down the very narrow street!) the welcome we received was perfect. The staff were  friendly and attentive, totally sincere in their efforts to make sure we enjoyed our stay. Nothing was too much trouble for them. We really cannot wait to return!! ",5,2016,08,16
15,30 year wedding,"excellent location, good food and pleasant stay. Liked the ambiente and the location as such. 
We would definitely return when going back to Barcalona. Nothing else to add, did already forward address to friends",4,2016,08,15
15,Fantastic food and Service!,"We stopped for lunch at the small restaurant that was part of this hotel. It was the best tapas and sangria we had ever had. The lady that served us was really helpful and made us feel welcome. The restaurant was very modern but traditional at the same time. Would definitely visit again when in Barcelona!
We had a look around the hotel too and it looked amazing!",5,2016,08,15
15,Unforgettable,"An unforgettable city trip in Barcelona ! 
Excellent central location to visit the city, most of the cultural sites are at walking distance.
Beautiful room with outstanding service. Fabulous breakfast, high quality ingredients.
Warm welcome and very professional and friendly staff.
",5,2016,08,15
15,A Truly Special Stay in Barcelona!,"What a fantastic hotel with the most amazing staff!  We just returned from our trip to Barcelona and we had quite a glitch to deal with and the Mercer hotel could not have been more helpful and accommodating.  Due to a medical emergency we were unable to honor our original dates that we had pre-booked and paid for with the hotel.  The Mercer kindly moved our dates not once, but twice to accommodate our hospital stay!  Going out of their way to help us and then providing us with the most concerned and courteous behavior.  Everyone is so professional and thoughtful.  Very special people :)  The rooms were also very comfortable and spacious.  We also enjoyed the closeness of shopping and restaurants.  Highly recommend the Mercer!",5,2016,08,14
15,Mercer Hotel,"I had planned my Barcelona vacation in two legs, with 3 days in Lanzarote in between a 3 day and then a 4 day return stay. Well deserved 5 stars, staff was extremely well trained, efficient, and friendly. The tasting menu at the hotel restaurant was excellent, as was smaller dishes available both at the upper deck pool area and in a more casual restaurant in the hotel. Location was superb in the middle of the gothic area, an easy walk to all the shops within, a number of museums and the cathedral, the beaches, fabulous local restaurants, and immediate taxi service other to local attractions and the airport. Car rentals are made easy by the hotel with drop off at the door, and any request I made was efficiently handled. Highly recommended, and thankful to the friends who recommended Mercer Hotel  to me!",5,2016,08,14
15,Top notch.,"Superb service, superb hotel. Incredibly quiet and peaceful especially after returning from the bustling streets of Barcelona. I cannot stress enough how impressive the level of service was from every staff member. Beautiful understated hotel in the heart of the Gothic quarter. I have no complaints and would gladly stay here again. Junior suite overlooking small courtyard with balcony. Room a tad on the dim side. Friends stayed at the Cotton House which is a beautiful hotel but the Mercer is a true boutique and a step above.",5,2016,08,13
15,An amazing 48 hrs in Barce,"A stunning hotel, a brilliant location. An amazing team of staff, that were so attentive and helpful

The roof top terrace is amazing, the food and drink perfect to match. 

And a lovely room overlooking a beautiful internal courtyard! ",5,2016,08,13
15,Very best hotel,"We loved everything about this hotel, staff and service, food, location. Best welcome. Great modern decor in a very old building of the barrio gòtico. Not cheap but worth every penny. Breakfast is absolutely delicious, served in a lovely patio. This hotel is vsuperior to most five stars hotels we have stayed in.",5,2016,08,13
15,Charming boutique hotel,"Cant fault this hotel for charm, character, ambience and service. The location in the old town is great to travel everywhere on foot. The narrow lanes do make it difficult for cab service to the door- but a few hundred metres away is ok. Book your transfer through the hotel so they will get your luggage to the door. 
The rooftop terrace with small pool and bar is a haven after a day touring and a great place to relax as are the ground floor bars, courtyard and restaurants.
While the hotel has historic charm -even boasting part of the roman wall, the rooms and public spaces are renovated in a modern style which compliments the original features",5,2016,08,11
15,Thoroughly recommend,"I stayed at The Mercer for 4 nights and must say its one of the most amazing places I've stayed. The staff were so friendly, helpful and knowledgable. The rooms were fantastic and for a place so central and convenient it was surprisingly quiet (had a fantastic sleep each night which I'm sure was also helped by the comfy beds). The rooftop pool and deck was a welcome relief after each day's walk. 

Definitely recommend. ",5,2016,08,10
15,Beautiful hotel in a great location,Everything about this hotel is wonderful and the location is great. The staff is very helpful when needed. The breakfast is amazing and a great way to start the day. Near a metro station and lots of sites in the gothic quarter that are very easy to walk to. A beautiful experience to stay in this hotel when in Barcelona!,5,2016,08,09
15,Perfection again,"Second visit to this unique hotel this year.  Last minute booking meant I had the last room over 'the street'  (a tiny lane)  but thanks to the perfect sound proofing and the blissful bed I slept well.  Spent the next morning on the  roof terrace which was beautiful.  The staff were attentive and very helpful,  special mention must go to the charming Canadian waiter  who arranged  a picnic lunch for us to take to the airport  on our way to Menorca for the weekend.  Breakfast was served in the courtyard which has beautiful plants and is an oasis of peace and quiet in a hot August city.   Communication from the Guest Manager Gloria were very efficient and all arrangements made for transfers etc seamless.  I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and look forward to my next visit.",5,2016,08,09
15,Our favourite hotel EVER,"Amazing location, sleek, cool but yet staff were so friendly and warm. Concierge service was the best before and after our trip. 

We are already dreaming of coming back. Lovely rooftop pool area. 

The whole hotel had a wonderful ambience and interesting history ",5,2016,08,09
15,Difficult to find location but worth the hassle,"There is a very good reason this hotel consistently gets great reviews. It's a beautifully restored hotel in Barcelona's gothic area in a quaint tiny street. What sets it apart is the exceedingly efficient and friendly staff of the hotel. The furniture is gorgeous as are the rest of the fittings. Breakfast is an excellent spread. 
The standard rooms might be a tad small but the hotel kindly upgraded us to a suite which was lovely. 
I will visit this hotel again. ",5,2016,08,07
15,Can't wait to return,"Wonderful unique hotel with a long history. It's within easy walking distance of cultural spots, shops, restaurants and Barcelona Cathedral. Staff have been amazing, so helpful. Breakfast has a great selection and food is delicious. Beds are wonderfully comfortable and rooms have Morgan Brown products. ",5,2016,08,05
15,The Best in Barcelona,"A really unique hotel in the heart of Barcelona. Situated in the Gothic Quarter, and central to all sights and attractions. Beautifully decorated, wonderful service and fantastic staff, make this hotel a perfect place to stay in barcelona. A magnificent breakfast, perfectly situated in the courtyard, was my personal daily highlight. The hotel has a unique top deck, with a plunge pool and views across the city. Also Walking distance to the beach. We will definately return. ",5,2016,08,03
15,Fantastic,Fabulous hotel. Staff are lovely and so helpful  (did not feel once like a tip was expected). Rooms were spotless and cleaned about 3 times a day. Excellent bed and pillows as cannot sleep easily when not in my own bed. Had a truely memorable meal in their restaurant. Lovely pool and cocktail bar. Best location in Gothic quarter. We have already recommended this hotel to all our friends and would definitely stay there again. One of the best hotels I have EVER stayed in (and I have stayed in many of the best).,5,2016,08,02
15,Amazing Staff and Hotel,"We checked into the hotel after a 10 day cruise and was notified that our flight home was cancelled by Air France with no rebooking.  When we checked into the hotel I mentioned that we were having this problem and Juan Manuel asked that we forward the Itinerary and that he would try to rebook us.  We took him up on his offer and went to the beach for the day and upon return Juan completely rebooked us and we had no problems getting home thanks to his help.  The hotel is amazing from the location to the services throughout the hotel; pool, breakfast, dinner reservations etc.  When we return we will be staying at the Mercer.",5,2016,07,30
15,Hidden Gem,"Great hotel in the heart of Barcelona . Rooms were large and well appointed with all with top class finishes . Rooftop terrace was a great space to unwind and have a cold glass of wine.
All staff at the hotel were friendly and couldn't be more helpful . I would definitely recommend this hotel and we will definitely return",5,2016,07,29
15,Tranquil oasis in bustling old town,"Wonderful hotel. Stayed with my wife and 2 teenage daughters. Perfect location for the old town and easy access to the underground. Clean rooms and very helpful staff. Only downside is the view from our room, which was a building site",5,2016,07,29
15,A taste of the old world charm with a modern twist!,"Just finished a 5 night stay at the hotel. The hotel itself is lovely! Ultra modern, very clean, and a great location! The old castle setting with the ultra modern facilities makes the hotel amazing! Beds with crisp white sheets, molton brown products to the detail of face wash and bath bombs are uber cool! And the two other things i would like to comment about is the guest relations staff are amazing and gave the greatest advice and reccomendations and arrangements. Especially florencia. The other thing i want to comment about is the desserts!!! Every day the dessert selections at breakfast and all other sweets around the hotel where par excellence!!! Michelin quality.......... If i had one thing i was not happy about it was breakfast! First day i left for my tour without eating breakfast cause i waited for my eggs for over an hr and they sent it with meat on top by accident as i am veg. Next day it also took close to over 30 min to get my eggs.... And i thought i was gonna leave again without breakfast..... The next 3 days i made sure i gave myself an hr for breakfast...... Cause eggs where gonna take time! My guest relations manager tried to help and make sure we had breakfast the last two days! Breakfast eggs were ok! But their sweat dessert chef was amazing!!! Overall i loved the hotel!!! Just felt that service at breakfast could have been better.....",4,2016,07,28
15,Good (but not quite perfect),"The Mercer does most things extremely well, and does in some respects deserve its reputation as the top hotel in Barcelona on Tripadvisor. But it doesn't do everything perfectly and has room to improve. I will let you judge.
First - the staff. Some absolutely incredible (concierge staff, absolutely first rate recommendations) and some were less so (reception staff, generally quite off hand). Room - we had a deluxe overlooking the inner courtyard where breakfast is served. My top tip - DO NOT book one of the rooms facing this courtyard. Every morning from 7am were woken by breakfast being laid out, followed by guests chatting whilst they had breakfast, and so on. Not very relaxing at all. Having said that the Mercer is a very small hotel on a very small site and appears to have only rooms facing the street (either side) or some facing an internal wall ('green wall') or the breakfast courtyard. All things done again, I'd have gone for the view of the wall!
Rooftop terrace - absolutely wonderful oasis in the city, small but swimmable pool, great loungers, rooftop drinks and food service (service and food all amazing). Only slight issue came when a group of loud US guests came and stood in the pool with their drinks for hours, meaning that other guests couldn't swim or access the pool at all without asking them to get out (we didn't). We felt that staff should be able to speak to such guests, unless of course they are the only group on the roof.
Sadly we had a bit of a weird incident - my other half's expensive sunglasses went missing out of the room. We searched absolutely everywhere for them, and then spoke to reception about them. That evening, on return from dinner, we found the 'do not disturb' sign on the door (weird, as we didn't put it on) and when we went in, the sunglasses were sitting back on the desk. Anyway overall I probably wouldn't stay there again - I hesitated between the Mercer and the Cotton House and I'd probably give the Cotton House a try next time.",3,2016,07,26
15,El Gotic Gem,"I looked at several hotels and finally decided on the Mercer for it's location and style. It lives up to all the positive reviews. Everything about this hotel is excellent including overall atmosphere, design, location, staff etc. Can't say enough good things about it! We would highly recommend staying at the Mercer!",5,2016,07,26
15,Mercer Hotel,"Quite the best hotel I have ever visited. The staff were all excellent, the room we stayed in superb, the restaurant was amazing and I couldn't recommend the Mercer Hotel high enough. A superb experience from the time we arrived to the time we left. First Class!",5,2016,07,26
15,"Luxury, warmth, history , and real , personable, and authentic staff","We have stayed in some amazing hotels around the world, our preference being boutique, local , and a mix of rusticity , great design and well - targeted luxury amenities.
I would place the Mercer in the very top of our list. It is located in the heart of the old city on a narrow cobble stone avenue. It is whisper quiet, with candle - watt light levels that soothe the senses. It is a design mashup of modern Spanish industrial design with ancient Roman walls..a gorgeous combination of color, hard and soft edges, and local cultural design touches. The service was personable, helpful, and first class in every way. Not inexpensive, but worth every penny.",5,2016,07,26
15,Lovely hotel in an oasis of tranquility in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona. ,"Beautiful hotel, friendly and professional staff and very comfortable spacious rooms. Very quiet and breakfasts are fantastic. Bathrooms are huge.  Cleanliness superb. Excellent location. Definitely worthy of 5 stars. Ate tapas in the hotel one night, excellent food with great service. ",5,2016,07,23
15,Fantastic service,"The service provided at the Mercer ma,es youbfeel special. Views are great. Location in the gothic distric is amazing. The concierge had the best recommendations. The roof top and pool is a spot to relax. This is the place to be in barcelona.",5,2016,07,23
15,Excellent hotel in great location ,"Loved the hotel! Very friendly and helpful staff, beautiful design and it smells soooo good. Rooms are stylish but a bit dark. Food is great in the tapas bar and for breakfast. Located in the gothic quarter, good to start a walk through the city. We will come back for sure!!! ",5,2016,07,22
15,Fantastic ,"Excellent location, based within the old Roman city walls. Rooms were great, large and plenty of added home comforts - including a complimentary mini bar. Staff made every effort to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Speak to the concierge for his local tapas recommendations. ",5,2016,07,21
15,"Excellent Stay, Great Staff, Comfortable hotel","We recently stayed at the Mercer Hotel Barcelona and really enjoyed our time there. The location in the Gothic quarter was pretty central to everything, my fiancé and I took some time to navigate the tiny streets around the hotel and eventually learned the best way there. Each time the staff greeted us warmly and was very responsive to our requests. The concierge was excellent, even walking us to restaurant they helped us find for dinner upon our arrival. We stayed in a superior room which was spacious and excellent for couples, though if you are traveling with children or more people you will probably want a larger room. Taxis will struggle to go down the tiny streets and are only allowed to during certain times of the day, we left for the airport around noon and they were able to pick us up directly in front of the hotel. If we are ever in Barcelona again I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else!",5,2016,07,20
15,"Magical setting, amazing service, stunning hotel...and a great nights sleep x","I chose this hotel originally for the location, right in the heart of the gothic quarter and so close to the Cathedral. It was fantastic and we had a truly amazing 4 nights here. The staff are incredibly helpful and friendly, the room was beautiful and extremely clean. I didn't want to leave! The atmosphere, food, service, room and setting is one of the best I've experienced, thank you for making my husband's birthday so memorable.",5,2016,07,20
15,Amazing! ,My stay here was amazing!!! Was greeted extremely politely by staff and my room was nice. Would definitely recommend this place as me and my partner enjoyed almost every moment of our stay here :) Thankyou for your service!! And yes food was scrumptious too ,5,2016,07,19
15,An Oasis in Luxury,"Great experience as service, food and atmosphere were all top notch. The concierge, front desk and overall service was excellent. The food was really good and the rooftop was a gem. Can't say enough. If anything it was a bit too quiet for a ""Mercer"" property but its a small property so it was fine.",5,2016,07,18
15,Smells good,"I only stayed one night there. Location is great and the staff is very attentive, they made sure everything was perfect. The room was spacious and updated. The hotel smells very good all over. Be careful because there are two hotels with the same name ( one is 5 stars and the other is a smaller/cheaper version from the same company. ",5,2016,07,17
15,Terrific staff,"This beautifully refurbished hotel is located in the Gothic Quarter.  The staff could not be friendlier or more helpful.  Everything from restaurant recommendations and reservations to suggestions on what to see and when to see it.  The rooms are clean and comfortable, and the hotel is blissfully quiet.",5,2016,07,14
15,Great stay at The Mercer,Special hotel. Incredible service and great location.  Not cheap though for the size of the rooms. The concierge Florentina really made our stay by organizing events and booking great restaurants. I cannot say enough about her.,5,2016,07,14
15,Friendliest Hotel in Europe!,"Great location, fabulous staff.  From the moment we got off the plane and was greeted by the hotel car service to the moment we left to start our cruise we received outstanding service.  We will certainly return.",5,2016,07,14
15,"Wonderful location, small room","So first off, the great things about this hotel...its location can't be beat, smack dab in the middle of the Gothic Area on a charming cobblestone alley near cute restaurants, a metro station, and a lovely ancient plaza, it's easy to get anywhere from the Mercer- and- it's quiet-- one of things a lot of the other ""superior"" hotels in the city are not. The staff is well trained, professional, and very friendly, without being intrusive. The rooftop terrace with it's green living wall, small bar, and shallow small plunge pool is the perfect place to retreat after a long day of pounding the streets during  a hot Barcelona summer. 
Now onto the negatives. First off, they need to dial back on the cologne they are pumping into the common areas in the hotel-- it is very strong-literally hits you right when you walk into the lobby-and totally unnecessary. Reminds me of going into an Abercrombie and Fitch store back in the 90's. If you want a nice smell, light some citrus candles or something! Thankfully, our room didn't have the fragrance. But the room was not great- we were on the second floor, and had a view right into another building (and a window, which meant we could never part the sheers), which meant it was almost oppressively dark. Nice to sleep in, but a little depressing. Also, the room was quite small- a king bed and a desk with a chair and the bathroom partition was 2 feet from the bed. It was fine for my husband and myself, but would be too small/intimate for friends or family members traveling together as there's nowhere to go once you exit the shower but the main room. It reminded me a lot of a NYC hotel--short on space, and also a little austere. Very mod- which i don't mind, but somehow lacked a degree of warmth. We booked our room through Tablet, so perhaps we got stuck with the worst room, but be sure you ask when you book the square footage, amount of light, what you overlook, etc. And don't do the 28 euro breakfast, there are plenty of little cafes within walking distance for a coffee and a croissant, though if you want the full blown breakfast, etc. and you don't mind the $, then the courtyard is certainly lovely. 
A pleasant stay, but I can't wholeheartedly recommend it mainly because of the price we paid for the room we got. If you pay more for a larger suite, it would probably be a very different experience.",3,2016,07,12
15,Fantastic Service and Quality,"Staff, quality and service was great! One of the best boutique hotels that I have stayed. The service really make you feel special. Also the hotel has a beautiful rooftop for relaxing. Overall it was a great experience.",5,2016,07,12
15,Wonderful experience,"Stayed at the Mercer Hotel for three days , an excellent hotel in the most beautiful part of Barcelona , the staff is very friendly and very helpful , food is great , pool area is very nice . I would recommend this hotel ",5,2016,07,12
15,Can't say enough good things about this hotel!,"The staff, room, views where all great! They where all incredibly helpful.
Everyone went out of their way
to make us feel special and where a major reason we are putting this 
hotel on our return list of, MUST STAY again hotels.",5,2016,07,11
15,Excellent boutique hotel,"Excellent boutique hotel in every way, from the professional and attentive staff, to the classic and central location in the Gotic district, to the rooftop pool and lounge, to the delicious and peaceful breakfasts in the hotel private courtyard, with open sky above, to a variety of other aspects.  The hotel genuinely could not have been better. Services internal within the hotel were not only excellent, but externally in other words when we asked for help, advice or outside connections, the hotel was on it not only effectively but instantaneously.  We are (2) fairly experienced travelers including to different parts of Europe, so have some basis to say, that this was and will be one of our favorite spots on this trip (throughout much of Spain) as well as all trips. The hotel, concierge, breakfast staff and everyone there were superb, and have our highest recommendations.",5,2016,07,08
15,Honeymoon ,Impeccable hospitality and great location. We went for our honeymoon and I was blown away by how lovely everyone was. Love that it's tucked away in the gothic district. The roof top bar and pool is a great hidden spot to relax after a long hard day of shopping. ,5,2016,07,08
15,Wonderful!,"Had such a lovely time here! The place was just perfect for my husband and me. The staff are so extremely helpful and the rooftop terrace is really lovely. We had family from Barcelona come visit with us and they couldn't stop complimenting on the fantastic atmosphere. I highly recommend the breakfast, just amazing. In general if you want a homey feel away from home, this is your place to be. ",5,2016,07,06
15,AMAZING! Beautiful hotel which I highly recommend!,"I stayed at Mercer hotel in September 2015 and thought it was fantastic! I had a junior suite room and enjoyed the dining, the roof deck & pool, and the excellent tapas bar downstairs.  The staff were great and we had a lovely time.",5,2016,07,05
15,Frustratingly close to perfect,"First the good: this hotel is exquisite, a fabulous clean modern building infiltrated into Roman stone walls brilliantly. Front-of-house staff absolutely outstanding. Central location, but really quiet. First-class room fittings and fixtures.
Now the frustrations (sorry guys): our ""superior"" room 101 was probably the least attractive room in the hotel - tiny and dark. It had really generous shower, loo and double wash area, but shoehorned into too small a space so if one person was sitting at the desk the other couldn't get to the bathroom. On the first floor, and opening onto the deep narrow pedestrian street it never saw the sun and the black fabric curtain fixed over the balcony to create some privacy cut off the rest of the light. My advice: forget the ""superior"" rooms and get the biggest available.
Maybe we were unlucky with the kitchen, because our tapas at the bar included some dried-out and some downright inedible. Breakfast the next day was also a dried-out overcooked mess.  Given the standard of the rest of the hotel I have to believe this was untypical.
We did have two taxis who refused point-blank to go the last few hundred meters to the hotel, so the answer is always to ask the concierge to get you a taxi.
Will we go back? Probably yes, but only in a suite.",4,2016,07,04
15,Exquisite hotel in a fabulous location with a wonderful staff and attention to detail at every level. Just say yes.,"The staff was amazing- friendly, helpful and completely thorough and engaged.  They went above and beyond to make this trip incredible...and it was.  

The hotel itself was exquisite, a building both modern and ancient. located right in the heart of the Gothic quarter (great location)! It was a quiet respite today after very busy and full days.",5,2016,07,03
15,MODERN AND UNIQUE!,LOved the Mercer! Gorgeous Hotel lots of history in the best position right in the Gothic Region! Rooms were nice and quiet (maybe a bit dark)Staff were super helpful.Front Tapas bar was great. Highly recommended!,5,2016,07,02
15,"Cool location, gorgeous hotel and amazing staff...perfect","After staying at this hotel, I would never consider staying anywhere else on future trips to Barcelona.  The team at this hotel is world class, attentive but not intrusive.  They remembered the smallest details and made sure that our trip was memorable. 

The hotel is in a chic part of the Gothic Quarter and exploring this area was the ideal introduction to Barcelona's unique shops, restaurants and people.  The Mercer rooms are spacious, quiet and relaxing.  King sized bed, comfortable bedding, A/C that works all night, Molton Brown products (most anything you may need if you forgot to pack it), in room coffee and mini bar.  The Mercer suite is impeccable...the furnishings, art, books all curated to perfection.  What a treat, feels like a home away from home...like a chic apartment.  The rooftop pool is relaxing and a dip in the plunge pool is invigorating.  

We travelled with our nine year old son and they laid out his own bath products, robe and slippers on his bed.  Nightly turn down service includes a delicious selection of bite sized desserts.  Start your day with breakfast in the beautiful courtyard, yummy pastries, fresh fruit and selections from the kitchen, which even included pancakes for our son. 

Really looking forward to coming back...not just because the hotel is excellent but because of the exceptional staff.",5,2016,07,01
15,A terrific comfortable stay,"This hotel is top notch in every respect. Very comfortable, spacious rooms, helpful service. A wonderful boutique hotel experience, with well designed rooms. Every piece of furniture and fixtures are top notch, room come with a USB port and plugs for every electrical standard. The staff is professional, courteous and efficient. For and drinks are very good and served in their courtyard, bar, restaurant or upstairs outdoor bar with a pool. 
A few items to note: the pool is unheated and quite small, but refreshing. Staying in the rooms which face the street out front can be a bit loud. The hotel can get a little carried away with scents in the hallways. One of the things that makes the hotel charming and intimate can sometimes be to their detriment - we had non existent service one evening while the Euro 2016 was on with the bar staff crowded around a TV in the kitchen. 
Overall, this is hotel will provide a terrific memorable experience though.",5,2016,07,01
15,"Wow, this place is amazing in an amazing city","The hotel, the staff, the breakfast and location is fantastic.  The Spanish are so warm and this hotel lives up to that reputation.  This was our favorite hotel after 12 days in different places in Spain and France.",5,2016,06,30
15,Sexy hotel,"Gorgeous hotel so sexy with the old elements of stone walls, dark wood, candelabras and then the modern glass and steel everywhere made for a beautiful hotel. I only just visited the room of a friend who was staying at this boutique hotel but it was unbelievable and I still want to return. The location was also super, centrally located you can walk evetwhere. Looking forward to returning.",5,2016,06,30
15,Ultimate in Barcelona,"Expensive but if you want to push the boat out this is the place. Staff warm and professional, there if you need them, not in your face if you don, t. The rooms are not large but are very modern and well equiped. We had a superior room, but for this read good standard room. Large double bed and small sitting area. Bathroom large and very clean. The special point to the hotel is the roof terrace with dip pool, great to have in the City centre and we made good use of it. It was our honeymoon stay and the staff had arranged some special things on arrival which was very much appreciated.",4,2016,06,28
15,Magical experience,"When a hotel opens the door for you each time you enter and GREATS YOU BY NAME, you know they care about customer service! Beautiful setting in an old Roman structure with one of the dinning rooms set in a watch tower from 4 AD! Every concierge was excellent. Rooms spacious with large closet with a safe. ",5,2016,06,27
15,Outstanding,"When mixing business and leisure (as we were on this visit) I prefer boutique  city centre hotels. 

over the years I've stayed in many hotels like the Mercer in many cities all over the world. I have a small list of favourites and the Mercer has just jumped to the top of the list 

Fabulous location in narrow streets in the gothic quarter. The hotels favourite taxi firm gets you to the front door. Other firms leave you 2 mins walk away.

Wonderful service from every single member of staff. They just couldn't have been more helpful.

Excellent, quiet, comfortable, well equipped room. 

Great little roof terrace and bar with small pool. Great to chill out for an hour or two late afternoon 

Lovely breakfasts. Dinner in restaurant ok but a bit underwhelming.  No problem given so many excellent restaurants around. 

Overall I have to say well done to the management and staff here . It's simply superb ",5,2016,06,27
15,Warm & wonderful!,There is so much comfort in such a small environment at this hotel.  The location is excellent allowing you to walk to attractions but tucked away on a tiny side street in the Bari Gothic area. The rooms were comfortable with an unusual garden wall as a view.  The rooftop pool and bar was a great place to unwind after a day of touring.  We looked forward to the delicious and beautifully presented breakfast in the morning.  The staff were always concerned with your every need. I was sad to leave this special place but had more adventures awaiting me.,5,2016,06,27
15,The best!!!!,"We LOVED everything about Mercer hotel!!! Location, staff, food, service, EVERYTHING!!! Wish it was a Mercer hotel on every city we visit :) 
Thank you guys for the amazing stay. We will be back soon!!

",5,2016,06,26
15,Lovely hotel in a great location,"Fantastic location, right in the heart of the Gothic quarter with all of its atmosphere and narrow streets to explore (although be aware that due to the narrow streets, some larger cars can't get to the hotel entrance). Had a lovely deluxe room. Wooden shutters and heavy curtains make for a peaceful sleep even though it overlooked a busy courtyard. The concierge staff are wonderful; great advice and go out of their way to help. And try the food at Le Bouchon cafe at the front.... surprise gourmet.... the food comes from the kitchen of the hotel's signature restaurant.... Michelin star chef oversees the creation of your incredible cafe meal.",5,2016,06,26
15,Stunning location and unbeatable service.  5 stars !,"Can't rate this beautiful hotel highly enough.  The staff could not have been more helpful. 
We were upgraded to the Junior Suite on arrival and the hotel provided complimentary cake and bubbly for my partners birthday.   Would definitely recommend.
Food in the Tapas bar was great and the rooftop bar provides the perfect place for drinks before dinner.   ",5,2016,06,26
15,I want to live here!,"Mercer Hotel.  As an Architect, my husband has high standards for understated good design while I have high standards for service, and amenities.  The Mercer Barcelona exceeded both of our expectations.  Due to a glitch, it seemed as if there wasn't a room for us.  The Mercer in conjunction with our booking service, Mr & Mrs Smith (another fabulous enterprise who understands excellent service, they had arrange for accomodations elsewhere, along with a couple of perks to make up for the mistake.  Turns out it all worked out, and we really wanted to stay here, even though it was just for our last night in Barcelona.  Just for the worry, Joan Manel Salamanca from The Mercer arranged a transfer for us from the airport, upgraded our room, and included breakfast.  They even knew it was my husband's birthday and sent cake and a bottle of cava!  He was also kind enough to book a last minute massage to wrap up our holiday.  Even though we arrived at 10 AM, our room was ready.   The room, a premium junior suite (108)  was spacious along with a good size bathroom.  The best part was a private terrace that was big enough for 6-8 people to comfortably lounge!  Juan, the young man who showed us around, and checked with us throughout our stay, was friendly, sincere, and had a great sense of humor.   We felt so pampered. The La Boucheron had tasty tapas and drinks.  The breakfast was generous and as leisurely as we wanted (first day) and as prompt as we needed (day of departure).  
Location wise, it's perfect. We had stayed further north in L'Eixample as the Mercer didn't have rooms for that leg of our trip.  Mercer, though, was in the middle of where we found ourselves most days, the heart of Gothic and El born.  If we get to return to Barcelona, I'd want to stay here.  ",5,2016,06,25
15,Mercer Hotel Gothic Quarter.  Everything a boutique hotel should be.,"We throughly enjoyed our break here.  El Gothic is a great location for a mini break close enough to the front and we never bored of the alleyways of the area.  More Tapas stops than you could wish for, magical squares and hidden architectural gems.

The Mercer Hotel is one such gem.  A sympathetic renovation amalgam of old and new.  It's small, discrete, the service and staff attitude is everything you could wish for and expect from a hotel at this end of the scale.  You had a feeling that your every need and whim could and would be met.  If you have high expectation of a boutique luxury hotel then they more than exceed.",5,2016,06,25
15,Stunning! And Perfectly Located!,"We went in June 2016 for our 10yr anniversary. The hotel was tucked down a charming, narrow street, in the gotic district (historical area of Barcelona). The updates were modern and gorgeously mixed with the old building. We loved sitting at the rooftop pool in the slow/siesta area of day. Room was enormous, with great Windows that opened to a gorgeous courtyard. Small hotel with maybe less than 50 rooms.  Concierge was super helpful with dinners (Can't remember his name-he worked the evening shift). Hotel staff was wonderful. If your going to plunge on a hotel, this is the one!",5,2016,06,23
15,Lovely and near perfect,"We stayed for 4 nights in a junior suite. The room was spacious and very clean.  The bed was extremely comfortable with very nice linens (which were changed daily).  Our room, #306, was quiet with the only noise coming from the courtyard which the room overlooked.   This posed a slight annoyance only at night when some guests were less than courteous and could be somewhat loud (we prefer to sleep with our window open). 

The hotel has a nice inside bar and a perfect rooftop bar.  Joey goes to great lengths to make  a drink his guests enjoy.

We booked a package that included breakfast (28 Euros/person).  In retrospect, I might have skipped that.  While the breakfast is nice, the variety is limited and tends more towards the sweets...not my favorite.  Service at breakfast also seemed a bit lacking in execution although the effort was present.

The hotel staff is very accommodating and will assist you with whatever they can.  They helped secure a convertible for us to take a drive along the Costa Brava.  The car was delivered to the hotel and the concierge offered that the car could simply be picked up by the rental car company the following day at the hotel. Thinking this was an easy arrangement for us, we opted for it. As it turns out, parking anywhere near the hotel is a nightmare.  It was very stressful  trying to find a place to park at night in Barcelona as space is beyond limited.  We would have loved if the concierge had mentioned this to us and suggested an alternative.

 The front desk staff is very helpful. They will respond to your requests and needs. My only suggestion is for the staff to take the initiative a bit more. As an example, we checked out very early one morning  (prior to the time breakfast was served).  The gentleman at the front desk indicated that guests in the past have asked for something to be prepared when leaving early.  I wish he had offered that option the night prior when we spoke with him about arranging early transportation to the airport.

All in all, though, no complaints of any substance.  Worth the price.  The location is ideal..although I wouldn't think of driving in Barcelona. ",5,2016,06,23
15,Stunning hotel in an unbeatable location.,"Professional and charming staff make this gorgeous, intimate hotel our top choice in Barcelona. The perfect refuge in a bustling city, The Mercer has beautiful rooms and stunning public spaces. The concierges, Joan Manel and Floencia are amazing! They gave us excellent restaurant recommendations as well as getting us a highly coveted reservation at Tickets Bar. ",5,2016,06,23
15,Modern Conveniences in a Roman Ruin Setting,"This hotel continues to be well reviewed for all of the right reasons. The staff is professional, and very helpful. The hotel's architecture embraces it Roman ruin surroundings. Located in the heart of the Old City with many restaurants and shops within easy walking distance, while accommodating a limited number of guests (about 25 rooms), it is ideal for a destination gathering such as a wedding. The pool on the fourth floor is ideal for outdoor afternoon drinks and relaxation. The breakfasts are wonderful. We cannot wait to return!",5,2016,06,22
15,The best staff and hotel I have ever stayed at!,"This is by far the best staffed and best hotel in Barcelona !! My boyfriend and I came and stayed for a week to celebrate our anniversary.i have to say the staff and the location make it a perfect trip!! We have traveled all around the world staying in 5 star boutique hotels, this was the best!! The location in the gothic area was perfect!! The staff was more than accommodating! From the amazing breakfast to them helping us book a private helicopter ride to a vineyard! We plan on always coming back because they made it feel like home to us!! The room was spacious beautiful balcony and my favorite was the bath tub! From morning to night the staff were immaculate!! From perks in the room showing up with champagne and fruit to the morning staff knowing our simple drinks and getting us an amazing helicopter adventure !! Everyone that works there are 5stars it is a very romantic and we felt at home!! We are always going to stay there! I fell in love with not only the city but this hotel and staff!!! If you are looking for a once in a lifetime 5 star time ALWAYS go with Mercer. From the breakfast to them going out of their way to get us an amazing
5hr helicopter ride to a vineyard! The staff makes this historical location over 5 stars. The location is a 15 min walk to the sea and a few min walk to amazing sights!! ",5,2016,06,22
15,Beween Roman walls,"Wonderful hotel, I would surely return when in Barcelona. The staff is very friendly and makes you feel at home right away:-) Breakfast is great, lots of fresh fruits and home baked bread. The rooftop bar has a small pool and nice sun beds. Rooms are quiet and clean. ",5,2016,06,18
15,"Charming, boutique hotel in the Gothic area","We went here whilst we celebrated my Mother's 70th birthday. We would certainly come back although we would change a couple of things if we did. Firstly it is a pain for taxi's which caused us a few issues along the way. The hotel concierge were fantastic and would go out of their way to help with reservations and general assistance. The hotel is small but feels both unique and exclusive. A lovely roof terrace with a small plunge pool made for a great venue to drink cocktails whilst the sun went down. Two things we would change, the first is we would not book a standard room again. We tried to book a larger room but they were fully booked and we found the room although distinctive, small and dark. This meant we slept brilliantly as it was so sound proofed but made applying make up an interesting experience to say the least! So advice is book a junior suite at minimum unless you are really not bothered about a small shower only dark room. Our other comment was the breakfast, it's expensive and it's (sorry guys) just not worth it. The eggs were very strange, we had an omelette - over cooked, poached eggs - strange consistency and under done on the outside but almost like a weird jam consistency on the inside and then fried eggs, the first time fine but the second they were raw. I couldn't eat them. We also had a meal at the tapas bar attached to the hotel and the food was hit and miss (mostly miss), they didn't have a lot of what was on the menu and the stuff they did, well, it's been the worst meal we've had in a week in Spain (Barcelona & Cadeques), the Calamari were sent back as we should have the rest of the meal. So in summary, book the biggest room you can afford, enjoy the ambience (thank you for the guitar evening it was brilliant). If you opt in for breakfast then it's a bit of a gamble, think they are at busy times slightly overstretched and egg cooking if it's important to you is sketchy at best. The service is fantastic and it's a very special hotel. Good if you are walking around and don't require taxi's to take you home (if you do, ask the hotel for a number for a taxi firm).",4,2016,06,17
15,Great hotel!!!,"It is situated in Barri Gotic quarter, 6 min walking to the Rambla. The arhitecture is splendid, quiet hotel, clean and friendly staff, good for business travel or when you visit Barcelona. One of the best 5 stars hotel in Barcelona.",5,2016,06,16
15,Most attentive staff,"We spent three nights here.  It is well situated in the Gothic Quarter.  The room was lovely and quiet, the bed comfortable, and the overall amenities just right.  The thing that takes this hotel over the top was the attentiveness of the staff.",5,2016,06,16
15,A Gothic Pearl In The Midst Of Antiquity,"Nestled among ancient structures, including parts of the hotel itself, the Mercer offers all of the amenities needed for both a romantic holiday or a relaxing adventure. After a day of much walking, the open air rooftop pool, comfortable chaise lounges and easy access bar was most appreciated. The ample staff wore their smiles effortlessly, always seeking to be of service. ",5,2016,06,15
15,BARCELONA BLOWOUT,"Had a fantastic stay at the Mercer Hotel last weekend location was perfect room was very peaceful & comfortable staff are excellent, very helpful & have a great knowledge of the area ,got some good restaurant recommendations from the Argentinian Lady on the front desk & concierge were great ,well done Mercer, i won't look anywhere else on my next trip to Barcelona ,not forgetting the Chefs & kitchen staff either as the breakfast was lovely,the staff are what makes a good hotel into a great hotel Well done",5,2016,06,15

The staff was also incredibly polite and helpful to get around the city. 
Cant ask for more.",5,2016,06,13
15,"Oh, What a gem!","We stayed at The Mercer for 5 nights last week.  It was so quiet and comfortable as it is a bit off of the beaten path in the old section on a tiny street.  The beds were extremely comfortable and the linens so smooth that we slept very well.  The concierge staff, especially Joan Manel and Florencia could not do enough and were SO welcoming.  They really went out of their way to assist us in making dinner reservations prior to our arrival.  Alex, the bar tender, mixed fantastic gin and tonics from The Mercer's well stocked gin supply.  Housekeeping was efficient and accommodating to unusual schedules.  Chef Giuseppe has opened a new restaurant (Kresios) in the hotel with tasting menus that were delicious and beautifully served.  The breakfasts were excellent and they served best Eggs Benedict I've ever eaten.  We highly recommend this hotel for your Barcelona visit.  We will certainly return.  Karen & Max",5,2016,06,12
15,Excellent 5 Star Property!  Call for Directions!,"If you want a great couples hotel this is the place. The service is excellent from check in to check out. The staff is first class and goes the extra yard to meet your every need. Hotel only has 28 rooms. 

I would highly recommend this hotel. 

Note: Your GPS will not be able to locate this hotel, call them and they will come meet you and guide you to the hotel.",5,2016,06,12
15,Beautiful hotel very friendly staff,"My husband and I loved staying at Mercer, it's in a charming area of Barcelona with small streets and old buildings.  The room was a nice size and I loved the bathtub.  The roof deck is nice as well.  The staff were so nice and friendly and went out of their way to help.  ",5,2016,06,10
15,JNCrasner,"The Mercer Hotel and its staff are beyond exceptional! We would recommend this hotel and location without hesitation.  The Gothic section of Barcelona is beautiful, historic, and centrally located. The rooms are large and provide  complimentary coffee and drinks. 
Thank you to every staff member at the Mercer Hotel for a wonderful experience and vacation!",5,2016,06,09
15,Mercer Magic,"What a great hotel!  This is a must.  We are definitely coming back.  The staff were amazing, they made sure our needs were met and that we had a fabulous time.The hotel was beautiful and  romantic, a special place to spend quality and quiet time with a loved one.  Thank you so much. ",5,2016,06,07
15,Hard to beat in Barcelona,"This hotel cannot be beat in terms of location, ambience, and dedication to service. Experience can't be duplicated at any other property in Barcelona. Staff were he most accommodating to guests as possible.",5,2016,06,07
15,Gothic Gem,"We loved the location and the facilities are first rate but the wonderful staff made our stay.  They were always helpful and pleasant.  Our meal at Kresios was excellent and the tapas bar attached to the hotel provided tasty delights.  Roof top area with pool was a perfect hang out after a day of touring.
Alex in the bar is a gin and tonic expert and we consumed all that he offered.  We hope to go back.",5,2016,06,05
15,Standard of Excellence,"The Mercer Hotel is located on a quiet, quant street near Via Laietana.  The hotel’s proximity to Via Laietana makes it easy to move around the city.  

The staff is attentive and kind; I could have been staying at Four Seasons.  It felt like the guest to staff ratio was 1:1.  At the 11th hour, my business meeting's location changed from Barcelona to a remote town 2 hours outside Barcelona.  At 6 pm, the Concierge arranged from an automatic car rental to be dropped off at the hotel for my use the next day.  The Concierge saved the day and reason for the trip! 

The hotel is a beautiful, boutique hotel.  The linens and the bed were very comfortable, luxurious.  It's a great place to relax and recuperate.  I would appreciate more lighting in the bedroom, specifically near the mirror in the bathroom (only gripe).  

We ate at the hotel for lunch and dinner a few times.  The food was good.  The bar was fantastic.  The rooftop pool is serene.  I recommend taking a drink upstairs (or take the staff up on offer to bring it up for you).",5,2016,06,04
15,Perfect Hotel,"We had a marvelous time at Mercer Hotel, everything was fabulous!  Right from the start we were welcomed graciously by responsive staff,  the location is perfect ....surrounded by fantastic restaurants,  lovely shopping boutiques, attractions...and the hotel itself is sophisticated and quiet....right in the heart of the best area....the room is very comfortable, fine linens, large, well designed bathroom, ample closet space, nice sitting area..we did not partake in the restaurant, choosing to go out and explore, but themes and food looked fabulous...we did enjoy have delicious, unique cocktails prepared by a very knowledgable bartender ........and the roof top pool area was very comfortable and relaxing...a great spot to rest before going out for the evening.  We would go back to Mercer hotel in a heartbeat!  ",5,2016,06,03
15,As good as it gets!,"Location location location is said to be the 3 key ingredients for selecting real estate.  We just stayed at the Hotel Mercer for 5 nights.  Every aspect was a pleasure.  The location was outstanding in the heart of the gothic district.  All the staff were excellent.  The front desk and concierge were helpful and knowledgeable down to the person who oversaw the restaurant at breakfast.  The variety and quality of food as well as the ambiance was outstanding.  Reminded me of the Inkaterra’s in Peru.  The Mercer may be a splurge, but worth every euro.  Our room was a standard room with a very comfortable king bed overlooking the courtyard.  One side of the bed had a US 110 volt plug and the other a USB outlet plus plug options for the new and old apple charger as well as android.  The only complaint was that while it had a pool, it had no Jacuzzi (hardly worth complaining about!).

Without any question this was one of the best hotels my wife and have stayed.  If we go back to Barcelona, I won’t even look for an alternative!  Well done Mercer!!",5,2016,06,02
15,"Perfect and quite location, excellent service, unique ambiance","Many of the touristic highlights of Barcelona are in the Gothic district and in easy walking distance. While many places in this district are full of people and hustle, the hotel is located in a quiet end of a narrow street. So it offers an ideal combination of being an convenient springboard for touristic endeavors through the lively neighborhood and being a sanctuary of quietness in a unique ambiance of a historical site yet offering state of art luxury. Following our wishes for a room offering the quietest possible location in the hotel we were being offered a Superior Room in the second floor facing the vertical green garden which proved to be the perfect choice according to our preferences. In this room the bath room is optically well separated through a wall from the rest of the room which we prefer as a matter of privacy. While the bath ""room"" offered a modern bathing tube we only used the very effective rain shower which offers a lot of room to move around in. The most surprising element was the air condition which works so quiet that you cannot hear at all so that one it tempted to believe that it may not work . But it does and very effectively so. You can cool it down to very low levels if you so prefer. In a hot summer of Barcelona this is certainly a great plus. As mentioned by others the bed is very large and very comfortable. We enjoyed the breakfast which offers a lot of choices and excellent service. The overall level of the service and attention of all the staff was excellent, on all levels and in all quarters. We had dinner spend in the night at the tapas bar to the hotel which was nice. Yet there are many other restaurants and bars in the Gothic district. We would highly recommend the Cafe de l ´Academia which is only 1 minute away from he hotel. While this hotel is on the high end of the price spectrum for a 5 star hotel  - even in Barcelona - you get excellent value for the money spent.",5,2016,06,02
15,Loved every minute!,"Staff was amazing . The taxi driver was not keen to drop us at the door  as the roads are tiny but we called on our mobile and the hotel spoke to the taxis driver in Spanish, all sorted. The accommodation was heaven. Very central, comfortable and friendly. Could not have asked for better service. Breakfast was delicious definitely get it included as well worth it. Can't wait to book in the whole family next time  into the top floor apartment",5,2016,05,30
15,By Liesl,"Fantastic location, excellent service. Very friendly staff who go above and beyond. Couldn't recommend this hotel high enough. The food in both the restaurants was of a very high standard and we especially enjoyed the Mr Pink menu!",5,2016,05,26
15,Wonderful Stay,"This was the best hotel in which I have ever stayed. From start to finish, the service was impeccable, room immaculate, comfortable bed, and excellent bathroom. Each evening the turn down service was a surprise. From the bottle of cava, to the anniversary cake, the Morton Brown products, and the chocolates. Our concierge was able to even get us reservations on a Sunday to a two Michelin star restaurant last minute. This hotel is worth the money! ",5,2016,05,25
15,"If there is a more peaceful, more helpful hotel, I haven't been to it!","Hotel Mercer Barcelona offers everything a guest could wish for;perfect location, beautiful interior, amazing knowledgeable staff, and even a small wooden hairbrush amongst the items in the bathroom, great when yours has been forgotten and left on the bed at home! 
It also has the best bed linen and most comfortable beds I've ever slept on in a hotel. Add the quality of the beds and linen to the peace and quiet of the rooms because of their ancient stone construction and it is very hard to get out of bed in the morning to begin your exploration of this beautiful city! But you must explore and Hotel Mercer Barcelona is perfectly located to facilitate that. It's wonderful! ",5,2016,05,25
15,Great hotel,"Great boutique hotel with very friendly service/staff. Beautiful architecture, which combines antique building with modern facilities. Nice large rooms. Sunny terrace on top of hotel with lounge chairs and a little pool. Only slight downside is the breakfast, where service is very friendly but food and drinks take too long to come.",4,2016,05,25
15,"Spectacular Service, Outstanding Experience Overall","We recently stayed at the Mercer while in Barcelona. We booked this hotel simply because it was, when we booked it, the number 1 rated hotel in Barcelona on Trip Advisor. I now see a number 2 listing. I can't imagine what hotel could possibly provide a  better overall experience.

The concierges were so much better than most. All of them, but especially Juan Manuel. Whatever we needed, they made sure we got it. And I had a strange request that I probably shouldn't share publicly. But our luggage didn't make it and arrived a day later. After flying from Houston, we really needed one change of clothes. I bought a Barcelona FC jersey on the street. But I needed underwear. It was a holiday, that day, Easter Second Monday (seriously) so the department stores were closed. Juan Manuel said if I was desperate, I could buy a pair from a street vendor, and told me exactly how to find them. So I did. And I did. Yes, that's how comfortable I was talking to people at the Mercer. I asked that question. And they answered. And I bought underwear from a street vendor.

The Mercer is beautiful and you might enjoy seeing it very much. It is actually build among Roman ruins and ancient walls. But it's new, so you see this incredible history but also have all the modern amenities of a beautiful 5 star hotel.

The food was very good. The bar was nice. Everybody at the hotel, people at the desk, the bartender, concierges, everyone, was so very nice. Even warm. You don't always get that. And it's a small hotel so they know who you are and never fail to greet you. Sometimes by name.

I would not hesitate for a minute to stay at the Mercer if we ever return to Barcelona.
Great location. A pool on the roof that appeared to be heated.

No noise at night. Very dark. So much so we overslept one day. Get a wake up call if you need to be somewhere.
J
ust really nice all the way around.",5,2016,05,24
15,Outstanding!,"We stayed here for two nights as a mini moon straight after getting married. I can't give this hotel or it's staff enough praise. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and did not want to leave

The hotel itself is beautiful; the lady at check in was so welcoming and even took us on a little tour of the hotel giving us some of the history of the building before showing us to our room. Our room was lovely and extremely comfortable. The bathroom has lots of Molton Brown products for you to enjoy and the minibar is re stocked daily as no expense. There was also a fantastic coffee machine in the room that my partner loved! A lovely bottle of Prosecco and a heart shaped cake had been left in our room, which was a nice surprise and helped to make the occasion feel more special. The cake in particular was sublime!

We spent some of our time sunbathing on the beautiful terrace, which was the perfect way to wind down after a particularly busy few weeks.  

I’m quite fortunate to have stayed in some wonderful hotels all over the world and I would have to stay The Mercer Hotel is one of the best. Thank you to all the wonderful staff that made our experience so enjoyable.",5,2016,05,22
15,Stunning hotel - wonderful staff/service!,"We spent two nights for our mini-moon and had a perfect stay. I informed the hotel prior to arrival and they had not overlooked this. The concierge was very polite, friendly and helpful. She gave us a tour of the hotel, pointing out historical points of interest as the hotel is built into the original wall of the ancient city. The décor is a really interesting mix of ancient with modern sleek and the room was very stylish. We didn’t avail of the breakfast as we were enjoying our lie-ins, but did have a lovely afternoon on the roof with an ice-cold sauvignon blanc. This has been the most stylish hotel I have ever stayed in.",5,2016,05,22
15,Sleek Hotel With Outstanding Staff,"We spent four nights at the Mercer.  The property is small (fewer than 40 rooms) and is located in the Gothic Quarter.  The building in which it's housed incorporates a portion of one of the Roman towers that once protected Barcelona.  The hotel's decor is very contemporary, but nonetheless combines well with the exposed ancient stone walls. A really interesting mix.

The hotel's staff is absolutely outstanding.  In particular, the concierge and front desk staff made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived, and were extremely helpful with logistical advice, restaurant recommendations, etc. throughout our stay.  

The hotel's location makes exploring the Gothic Quarter very easy.  Before we arrived, we downloaded a walking guide to the area, and explored on foot.  There are loads of restaurants in the area.

One word of caution:  some taxi drivers don't like to drive into the Gothic Quarter because of the narrow, confusing, congested streets.  While you're a guest at the hotel, this isn't a problem because the hotel will call a taxi for you (they work with companies that are familiar with the area).  However, if you arrive in Barcelona by train or plane, your driver may have difficulties (the driver who took us from the Sants railway station to the hotel definitely did).  We later learned that the hotel staff can email you a PDF with detailed instructions re the best route for driving to the hotel -- so you may want to request a copy before you arrive in Barcelona.  Alternatively, you can call the hotel from your mobile phone, and they'll instruct your driver on the best route to the hotel (that's what we ended up doing).

Highly recommended.",5,2016,05,20
15,Unique hotel,"The Mercer is built into the walls of the old city in Barcelona, close to the beautiful Cathedral. The hotel combines an historic feel with excellent modern facilities.

We absolutely loved it!  the concierge took great care of us arranging our logistics.  The hotel is well-appointed with a quiet yet energetic vibe.

15,Beauty and Charm,Our stay at the Mercer was fantastic.  The Mercer is elegant and charming.  The staff was so very helpful and kind.  The location in the Gotic area was perfect.  The personal touches - like free flowing Cava and boxed tapas for the plane ride home - were amazing.,5,2016,05,16

Superb location . I recommend you get a local map from reception as the narrow streets make it easy to get lost, especially after a dinner with a few drinks !",5,2016,05,16
15,Inside/Outside,"The Mercer is a chic,elegant modern hotel sheathed in ancient stones. Set in the charming Gotic area oof Barcelona, you step from a narrow medieval street into a beautifully-conceived 21st century space that beautifully incorporates elements of the original buildings that are its skin. 

Rooms are well-appointed, and the service is excellent, of course. ",5,2016,05,13
15,"Fantastic service, and calm in busy Barcelona","Having pre-booked a hotel for 7 nights, we arrived to find it lacking in several way. Mercer Hotel was able to accommodate us at extremely short notice. We had a fabulous room with a little patio, which was perfect. The hotel also provided a cot for our son.
The concierge service was excellent, and they helped us out a lot. The two restaurants on site serve high quality food, and we would definitely recommend, even if not staying at the hotel.
All in all, this hotel really saved our holiday, and we were so grateful!",5,2016,05,12

15,Perfect hotel in Barcelona,"Lovely hotel in the Gothic quarter of Barcelona. The staff were exceptional and very helpful.  They can book visits to sites which avoids queues and restaurants and anything else. They looked after my wheat allergy by providing lovely wheat free bread. The Bed was wonderful. Forgot to suggest they get some useful English speaking channels on the TV but we were out most of the time.  The sun deck on the roof was lovely and peaceful with a very small dipping pool, comfy loungers and bar for drinks and food. Great location as it is in easy reach of places. Tapas bar very popular. Main restaurant food was not as good unfortunately and pricey. Hotel is a great find and wonderful treat.",5,2016,05,07
15,Hidden Gem,We stayed at the Mercer for 4 days to celebrate our first wedding anniversary.  The personal service and attention to detail were exceptional.

15,Incredible 5* luxury,"My new husband and I stayed here as part of our honeymoon in Barcelona. Having walked past the hotel several times on previous trips to the city, we decided to treat ourselves. The moment you walk in, you are greeted with friendly service, beautiful interior and a wonderful smell everywhere you go!
In particular, Juan was amazingly helpful and friendly, showing us to the rooftop terrace as our room wasn't quite ready and recommending somewhere for some tapas for lunch and marking a few things to do on a map. The best tapas we had in Barcelona, it was an incredible place, thank you Juan! All the other staff were brilliant too, helping us with reservations for other restaurants and booking tickets for the Sagrada Familia.
The room and facilities were perfect, such comfy beds and we miss the bed linen already! Complimentary mini bar restocked every day and the amenities in the room were great. Only complaints would be a bit of a rubbish hair dryer and no full length mirror.
We ate in the Michelin star restaurant one night which is a pricey affair but well worth it, we treated ourselves as on honeymoon. The food and service was incredible, as was the wine! If you don't want to stretch yourself then at least enjoy a drink at the very cool bar, the cocktail we had was delicious. 
We will definitely be back for our wedding anniversary, best hotel we've ever stayed in! Thank you.",5,2016,05,04
15,The best hotel in Barcelona!,"'This is the best hotel in Barcelona' - that's what the taxi drivers say, based on customers comments, and it lived up to our high expectations.

15,A GEM OF A HOTEL WITH LUXURY LEVEL SERVICE,"Mercer Hotel Barcelona represents an excellent example of contemporary design that is tailor-fit into an historic structure in the middle of the Gothic District.

I would recommend heartily, and stay again at next opportunity.",5,2016,04,26

15,Late March City Break for 4,"First mistake was to go to spain a couple of days after british summer time started in the UK, so I suddenly found getting out of bed very difficult due to my body being 2 hours behind local time.
We flew from East Mids to Barcelona with Ryanair (and they did not measure our bag once!) We had arranged with the hotel to be met at the airport which was a nice touch (but a little expensive at 125 euro) There are lots of taxis so next time i would just get one of these. The return taxi a few days latter was around 43 euro for 4 people. It is around a 20-25 min drive to the hotel from the airport.

The hotel is located in the (very)old part of the city and parts of the hotel are a few hundred years old. The old streets are VERY narrow and you can feel as if you are getting lost,  but after a couple of days you soon get your bearings. We were met with a glass of free Cava. They seem to give you a glass of Cava when ever they think you look like you need one, so just look thirsty and a glass of Cava seems to turn up. They even have it at breakfast !
We had booked a small suite with private terrace, mainly because my teenage daughters did not want to be in a room of there own in case they got attacked or something! So we needed a room that was big enough for 4, although the double bed could easily have take all 4 of us. And predictably after a few days they wanted thee own room (something to do with their mum snoring!) The hotel felt very safe as did Barcelona, there were lots of police around and no sign of any pick pockets etc. and we walked around the city most evenings with no problems. The room had a fridge with complementary juice and water that was refilled every day. The beds were changed every day, a small card was left in the room every evening to tell you what the next days weather is going to be and there were also a couple of chocolates left in your room every evening.
There is a restaurant at the hotel that we did not use as we wanted to try lots of different places. There is also a small bar/cafe attached to the hotel that we used the first evening and the food was Ok but a little on the expensive side compared with other cafes/bars.
The room had universal sockets so there was no need to take a UK travel plug, and there was even a USB/iPhone charger built into the wall next to the bed.
The room also had heating and cooling.
On the roof was an amazing terrace with a pool and it was great to just lie there in the spring sun.
The breakfasts where buffet and cooked and basically you could have anything you could think of. including Cava!.
The location is great and the staff were amazing so i would without hesitation return.
One final point, the staff all speak very good english and the place seemed very wheel chair friendly with elevators and large doors.",5,2016,04,18
15,Visiting Barcelona,"The Mercer hotel has an excellent location to visit Barcelona. Located inside the gothic area it's very convenient to visit the quarter or find a good restaurant, and this quarter is very typical. At 2 minutes there is the metro which is nice for visiting the rest of the city. 
The hotel itself is beautifull, calm and well designed. Our room was awesome. The swimming pool at the top is nice.

15,Good but not outstanding ,"We stayed for 5 nights for my 60th birthday.  The hotel is beautiful, our junior suite was lovely and, generally , the staff is extremely courteous. The recommendation to eat at the Barraca restaurant in Barceloneta was not good. The restaurant was dreadful. The concierge service was generally good but not consistent. We found one colleague cold and disinterested.  Everything else was good. But for this sort of cost, further staff training is needed.
We didn't appreciate the attempt to check us out 1 day and 1 night early either. 

",4,2016,04,16
15,An ideal hotel for a city break,"My husband and I came here for 4 nights. This was our first time in Barcelona and the hotel was in a fantastic location, on a quiet street full of character near the cathedral and a short walk from the Picasso museum. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly in giving us lots of recommendations and tips on the best places to eat and visit. The breakfast was delicious and varied and we would also recommend the tapas bar adjacent to the hotel. Overall we had a wonderful stay and will definitely come back again. 10/10!",5,2016,04,16
15,Beautiful hotel,"Great location in gothic quarter, very atmospheric with some super places to eat locally.    Very calm and cool after days in the city.   Nothing too much trouble for staff.   Enjoyed bar area and el Bouchon.   Great places for breakfast locally.  Rooftop area lovely.  Would recommend.  

",5,2016,04,16
15,Striking remodel in an historic building,"The hotel has a lovely contemporary feel though you're always aware of the history. Next to the library, you can even see a meter of Roman wall. The staff is very helpful and unfailingly pleasant. It's location is super in the Gothic area, about two blocks from the Cathedral. Breakfast was pleasant. The hotel should work on the other restaurant, as the food is not up to the standard of the rest of the hotel.",4,2016,04,15
15,Birthday weekend!,"Came in on my birthday weekend to this very romantic hotel. Staff was amazing and friendly. Specially the guys at the door and reception. Loved that we got a nice upgrade when we arrived and a bottle of champagne was waiting for us in our room. I also got a delicious birthday chocolate cake!  
Location was great for walking.
Breakfast was delicious too.
Couldn't have asked for a more perfect birthday weekend!",5,2016,04,13
15,Perfecto,"Believe what you read concerning this hotel. It is beautifully minimalist but you have everything you need in terms of superior service from the staff, excellent breakfasts, great room amenities that include daily replenishment of beverages ( a must in Barcelona as it is somewhat dry). The concierge Juan Manuel is approachable, funny & so willing to help. We showed up at the hotel without a clue as to where to start. He and one of the other staff, also Juan .....recommended Sagrada Familia, Park Guell, The Picasso museum and a day trip to see Dali's museum. They arranged for all of this, drivers, taxis, tickets etc in the most pleasant manner I've ever seen a hotel.  The only thing we stumbled upon ourselves was the Flamenco dancers near the hotel for an evening performance.  The one factor that sets this hotel apart is the absolute perfection of the hotel staff. By the end of our week I felt like I was leaving family. By the way, the Gothic area of Barcelona is breathtaking. Throughly enjoyed the week spent in Barcelona.",5,2016,04,13
15,A wonderful stay for me and my family,"I recently booked a room for my Family in this hotel and I was really happy with the choice. I was with my wife and two children and we liked very much our room: it was spotless, average site, enough for everyone to stay comfortably and the staff was really friendly and helpful.

We will surely return to this hotel on our next trip to Barcelona. ",4,2016,04,13

15,Barcelona hotel,"Great city great location great hotel
Lovely staff. Breakfast very good, slept well, room very quiet, bed very comfy and nice and dark, slept well. Very close to shops, bars and restaurants plus beautiful cathedrial.",5,2016,04,12
15,almost perfect,"i debated for months about where to stay in barcelona; i juggled between the ohhm, the ohla and the mercer dozens of times debating their pros and cons but ended up choosing the more expensive mercer because i thought it would be a more elegant stay.

that turned out to be be pretty true, with a few glitches. 

on the mercer site, i found a slightly discounted rate which required prepayment and booked it; i was to save 5%. but when we arrived, they had not charged my card and seemed confused about my actual rate or whether they had or had not charged my card. i was required to check my bank statement (something i don't like to do on shared wifi networks) to learn they, indeed, had not charged the card. i was promised i would still received the promised rate. more about that later.

our room was lovely, actually perfect. the decor was simple and luxe with generous amenities, nice big towels, a private toilet, nice robes, even toothbrushes. each side of the bed had a powerful reading light and the housekeeper thoughtfully turned it on for us each evening. though we had the simplest room, we had plenty of space to stretch out. the linens were high quality and the bed was comfy. the mini bar, though scantily stocked, was gratis. however, controlling the temperature was a bit tricky. if we didn't use the ac, we woke up broiling in the night. open windows were not an option because of the noise from the narrow cobblestone streets and the nights we used the aircon, it felt like a meat locker. both my husband and i had two nights each where we didn't sleep because we just couldn't find a comfortable temperature.

i take medicine which needs to be dissolved in hot liquid at night and asked the concierge to send up chamomile tea the first two nights of my stay. that seemed to confuse everyone. the first night it was delivered lukewarm, the second without sugar or honey and i never was i asked to sign a bill. (when we checked out i was charged 7 euro, but it is unclear  whether that was for one tea or two or if it was for something else altogether) the third night, i just gave up as it was too complicated.

the rooftop deck is gorgeous, as is the glassed in seating area in the lobby area. the bellmen were generous with suggestions and not sure what's in their water, but everyone, everyone is barcelona is so happy. my husband speaks passable spanish, but the staff seemed to be able to understand just about anything that comes out of anyone's mouth. (one bellman told us english is his 7th language) i am particularly fond of spanish gummy candy and was thrilled to see three generous jars full in the lobby. (i was also happy to see i was not the only person enjoying it.)

so here's where it gets ugly: when we went to check out, my bill was bananas. i'd been charged the full rate, not the agreed upon, prebooked disounted one. we'd been charged 140 euros for 2 breakfasts for 2 people when we never even set foot in the dining room. worse, the dollar had dropped 3% during our stay, so their not charging my card in advance cost me nearly the entire discount i'd been promised. i finally got the clerk to adjust the bill properly after i dragged out my cell phone and showed the confirmation letter they'd send. to me weeks earlier. the joy of staying in a high end property is that those details feel effortless and while the occasional mistake does happen, not three mistakes in one bill. checking in and out should not be such an ordeal and i shouldn't ever have to argue about money. it is just tacky.

i loved staying at the mercer. the location was fantastic, slightly on the edge of the old quarter and acoss the street from the trendy and exciting born neighborhood, but given the price and the number of mistakes made with what i was charged i think next time, i'd give another one of my options a go.",5,2016,04,12
15,A dazzling place,"We booked a room at the Mercer as we did an Iberian road trip.

Allow me to start off by saying that my stay at the Mercer was sumptuous. That's it. 

We called the hotel as we arrived at ""Via Laietana"" and we told to park there — not even 2 minutes later the Valet from the hotel arrived accompanied by a Concierge. The vale took our car to park it (to this day, I don't know where that was) and we walked to the hotel accompanied by the Concierge; who, as he was walking us back was giving us a historical context of Barcelona... #wow 

When we arrived at the hotel (approximately 10 minute walk with children) to check in, there were already two flutes of champagne waiting for us not to mention that the person that checked us in (who was fluent in english, french, castellano, catalan and italian), upon realising we had two children **AUTOMATICALLY UPGRADED US** from a Deluxe room to a Junior Suite.

As we were only stopping for one night in Barcelona, we didn't dine at the restaurant; we did however had breakfast over there and that was probably one of the best meals I have ever had in my life: You could feel the sun in the orange juice, the croissants felt like that had been shipped from France, the bread, the cakes, the coffee... everything felt like the universe had stopped just to pamper me.

The architecture of the Hotel summons a notion of elegance, lightness and utter obsession with detail: from the door knobs to the faucets, to the chairs in the lounge by reception... everything oozes beauty. 

If you're ever in Barcelona (and you have the means to), be sure to sleep at least once at the Mercer — what an experience...",5,2016,04,10
15,Perfect start to our Barcelona trip,"The Mercer is a lovely and stylish hotel, perfectly located for walking and discovering the Barri Gotic and El Born.  The staff was attentive and charming and helpful.  The food was excellent and the rooms, while on the small side were fine as we were busy exploring the area.",5,2016,04,08
15,"A ""must"" hotel for Barcelona","This beautiful jewel of a hotel sits in the Barri Gotic and is the perfect location for exploring Barcelona.

This hotel was one of the reasons we loved Barcelona so much.",5,2016,04,07
15,Amazing hotel &staff,"The Mercer is one of the best hotels I have been to. From the moment you enter the beautiful building to the second we left it was all about style and hospitality in the most pleasant way. The location is great. It is extremely quiet which is a big thing for Barcelona city center and the room is big spacious with tons of style and even a full free mini bar of soft drinks that give a great feeling. The staff are there to help and make sure you enjoy. Don't miss the rooftop for the sunset. 
Defiantly a place to go back to !",5,2016,04,07
15,Wonderful stay,"We’ve recently returned from three nights at the Mercer to celebrate my wife’s 50th birthday.
I chose the Mercer due to its excellent reviews and definitely wasn’t disappointed.
We stayed in one of the junior suites which was beautifully  appointed and had an amazing private terrace.
The hotel itself is a lovely mix of medieval and modern and it is perfectly located, being in the heart of the wonderful Gothic Quarter.
However, for me, what elevates this hotel above any other we’ve stayed at was the level of customer care.
Without exception all the staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, and the concierge could not have been more helpful.
We had a wonderful stay at the Mercer and would recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2016,04,07
15,"Great staff, location, breakfast; quite good room, lunch; poor dinner","Our trip did not start well.  Our taxi from the airport could not find the hotel and at one point tried to leave us in a very dodgy part of town - we ended up walking thru the old town the last way to the mercer.  It would help if the hotel provided some instructions on its website to be given to the taxistas to help them get thru the tiny streets.

But once we got there the location was hard to beat and we either walked or took a cab (no more than 10 Eur) around town and saw all the major sights. We loved the old town and found it housed the best shops and restaurants.  We would stay in this location again should we return to BCN.

The staff cannot be improved upon. They always tried to help and ensure we had tickets to what we needed and reservations when we needed them.  By the end of the trip the staff knew us to speak to and where we were going and what we were doing each day.

We could not make our mind up about the minimalist room. We missed the bath but found the bed quite comfortable and the pillows superb. We slept well and had no noise from outside (yet could hear guests above us walking around).

There are two restaurants; le bouchon is informal and quite good and Kresios is formal and frankly a drag on the rest of the place. We had dinner here and at Informal at the serras hotel and Kresios is embarrassingly bad by comparison. The hot food was cold and the cold food barely tasted of the advertised flavours - plenty of style but very little substance.

Yet the breakfasts in the same space as Kresios serves dinner were superb. Precise and elegant. Can the same people that cook breakfasts also cook the dinners? We loved the breakfasts.

If we had not eaten dinner here one night we would have given a clear, resounding come again message in our review. As it is we would return but only eat breakfast and an occasional lunch here instead eating in one of the dozens of great places within 10 mins walk of the hotel.",5,2016,04,06
15,Perfection,"The Mercer is a beautiful boutique hotel in  a perfect location.  The food and service are exceptional be sure to enjoy breakfast it is delicious, and drinks on the lovely quiet rooftop. The staff is friendly and very helpful. Can't wait to return. ",5,2016,03,31

15,Amazing boutique hotel in the heart of the gothic quarter,"Absolutely amazing hotel - with the best service and staff we have ever come across (and we have stayed at a lot of hotels over the years!). The location is perfect and really close to major attractions and for exploring the old world charm of the gothic quarter.

From the moment we checked in, the staff were amazing.  The exceptional service and attention to detail was second to none. Whilst all staff were amazing, Raffael and Juan deserve a special mention and went above and beyond throughout our stay.

The rooms are well sized and very modern.  The free mini bar, which is restocked daily, was a nice touch and the Nespresso coffee machine in my room meant that I could get a caffeine fix whenever I needed!

The breakfast service was exceptional, with everything you could want on offer - including hot dishes cooked to order. 

Overall, an amazing hotel and we cannot wait to return to stay here again when we next visit Barcelona.

To top it all up, it has deleciois choice of food and excellent wine. I had a great stay at this hotel. Very good location,  easy access to every attraction of the city.

Our room was beautiful, well laid-out, and quiet with a beautiful bathtub that was used almost daily.  Only problem was the bed was so comfortable, we continuously slept in every day.

15,"Excellent hotel, outstanding service",We stayed at The Mercer for the last three nights of a two week European trip. It was a perfect place to stay to end our vacation on a high note . It is in an interesting historic location in the Gothic quarter of Barcelona . We loved everything about the building itself as well as the comfortable bed and the very clean room. But it is the service of the entire staff that makes this hotel stand out above others. Everyone is very welcoming. The concierge is attentive and makes you feel like you're the only guest in the hotel . The breakfast is served in their lovely dining room and is very very good . My only regret is that we did not have dinner at the restaurant in the hotel. But that may be just another reason for us to return to this hotel in the lovely city of Barcelona.,5,2016,03,04
15,AMAZING TOP NOTCH HOTEL,"There are many choices of hotels when you stay in Barcelona but this is one hotel you should experience. It is a boutique hotel that offer unparalleled service. They make you feel that you are their only guests. The concierge, JM, we call him makes you feel so welcome and is genuinely concerned about your stay and even had a bottle of cava and dessert waiting for us in our room for my birthday. A lovely surprise. The location is perfect as you are only 5-15 minutes away from most sites you want to visit. The service for breakfast very personal and unhurried.  Overall a WONDERFUL hotel. You must stay here. Tip: it's a bit hard to find so take a taxi from the airport or private car service. Google maps for walking also works perfectly.  Thank you for a memorable stay Mercer Hotel.",5,2016,03,02
15,Will travel back to Barca specifically to stay at this hotel,"Loved everything - location, rooms, architecture, history, service, amenities, rooftop deck, and especially marshmallows and cava in the lobby.  

Traveled as a girls long weekend trip in October, and one friend had to crash in our room at the last minute - they sent up the nicest note to inform us of the surcharge for having an extra person in our room.  I actually appreciated the note!

The restaurant is a class act.  The food is better than anything I have ever tasted.  We had a group dinner one night -- scallops as an appetizer, risotto to die for, and then ending with a beautiful dessert and petit fours.

The hotel itself was very nice, very clean, nice comfy bed and a nice tough to get some treats like chocolates and complimentary soft drinks in the mini bar.
the staff were very friendly and were always asking if they could help with anything.
I would definitely recommend this hotel, yes it is expensive but I think you pay for the location / friendly staff and the name of the hotel",5,2016,02,15

Tucked away in the Labyrinth that is the Gothic quarter (the location proved to be a challenge for Google Maps),it is nonetheless very close to bars-restaurants, the Jaume Metro stop, and many tourist attractions including the Picasso museum.  The rooms are spacious, exposed brick walls and beamed ceilings harmonizing wonderfully with the rooms modern appointments.  No need to worry about an adaptor to charge phones, etc. as the room is equipped with a USB port next to the bed.  The large bathroom has a full array of Molton Brown products including a toothbrush; the rain shower will demand more of your time, just a joy to use!

15,interesting,"We wanted to spend our last night in such a special place. We have been staying for 5nights in another hotel in barcelona of a definitely lower category and we have decided to stay for our last night in a magic place. perhaps our expectations were to high, we found a good deal on booking and we reserved for 300€, the taxi in spain doesnt really know a lot, so was a nightmare to find the entrance,once in the staff were fantastic and very very helpfull but when we arrived to our room after a tour of the palace, was such a deception. small, with no light and with handwash in front of my bed. breakfast was not included we wanted to spoiled ourself but ths was a disaster, mainly for the value for money. 70 box for a breakfast. this is unaceptable and when we spoken with the waiter, told us was completely agree with us but unfrtunately this are the price here. However very kind suggested us another place outside. for this price you expect the best eggs in planet, far away from that and more than 15minutes waiting made us decided to place this fair and sincere review",2,2016,02,11

The hotel has a small but really well presented pool on the roof top terrace and a choice of two restaurants, one of which is the best in the area.  There is an amazing cocktail bar which has the most extensive collection of gin I have ever seen. The barman makes great cocktails and every now and then the chef brings out hot canapés.  A really fantastic stay.  Thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,01,25
15,Super hotel,"If you want to be utterly charmed by phenomenal staff and amazing concierge, stay in a great area, be wowed by a beautifully restored building and generally have a great Barcelona trip then I highly recommend the Mercer. We loved it. 

Not being ones to usually eat at hotel restaurants by choice, we reluctantly tried the tapas restaurant and it was great too. ",5,2016,01,15
15,A really beautiful and friendly hotel,"We (a couple from sweden) stayed at Mercer during five nights over New Years Eve and had a really great experience. The staff were so welcoming and in my opinion the hotel leaves nothing to be desired. As an architect I'm a bit choosy when it comes to design. Many so called design hotels are stiff and impersonal but Mercer is both warm and welcoming and beautifully designed, modern style nicely integrated in an old roman house. The room we had was spacious, at least three meters high and the furniture was elegant and comfortable. The roof terrace is a nice garden-like escape when your feet are tired from walking the streets and the restaurant is beautiful and the food is excellent. We hadn't high expectations on the New Years celebration but it turned out to be a very funny and memorable night with a lot of cava and dancing to a really good live band in the lounge! I strongly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants an extraordinary experience!",5,2016,01,11
15,"Best in town, for sure!","I have stayed in other 5 stars hotels in Barcelona and the Mercer was doubtless the best! Beautiful ancient building, but with a very modern touches. Its location is the best, but hard to convince a taxi driver to drive along the narrow streets of the old city... Our taxi dropped us from BCN at 1 block distance... when leaving the hotel concierge arranged a taxi to pick us up at the hotel door!

Our rooms were very spacious facing the beautiful vertical garden. Huge windows reduce the rooms privacy, but help with natural light (great for winter short days). We loved the room decor, but be aware the bathroom has an open style, not an unanimous preference... My room (309) didn't have a bathtub (thanks God it had a great shower), but the shower floor was odd and noisy. My family room (310) was bigger and with twin beds, bathtub and a big walk-in closet. Btw, we got an upgrade at the twin beds' room.

The hotel offers lots of eating options and all were great! We enjoyed a lot the breakfast buffet and Le Bouchon, for tapas and wine!

The rooftop terrace is beautiful, but with no special views and a small but nice pool area. Very well decorated and landscaped!

Service was flawless, but I am sure the hotel was not full when we were there.

Highly recommended! Will be back for sure!",5,2016,01,09
15,Too cool for school... ,"There is a lot to like about this hotel. Great location (when you finally find it...), friendly service, and a funky industrial design. It just seemed to lack a bit of soul and was a tad austere.. 
The rooms could have been featured in a design mag but call me old fashioned.. I still want a kettle to make my tea in the room in the morning... 
To be honest.. I think we had been spoilt in Madrid & Seville with the character of the (much cheaper) hotels we stayed at... 
",4,2016,01,09
15,Special Hotel ,"Really lovely hotel. The service was incredible. The concierges (particularly Florencia) were so knowledgeable and willing to make and change countless reservations for restaurants/ sites/ travel. The breakfast was particularly nice, as the food was delicious and the serving staff were friendly and gracious. We especially enjoyed meeting Noemi.

The rooms are well appointed and meticulously clean. Beautiful fixtures in the bathroom. Lobby is fresh and modern, but also comfortable. Location in the Gothic Quarter is slightly difficult to find at first, but so convenient for walking and wandering through an interesting part of the city. Highly recommend this hotel! ",5,2016,01,01
15,Wonderful visit over Christmas,"We'd highly recommend the Mercer Hotel. The location is superb and it is a top-notch facility staffed by lovely welcoming personnel. Oh, and it's beautiful. 

We were fortunate to get a great deal by walking up and paying up front. (We'd had a mix-up with our first hotel and had to move.) In the end, we were happy to have had to make the change.

The breakfast is exquisite.",5,2015,12,31
15,"Great hotel, service, rooms, products and location","If you are looking for a great little paradise in the heart of Barcelona go no where else this is the place for you, from the door to the reception, from the rooms to the breakfast everything is just perfect the only down side is parking and access by car but the quality of the hotel and services is definitely making the little trouble worth  ",5,2015,12,29
15,Hotel snob,"I am a verified hotel snob. The Mercer hit the ball out of the park with its service, comfort and amenities. The staff is welcoming and very friendly and approachable. The Botega, the main restaurant and the cocktail bar are pretty much perfect. The rooms are modern (think W) but very comfortable and convenient. Hotel is centrally located in the old town, in a 16th century building with Roman walls. Inside, the hotel is very modern. No, I was not paid to write this fantastic review, I am usually disappointed by the places I stay in, but this hotel is worth considering when in Barcelona. Thank you to the staff for making this a good stay.",5,2015,12,23
15,Didn't Want to Leave,"This is one of the world's outstanding hotels.  The room was beautiful and service  outstanding.  The staff were very welcoming and always greeted me by name, even though I stayed only a few nights.  The building is historic but the interiors beautifully renovated.  Outside the tall windows of my loft-like room there was a beautiful wall garden.  This was spectacular during the daytime, and at night came to life with twinkling candle-like lights hidden amongst the foliage.  Tucked away on a side street yet in the center of everything, this hotel is close to shopping and great restaurants.  The food from the hotel restaurant was also fantastic.  Is you are looking for a classy and cool place to stay, this is the spot.",5,2015,12,14
15,Ancient & Modern Elegance,"From the moment we walked through the glass doors until the time we left, everything about the Mercer humbly boasts modern elegance with a nod to ancient architecture, a feat which is not easily achieved. The Concierge was very informative, kind, caring, and helpful. We felt every member of the staff truly cared about making our stay as wonderful and comfortable as possible. With guest service's help, arranging for a taxi was a breeze. The Mercer's own restaurant should not be overlooked; the food was impeccable in presentation, freshness, and taste. We loved this little boutique hotel and can't wait to come back for another visit!",5,2015,12,14
15,Stands up to its excellent reputation,"Context of the review:  A 7 night stay in order to visit Barcelona

Pros:
Historical building that is part of the old roman wall surrounding the old quarter
Large, quiet rooms, although I can't speak to all the rooms because we specifically requested a room that did not overlook the street
Excellent room service with an unusual, yet delicious, take on a caesar salad
Very helpful and friendly staff
Rooftop terrace with great views over the city
Central location in the old quarter
Small, intimate, boutique hotel

Cons:
Very expensive, but you get what you pay for.

I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,12,12
15,A treasure in Barcelona,It's a very special place...warm and very well decorated! The location is very handy! We were amazed by the architecture of the rooms and the building! Really beautifull! The staff is very friendly and helpfull! We also loved the roof-garden!  We will definitely come back!!! ,5,2015,12,03
15,Exquisite - Just do it!!,"If you are even contemplating staying here, I recommend you stop reading the reviews and just book it now.  You won't regret it.

This property is just perfect.  Nestled in between old Roman Walls is a luxury boutique hotel that also somehow feels familiar and comfortable.  The staff is very helpful and it is actually a lot smaller than it looks in the pictures as there are many different unique spaces - the roof top deck /pool, the library bar, breakfast room, patio, lobby.  There are only 28 rooms.

We booked 2 rooms and stayed with our teenagers for 4 days before a cruise.  Just keep in mind that in Europe when they offer you adjoining rooms they mean adjacent and not connected.  Was not a big deal - this place is very quite and very safe.

From this location we were able to walk to all he main sites in the old town and nearby and we even walked all they way down the beach to Baceloneta and the Frank Ghery Fish/ Olympic village.

The hotel makes great recommendations and the staff is very, very helpful. With only 28 rooms everything feels very personal. 

The bar/ tapas place next door is also very welcoming with simple yet creative foods.",5,2015,12,02
15,First Class,"A wonderful ""boutique"" hotel in a fantastic location. Step outside, literally, and one is in the center of the historic distriict will ALL that it offers! Great bars, tapas restaurants, etc. etc. 

The staff at the Mercer understand ""first class"" in every way! 

Great breakfast, super ""intimate"" bar and a fantastic ""on site"" tapas bar, ""Le Bouchon"".

Would return in a minute!",5,2015,11,30
15,A City Wonder,"I was looking for a special hotel for my 30th Wedding Anniversary holiday and I spent a week going through the list of hotels in Barcelona. Initially I was a little worried about the location of the hotel after reading several reviews as it is not accessible by car and it could be hard to find with luggage in hand. After comparing several top hotels, I am glad I have chosen Mercer Hotel. It is not hard at all to arrive at Plaza Sant Jaume with a taxi from airport and follow by a short walk following the map emailed to me by the hotel. The walk around the hotel is extremely mesmerising with narrow old streets thinly lighted with not too many people and yet one can feel safe. There are also some beautifully decorated shops build into some old building. They are mostly artistic, unique and the architecture is uniquely Spain. Overall the atmosphere surrounding the hotel allow you to bath in a time zone several hundreds years back. This is a priceless addition to the hotel. The rooms is slightly small(there are bigger rooms with higher pricing)but very comfortable and quiet. The service is excellent with every staff so well trained and attentive. They are very friendly, helpful and sincere and never wear an artificial smile. The cleanliness of the hotel and room is top class. During our stay of 4 days, we thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast as it was very well presented with a small buffet and all other warm food can be ordered from the menu. It was classy as compared to a big buffet counter crowded with people. If you are looking for a conventional hotel, do not stay here. This is one unique hotel that provides a totally different experience and memory. On our departure, the hotel got us a taxi right to the door step perhaps possible due to early departure, and we got out through the narrow street, it was fun. We don't like to stay in the same hotel twice but we will definitely go back to the Mercer. ",5,2015,11,28
15,Exquisite and Exceptional,"From the moment we arrived to the minute we left Joan Manel saw to every detail. He and the staff are remarkable. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are ultra comfortable. I loved the area it was in, surroumnded by wonderful restaurants and
sights.  Very easy to get around! Would definitely return!",5,2015,11,25
15,Superb hotel in the Gothic quarter,"My husband organised a stay here as a surprise for my birthday - we stayed three nights and it was fantastic!
All the staff were friendly and helpful, the concierge service was excellent, they helped us book restaurants and entrances to museums/tourist sites, couldn't fault it. 
There was a bottle of cava on arrival in our room for my birthday, however as we arrived at midnight we only had a glass each, would've drunk the rest the following day but they cleared it away. They also cleared away the chocolate birthday cake (couldn't face it at midnight!) so didn't get to try it the next day. Still, it was a lovely touch. 
The room was a superior and gorgeous, overlooking the wall garden. Bed was large and comfortable, air con efficient and quite. 
Bathroom area separated from the bedroom with a dividing wall, but felt very open plan. Shower was a rain type affair and really roomy with lots of hot water, but no bath option available. 
Fridge was full of soft drinks and filled up for free every day, and free wifi was provided. 
Breakfasts were very good, again staff really friendly and helpful and food was excellent. 
Didn't eat in the restaurant but the bar was great, and Miguel so friendly and full of drinking facts - we learned a lot about both whisky and gin while we were there! He also made superb cocktails, although he told us he leaves soon so you may not get the benefit of his service...
I travel a lot and in all the hotels I have experienced this is one of the best, would definitely recommend. ",5,2015,11,24
15,Wonderful hotel and staff,What a gorgeous place. Stayed here for a flying visit in January and were determined to return. Had a wonderful stay. Hotel doesn't have many rooms so always feels chilled. Great tiny rooftop pool - didn't trouble it this time though! Had room 106 which was lovely. Definitely recommend if you want something a bit special in a great location. ,5,2015,11,24
15,Joint Birthday,"My wife and I stayed at the Mercer for 3 nights to celebrate our joint birthday.
Even before we arrived Juan in Guest Relations recommended and booked 3 restaurants which were superb.
I can only say that if you are looking for a hotel where nothing is too much trouble, the rooms are delightful, the staff courteous and helpful, and in a fantastic location in the Gothic quarter, then look no further.
There is a turn down service each evening with chocolates and hand-written weather forecast, Molten Brown soaps and shampoos and complimentary soft drinks in the mini-bar. A bottle of Cava also materialised on the evening of our birthday
We will be back.",5,2015,11,17
15,“Magnificent”,"Very nice view, very helpful and friendly staff, rooms are clean and comfortable, Very good & excellent location. I enjoyed my stay and recommended to all my family and friends. . I cannot imagine a better place to stay in Barcelona.",5,2015,11,17
15,amazing,"Just returned from a two night stay at the mercer...what a fabulous hotel...small but perfectly formed. It is in the gothic area of barcelona in a very narrow lane just 15 minutes walk from the cathedral. The welcome given by all the staff was so warm and friendly, we were shown to our room,which was beautifully decorated and the bed ! Wow...so comfortable, with big "" marshmallow pillows"" ! Our room overlooked the lane and it was a bit noisy if you sleep with the windows open ,however if you close windows and shutters it is ok. We ate in their bar on the first evening and had some delicious tapas ,and on the second evening we ate in the restaurant...the food was divine and beautifully presented. I cannot single out one member of staff as being especially helpful as they were all brilliant. We cannot wait to go back to use the fabulous roof terrrace in the summer.",5,2015,11,16
15,Great pool,"We went as a group of three families and it was the perfect hotel to stay in- it has a personal feel to it as well as some lovely luxuries that aren't present in it's counterparts. When we were there, the pool was one of our main hang outs as not many people used it, it's stunning though and felt like a family pool party gathering rather than a hotel pool. The location was great as well and a short walk from fantastic shopping. ",5,2015,11,14
15,Surprised with everything,"My wife and I, invited a friend/client of ours and his wife to accompany us to Spain as a Thank You.  We really wanted to treat them well.  We found the Mercer Hotel, and booked it on Hotels.com, based on the review of other guests.

We had no idea to the Surprises ahead.

Luckily we book an airport transfer ahead of time with the concierge.  The hotel is hidden in pedestrian only area.  The van that brought us to the hotel barely made it through.

My first surprise was the location.  Where are we I am thinking? Where am I bringing these people?  

You walk into a relatively small, but extremely charming lobby, mixed with modern architecture that blends with the origin of the building. Our second surprise.

As the welcome champagne was served while we are checking in, and the professional reception by all the staff, about 5 people were attending us, here comes our third surprise.

The junior suite was the fourth, and the surprises never ended.  The quality of the food, the service, the location grows on you and adds to the nice surprises.

The helpful staff, all of them without naming anyone in particular, from arranging and recommending dinner reservation,  to securing football statidium tickets, to pampering us with everything.

Great hotel, great staff, great food.  We will be back for sure.

PS: I will add more lights in the bedroom. This is our only uncomfortable experience.",5,2015,11,13
15,Exceeded my high expectations!,"This hotel exceeded my expectations, which were already high because of the great reviews on TripAdvisor! I knew the service was impeccable immediately when they saw us walking up the alley with our luggage and walked half way to meet us and carry it from there (our taxi couldn't get around another car a block or two away so we walked a short distance). 

When we showed up, I was a little upset because the airport had lost my luggage - the front desk employee took my claim ticket and told me they would follow-up on it which I REALLY appreciated. Fortunately, it arrived later that day and we just about hugged the bellman who brought it up to our room! All the tips and suggestions from all the concierges were excellent! We went out for a run one morning and they had a towel and water bottle waiting for us when we returned! They were always one step ahead and thinking of what we might need before we even had to say a word.

Aside from the impeccable service, the hotel itself is beautiful - it is simplistically decorated so as not to take away from the great history of the building - which one of the employees shared with us. It was also very clean and the only hotel I've ever felt the need to comment on the bath products - loved all of it, especially the face wash! 

The location is also incredible - I thought it would be too far from Las Ramblas but wasn't far at all and was very close to the Barcelona Cathedral and also close to El Born and Plaza Catalunya so it turned out to be a great, central location! Overall, we had a great stay at this hotel and will definitely return in the future and will recommend to family and friends! Thank you Mercer Hotel :)",5,2015,11,04
15,Honeymoon - first stop,"Perfect from the minute we spotted the entrance.  The service was wonderful. we arrived around 9:30am.  Understandably our room was not quite ready but the concierge was quick to engage us and we sat in the lobby while talking with him about some of our thoughts and learning from him. We then left to get some air and explore a bit of the area while the room was being prepared.  The hotel is perfectly located in the Gothic area. It is charming and easy walking access to some Gaudi, the water, Los Ramblas and cute shops.  When we returned we were taken to our room and loved the view of the green wall.  There is a perfect roof top patin with a pool -- more like a dipping pool but serves the purpose and makes for a nice environment to relax outside.  We spent two nights- had a lovely breakfast at the hotel one day but a little pricey for our breakfast taste so the next days enjoyed tea & coffee and then went out for a bite.  the service was phenomenal. A boutique hotel with (i think) 28 rooms.  Will recommend to everyone I know visiting Barcelona.",5,2015,11,02
15,Small but beautiful,"Stayed a couple of nights during a beautiful October weekend. The hotel was a bit challenging to find. If you aren't reasonable with maps, could be very challenging! Our party of 4 had a single carry on rolling luggage a piece-- so dragging them up and down the streets and alley ways was manageable. I did see a taxi pull up a couple of times next to the hotel entrance, however.

The Mercer is beautiful, once you find it. The personnel are very welcoming and helpful. It is a small hotel-- with a total of 28 rooms. We booked a ""superior room"" with some old architecture. It was cozy-- but lovely. It had an open concept bathroom (ie no walls to separate the shower from the rest of the room) but the toilet was enclosed.  There was a complimentary minibar (waters, sodas, some juices). 

We did check out the terraced roof area-- again, small but beautiful. The pictures make the whole hotel look larger than it turned out to be-- but as we were out and about the city most of the time-- it didn't make much of a difference. 

Our dinner reservations cancelled on us on Sunday afternoon so the front desk person scrambled to find us something nice (and somewhat equivalent). He did a great job!

Booked this based on the strengths of TripAdvisor reviews as well as wanting to spoil my husband for a big birthday.",5,2015,10,30
15,Wonderful Stay.,"Lovely hotel with lots of character and history which makes it far more interesting than a typical city hotel. We loved the location of the hotel which is in the heart of the old town with its beautiful architecture, independent shops and restaurants also very easy to walk to other parts of the city from here. 
Right from the initial booking communication with the hotel was excellent, the airport collection service was very efficient  they  also received pre ordered tickets on our behalf.
Our room was a good size  with nice original features and accommodated an extra childs bed with ease. The outside terrace was large with loungers, sofa and chairs, a nice space to relax after exploring the city.
The 'boutique' nature of this hotel is a real plus and it means that the staff can provide an excellent personal service, which they did throughout, the staff were very friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Would definitely return.",5,2015,10,29
15,"Excellent location, design and service","We went here on a romantic couples getaway. We were excited about the hotel based on the fact that it was a tastefully remodelled old property. While it is not large, the public spaces are very pleasant to sit in and have an interesting mix of old and new to provide history and comfort. The service was excellent - particularly the concierge in helping us to make the most of our time in the city and do things that we would enjoy. They worked on our requests even while we were out and about and confirmed bookings and options over email to allow us to dynamically adapt. Finally the location should not be undersold, it is in the heart of an old district in the town and you can see and do many things within a short walking distance of where they are placed.",5,2015,10,29
15,Charming Hotel,"We had some trouble finding it but when we did it was well worth it. Its staff was very welcoming and accommodating to our needs. It's within walking distance to lots of great tourist sites. We loved the fact that rooms were quite and quite large for European standards. 

The building's architecture, decor, artwork  and overall feel were fabulous. Overall this is magnificent hotel for a fascinating city. We're planning to go back next year and will definitely here again.",4,2015,10,28
15,A definite yes !,"We booked well in advance for a special occasion trip to Barcelona having read the great reviews on Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed. The 4 night stay from the moment we were picked from the airport by the pre arranged hotel car to the moment we begrudgingly left was great. All the staff in particular the lady concierge were great. The hotel is perfectly located for all your sightseeing. We had a junior suit with a terrace garden and it was perfect. Spacious well appointed very quiet, and  a particularly large and comfortable bed. Some reviews of the restaurant have not been particularly good however we found that the new chef and his team provided an excellent dinner as good as any and better than most. The spa massage service is particularly good and worth it.  Will recommend to anyone without hesitation. ",5,2015,10,28
15,Outstanding,"Hotel Mercer is located on a very quiet street in the old part of town, in easy walking distance to many of Barcelona's beautiful sights. The hotel's decor is elegant, yet contemporary. The staff was outstanding, everyone so friendly and helpful. The Guest Relations staff was remarkable, quickly answering all the questions in my many emails before we even arrived. Their suggestions for restaurants, guides, what to visit and the best time to go were outstanding. We would go back in a second. Nancy D",5,2015,10,27
15,Setting the Standard,"We have just returned after staying for 5 nights in Mercer Hotel Barcelona. What an absolute treat! This is a first class hotel in every way. The decor and architecture, including the Roman Wall and artwork is amazing. We stayed in a Deluxe Room with a bed big enough for 6 people, and a bath almost big enough to swim in - perfect after long days of seeing the many sights and walking through the fascinating city. There were so many little extra touches that made our stay extra special (check out the wonderful little oasis, with pool, on the roof - very romantic after dark) but, in particular, what makes this hotel stand out is the staff. Nothing is too much trouble for any of them and the absolute focus is on the comfort and enjoyment of the guests. Attentive, polite, cheerful and always available when needed - we can`t praise them enough, they made a brilliant holiday perfect. We wouldn`t hesitate to highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning  a stay in wonderful Barcelona.",5,2015,10,26
15,Oasis in barcelona,"This small boutique hotel is a bit hard to find down a small alleyway, but it is worth looking for. The service was excellent, the staff very friendly and helpful. The drinks at the bar were excellent, mikel was an excellent bartender, suggesting a small town to visit on our trip to the costa brave. He makes excellent Negronis!",5,2015,10,25
15,Excellent Service,"We stayed two nights at the Mercer last week. As noted by others it is inside the walls of the Gothic Quarter on a narrow street and a bit hard to find, so we arranged through the Mercer for a car to pick us up at the airport and take us to hotel. This worked very well- he drove us straight to the front door. We were greeted by two individuals, taken to reception, informed we had been upgraded to a junior suite. We had already arranged through guest services for a lunch reservation at a nearby cafe, and we were running a little late. Guest Services called the restaurant to inform them and then walked us there- -it was very close, but this was great service at check in. Map directions, recommendations, restaurant reservations, pick up for the flight out at 4:30 a.m. with coffee waiting- it was all handled very well and with no wait. I would definitely return on the basis of service alone. The hotel interior is great as well. Only issue for me is that in this room there was no sound barrier between the sleeping area of the bedroom and the sink area of the bathroom.",5,2015,10,19
15,"Location, Architecture, Service","My wife and I had a lovely stay at this exceptionally high quality hotel. The staff is extremely attentive. We felt like movie stars every time we entered or exited. It is as if when you enter into this hotel that you are entering into a work of art. The architecture, the inclusion of the Roman wall into the design of the hotel and the original artworks, fused with a pleasant scents really took us away. 

We had a junior suite with a tub, balcony and stocked free minibar (no booze, but really handy when you want a cold drink without leaving the room). The staff mentioned that the last visitor to this room was the Finance Minister of Greece - a guy that probably needed a relaxing break. 

I cannot say enough positive about this hotel that combines amazing service, great location in the old city, and really well thought out room layout, lighting, art and scent. 

This was a splurge for us - and worth it. ",5,2015,10,18
15,Perfect in every way!,"I cannot rave about this hotel enough! It is absolutely beautiful inside and the service was excellent. I was traveling solo and stayed in the mercer for 2 nights. The room was large and beuatifully decorated and felt very luxurious. Even the finishing touches of the sheets being washed in some kind of scent which was so wonderful .. I almost wanted to stay in there all day! Breakfast was fantastic and the recommendations by the hotel staff in where to eat and what to do were faultless...Thank you for sending me to Sagas to have the best porchetta of my life.. I still dream about it now! Service with a wonderful smile, even when I wa sleeping I asked for a few tissues and I was given a whole box and waved off by several of the staff and their big smiles, thank you to The Mercer, I am in love with you!",5,2015,10,18
15,Small elegant and centrally located,"This hotel is a great find in Barcelona.  The staff is so friendly and the concierge gives great recommendations.  We had a beautiful room, very large and well appointed.  The hotel has beautiful artwork in the rooms and around the public spaces. There is a quiet place for breakfast and fresh flowers throughout. We arrived early and our room was ready for us. We were given great ideas for where to go and what to see in the city. While not inexpensive, it's an excellent value.",5,2015,10,18
15,Faultless,"O booked the Mercer for 4 nights at the end of September 2015 to celebrate my wife's birthday.  The hotel and all staff were first class and the deluxe room was well worth the extra cost.  The room was wonderful with a balcony overlooking the internal open air courtyard.  The hotel is located along a narrow side street in the Gothic Quarter and was perfect for exploring the city.

The hotel staff were great (as mentioned) and the concierge service couldn't do enough to help, organising fantastic tickets for the Barcelona game on the day we arrived and arranging for an extremely choclaty chocolate cake on the morning of my wife's birthday.

With a water/soft drink complementary mini bar, molton brown soaps and shampoos etc as well as dressing gowns and slippers we were well set up to enjoy the stay.

Breakfasts are a treat with a huge range of items to choose from the breakfast area (including chocolate things).  The fresh fruit (and I mean very fresh) salad provided as a starter for breakfast was always welcome and following this up with a choice of hot eggs and ham dishes really set us up for the days ahead.

All in all, I highly recommend this hotel for quality, location and their friendly helpful staff.

Thanks you all at the Mercer for helping make my wife's birthday special.",5,2015,10,16
15,Ueber chic boutique hotel in old Barri Gothic - make you feel like family,"this is an incredible piece of architecture - built right into the original wall of the old city.  Located on one of the quiet streets (more like a walking lane way) of the gothic quarter.  It is perfectly located, walking distance from hundreds of shops and restaurants, yet quiet and chic.  The staff make you feel like family, always offering to help you, making sure everything is ok with your stay.  There are less than 30 rooms in the hotel.  A lovely restaurant with an inner courtyard for outdoor dining for breakfast and dinner, and a fun tapas bar, Le Bouchon, adjoining.  We had a quality special 6 course meal in the dining mid-week and were the only ones there - our luck because it was excellent in all respects.  We really enjoyed the full breakfasts which we ordered when making our room reservation.  One note for breakfast - the restaurant is very laid back so if you are in a hurry or need to make an appointment, tell them.  Otherwise the pace is "" lazy tourist"" which worked perfect for us!  Le Bouchon had excellent tapas and worked great for us two or three nights after long days of walking around.  The rooms are not large but very well designed, nice king bed, and separated from a very modern bathroom area, with soaker tub and separate large walk-in rain-head shower, Because of the location, you can't expect much in the way of views from the rooms - ours, 210, looked into one of the two inner courtyards.  We were told that a few rooms face out the back street and have more open space so they may be worth asking for.   Because we were there in early October, and the weather wasn't conducive, we didn't use the roof top mini-pool and sunbathing area but visited it and it was a special added feature.  All in all, a great stay - thank you Mercer, and thank you fellow Trip Advisor members - you nailed another one!",5,2015,10,15
15,Great Hotel But Do Not Order Room Service,"We really enjoyed our stay. The employees were very helpful and the Hotel top notch. Location is great. The rooms are a little expensive but very large and nicely done. Being a old building, the lighting is not that good. On the negative side, We ordered a cheeseburger from room service. It was to have lettuce, tomato and bacon. It came with nothing on it and was very dry. Also, no silverware, napkins nor salt and pepper were delivered. We understand things go wrong, and this is a small issue, but when we brought it up to the front desk, they told us they would let the management know. We never heard a thing after that. We were not necessarily  looking for any credit, but with rooms running $450 Euros +, at least some feedback from the management would have been nice.",4,2015,10,14
15,Amazing Spot in the Gothic District,"Central to everything.  A top notch hotel with everything you could want (except maybe a bathtub).

Great bar.  Great formal and casual dining options.  Beautiful rooftop pool and patio area.  Staff were all VERY hospitable.

I loved this hotel.

Getting there is tricky.  The gothic district is a maze and taxis don't really/can't really get you right to the door because of the narrow streets.  We walked about 100m to get from the street to the lobby.  Easy but if you had heavy bags - best to call ahead, and have the bell man meet you at the street.",5,2015,10,13
15,Elegant Hotel,We had a wonderful stay at this elegant hotel in September. Firstly we were upgraded to an amazing suite & secondly the service was top class. It is quite an expensive place to stay but well worth it if you want a quiet retreat in the old quarter. There is a rooftop pool area which is an added bonus.,5,2015,10,11
15,Perfect Location,"We stayed at the Mercer last week and from start to finish it was everything we would and could expect from them.  We were greeted with a glass of Cava and a warm welcome by the concierge.  Our cases were whisked up to our room, while we were given a tour of all the amenities, plus brochures for any possible activity we might like in Barcelona.  The location of the hotel was perfect - we were able to walk to just about anything, and the metro was just up the road.  The room was delightful, with very good air conditioning (always a plus!)  The concierge was always available to answer our questions, or make reservations. We hope to return soon.  This was certainly one of our better hotel experiences.",5,2015,10,10
15,Beauty in the Gothic Quarter,"My boyfriend and I had the pleasure of staying at the beautiful Mercer Hotel early June. This was our first time in Barcelona.

When we first arrived, we were greeted with huge smiles and graciousness. The staff were incredible helpful and friendly. They made sure our luggage was taken care of, while they took us aside to explain all the great things to begin exploring in Barcelona.
We are not always wanting to go where the tourists go, and love to explore the more local parts of places we travel. We were given many tips by the hotel staff, and were able to find many hidden gems because of their advice!

When it comes to the accommodations, there was a beautiful private rooftop patio, with a pool. Although the bar would close early, we had the option to purchase a nice glass (or bottle) of cava, and it would be brought to the rooftop from the main bar. During the day, there was great service. Towels and chairs are also provided. 

The rooms were very clean and modern. The layout of our room was unique to what we are used to. The bathroom was somewhat of an open-concept. The toilet was in its own separate room, but both the sink and shower were exposed without walls. As a couple, that was not bothersome, and actually pretty cool!

We had the pleasure of celebrating my boyfriend's birthday during our stay. In the evening, we received a beautiful and delicious dessert with a complimentary bottle of cava to celebrate. 

I do recommend trying to find other places to eat. I am unsure why, but it seems the prices are significantly marked up. For example, two double espressos came to 18 Euros. 
Luckily there is a great place just a few steps down the corridor called Academia, that serves delicious meals and drinks. We ended up there a few times for breakfast and even a late dinner.

Overall, the experience was great. The staff really makes the place what it is. So friendly, helpful and happy. I recommend this hotel to couples looking for a luxurious, private getaway.",4,2015,10,04
15,Selectively Mediocre,"I suppose the hotel has the basic amenities needed to qualify for a five star hotel.  Although, without tip-toeing around the issue, I will say the service is Caucasian guest preferred and oriented; so if you are Caucasian you're great to go but if you are of color, well expect obvious discrimination from the staff & especially other European guests.  They do not care about subtlety or understatement in this regard.  Besides that, the pool is very small on the roof and no more than 4 feet deep and about 15 feet long.  The plumbing is questionable.  The shower is a cabin of see through glass, so if you are not a couple, it might be super awkward.  In our 3 day stay the toilet wasn't flushing properly for 2 days, despite multiple attempts.  The hotel's winning point is of course location!  It's centrally located in the Gothic area and near the Barcelona promenade/mountains, hence the attraction.  We managed to enjoy the scenary and Gaudi's architecture as much as we had planned to, but we certainly and unexpectedly experienced more about the world we live in.",3,2015,10,03
15,Great spot in the Gothic quarter ,"Wonderful hotel and thoroughly recommend. Beautiful spot in the Gothic quarter, which I would recommend for first time visitors to Barcelona. Great use of the original building and really well thought through rooms. Service was unobtrusive and to a great standard. 
Tapas bar was also good and reasonable pricing. ",5,2015,10,03
15,Fantastic Honeymoon Break,"My wife and little boy spent a couple of nights at the Mercer on 23rd & 24th September and from start to finish our experience there was fantastic. Every member of staff was attentive and made our trip feel special from the flower petals on the bed on arrival to the chocolates and bubbly sent to the room as congratulations from the hotel on our honeymoon
I couldn't recommend the place highly enough",5,2015,10,01
15,Amazing hotel experience,"We loved the Hotel Mercer in Barcelona- great mix of old world charm and contemporary design in a great location -  Extremely helpful staff that went above and beyond, beautiful and comfortable room, relaxing rooftop and elegant breakfast served in the beautiful courtyard.  Highly recommend!!",5,2015,09,29
15,"Wonderful, Hotel, Location and Staff","My wife and I traveled to Barcelona as part of our trip celebrating her retirement, Barcelona and the Hotel Mercer was our first stop.  The hotel is in a great location, the heart of the Gotic district and within walking distance to the beach, La Rambla and many wonderful restaurants.   

Our room was spacious with luxurious accommodations and a wonderful view of the courtyard.  But the best part of the Hotel Mercer was the staff, very friendly and accommodating to our every need.  

Thanks Hotel Mercer for the wonderful stay",5,2015,09,28
15,Zen Like,"A beautiful hotel with a very calm and relaxing atmosphere . Well located for exploring the city and in a more interesting and cool part of town.
The service and staff were excellent.
The common areas even smell nice.
The only complaint would be that our room which was very expensive even compared to other city centre hotels around the world had very little natural light, room 207.",5,2015,09,28
15,Beautiful hotel!,"Just back from an amazing birthday trip  in which this hotel played a huge part.. Perfectly located...Absolutely lovely staff..friendly, warm and helpful but never over-bearing.. Room beautiful, bed comfortable, linens delicious...Breakfasts were wonderful..(stunning fruit salads)..Chocolate birthday cake mouth-watering..:-) Really can't thank them enough for service and hospitality..Cheers!

15,Superb hotel and restaurant,"We decided to go to Barcelona for our honeymoon so I was looking for a first class hotel and we were not disappointed with the Mercer hotel. It took some time to find but on arrival we were impressed with the architecture and styling within the hotel. On arrival we were amazed to find out we had been upgraded to the suite, what a fantastic gesture for our special occasion. We also received a complementary bottle of bubbly and treats in our room, the suite was magnificent. We decided to explore the hotel and ventured to the rooftop which has a classy sun terrace, bar and pool. We decided to take a seat and have some tapas, each dish was delicious, it was that good we returned on a number of occasions during our stay. On our first night we had dinner in the hotel restaurant, the food and drink were top class and recommend booking ahead. All of the staff provided an excellent service during our stay, we were even taken to a bank by one member so we didn't get lost, what a superb gesture. The Mercer is pure luxury and located in an incredible area of Barcelona, I hope we can return in years to come.",5,2015,09,27
15,"Incredible service, location and beautiful rooms - best in Barcelona!","We absolutely loved our stay at the Mercer - one of the best European hotels I've ever stayed at. It is small (28 rooms) and boutique and the staff knows your name within hours of being there. The rooms have beautifully high ceilings, are modern in design, yet with 1000 year old walls adorning them.  The beds were extremely comfortable and evening room service along to morning cleanup was always a plus. 

You cannot beat the location either - so many great restaurants, bars, tapas, shopping, etc and the hotel will book everything for you if need be. Breakfast in the hotel was delicious (great pastries, eggs, etc) and the bar was wonderful. Very well priced wine (4 euro per glass) and delicious cocktails. Roof was a wonderful escape as well. We'd find ourselves there for a glass of wine or cold beer later in the afternoon.

Juan Manual and his team did a fantastic job during our 1 week stay, we can't wait to come again!  A perfect boutique hotel in Barcelona.",5,2015,09,27
15,An Oasis of calm in the middle of Barcelona,"The Mercer hotel is in the ideal central location with easy access to wonderful Barcelona. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and the rooms are nicely appointed with a clever use of space. The roof terrace is great and very much appreciated in the hot weather as somewhere to relax after a days site seeing. 

I found the room temperature uncomfortably warm. The controls in the room do not work as I learnt temperature is centrally controlled when I went down to reception in the middle of the night unable to sleep.  My room had been set to 23 degrees and I was told the lowest temperature was 19 degrees, not sure why. The temperature was kindly changed and it was an improvement, but it was still a bit too warm for me. 

I'm not a fan of lumpy mattress enhancers on a perfectly good quality, firm bed, but that's personal preference along with a nice firm pillow rather than the very soft ones provided.

The free wifi seemed to work better on the roof than it did in my room, it seemed to take a long time to activate inside, but was ok once it got going.

I do think this is a great hotel in the ideal location, and would highly recommend it as a quality base for exploring.",5,2015,09,24
15,Nice but not worth the money!!!!!,We recently visited Barcelona and mainly based on TripAvisor reviews decided to stay at The Mercer. I think that it is overrated. The personnel were courteous and somewhat helpful. The design was very creative and pleasant but definitely not a five star hotel. The location was good but very hard to find. The room rate was high.The room was sparse with no balcony or views. We would not go back. There are other hotels that would have been a better choice for a lot less money. We were disappointed to say the least.,3,2015,09,23
15,peace in Barcelona,"We LOVED the Mercer Hotel Barcelona. From the minute the handsome doorman opens the front door to a lovely quiet courtyard we new we were in for a treat. This is where the beautiful, quiet, wealthy stay for a bit of perfect downtime. Minutes away from Los Ramblas, and the Bouquaria Market and just behind 2000 year old walls of the Gothic Quarter....is this precious gem of a hotel!!!  Our room was perfect , spotless and luxury. WE loved the beds , linens and great comfy pillows. The bath tub was a treat too! Breakfast is served on Limoges dishes and our server Lillyia  (from romania) was too sweet. She was kind and warm and we loved her!!! As well, thanks to Bogdan who gave us a full history lesson including visual aids, and tour of the ancient walls of the Mercer Hotel. He is very fun and knowledgable. The bar tender was great looking as are all of the staff.....a small perk. And the roof top pool was a perfect spot for a quick dip and nap!! the food was great too!!! WE felt welcomed and relaxed. 
Loved this hotel and ill come back!",5,2015,09,20
15,"Great hotel and bar, amazing service!","The hotel is set in the old city, in a very quaint and quiet side street. Beautiful facilities and wonderful service.

Their bar, in particular, is worth noting. Our bartender Miguel was amazing -- very knowledgeable about his craft, personable and one hell of a crooner! :) (also a big Sam Cooke fan, that's a plus!) He was so entertaining and made us feel special. Thank you Miguel for such a memorable experience!

Highly recommend this hotel. If you get a chance, swing by the bar and ask for Miguel!

John + Ann",5,2015,09,14
15,Great stay,"We loved this hotel in every way. Starting before we arrived, the contact to make sure our stay was special was appreciated. 
Staff were professional and friendly but not intrusive. 
We had great food and drinks. 
The room was truly a sanctuary. Location was perfect and allowed us to explore the city.
Would stay again in a heart beat.
",5,2015,09,13
15,A hidden gem,"A newly renovated hotel in the heart of the Gothic section. The staff were exceptionally helpful and helped us steer clear of tourist-type restaurants, instead, directing us to local places, which gave us a real taste of the city. A rooftop pool and bar help put the period of a busy day of sightseeing and prepared us for a busy nightlife experience.",5,2015,09,13
15,Excellent!,"Attention to detail is a mark of an excellent hotel, and the Mercer Hotel Barcelona excels in this area.  Upon arrival, we were offered a water - a small detail, but much appreciated - and we were escorted to our room by the manager.  Our room was cutting edge modern and very comfortable.  The rooftop bar is worth a visit, and the staff perfectly made several bookings for us.  Location is also excellent - it is an easy walk to la Rambla, the cathedral, the Gaudi sites, and to the beach.  Go for the location, the service, and the experience.",5,2015,09,13
15,Spanish holiday experience by couple from Australia,"fantastic location, you can not beat it! Gem in the heart of old town but close to many city sites-Barcelona cathedral, shopping, museums. Very clean, comfortable beds, luxurious linens/bath amenities. Room has all facilities but not kettle which was brought to our room within minutes on request. Staff could not be more helpful or friendly. Special thank you should go out to manager and Bogdan-you are excellent in what you are doing! Breakfast was good but should have less eggs choices on menu. This hotel is the place to stay in Barcelona( we spend 5 nights in hotel).",5,2015,09,13
15,Fantastic in every way!!!! ,"If you are coming to Barcelona check this hotel out! It's a classic gem!! Hidden away in the old town.

The hotel offers an excellent experience from the staff to the facilities it provides

The hotel staff are courteous and should train some of our English hotel staff in customer service. 

The overall service provided is tailored to the individual. For example we requested milk for Our Nespresso machine, diet coke rather than regular coke in the min fridge and all not a problem. Breakfast in our room on my birthday also sorted easily. 

The rooms are typical of a boutique hotel and offer a luxury experience with fantastic comfortable bed, complimentary Molton Brown toiletries and mini fridge restocked daily with water and juice and coca cola. 

The top floor pool bar is excellent providing a relaxing space to catch the sun while enjoying a cold beer or frozen cocktail. 

We didn't eat in the restaurants but the breakfast was excellent although you do have to like eggs - eggs eggs and more eggs on the options. 

If you are coming to Barcelona you could not stay anywhere cleaner or more welcoming in a location just a few minutes walk from the Ramblas, port etc etc. 

Will definitely return!

",5,2015,09,11
15,Perfect oasis in the city,"We recently spent 4 nights here and loved every minute of our stay. The staff were all extremely professional yet so friendly and helpful. No request was too much trouble. 

The building has been restored to an extremely high standard whilst still sympathetic to the original features. Beds are so comfortable and the roof top pool area perfect for making the most of the sun and having a break from the hustle and bustle of the city.

The location is ideal for exploring Barcelona and I've no doubt that we will return to the hotel.",5,2015,09,10
15,Lovely hotel,"Beautiful property. Has a lot of character and definitely is not an ""average chain hotel"". You can truly call this a boutuque hotel. Rooms are spacious and clean. Staff is knowledgeble and professional.  Location is perfect. 

One downside was the bar. Rooms are equipped with Nespresso coffee machines, but we wanted to get some real coffee, not a capsule.. Went downstairs for a little espresso and were offered a Nespresso coffee for 13 Euro. Not something that you would expect from a 5 star property.",4,2015,09,08
15,Wonderful barrio gotic,"Wonderful small, boutique hotel and great location in the old gothic part of the city.  The rooms are very spacious, charming and the beds are quite comfortable with luxury linens!  There was a lovely garden outside our room so the view was nice.  The bathrooms also quite spacious.  And the mini bar was always stocked with free water and juices.  Don't miss the rooftop deck-lovely view and small pool and bar.

When we first arrived, We were greeted at the taxi by Juan Manuel, the concierge who quickly became our best friend and practically our personal guide.  He truly made it possible and enjoyable to navigate the tiny streets of the old city and gave wonderful suggestions on how to spend our days and where to dine at night.  He is a gem!  The hotel itself was tastefully remodeled but has wonderful remnants of the original historic building.  

It is quite easy to get lost in the old city and the entire staff at the hotel was always very helpful and pleasant.  We really enjoyed our stay, the wine at the bar with our friend Raymond.  The business center is a beautiful old, antique room off the bar.  

We would stay there again!",5,2015,09,07
15,Fabulous!,"Beautiful hotel in a wonderful location in the Gothic Quarter, built on Roman ruins. Sophisticated, lovely and comfortable. The staff is flawless, from the waiter at breakfast to the concierge. Everyone is so helpful. We would love to return and will never stay anywhere else in Barcelona!",5,2015,09,07
15,Perfect!,"Can't say enough really.  Absolutely amazing property, staff, location, vibe.  Boutique hotel of the highest quality. Modern, historic, simple luxury.  One of the best 5 star hotels we have ever stayed at around the world, and we've stayed at plenty.  We will definitely recommend to our friends and come back ourselves next time in Barcelona.",5,2015,09,07
15,Wouldn't stay anywhere else,"The hotel is superbly located on a quiet, picturesque street in the Gothic Quarter.   Beyond location, it is a revelation - built atop Roman ruins, aesthetically beautiful, understated yet sophisticated in every way.   The rooms are absolutely lovely - large, quiet, comfortable beds....there are beautiful public rooms as well.

Everything shines at this hotel but at the top of the charts is the outstanding service - across the board.  That includes among the best, most helpful concierges I've ever seen at any hotel.   We hope to come back to the Mercer.  It beckons.",5,2015,09,03
15,Beautiful Hotel!,"+ centre of the Barri Gotic 
+ elegant with just a hint Spanish elements
+ all the fun shops and good restaurants are nearby
+ free upgrade from deluxe room to the junior suite
+ very comfortable bed 
+ bathroom had molten brown products
+ private, quiet and very calming atmosphere
+ good rom service

- i would say the only minus point is bathroom and the bedroom don't have any separation which i felt a little uncomfortable with in privacy and hygiene especially when you order room service
- the menu had very limited options for food unless you take the effort of calling room service and requesting for foods which they do have and can make promptly

I would stay again at this wonderful hotel if they did something with the bathroom and bedroom separation! Otherwise its a 5* ! 
Be sure to try the Sensei Bistro nearby which was suggested by the hotel has mind-blowing food and amazing service!",4,2015,08,30
15,At the top of all lists,"The Mercer Hotel, the Owners, Guest Relations and Reservations, Florencia, Joan Manuel, Aleix and Marina,

 

  I wanted to thank you all for the exceptional service and hospitality that we received during our four nights at the Mercer Hotel Barcelona.

  Travel planning, especially when you desire a special experience, can be a difficult undertaking. I am of a nature to examine closely my options and to plan my trips to their fullest. I utilize as much information as I can gather from varied sources and apply it towards my lofty goal. Not the least of this information is the responsiveness of the staff as it relates to my inquiries. 

  Barcelona was a special trip for us. As we are a relatively new couple, our experiences traveling should start off and continue as adventures that draw us closer. With these thoughts in mind, I set out to find the perfect place in Barcelona to greet us on what was to be our first trip to the Catalan city. 

  As a Relais 5C member, I was drawn initially to the Hotel Neri...... I penciled it as possible and searched further....the Hotel Ohm, the Majestic, The Hotel Arts, The Mandarin Oriental, The Palace, Hotel Do, the ABaC, the W, all were looked at and contacted with regards to putting together an experience that would be memorable. None of them, including the Neri , responded in any way suggestive that they would be the right location.

 The exception was the Mercer. 

 From the outset, the Hotel Mercer's staff was gracious and accommodating to my inquires. I wanted to maximize all four days as much as possible, so I peppered the reservations and guest relations staff with questions regarding advice and options that would allow my plans to succeed. Restaurant recommendations, transit requests to and from the airport. Private tour arrangements for the Gaudi architecture, in house packages for Dinner together and more. All of my requests were greeted professionally and cheerfully by each and every member of the staff.

  On my arrival day, weary from a transatlantic journey and connections through London, I was welcomed by the smiling reception staff led by Florencia. She expressed excitement in my plans, all surprises for my lady to savor during our stay. Florencia showed me to our room, a beautifully designed and appointed suite....so stunning that I photographed it in detail before our departure as I would love to live some day in a space as well designed.

  As I awaited my lady's arrival, I explored the Hotel. The photos on the web site are lovely yet they pale considerably to the real beauty of the spaces throughout the Mercer. The door at the entrance, the preserved old walls, the inner courtyard, the lighting, both natural and ambient from the most amazing light fixtures. The art work. The flower arrangements. The flatware and silverware and especially the glassware. This is as much a luxurious home as it is a beautiful hotel. 

  From the food treats in the room to the breakfast baked and prepared dishes to the exceptional five course dinner that was prepared especially for us...every taste was memorable and delicious. The goat dish at dinner was one of the top dishes that we sampled during our stay in Costa Brava.

 With all of these pleasant surprises to contend with, the greatest surprise was the amazing staff...their enthusiasm, warmth and their smiles were balanced with professionalism and a genuine desire to make the Mercer experience an exceptional one. They far exceeded my expectations.

 Special thanks go to Florencia and Joan Manuel.....they were tireless in their efforts to please. They represent, to me, the benchmark by which all hospitality and service should be compared to. Everyone was pleasant and helpful, the front doormen with their direction and driving tips, the breakfast and Dinner service team....Aleix and Marina and those who's names I failed to secure....exceptional, each and every one. Please forward my thanks to the director of staff services for what amounted to a demonstration of refined and stellar hospitality and service throughout. 

 Please also forward my thanks to the owners of the Mercer Hotel. Their vision and the execution of that vision merit the highest praise.

 

Warm regards and Moltes Gracies",5,2015,08,30
15,Gracias to Juan Manuel,"Great stay at the hotel. True 5 star experience even by NYC customer service standards. Juan Manuel, the concierge, went above and beyond the call of duty to help us. Excellent recommendations for restaurants, got us tickets to the soccer game, and even--when the bellhop was not available for a moment-- helped us with our bags. Thank you Juan Manuel.",5,2015,08,29
15,Amazing place,This was such a lovely place to stay and the food was really decent. The staff are a little cold but otherwise a great place. Barcelona has great hotels but this one is a little more special than the ones I walked into.,5,2015,08,26
15,Stunning,"The 3 year conversion this building underwent to make it into a modern hotel whilst keeping the best of the astonishing wealth of history is stunning. The building itself is an oasis of calm from the ever bustling Barcelona. This is only emphasised by the staff who were wonderfully trained to strike just the right balance between formal and friendly and who were always there when you needed them. Our room was a small first floor room over looking the street. This is generally the worst place for a room in Barcelona but it was very well designed, felt luxurious despite its size and still managed to be pretty quiet at night. We loved our stay and will be dreaming about the roof terrace for some time to come. Highly recommended.",5,2015,08,24
15,Can't wait to go back,"Our second visit to the Mercer and this year we were joined by my sister and brother in law who also loved it. I just want to say what fantastic staff they have and how refreshing it was to see many of the familiar faces from last year. Fantastic breakfasts and the most comfortable beds I have ever been in. The location is great for exploring Barcelona and the hotel has a real feel of understated luxury.

Our only disappointment was that the formal restaurant was closed for part of August. We had a great dinner there last year, but just made us want to return again soon.",5,2015,08,22
15,Stay here and stop looking for alternatives,"We've stayed at a ton of high-end hotels, but this one was up there. There were other more affordable options in the city but after traveling around Europe we decided to splurge on the Mercer at the end and so glad we did. 

Location - best in Barcelona in a historic area, but walkable to everything
Amenities - has everything you'd need and the rooftop bar/pool was stellar
Room - clean, modern, beyond comfortable and quiet, great toiletries, worldwide adaptors on outlets (this was HUGE!)
Service - they've beat the Ritz and Mandarin Oriental on service. Doors open at every arrival, champagne in room, attention to detail, true warmth. 
Bar/food - we didn't eat much at the hotel since it was pricey but had some drinks and they were wonderful!",5,2015,08,22
15,All I need in BCN...,The room that I was staying on 1st floor was really nice with a balcony to the court yard. The bed was really very comfy and the room in general is very nice. I had tasting menu at the restaurant which was very good too. The concierge arranged 4h walking tour of BCN which I enjoyed a lot. This is by far best place for me to experience all what BCN has to offer. I will return soon! ,4,2015,08,22
15,A very clever choise!!!,"This was my third visit in this hotel after many yearsWhat a nice choise that i made! The lobby ws renovated,the welcoming from the staff was friendly,they treated us two nice chocolate cookies....the room was clean,the breakfast was good enough,the location was perfect!a few steps from paseig de gracia and the metro station. 
I highly reccomend it!",4,2015,08,22
15,Best staff?,"The facilities are beautiful, and the service was impeccable.  Upon arrival, Florencia provided us with all the information about the hotel, and she helped us with suggestions for places to see, and directions for wherever we wanted to go.  The breakfast every day was tailored to our liking, from the first day when Noemi was the server of my French egg-white omelet, for which I am grateful to the chef, as well.  Noemi proved helpful in many ways other than serving breakfast, and we looked forward to starting our day off with her and Alesh, who also helped facilitate our unexpected last-minute check-out when he brought us room service our last morning.  We also enjoyed the roof top bar, especially talking with Albert about Spain, as well as the delicious smoothie he made.  The doormen--including Paolo and the Ukrainian who speaks 7 languages--were also helpful and friendly, and we enjoyed seeing them every day.  I must also thank the doorman who helped us with our luggage all the way to the Cathedral when our air transport was unable to pick us up any closer than that.  He was great!  I also loved the Molton Brown Deep Cleansing Mineral Face Wash, and am disappointed to find that I cannot buy it anywhere, but can only get it from a hotel.  Any you can spare me??",5,2015,08,18
15,Pure Elegance,"We recently spent a wonderful 4 nights at the Mercer and to say it was an absolute pleasure would be an understatement.. Thank you to the staff, each and everyone of you were so friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We can also recommend trying the tapas bar (we did quite a few times in our short stay) and we also had the pleasure of dining in the gastronomic restaurant..excellent.
The Mercer is fantastically positioned in the Gotic quarter, so easy to get around and so much close by... I cannot recommend enough, please enjoy as we did and stay at the Mercer...
Australia is a long way, away but we will return...",5,2015,08,17
15,The magnificent Mercer,"We recently spent 6 nights at the Mercer hotel in Barcelona. In our estimation, it was one of the best hotel stays we have ever experienced. The staff was gracious, knowledgeable, friendly, and professional in every way. The hotel is well situated within walking distance of many sites. We could not imagine a better experience for our first time visiting the beautiful city of Barcelona. Gracias to the entire Mercer team.",5,2015,08,17
15,The perfect place to stay in Barcelona,"I knew the Mercer was nice from what I had read about it, but it exceeded all my expectations when I arrived. We were greeted with a glass of cava on arrival, and given a map along a brief explanation of some of sights of Barcelona and their  locations. We were then guided round the beautiful hotel so we knew were everything was.

The staff were great from the moment we arrived. They were always friendly and helpful, and the maids left the rooms spotless. 

The hotel is located in the Gothic quarter which has plenty of places to explore, and very easy access to the metro to get around the city.

Overall we couldn't fault the hotel and when I go back to Barcelona I will definitely be staying there again. 

",5,2015,08,16
15,Perfection,"The Mercer is perfect. A very stylish mix of old and new - as lovely as the pictures, which is not often the case. The staff are exceptionally helpful, speak excellent English and help with any queries and arrangements. The breakfast in the courtyard was excellent. The rooftop terrace is a lovely spot for a pre dinner drink. The rooms are well equipped, with all sorts of things you might have forgotten and all those things which should be basic but aren't always there in even the smartest hotel - sockets beside the bed, plenty of sockets to charge everything, plenty of space for all your toiletries and bits. Even the safe in the room was the smartest I have seen (and I travel a lot). The location is very good for exploring Barcelona.
Perfection.",5,2015,08,15
15,Wonderful boutique hotel,"We stayed at the Mercer Hotel in April 2015. What a treat, 
This hotel is situated in the gothic area of Barcelona. It is within walking distance of  Las Ramblas as well as the more luxurious shopping district. It is close to many wonderful tourist attractions including the Picasso museum. it is close to many wonderful cafes and restaurants although you might not want to leave this wonderful hotel. It has the most wonderful little tapas restaurant that we frequented twice during our stay. Unbeatable food! the breakfasts were also of fine dining quality. 

The service was impeccable. from the reception to the most informative concierge. Staff were always on hand when needed but not intrusive: a very rare combination.

The rooms were modern, clean and very comfortable. Every detail is taken care of in this hotel, without being overly pretentious. The hair dryer is amazing and its the best hotel slippers I've had in a while!

I could not recommend this hotel highly enough. Than you for making our trip memorable!",5,2015,08,12
15,Excellent location and service,"This hotel has an incredibly attentive and friendly staff. From the moment we arrived, we did not have to worry about a thing. Our room was excellent and had very nice artistic touches. We did not try breakfast, but the room service was decent and the attached tapas and cocktail bar served some of the best Iberian ham we have had in the city.

In addition to excellent five star service around the clock, the hotel is in the best location you could imagine. Our cab driver hadn't heard of it and thought it might have been a youth hostel (quite the opposite), but he was able to bring us directly to the understated front entrance, which quickly gives way to a chic, modern, and very comfortable hotel. We will always choose this hotel for our return trips to BCN.",5,2015,08,09
15,Good hotel,"I little bit hidden but with very friendly staff. Good customer service. Nice rooms, very modern. Not a party hotel. Go for it if you need peace.  Not to far from the restaurants. Pricy breakfast. Would stay there again.",4,2015,08,08
15,Perfect and hope to return soon!,"WE loved this hotel.  We drove in from the coast and had a rental car.  Being American and used to wide lanes, we were overwhelmed by the narrow streets (Barrio Gothic Quarter) plus a little confused how exactly to get to hotel from the square which was in the middle of a protest. They sent the doorman to the square to find us and guide us driving the very narrow pathway to this hotel.  They also assisted us in returning our rental car which was a HUGE help. GREAT STAFF!

The rooms are cool and modern.  I love being greeted with beautiful treats. The toilet seats are abit funny.  You feel like you did not put the seat down.... The rooftop is beautiful with a small lap pool.  Excellent for drinks and relaxing.  Breakfast is delicious and the seating within the beautiful courtyard adds to the allure. We walked so many places from this location.  The architecture and design of this hotel is simply a must see. The chef at the tapas bar prepared some interesting and delicious tapas for us to try.  The concierge is extremely helpful and friendly.  He actually checks in with YOU to see if you need assistance and how your day was.  

Segue is around the corner and my daughter convinced me to try.  A great way to see  the city.  Not as scary as I thought. 

I loved staying here and would love to return soon!",5,2015,08,08
15,Best hotel in Barcelona!,"This was my second trip to Barcelona. I was super-excited. My sisters and I spent three days in Paris, and by the time we arrived in Barcelona we were very very tired. I picked this hotel because of its location. Since the reviews were so great, we decided to book it at the Mercer Barcelona. I don't know how to explain it, but the minute we arrived, we felt we were in a different world. The hotel is a mix of old, and new. The location is perfect, in Barrio Gotic. It is a walking distance to all the great tapas places, shopping, and more. It is hidden in a small street, well all streets are small in this neighborhood. It's like a hidden gem. The architecture, and design of this hotel is super cool and chic. The rooms are spacious, well arranged, and has an amazing bathroom. When you spend an entire day walking, and you come back to an amazing place like the Mercer Barcelona, it makes your stay even better. The staff was professional, welcoming, and always ready to assist you. Every morning we would have breakfast at the hotel, it was beautifully prepared, the space is so pretty. The staff, especially Alesio  (I hope I spelled his name correct.), was always ready to greet us, and made us feel so welcomed. The hotel staff knew it was my birthday, and even greeted me in the morning with a small birthday cake. I was so touched by it. At the end of the day, when we returned to our hotel, they had left me another birthday cake, and a bottle of wine in our room. I have been to many places around the world, and this is my first review of a hotel. If you are stopping by Barcelona, there is no other place but the Mercer Hotel. I will definitely return.",5,2015,08,07
15,Perfect - couldn't fault it. Definitely hope to return.,"Great location, very comfortable rooms, excellent food, and the staff were fantastic - so friendly and helpful, they made our stay really easy. We asked quite a lot of their concierge service and it really delivered everything we needed. If we go back to Barcelona (which we hope to do) we would definitely stay here again. We didn't really use the wifi or the pool so can't comment - we used the hotel as a base to see the amazing city. Also just around the corner was the Segue tour which was fantastic - highly recommended and much easier than it looks.",5,2015,08,03
15,Excellent choice ,We can't say enough good things about this hotel. Let's start with its excellent location walking distance to all major neighborhoods in Barcelona. It really enhanced our stay. Rooms are big and spacious with excellent bathrooms and showers (not taken for granted in europe). The roof top is relaxing and a great way to soak up the warm weather. The staff was top notch and extremely helpful with tours and restaurants. We very much recommend it. ,5,2015,08,03
15,Perfect ,"Excellent service, location, design. Not sure why it's called the Mercer--no relation to the NY Mercer. I initially booked because I thought it was the same operator which is clever I suppose many people book with that assumption. Absolutely no regrets. They also have a very good little tapas restaurant and bar. Don't know Barcelona that well but if you want to be in the gothic area you can't go wrong with Mercer.",5,2015,08,02
15,Loved this hotel!,"We absolutely loved this hotel!  We stayed here five days on our honeymoon.  This is the absolute best location in Barcelona.  The gothic quarter is a charming place to stay, and delicious restaurants and charming plazas to sit in are just steps away.  We stayed in a junior suite and it was perfection.  The bed was super comfy, the room was spacious, and the shutters kept out the light in the morning so we could sleep late if we chose.  The amenities were lovely, including the robes and slippers. The hotel staff was unfailingly charming and helpful.  Very elegant and tasteful hotel.",5,2015,07,30
15,Amazing Mercer,"My husband and I had an amazing stay at the Mercer hotel in July. The staff were brilliant, service excellent- attentive without being too much. The hotel was beautiful in a very rustic informal way. The roof terrace is perfect for winding down after a busy day sight seeing. The hotel location was brilliant as very central, but very quiet. We will come again. I can't recommend it enough.",5,2015,07,30
15,Stunning,"What a fabulous Hotel. 

The location is gorgeous and you feel like a million miles away from the centre of Barcelona, when in reality you are a few minutes from the hustle and bustle.

The rooms are exquisite. 
All of the usual expectation with excellent add one, such as a complimentary mini bar, slippers and gorgeous toiletries.

Excellent, and free Wifi.

All of the staff are extremely helpful and knowledgable. 

The bed and shower are so divine that you don't want to leave your room!!

Highly recommended!!",5,2015,07,23
15,Excellent,"Very Impressed i agree with the other reviewers service is second to none.
Quiet possibly the best hotel we have stayed in this part of Europe, we cannot wait for our next visit would certainly recommend to all.",5,2015,07,22
15,Service that goes above and beyond,"We spent 3 nights at the Mercer Hotel and really enjoyed it.  The location was fantastic, the breakfast delightful and the service was outstanding.  After 3 days we felt like part of the family to the staff.  They greeted us with delight every time we came in, and anticipated our every need.  Once they know your breakfast choices, they remember them the next day.  Concierge Florencia spent almost an hour with us planning an itinerary for our 3 days, making recommendations, ordering tickets, calling for reservations and giving crucial guidance.  We were overwhelmed by her patience and generosity of time.  I would return again in a heartbeat.",5,2015,07,20
15,A little gem!,"This is arguably one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Not because of any one thing but for the whole experience. It is a 28 room boutique hotel cleverly tucked into the 2nd century roman walls surrounding the gothic quarter off a very quiet narrow street. The hotel is modern, elegant, peaceful and totally understated. It has its own fragrance that is quite delightful but unobtrusive.

We stayed there for 5 nights in a standard room which was exquisitely simple, comfortable and very spacious. The bathroom too was huge, modern and very tasteful. 

The pool deck on the roof was an a lovely surprise, an oasis of peace and tranquility with vies over the gothic quarters roof tops. The ideal spot to relax with an cold beer or exotic cocktail in hand. 

But the most amazing thing about this already very special place is the service. The staff just can not do enough to make sure your stay is a joyful, stress free experience. Well done to all of you and thank you for making our stay so special. 

All of this together with the special location in this beautiful city also make this a wonderfully romantic destination. We would love to go back some day. ",5,2015,07,20
15,Stunning,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and it is stunning; in location, amenities, room, staff and food. 

After an intense cruise the Mercer was our last port of call, we arrived at the hotel at 8am and even though our room wasnt available the staff had us up on the roof top deck for a coffee and quick breakfast before we set off for a walk around the beautiful Gothic area.  On our return we were welcomed with a warm greeting and our room was available early.  The attitudes and attentiveness of the staff was consistent with all the staff at the hotel.  They are truly a great team and their service was outstanding.  

The hotel itself is magnificent and sits on the old Roman walls, the heritage has been complemented by the renovation and it really is a beautiful asset.  Definitely try the tapas at the hotel restaurant we loved it so much we went back twice and the chef made some awesome recommendations for food.  The GM also recommended a fantastic tapas bar in the Born district which was excellent as well. 

The hotel's location in the Gothic area is centrally located to Born and to Las Ramblas and a short stroll to just about everything. Definitely worth a stay.",5,2015,07,16
15,Beautiful Hotel/Wonderful Staff,"The Mercer Hotel is beautiful, extremely comfortable and very tranquil. During our stay 4th-11th July, the staff were wonderfully attentive and friendly-nothing was too much trouble e.g. they kindly provided us with an equipped bag for a trip to the beach. Great attention has been given to every aspect of design in the hotel, including the beautiful roof top garden/terrace.  We will definitely stay at this lovely hotel again-hopefully next year! Many thanks to the whole team.",5,2015,07,15
15,Amazing hotel,The hotel is fabulous with staff that were friendly and helpful. they me and my friend a bigger room and it was very spacious. I love the location of this hotel. Lovely place for a cava  and very close to all the action downtown.The beds were extremely comfortable.will definitely be back.,5,2015,07,12
15,Best place to stay in Barcelona,"I can't say enough about the Mercer hotel in Barcelona. The location is right in the middle of everything. You can walk to many of the great sights and museums. The food is great and the hotel itself is clean and well maintained. However it is the staff that really sets this hotel apart.

Everyone from the front desk to the concierge to the lovely waitstaff were a pleasure. They really made our stay wonderful. The concierge helped us with our itinerary and made sure we had a great time. Stay at the Mercer hotel next time you are in Barcelona and you won't be disappointed,",5,2015,07,11
15,Our best hotel experience ever,"Before we arrived we were a bit puzzled. The hotel has great ratings and looked great, but we kept getting these ""can we do something for you"" and wondered if they would be overselling. Not so. Once we got there we experienced the friendliest and most eager to please staff we have ever met! So they were just trying to tell us they could fix everything we needed before we came. This is not a stuffy and servile staff or place, just friendly and trying to second guess what we could possibly want. And when we asked every request was fixed in an instant. Like a wonderful outside restaurant in November and a hair/beauty appointment on short notice in a wonderful place on a Saturday afternoon.

Mercer is pretty pricey, but absolutely worth it if you can afford it. It was our silver anniversary so we decided to splurge. Mercer made the trip magic. We will come again!",5,2015,07,09
15,Great location and amazing hotel,"Sadly we only stayed one night - wish we could have stayed much longer.  While modern in style, this hotel is rich in history and located in Old Barcelona.  We loved the access to the old town and the hotel was A+.",5,2015,07,08
15,Amazing!!,"Stayed here from June 30-July 6.  Without a doubt the best staff of any hotel I have ever stayed at.  Located on a quaint street, within walking distance to most major attractions and shopping.  From the housekeeping to the restaurant staff, I can only say that the pride they take in their guests is unbelievable.  The rooms are beautiful and clean.  The pool and terrace are just a perfect place to relax and wind down for a while.  The concierge staff, including Joan Salamanca were so courteous, professional and helpful.  There wasn't enough they could do for us.  I WILL return to this location sometime in the future.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona.  It was a fantastic adventure that was amplified in a tremendous manner by staying at the Mercer!!",5,2015,07,07
15,Fabulous,"I'm fortunate to have the opportunity to stay in a lot of nice hotels, but this hotel is truly exceptional.  It's a small hotel tucked away on a lovely little street in the Barri Gòtic, within walking distance of both the waterfront and the more commercial area surrounding Plaça de Catalunya.  It's a great location from which to explore Barcelona.  The hotel incorporates the remnants of an ancient Roman wall and is impeccably appointed throughout.  

The service was fantastic.  Our group consisted of 12 people across three generations, and the hotel took great care of us all.  My youngest niece loves maps, so the concierge made sure to sit down and give her a full briefing on the hotel's map of the city.  We arrived in Barcelona without much of a plan, as it was merely a layover on our way further north.  The staff did a great job of arranging a last minute restaurant reservation, making sure our transportation needs were met, and making suggestions about sites to visit.  Genuinely friendly people across the board.

Be sure to visit the hotel roof.  It has a small swimming pool, a bar, and a lounge area with great views of the Barri Gòtic.  It's an unusual amenity to find in a dense urban setting like this one.  

Be advised that some taxis will not take you directly to the hotel, as the street on which it is located is very narrow.  The hotel works with a taxi company that is willing to drive passengers to the front door.  If you arrive at the hotel in a taxi that isn't willing to traverse the street, you may have to wheel your luggage a little ways from where the taxi drops you off.  It is a minor inconvenience that is a small price to pay for the hotel's charming location.",5,2015,07,06
15,A beautiful escape to a cool peaceful world,"we stayed one night in the Mercer at the end of a shabby
AirB&B week. The staff were so kind, so helpful and so knowledgable and welcomed us with warm, understated
hospitality that blew both of us away.I travel the world as does my girlfriend,and we both stay in great hotels all over Asia, Europe and the US...this place beat them all. Great rooms, killer rooftop deck, not to be missed and in such a cool location as to be unexpected, a secret garden, a James Bond hideaway off the busy bazaar...
top notch spot. I crave time in their other Spanish locations coming up. they are independent of the NYC Mercers....different country , different brand  ...so far above all the other Barcelona hotels and a top notch restaurant, peaceful breakfast and elegant, farm based dinners...",5,2015,07,06
15,Excellent Hotel Experience Once Again!,"Returned to the Mercer Hotel for a few days R and R and found it to be just as good as our first visit last year.  The staff were friendly and helpful and one bar staff member welcomed us back, remembering us from last year!!  We had a bigger room this year and it was very spacious.  I love the location of this hotel and will definitely be back again.",5,2015,07,05
15,3 night stay,"I stayed at the Mercer with my husband for our wedding anniversary in June for 3 glorious nights. From the greeting in the street by the doorman to the warm handshake as we left everything was just about perfect. We were greeted with a glass of cava in reception and informed that we were being upgraded to a suite [room 301].
The suite was large and airy with a sliding door separating the vast living area from the bedroom. The air conditioning worked perfectly and was well appreciated during the hot June nights. The room was very quite despite overlooking the narrow street due to the electric blind on the exterior of the windows. Bed was super comfortable. Bathroom original in design, shower floor slats a great idea.
The staff were superb throughout, ( Special thanks to Lydia for my cocktails on the fantastic roof terrace).  We took the 3 course breakfast each morning which certainly set us up for the day.
A great location to discover on foot a wide spectrum of Barcelona.
A big thank you to all at the Mercer for making our stay very happy and memorable.",5,2015,07,05
15,;),What a little gem.the visible was just as expected for this lovely little place breakfast.was good but the service was the best I have had.the lady waitresses were so helpful.friendly and made this such a memorable experience.only thing was the small room.for me and my husband was tight.,4,2015,07,03
15,Great location and very good staff,"We stayed four nights in June, great location (don’t be alarmed when your cab driver drops you off in a small lane and says its just a short walk) The location well makes up for the cab drop of issue, hotel staff are very good.  Our room was small but nice, good bar and restaurant.",4,2015,07,03
15,Just Lovely,"From the moment we arrived we felt welcome. The room was small but comfortable and well appointed, the staff at the front desk impeccable, the breakfast divine. The darling young ladies that served breakfast could not have been more wonderful",5,2015,06,30
15,Attention to Detail,"Good location and allowed for an early check in. My room was small but perfect for one person. I think most hotel rooms in Spain are pretty small. Bed was soft and the room was very quiet despite the busy street outside. I was able to walk to most locations and Las Ramblas was within a 10 minute walk. The metro line was only one block away. The staff was very friendly and the roof top bar had very nice views. 

There is a small fitness room and also breakfast area in the lower levels. All in all the service was very nice. They do charge for the use of espresso machine, but I didn't know that at first. It was nice to have the espresso machine accessible.",5,2015,06,29
15,"Intelligent, Unpretentious Luxury","Hotel Mercer lived up to its sterling reputation as the best in Barcelona. The good news began when I called the hotel for advice on which Junior Suite to book and learned that the sole, large suite was also available. It was offered to me at a discount and I booked it at once. On arriving at 10AM, bleary-eyed from New York (this was our first stop on a two-week trip), we were greeted by a very gracious front desk staff, and then the concierge, who oriented us thoroughly and with self-effacing humor—there is no “attitude” here at all. Despite the fact that our room had been occupied and that the conventional check-in time is 3PM, we waited only briefly on the roof deck—beautiful in itself—while the staff rushed to prepare the suite, which was magnificent in all aspects, filled with light (despite our concerns about a lack of same in the Gothic Quarter) and featuring the most comfortable king bed we have ever slept in, and I’m not kidding. More on the Gothic Quarter: the location is ideal, about a half-hour walk to the beach but very close to the kind of “happenings” and attractions that give the city its flavor, e.g., an exuberant and friendly rally for Catalonian solidarity, and the famous music palace where we saw flamenco dancing (tickets obtained without problem through Classicist.com). The rest of our stay, including a fine breakfast, maintained the overall tone of relaxed, unpretentious luxury, which is exactly what one wants in a boutique hotel: no crowds, no trampling other guests (or being trampled) in dining queues, no long waits for elevators or services. The streets are quiet at night, the décor is in the best possible taste, incorporating gallery-quality modern art and a Roman wall into its colorful minimalism. Other guests appeared to us to be sophisticated and typically middle-aged or older, with some families, all in apparent appreciation of the generous, disciplined service. There was no ambient noise from other rooms, hallways or the streets, as mentioned. While cabs can come to the hotel’s front door, it seems best to do this only at the beginning and end of your trip when luggage might weigh you down, although even this is not necessary since it is a short walk if you turn off Via Laietana on to Carrer del Sotr by car, and then walk the fifty meters or so to the hotel via Baixada de Cacados, which is far simpler than it sounds. Add to all this the fact that they noticed, presumably from my wife’s passport, that it was her birthday on the day of our departure, and left some cake and champagne in our room by surprise the night before, a lovely touch. We will return as often as we can!",5,2015,06,28
15,Heaven Sent,"To find fault in this place would be a tough call. The hotel has ticked for me every box. It oozes class yet is not showy. The staff are charming and most delightful. The room we stayed in has a bed big enough for any American couple.

The roof top pool is in keeping with the boutique feel and as for the food we had on my partners birthday.....i would suggest you close your eyes and think of the best thing that has passed your lips and then think again.

I could go on but don't want to sound fake....just go there and take the tasting menu option and eat in for at least one evening......oh and have the in house Sangria......way better than the average 

Barcelona is a treat......the place is buzzing .....a few too many yanks for my liking but then you cant have everything",5,2015,06,27
15,Gem in the heart of Barcelona,"This hotel was a wonderful find. The staff was incredibly helpful and eager to help us enjoy our time in Barcelona. The staff even worked with us to help us check in early -that was greatly appreciated after a long flight. The taxi did have some trouble dropping us off, but that is more of the taxi driver's fault than the hotel's. I will stay again!",5,2015,06,26
15,Excellent hotel with wonderful staff,"We like the Mercer much better than the Arts (Ritz) Hotel where we stayed last week. Mercer is a boutique hotel Vs a convention style Ritz. The Mercer is only 4 stories w a roof top small pool. Sunbathing with such a urban rooftop view of Barcelona is really neat. Mercer is on an alleyway that's very quaint & in the middle of the Gothic Barrio which makes almost anything u want to do, walkable. The Arts Hotel is isolated on the waterfront and away from most everything yet not as isolated as the W! The staff here at the Mercer is so helpful, friendly and accommodating it makes ones stay so much more enjoyable.",5,2015,06,26
15,Amazing!!,"I have been to Barcelona for a business trip. I stayed only a few days but I really enjoyed the Mercel hotel. Great service, great meals. Staff was very kind and polite. I will be back in September for sure. :)",5,2015,06,25
15,Amazing,"Just arrived home from a short stay in Barcelona .. We stayed in the wonderful Mercer Hotel.
From the time we walked into the hotel till the time we left nothing was too much for this amazing hotel !!
We were met with a refreshing cold glass of cava to take to our room .. The helpful staff showed us around the amazing history of the hotel including a Roman wall in the library .. The hotel has a very chic boutique feel with history they have achived to make this hotel a wonderful place to stay. 
Our room was spacious modern with lots of added extras molten Brown essentials and free mini bar in the fridge .. 
The bed was extremely comfy in fact we over slept we enjoyed it too much. 
We had the pleasure of watching the festival of St Joan, housekeeping brought around two different cakes that are eaten at this festival with history of why they do .. A very nice touch. 
Roof top cocktail bar with a small but adequate pool and sunbeds. The staff here were extremely pleasant nothing too much trouble .. We had a lovely chicken ceaser salad here with a glass of cava.. 
We have stayed in a few hotels in Barcelona including the hotel Arts and W but I would choose this hotel over them .. Walking distance of everything and the quaint small lanes it is situated in makes this hotel even more interesting and special .. 
Thank you Mercer hotel and staff I hope to see you very soon .",5,2015,06,25
15,Charming historic gem,"I found this hotel through trip advisor and booked based on reviews. A few things to note:
1. This hotel is in the Gothic district which has very narrow roads and most cabs do not like to bring you to the front door. The entrance does not have a sign and even the local police didnt know where it was when we asked. The door is a very large smooth wood door with a silver modern handle. 
2. The reception held our bags with no problem since we arrived early. 
3. The rooms were large for Europe standards but the AC in room 103 was less than to be desired.
4. The lighting was very dim in all area but the bathroom was adequate. 
5. Breakfast buffet was enjoyable. There is a very good restaurant a few steps away called Arcano that I highly recommend. Service was better than we had anywhere in Europe and the food was wonderful!
The advertisements say it is 5 star, I wouldnt go so far to say that but it was an upscale 4",4,2015,06,23
15,Perfect boutique hotel,"As soon as my son and I walked into the Mercer we fell in love with the place... from the staff to the decoration everything was perfect.  We spent 3 nights at the Mercer and it was difficult to leave it... We felt spoilt and took great pleasure to enjoy the roof terrace, the bedroom or/and the different spaces on the ground floor. We ate at the cafe and the food was excellent. The only thing I would suggest is to have a nespresso machine or similar in the bedroom.... We would love to come back there.",5,2015,06,23
15,Magnificent hotel,"My oh my what a place! It's not often you come across a hotel like this chilled out oasis in a typical Gothic Quarter street near the Cathedral - so walkable to everywhere in that brilliant city.  A top class experience from start to finish and it started with a glass of chilled Cava in reception.

Staff exceptional, rooms excellent, breakfast superb but at extra cost. It's expensive but you get what you pay for here.  They even spray lovely smells around the hotel!
Rooftop pool and bar with sun loungers worth a visit.

It's very backstreet and taxi drivers struggle to find it so get the hotel to e-mail directions to hand to them.  It's worth seeking out.",5,2015,06,23
15,Great hotel in Wonderful Barcelona,"Enjoyed our stay at the Mercer, staff where helpful the room 309 was modern clean and has everything you require. 
Situated in the Gothic Quater it is very central with Restaurants and Cafes near by and plenty of shopping.
I only have one criticism we ordered coffee from Room Service every morning for the 3 days we stayed and it was never hot always warm, a little annoying because I enjoy a coffee first thing in the morning, I did mention this to the receptionist on checking out and they apologised.",4,2015,06,18
15,"So charming , beautiful and chic !","I'm a pretty picky hotel stayer , ( especially being from Miami beach and living in nyc) and this place made me very comfortable . The rooms are incredibly clean , the products they use for the bathrooms are Molton brown , and it's very quiet . There was a small incident where children came our last night and it was noisy upstairs, but the manager took care of it right away and even gave my husband and I a second room option if we couldn't sleep that night . He even double checked on us to make sure we were ok . Breakfast was wonderful -our waiter was so kind and attentive , the cafe connected to the hotel was so yummy as well . The gothic corner is much more authentic than staying at for example the majestic . The narrow streets and cute cafes really make you feel like your in Spain . I definitely would stay here again .",5,2015,06,18
15,Beautiful gem in the Gothic quarter of Barcelona,My wife and I stayed at the Mercer Hotel for 3 nights in June. This gem of a hotel is hidden within the meandering lanes of the gothic quarter of Barcelona. Upon arrival we were offered a glass of Cava and immediately felt at home. Our room was lovely and very quiet & comfortable. The concierge and tour guides were great in helping us with dinner & tapas recommendations. Highly recommend Café de L'Académia which is a 1 minute walk from the hotel. The location of the Mercer Hotel is ideal. Close to las Ramblas & walking distance to hop on hop off bus stops. Will definitely stay here again.,5,2015,06,18
15,Perfect,"Absolutely loved the mercer hotel. Hidden within the narrow atmospheric lanes of the gothic quarter we were delighted with the hotel from the first moment . Having deliberated over which hotel to choose in Barcelona we made a great choice. Warm welcome from the knowledgable concierge fabulous, intimate rood terrace with small pool but comfortable sun beds and wonderful food.
Great tapas bar/cave and a excellent fine dining restaurant. Loved the mix of modern interiors with tall glass doors and architecturally fabulous with the original walls retained to create a modern but cosy environment 
Would return in a heartbeat",5,2015,06,16
15,Junior suite upgrade and cava delivery,"My husband and I stayed 3 nights in May, 2015, and of all the luxury hotels we stayed in over a course of 10 days in Spain, this was by far the best. Upon arrival, we were offered a sparkling glass of cava, and because it was our anniversary, we were upgraded to the Junior Suite! We were given a nice tour of the hotel, including a viewing of the Roman walls inside the property. The Junior Suite was incredibly spacious, and we appreciated the complimentary mini bar full of cold beverages that was stocked daily -- it was just a nice thoughtful touch to the room. I also enjoyed the huge bathtub complete with soaking bath salts and a pillow. On our first night, the hotel manager brought us up a bottle of complimentary cava on ice and chocolates and macarons. The concierge was great helping us with dinner recommendations and reservations (HIGHLY recommend Sensi Bistro!). The location of the hotel is great, too. Highly recommend.",5,2015,06,12
15,a gem in the gothico,"The hotel location is incredible, and we were afraid it would be noisy, but couldn't hear a single noise all night long.

Rooms were flawless. I'm a maniac of towels and were probably the fluffiest ever seen.

for a bonus, the building is over some old ruins and makes it more unique. 

To name one downside, it's a bit pricey but sometimes if you want quality you need to pay for it",5,2015,06,10
15,If the walls of the Mercer Hotel could talk,"...you would be able to listen to stories dating back thousand of years. This hotel is a hidden gem located in the narrow streets of the Barri Gotic with an amazing combination of the walls from the old town and today's architecture. The service and attention from the very kind staff from the minute you arrive is the best I have ever experienced and I have to compliment the management for having such a uniform team. However, even if you are the best there is always room for improvement, so here is some food for thought for the management. One morning the breakfast serving was very slow and it was my impression that they were short of staff that day, but irrespective of that the managers that stood around did not participate in serving the food or clearing the tables. When it comes to the rooms I would recommend a different floor in the shower cabin instead of the loose and noisy wooden floor that is used today - and please change the toilet seats to a more narrow model. I look forward to the see the improvements next time when I check in to the hidden gem = Mercer Hotel",5,2015,06,09
15,Incredible experience,"We loved this hotel.  It is a unique property on a small narrow street in the Gotic quarter.  It was developed from an old house, but they kept many of the original details like the old Roman wall, which is a part of the main floor. It is incredibly charming and just a perfect spot from which to explore Barcelona. It is very convenient to most of the sites of Barcelona.  The rooms are wonderful, very well appointed with lots of wonderful features. We upgraded from a Deluxe room to a Jr. Suite because we wanted a little bit more room  and also had a wonderful balcony.  Thanks to Gloria, one of the managers, who assisted in making this happen.  All the  staff was just wonderful.  The concierges, whose names i have forgotten, took wonderful care of us and assisted us with tickets to various attractions and also made restaurant recommendations, which were fantastic, and not the usual touristy places.  It may be a little pricey, but it will be worth every nickel.",5,2015,06,08
15,amazing,"imagine a perfect place in the romantic center of old ancient (gothic) city of barcelona. this is the mercer hotel barcelona. 

staff? excellent! interior? amazing combination of modern and old architecture. and so one... simply one of the best hotel i have ever been in. 

few minor minus O:-)... :
(1) breakfast a la carte (i realy prefer buffet, but .. you can also go to one of closest cafes..)
(2) taxi (generally in barcelona) .. maybe i just didnt met the right guys.. :)
",5,2015,06,08
15,One of the Best in Barcelona,"We just spent five days at this hotel, and had a wonderful experience.  With only 28 rooms it is intimate, but very well equipped.  The room was hip, comfortable and well equipped. The staff is professional and very attentive, and the breakfast is wonderful.  It is in a lovely section of the old city, with a great location to walk around.  Note that many of the other top-rated hotels like the W are at the beach, and a much longer walk to the old section of town,  Very highly recommended!

One caution unrelated to the hotel......believe them when they warn you about pickpockets in Barcelona.  I was accosted by two men and had my watch stolen.",5,2015,06,08
15,Most comfortable bed I have EVER slept in!,"A gem of a hotel in the old part of town. Small, very quiet, almost inaccessible (very narrow street - consequently hardly any traffic) and strategically placed for wandering near and far. Only downside is that that they could not prepare omelet or scrambled eggs no matter how often they tried! Always came out runny! 
The bed was simply out of this world. The most comfortable sheets and mattress I have ever tried! Concierge was extremely helpful - his advice avoided a 3 hour line up at the Gaudi Cathedral by buying tickets on line.
Beautiful city - should have spent much more time there. Hotel much recommended.",4,2015,06,05
15,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful service.","A beautiful, ancient stone meets cutting-edge-modern building situated in the shady lanes of the ancient quarter.
We chose this hotel as it was conveniently located for us to explore many of Barcelona's attractions on foot and also for its fantastic sunny roof terrace to relax in with a glass of something cold and sparkling after each great day.
The staff could not have been more helpful, booking tickets, recommending excellent restaurants, enquiring after our day. We also dined in the hotel's own restaurant for my husband's 50th birthday and had a lot of fun with the staff, a delicious tasting menu with matched wines. Nothing was too much trouble, they accommodated my severe food allergy and even provided a birthday cupcake, very sweet, thank you!

Tiny gripes: the slatted, sliding shower base is a strange choice. Our room was beautifully designed, spotlessly clean but a little small and the shutters were so dark we found it a little disorientating (but we have a very light room at home, so I guess it's down to personal preference.)

Finally, we had a lovely trip to Barcelona, it's a vibrant yet chilled city with the most delicious food. I would thoroughly recommend The Mercer, it was the icing on my husband's 50th birthday cake!",5,2015,06,05
15,Great Boutique hotel,We enjoyed a great stay at the Mercer. The location was fantastic for exploring the Gothic Quarter and El Born. Lots of great restaurants within walking distance. Excellent breakfast. Concierge very helpful. Will definitely stay again the next time we are in Barcelona.,5,2015,06,04
15,Heaven on Earth!,"I have never written a review before, but i am compelled to do so for the Mercer.
I have been lucky to travel the world for business and pleasure, and have never encountered a hotel that possessed the rare combination of beauty, serenity, comfort, and service that the Mercer does.  First, the position in the Gothic Quarter was perfect.  Charming and quiet! The hotel was lovingly built over the course of 7 years, keeping in tact the original roman walls that were uncovered there, and is beautifully integrated into the entire structure. The combination of one of the most stunningly designed and comfortable spaces is beyond compare. My room (suite 108) was magical.  And the service.  It's not just that everyone who i encountered was helpful, insightful, and genuinely kind.
They made me feel like i was part of their family.  I have never experienced this combination of glorious surroundings
 comfort, and care.  The Mercer is a rare and special place. I must convey my sincere thanks and gratitude to the entire staff. Who ever is responsible for this magnificent gem of a hotel should be applauded.  I will be telling everyone i know about the Mercer.  If you are searching for the finest small hotel in Barcelona, look no further than the Mercer. Thank you once again to Juan, Florencia, Ricardo, Jordi, Gloria, Nelly
and the rest of the wonderful staff for taking such good care of me.  I miss you and the Mercer already! 
With much admiration and thanks for a beautiful stay, my kindest regards to you all.  Roseanne Horn

15,One of the best high-end hotels we have stayed at.,"Great location, helpful staff in general it is a very chic boutique hotel. I think this could be compared to the Delano in Miami. The location is more exotic than some of the major hotels in Barcelona.",5,2015,06,02
15,"Great staff, excellent location, great concierge recommendations!","Wonderful hotel tucked away in a fantastic location in the gothic quarter.  Concierge Ricard, Joan Manuel and Florencia were welcoming, kind, informative and attentive. Just fantastic! Very clean hotel, small and intimate. Wonderful rooftop lounge with pool ideal for taking a quick break . The restaurant recommendations were spot on. Concierge also arranged the purchase of futbol tickets to see FCB; great seats!  Will be back.",5,2015,05,31
15,Perfection,"I had such a great stay, from the location, to the food and service. The architecture is modern, but the hotel itself is built into the old city wall, so the whole look and atmosphere is really cool. Our room was very nice and comfortable, but simple, clean, and modern. There was no fussy decor or unnecessary amenities. The service was also very good, and the food in the restaurant was very authentic and delicious. I haven't been there since the summer of '13, but I was reminded of it, and had to write about how great it was. It was like a luxury chain at a small scale. I would suggest it to anybody, and I think it is one of the best city hotels I have ever been to.",5,2015,05,30
15,Wonderful hotel; excellent location; great staff.,"We had a perfect stay at the Mercer Barcelona. Arriving straight from the airport at 8 a.m., we were immediately ushered into a private place to change and regroup, our bags were secured, and our valuables locked up. The concierge inquired about our plans and thoughtfully helped us book tickets for an empty spot in our day to visit Gaudi's Sagrada Familia.  We were texted the moment out room was ready (early).
The location is great; we loved being in the center of the Gothic Quarter.  The staff was helpful, sincere and friendly -- among the very nicest that I've encountered in many years of travel.  They were very knowledgeable, interested and really guided us to fully enjoy Barcelona. Nice courtyard for breakfast and rooftop deck, too.  Loved it!",5,2015,05,29
15,"A warm a welcoming staff, perfect accomodations, ideal location!","My wife and I stayed at the Mercer for eight (8) days celebrating our anniversary and exploring Barcelona. A big thanks to Juan-Manuel, Richard, Teresa, Jimena, Susanna and to anyone else I didn't mention in this review. The hotel is immaculate, perfectly located, and the staff made our stay a true oasis and for a beautiful anniversary.

Everyone went well above and beyond in helping us navigate our way around Barcelona and was always sincere and welcoming whether we were returning from exploring the area or simply enjoying the amenities offered at the hotel.

Simply a great experience...we will certainly be back!",5,2015,05,29
15,Beautiful hotel and great location for Gothic Quarter,"Clean, nice size room and bathroom, private toilet.  First floor had a ""Living Wall"" with nesting bird.
Did not have breakfast (pricey) went three doors down for and nice traditional breakfast.
Outstanding service from all staff.",5,2015,05,27
15,You are stupid if you do not book this hotel.,"Do not waste time researching other hotels in Barcelona. This is not a big, brash hotel packed with screaming tourists. A big plus. If this hotel was for sale I would sell my kids to raise the finances to buy it. My wife and I loved this hotel. It beats all other purported ""5 star"" hotels in Europe. We have stayed at the Waldorf Astoria, Four Seasons, and other 5 star hotels in Europe, but this modern little hotel crushes them all in my travelled opinion. 
This is the way a boutique hotel should operate: friendly, fast, professional, with razor sharp staff. And the food is not mass-produced trash that the other hotels chains throw at you. 
You cannot beat the staff at this hotel. The reception staff and concierge are light years ahead of the other so called 5 star hotels. They will make you feel like a million bucks with their service. I challenge anyone to find a better concierge when it comes to explaining a map, locations or directions.
The location is brilliant. You can walk for hours and get happily lost in this section of town. 
The rooms are super clean and well designed. The bathrooms are contemporary with good space. The shower floor (wooden slats) is a challenge as it keeps moving. Interesting concept. I did not mind this. The linen, pillows and mattress are on par with the best hotels around. Trust me, we've been around. 
The food in this hotel is very good. Well done to the chef and staff on always going the extra mile, and making the best omelette and coffee in town. I seriously enjoyed the fact that the bacon and eggs was not a buffet (thank goodness). This is something that reveals the quality of the chef and kitchen staff in my opinion.
The little restaurant adjoining the hotel (Le Bouchon) has excellent tappas if you don't feel like looking for a restaurant. No need to worry about finding decent restaurants. They are all close to this hotel. You cannot go wrong.
If you like a boutique hotel that knows what the word ""service"" means in this day and age, then stop looking around and book this hotel.",5,2015,05,27
15,One of the best small Hotels in Europe,"We just spent two nights at the Mercer. It was a real find--well located in the heart of the Gothic Quarter,comfortable with a large room and very helpful staff.  Could not ask for better.  We would certainly stay here again",5,2015,05,26
15,Loved our stay at the Mercer,"Stayed 2 wondeful nights at Mercer prior to a cruise.  Highly recommend.  Our room was beautiful with full size wall- window that opened to an enclosed courtyard with green plants on wall which  allowed light and fresh air.  Very quiet. .Bed was very comfortable and amenities were modern .  

Only issue (not hotels fault) was taxi dropped us 5 blocks away.  I gave cab driver printed instructions from hotel on how to get to hotel, but he obviously didnt care.  A cab easily came to the hotel to drive us to the port.  Loved the Barri Gothic neighborhood . (We walked with our luggage at 11:30pm and did not feel unsafe. ) 

Staff was welcoming and so very nice.",5,2015,05,26
15,So lovely!,"The reviews are spot on!  We used the Mercer as our home base during a trip to watch the Spanish Grand Prix.  This is such a beautiful hotel with first-class service.  We had a junior suite room overlooking the courtyard.  It had a balcony, modern furnishings and a fabulous shower. 

But the most impressive thing we witnessed was one of the concierges giving a visually-impaired guest a tour of the lobby/reception area.  He described every piece of art, guided the guest to each piece of furniture and took his time doing it. They joked and laughed about some of the art pieces and I could tell the guest felt very welcomed.  

We had breakfast in the dining room every morning.  If I could have fruit like that brought to my kitchen table every day, I'd be much healthier!  

The location is perfect!  The metro stop is 1 block from the hotel -- it's super easy to use and so clean, efficient and inexpensive.  But if you need taxis, restaurant reservations, etc., the concierge desk is very responsive and does everything with a smile.  Can't wait to return!",5,2015,05,26
15,Great hotel! We'd stay here again.,"We really wanted to give the Mercer 5 stars, but there were a couple things.

Good stuff: Concierges are awesome. Entire staff is friendly and helpful. The room was large (we were given a free upgrade to a junior suite). The location was perfect for us; tons of restaurants and other stuff in the area. Five minute walk to the Picasso Museum. Roof top deck with small pool. Complimentary water and soft drinks (which is really something because we didn't go to a single restaurant in Spain that had water for free). Giant soaking tub. Lots of other elements made it very nice.

Stuff that wasn't as good, two small and one larger:

1. Small thing: Shower floor was made of slats that were slippery and they moved a little relative to each other. My wife slipped, but thankfully didn't fall. 

2. Small thing: The room was dark. You couldn't really get it bright (which was romantic at times, but sometimes you want it bright).

3. Larger thing: We went to a soccer match at Power 8 Stadium. The concierges recommended we take a taxi there and back. Getting there was a breeze. Unfortunately, there were no taxis at the stadium after the game (none, zero, nada). We didn't have cell phone service to call a taxi. So we had to find our way to the metro on our own which ended up being at least a 20 minute walk through neighborhoods, and required us to ask help from 8-9 different people. Once at the metro we had to take 3 trains to get home. 

3A disclaimer: I'm certain the concierges believed we could get a taxi. I don't think they were lackidaisical, it was a simple mistake. It just got firmly planted in our minds because it such an adventure.

Bottom line: We would definitely stay there again, and recommend it to our friends.",4,2015,05,24
15,good,"I decided to take a chance based partly on the reviews from this site. We were so pleased upon arrival! The location was outstanding, room extremely comforable and cozy, staff so nice, and general feeling in the hotel very, very comfortable. My only concern is the same as another reviewer on this site, and that is the time beverages and snacks actually cost something as opposed to being 'free'. My wife and I were very confused as well, and the hotel should address this. Otherwise, this was a perfect stay in a wonderful city! I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone!!",4,2015,05,24
15,ULTRA MODERN HOTEL IN GOTHIC QUARTER,"So pleased I'd read reviewers suggestions of printing a map to give to the cab driver as he didn't know where to go! Even with the use of the map, he dropped us at the uphill end of the narrow lane where The Mercer is situated. He could have driven in at the other end outside the main entrance saving us struggling with our luggage up this very steep slope. 
However, once settled we so enjoyed our 6 nights. Our room was unique in that we had a living wall of plants as a view. As a bonus there was a bird's nest on the wall and we enjoyed seeing the birds feeding the chicks. 
The room was very quiet and we enjoyed the rooftop garden, bar and pool even though the latter is very small.
Only tiny complaint was when my husband ordered the scrambled eggs on toast for breakfast, it was a very small portion of scrambled eggs and the toast consisted of two tiny crusts!
All in all though, a really lovely stay.",5,2015,05,24
15,"Nice hotel, friendly service","I recently stayed at the Mercer in Barcelona. Its clean, secluded in the Gothic neighborhood -- a nice hidden spot. I ended up having to switch rooms because of availability during my stay and I actually preferred the deluxe room to the junior suite, which was more expensive, because I was sharing a room and there was zero privacy in the junior. The free breakfast that is included is good too. The staff is very accommodating as well. Its there Mercer, so it's a bit minimalist. ",4,2015,05,23
15,Absolute perfection,"A truly wonderful hotel in the heart of Barcelona. It is hard to find fault - our only problem was that the technology and design is so impressive that we has to seek assistance to use things like the shower, the airconditioning and the telephone. But it didn't matter as the rooms are fabulous, the service impeccable, the staff friendly and helpful. Outstanding!",5,2015,05,20
15,A Great Choice,"We stayed at the Mercer for 3 nights to begin our 10 day stay in Spain visiting our daughter who is studying in Barcelona. From the moment we arrived for our 3 night stay, the staff was extremely accomodating and inviting. The room was great and in the 3 days that we were there did not hear a sound outside our room. The breakfast is a must and I highly recommend this hotel!!",5,2015,05,18
15,Fabulous weekend,"We stayed here for 4 nights and had a truly great experience. Friendly staff, free upgrade to a junior suite (a beautiful room with a complementary mini bar) with a lovely view into the inner courtyard. The breakfast was nicely served by very polite staff and included a complementary newspaper. The rooftop terrace was a real bonus from where it was a pleasure to indulge in tapas and sangria!! 
A first class hotel equally matched by the first class staff and a superb location.",5,2015,05,18
15,A TripAdvisor winner,"We stayed at Mercer Hotel for our 3 days in Barcelona, largely because of the TripAdvisor reviews.  We would like to add our recommendation.  The hotel is located in the very heart of the old city but on a very quiet little street.  We walked easily to shopping areas and attractions, and took the subway from the stop at the corner to further places in the city.  The staff was excellent, and everyone spoke perfect English while helping us with reservations, tickets and suggestions.",5,2015,05,16
15,Lovely and friendly,"Stayed here for a long weekend,we were met with champagne and very friendly staff.We were made to feel very welcome and felt like we had known the staff for years.We had lots of laughs and they were very helpful with anything we asked them.Will definitely be coming back here again and again.Thank you for making us feel so at home ",5,2015,05,14
15,Boutique Perfection in the Gothic Quarter!,"My daughter and I absolutely loved this little gem of a boutique hotel nestled in a narrow street in Barcelona's Gothic Quarter. Our room was very nice, quiet and quite dark with its custom shutters. We didn't fully appreciate the size of the room until we realized that EVERYTHING in the gothic quarter is tiny and every space is maximized to its full potential. I would have preferred frosted glass doors on the shower as it is open to the room, but it was clean and very comfortable with every desired amenity. The staff at the Mercer is its greatest recommendation - they make you feel like they truly care about your Barcelona vacation. We felt that Richard, our concierge, was completely invested in the time we had - he gave us wonderful restaurant recommendations and then wanted our reviews after we dined out. He helped us locate the souvenir items family back home had requested and booked flamenco and La Sagrada Tickets for us. He was absolutely adorable - friendly and funny and so helpful - we were sad when we got to Madrid and didn't have the benefit of his expertise! The doormen and DR staff were also wonderful; this hotel could feel snooty and pretentious, but the staff maintain an extremely pleasant and relaxed vibe. Breakfast was delicious; we didn't use the pool, but would have if it was a hot summertime visit. We highly recommend this hotel and would absolutely return.",5,2015,05,13
15,A jewel,"First time in Barcelona and we're lucky to pick the Mercer. Outstanding boutique hotel in the heart of the gothic district. Such a great location that we spend two days just exploring the immediate environs. The cathedral, Picasso museum, Las Rambles all within easy walking distance.

A little oasis of a roof garden to retreat to when the feed finally give out and the most delicious tapas bar right in the hotel. Staff could not be friendlier or more helpful.

Can't recommend it highly enough - even had famous pop icon staying for bonus points.

15,"""Chic, Unique, and Fanatastique""",This hidden gem located in the most architecturally stunning cobble stone lane is a work of art in itself. We were greeted by a friendly professional staff that offered us a glass of Cava upon arrival and could not have been more welcoming after a long travel day. The hotel room is impeccably clean and the appointments look like something out of architectural digest. We were absolutely thrilled with the Frette sheets and the comfortable bed. We felt like we were at home. I'm in love and could not wait until I was home to review.... Tonight we have reservations at the Mercer restaurant so stay tuned for tomorrow's restaurant review....,5,2015,05,08
15,A special oasis staffed by very special people,"There are a myriad of reasons for visiting a wonderful city like Barcelona.  My partner and I were celebrating an anniversary of our loving relationship and had the good fortune to discover the Mercer Hotel.

This special oasis is tucked away in the heart of the old city where the owners have worked with sympathetic architects and the city authorities to combine historic structures with modern features to create an accommodation facility with a distinctive ambience that elegantly reflects the surrounding streets and current fashion.

And while the structure and facilities succeed in meeting the needs of demanding travellers, it is the people of the hotel that make it truly special.  Our first encounter was with a porter who came down the street to help us with our bags.  He set the standard for the rest of the front of house staff we met during our four day stay – without exception, they were friendly, helpful and professional.

As for the food and beverage facilities, we used the tapas bar, the lounges and the restaurant and can recommend them.  The catering and waiting staff in the restaurant deserve special mention.  Not only is the food (and drink) of a high standard, it is also served by people who are knowledgeable, caring and responsive to individual requests.

The Mercer is a special place that was a joy to experience and we will definitely return.

Patrick Lennon, May 2015",5,2015,05,07
15,Great place to stay in Barcelona,"The Mercer is wonderfully located in the Barri Gotic neighborhood, quiet but close to Las Ramblas. We appreciated how helpful and knowledgable the staff was, not to mention the hotel's cleanliness. The architecture is a blend of old and modern, and the rooms are efficient and easy to use. Our bathroom gleamed. We were at first surprised that our room looked out on a ""garden"" wall,  but we quickly realized that sound of the water trickling down the wall was relaxing, and the ""view"" was part of the charm. Don't forget to spend time on the room, which has a view and is a lovely place to take a break or picnic.",4,2015,05,07
15,One of the Best,"Beautiful hotel , great location right in the centre of Barcelona.Nice cocktail bar and to top it all off the perfect night sleep.The concierge was a great help recommending all the places to see and eat .All the the staff were so friendly and professional.",5,2015,05,05
15,Great,Many times I visited Barcelona and lived there as a student but never in a world class hotel like this one-the staff the rooms and what a great location: will definitely go back on my next visit - one of the greatest hotel in Europe! Enhorabuena! ,5,2015,05,05
15,Gorgeous elegant hotel,"This is a lovely boutique hotel in what was a 15th century building the Gothic Quarter. The renovation, design and  and decor are really beautifully done. Rooms are modern, comfortable, luxurious. The experience of staying there was magical. Service was professional, cordial and outstanding. The location is convenient to most landmarks in the old city. If you arrive by taxi, make sure it is not a van or larger model car - navigating the narrow streets is a challenge and o'm pretty sure larger cars can't get all the way to the hotel.",5,2015,05,02
15,Incredible staff and lovely hotel,"First of all, I never write reviews of hotels and I have traveled extensively all over the world. I traveled to Barcelona with my boyfriend and from the minute we arrived to the moment we checked out, it was a 5-star experience. We were upgraded upon arrival and served fresh-squeezed Valenciana orange juice. The concierge service was off the hook - their restaurant recommendations, guided tours and venue suggestions were all phenomenal. The breakfasts and coffee here were amazing, and every single staff member remembered the smallest details of our preferences. This gorgeous hotel features old Roman antiquities but with a modern flair. And its location in a quiet small street in the Gothic Quarter was the perfect spot for us, within walking distance to many special venues but still secluded and special. They have THE most comfortable beds to rest after a long day of activities. After traveling to Girona we decided to cancel our hotel reservations we had booked prior to our stay at a different hotel in order to come back to the Mercer. We will be back! -Anna + Mike",5,2015,05,02
15,Great location and staff and the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in!,"I am handicapped and have special needs and the remarkable staff at the Mercer Hotel made everything work smoothly, including the pick-up at the Barcelona train station.  The handicapped bathroom was outstanding with grab bars and a great shower.  But the bed was a dream!  I wanted to buy one and discussed it with the concierge, but the beds are made especially for them, and are not available (boo hoo!).  Hotels are for sleeping, and the sleeping was quiet and comfortable at this centrally located hotel.",5,2015,05,01
15,A lovely hotel in a lovely part of the city,"This really is a super hotel.  Very interesting architecture which incorporates parts of the original town wall.  

We were welcomed with a nice glass of cava and shown to our very lovely room.  Spacious, extremely stylish and very well appointed.  Top quality everything including masses of luxurious Molton Brown goodies.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the shutters kept out the light for a good night's sleep.

The staff were lovely and keen to help and the hotel location is brilliant.  It is in the lovely gothic quarter and surrounded by amazing old architecture.  There are also great little restaurants within a stone's throw which serve lovely coffee and pastries, tapas, whatever you want.  See my other Barcelona reviews.

The hotel also has a lovely cocktail bar and tapas restaurant, as well as its fine dining Mercer Restaurant and its roof terrace.  I have a separate review for the tapas bar.  We did not have breakfast at the hotel as we were room only but found any number of local cafes to have a croissant.

The cocktail bar is small but has a great range of drinks.  Only caution is that while I am used to paying high prices €24 did seem a bit steep for a (very nice) gin and tonic.  However on the plus side my husband drank very lovely fine wines at under €7 a glass.  

We did not go to the restaurant so I have not reviewed it separately.  We did book but when looking at the menu the night before found there to be little choice for non meat eaters.  The Spanish do like to add a bit of foie gras to their fish dishes which while I am sure is delicious is not something I would like to eat.  We asked for the vegetarian menu we were told that there was not one but they would be able to provide something suitable. I am sure it would be delicious but if I am paying in excess of €30 for a main I would expect something designed and perfected rather than something rustled up on the night and there were so many fantastic places to eat locally at very reasonable prices we decided to give it a miss.  

The roof terrace is very pretty with lovely herbs and flowers growing. It comfortable and has a bar so a nice place to sit in the sun.  There is a pool but it is very small - however I am sure on an overheated day it will be very welcoming. 

Other than that I can highly recommend this lovely hotel as a base for exploring this welcoming city.  It is not cheap but it is very comfortable and luxurious.",5,2015,05,01
15,Barri Gotic gem,"This was our first weekend break in Barcelona and as we wanted to stay somewhere central with character and a bit of luxury. The Mercer appeared to tick all the boxes and the actual experience exceeded our expectations. 

This boutique hotel is located on the edge of the Barri Gotic quarter with it's entrance off a narrow winding street - be aware that some taxi drivers prefer not to drive down this but, if so, it's no more than a 50m walk. There's no similar problem if the hotel calls a taxi when you leave. 

The location is perfect for exploring the meandering streets and soaking up the atmospheric Gothic quarter, especially early and late in the day without the inevitable large tour groups. With bars and restaurants a plenty you're spoiled for choice when it comes to eating and drinking.  Many of Barcelona's highlights (e.g. La Rambla, The Cathedral, Port Vell) are all within easy walking distance and for those sites further afield (e.g. Sagrada Familia, Park Guell) the nearest metro station (Jaume I) is conveniently close to the hotel. An unexpected bonus was that the short distance from busier streets meant that inside the hotel it was very quiet and many of the bedrooms face out on to small internal courtyards. We were able to have our window open at night without any of the usual city noise. 

Our welcome at the hotel, including a glass of cava, was warm and friendly. The staff at the Mercer exude an air of friendly calm and throughout our stay service was always excellent with a lovely personal touch  
 
Overall, the reception, lobby and bar areas on the ground floor are tranquil and spacious. The 28 bedrooms are arranged across three floors with a rooftop terrace above them which has a small pool area, ideal for a drink and a view across the Gothic rooftops. Our deluxe bedroom was large, from the superking bed through to the freestanding bath and the separate shower cubicle. The muted, luxurious modern furnishings sat well with the character afforded by the high ceilings and the part exposed brickwork. There is a complementary soft drinks mini bar and the top up of this, the Molton Brown toiletries and the changing of sheets and towels is generous. A quality room which was well serviced.       

We ate one night in the main restaurant (open also to the public) and with a choice of a tasting menu, a seasonal set menu and a la carte plus extensive local wine list the Mercer provides a true gastronomic experience if you're looking for it. The seasonal menu was superb, the tables well appointed/lit and the service friendly. We also enjoyed a complementary tapas in the separate Le Bouchon bar.

For us this was a Barri Gotic gem of a choice in the beautiful city of Barcelona. 

P.S. It was our wedding anniversary and a thank you to the hotel team for sprinkling rose petals on the bed and for our bottle of cava.",5,2015,04,30
15,Perfect getaway,"Yes, it's a bit tricky to find, but well worth it.  The location is right in the Gothic quarter, but still quiet.  2 metro lines within a few minutes walk.  The staff was amazing from start to finish.  They even surprised us with a bottle of Cava in our room on my husband's birthday.  The restaurant is superb - both for dinner and breakfast.  For breakfast, I recommend the Mercer breakfast - breads, pastries and eggs (best eggs Benedict I've ever had).  Everything from start to finish either met or exceeded our (very high) expectations.  It's truly an experience!",5,2015,04,28
15,Perfect stay,Just returned from Barcelona and had a perfect stay at the Mercer. We love the location surrounded by tapa bars and small stores and within walking distance of the Picasso Museum and all our other favorite sights. The service was 5 star +!  Just as good as it gets! We look forward to coming back. Best pillows and complimentary mini bar too!,5,2015,04,28
15,"Amazing hotel, an island of tranquility in busy Barcelona","I recently spent 4 days at the Mercer.  This hotel is simply fabulous and worth every penny.  It is in an historic building with the original ancient walls preserved in many places, paired with modern minimalist decor.  The result is an island of grace and tranquility in the midst of a busy city.  

The hotel is beautiful and luxurious but the staff is what makes it spectacular.  Everyone employed by the hotel from concierge to the hotel maid staff is friendly and so helpful.  The breakfasts are delicious, the service impeccable and the concierge service the best I have ever encountered at any hotel.  

The staff had delicious gluten free breads for me from the minute I arrived at the hotel in response to my notifying them that I had celiac disease and had to eat gluten free.  Now that's service!  My meal at Cafe Mercer was also made gluten free for me without my even asking.  

The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, the room was huge (room 205) and the bathroom even larger with a great walk in shower. Items in the in-room mini-bar were complimentary.  I'm sure I paid for them in the cost of the room, but it was so nice not to be nickel and dimed by a hotel and treated like an honored guest for a change.   I will definitely return to this wonderful hotel.",5,2015,04,24
15,Exceptional Service from Staff,"Richard Cusco, a concierge at the Mercer Hotel, arranged traveler assistance for my clients who are arriving in Barcelona by train from France. Because of difficulty in walking, Richard went the extra mile to coordinate a wheelchair in Avignon and again on the train platform when my client arrives in Barcelona. He called me in the U.S. to confirm the details. Everyone I have worked with at Hotel Mercer has been equally efficient and fluent in English which makes communication so pleasant. I will recommend the Mercer Hotel to all my clients staying in Barcelona. What a pleasure to work with such caring and friendly people. Thank you to the staff at the Mercer Hotel!",5,2015,04,24
15,Luxurious and right in the spot,"This is not a standard hotel, it is one of the best ones. We wanted to treat us a little bit because this was the end of our trip and we could not have been more right!

We don't think it deserves 5 stars because the staff were a bit unfriendly, but nothing too serious.",4,2015,04,24
15,Luxurious w Personal touches,"one of my wife and i's favorite hotels in world. We frequent Fairmont, Ritz Carlton and other fancy hotels. This was still one of our favorites. Very nice bathroom amenities plus fresh cookies at turn down service",5,2015,04,18
15,Best hotel experience of my life,"Starting with the hotel staff greeting us when we arrived, and through our entire stay, this was the closest thing to perfection in a hotel that I've ever seen,  or hope to see. The room was beautiful, the bed was superbly comfortable, and it was SILENT and completely dark at night. As soon as we arrived we were treated to cava and tapas at the excellent bar at the front of the hotel, and later had a fantastic dinner at the superb hotel restaurant - wonderful molecular gastronomy, gorgeous and creative presentation of delicious dishes.
The feeling of the hotel is sophisticated and hip, yet understated, with art and decor that's just unusual enough to feel refreshing, without seeming overbearing or self-consciously quirky. And, although it has modern art on the walls, the decor also beautifully highlights the Roman wall and 15th-century palace that make up part of it. The location is easy to get to, with a Metro stop only a 5-minute walk away, and the Gothic quarter is a gorgeous and romantic dream. The staff was unfailingly friendly, welcoming, and helpful--every single person that we encountered, from general manager on down.
When we return to Barcelona (and we definitely will--wonderful city), we will stay here again, absolutely. After this, I wouldn't even consider another hotel in the area.",5,2015,04,17
15,The very best,"We recently stayed for a week at the Mercer Hotel. We have stayed in some fantastic places over the years, but I'm not exaggerating when I say that The Mercer is the best hotel stay ever. Everything about the stay was superb. All staff members are gracious, highly competent, friendly and a joy to interact with, from starting with the online reservation and continuing throughout our stay. We were welcomed with a glass of cava and upgraded to a Deluxe room facing the courtyard. If you want a good night's sleep, this is your ticket to paradise: the most comfortable kingsize bed ever and dark shutters letting no light in and wonderful silence. Fantastic. The room is beautiful and large and has a balcony. And chocolates every evening for turn-down service - what's not to love? The location on a smaller street in the Gothic Quarter is perfect - easy access to many things, yet not as busy as much of the area. 

We ate at the hotel restaurant once - to be reviewed separately. It was one of the best meals during our stay among many great meals. Well deserving of a Michelin star, which I hope they get soon. 

The concierge helped us get reservations at several superb restaurants on this foodie vacation. 

I wouldn't consider staying any other place when going to Barcelona and it's one of the reasons I can't wait to go back to this fine city. Mercer: you're the top. Best of luck to everyone there, and thanks again for a superb stay!",5,2015,04,14
15,Super hotel,"We recently visited this hotel and stayed for 2 nights after reading the reviews on here, it was worth every penny spent, pure quality in the heart of Barcelona gothic quarter.

We loved every minute and every part of our stay here. Classy, perfect blend between old and new, lovely fusion everywhere with first class service to match.
The only thing that 'Shocked' us, i think is the word is that when we checked out we were actually 'more or less' asked for a tip and to enter the amount on the bill !
This matter has been rectified now as we mentioned this to the guest relations manager who delft with this very professionally, so enough said!

If ever visiting Barcelona again, we would stay here, for sure.",5,2015,04,12
15,Very personal,"Lovely room ,great service,quiet and classy. We stayed here a as a family of four .we couldn't request more .we ate in sensi bistro round corner .again lovely .went on Segway tour again round corner. Roof top secluded and friendly .",5,2015,04,11
15,Must visit if you can!,Very luxury boutique hotel. Service was impeccable from the moment you walked through the door  couldn't fault our stay. included breakfast was lovely with choice of continental.options and hot food. Located in the best part of barcelona in the gothic quarter with lot s of.nice restaurants on your doorstep (sensi bistros in particular) . Would highly recommend.,5,2015,04,11
15,Outstanding,"Staff were fantastic, hotel deco is superb, location is great and service is 5 stars. We are delighted to have selected this boutique hotel and loved its history as well as we truly enjoy our stay. Thank you",5,2015,04,05
15,Fantastic 4 day break,"If you get the opportunity to stay at the Mercer Hotel, grab it with both hands. My wife and I hadn't been to Barcelona before so we selected the hotel based on its location in the Gothic Quarter and positive reviews from other people who had stayed. We were not disappointed. The hotel is an absolute delight, situated on one of the narrow lanes, it can be easily missed. Our taxi took us directly to the door, which was an experience in itself. From the time we stepped out of the car right up until the time we left the staff were excellent; in fact the taxi that came to pick us up when we were leaving, wouldn't drive down the lanes to the hotel as they were too narrow. No problem, the concierge and doorman took our luggage and walked with us to pick up the taxi. In addition to the very friendly and helpful staff the hotel building and interior decorations are exceptional. This is an historic building which has been lovingly restored. It still has many original structural features yet still provides a very modern and contemporary feel with carefully chosen décor. I cant do it justice in a write up you have to see it to appreciate it. The location of the hotel was also ideal, right in the heart of the gothic area it is a short walk to the Barcelona Cathedral, la Rambla and the the market (la Boqueria). I have no problem recommending the Mercer to anyone, it is now one of our favourite hotels in the world.",5,2015,04,04
15,Outstanding boutique hotel with impeccable service,"We loved everything about this Hotel, its location, rooms, history and above all the service provided by all staff members. The hotel abuts an ancient Roman city wall which haas been incorporated  and integrated beautifully with the architecture of this modern boutique hotel. Beautiful rooftop and courtyard to relax. Richard was extraordinarily helpful with any and all questions asked. We look forward to returning.",5,2015,04,02
15,Impeccable service...fantastic place!,"The staff was amazing...extremely helpful and courteous (every suggestion they gave us was perfect!) the rooms were wonderful...the bed and sheets...ahhhhh!  I asked about them and Ricard had a note with their web-site on my nightstand when I returned a few hours later!  Lots of little extras like...free wifi, someone greeting you with a smiling face and opening the front door every time you come and go, champagne upon arrival, free refreshments in your in room fridge, chocolates at night!  I would highly recommend.  Right in the center of the Gothic District and close to everything.  If I go back to Barcelona...THIS is where I will stay!  THANK YOU!",5,2015,04,02
15,Best Service and Stay in Europe,"The staff and accommodations were amazing.  The ""room"" was beautiful with kitchen, living area and room for the family.  We mailed packages to the US that ended back at the hotel.  The staff helped get our box to us and were wonderful.  This is the only place we will stay while in Barcelona!  Great for couples, families or groups of friends.  Accommodations and price can not be beat!  The staff were fluent in several languages and 24 hour desk service.  Thank you Hotel Mercer and staff for our stay and making sure our memories and treasures made it to us!",5,2015,03,29
15,An absolutely perfect and unforgettable stay,"This really is the most perfect hotel I ever stayed at. Extremely friendly and helpful staff (unfortunately I forgot to ask this very  nice guest relation manager for his name). Wonderful architecture, perfect combination of historic (gotic) building and modern but subtle renovation. Huge rooms with a spacious bathroom, a lot of space for luggage and clothes and the best of it: THE BED!!! I have never before slept in such a comfortable bed before (and I was there with a friend of mine, not even my husband;-)) Food (tapas) and drinks (wine, beer, cocktails) are worth more than one try, the library is beautiful and so is probably the rooftop terrace (which was closed due to the early season). I can only recommend this hotel, oh yes, and I almost forgot to mention its location: in the very centre of the old town, but very quiet at night. In the close surroundings there a lots of cosy and authentic tapas bars as well as a lot of the historical monuments of Barcelona.",5,2015,03,23
15,One of the best ,"Our stay at Mercer was fantastic. Wonderful, large rooms. Great location in the Gothic district. Great breakfast each morning. Impeccable service. Rooftop deck a great place to be on a warm day.  Old Roman wall anchors one side of the hotel.  ",5,2015,03,23
15,Delightful boutique hotel in the old city,"So much about it that makes it a great place to stay: location, staff, modernist style and food.  Breakfasts were a true pleasure. Many attractions are very close by.  Staff went far to help us with whatever needs we had, from advice on how to get around to getting us tickets to see Barca at Camp Nou! We would stay here again if we return to Barcelona.",5,2015,03,17
15,Loved it!,"Thank you to Mercer Hotel for a fabulous stay in Barcelona.  Our rooms were ready upon arrival very early around 10 am!  We were not expecting to have the chance to freshen up so soon after our long journey.  Crazy comment, but..the lobby of the hotel has the wonderful scent of a upscale spa..so refreshing!  We were glad that we had the transportation arranged from the airport to the hotel since they knew how to get to the hotel.  Most taxi drivers subsequently dropped us at a nearby location a few blocks away during the rest of our trip. Some did not know the tiny streets in this area and surely others did not want to venture down these narrow streets.  The hotel is on a charming street barely wider than a vehicle.  We arranged our FC Barcelona match tickets several months in advance with a money order purchase direct with a ticket broker arranged through the hotel concierge. They were great seats and included VIP access during the match.  The concierge arranged all of our restaurant reservations and made a few changes last minute.  We particularly loved Sensi Bistro within a 3 minute walk.  Just prior to our vacation, the concierge sent a ""little scheduler"" with all of our reservations , tours and FC Barcelona information.  So helpful!  Don't miss the rooftop terrace at the hotel.  It is great just to lay on their lounge chairs and enjoy the sunshine in March.  We had a fantastic time.  Definitely will return to this hotel on my next trip to Barcelona!",5,2015,03,16
15,A hidden delight ,"Friendly attentive welcome. Delightful spacious room with comfortable bed and well laid out bathroom and super shower. Excellent location and amazing architecture. 
Helpful friendly staff.  
Breakfast was glacially slow and very ordinary- possibly too much attention to detailed presentation at the expense of efficiency.  On our first morning it took 20 minutes between arriving for breakfast and the first morsels appearing at our table.  Second day was quicker. 
Lots of thoughtful touches - a weather forecast for the following day was left in our room each evening.  Complementary mini bar with water and juices.  Good quality toiletries including mouthwash. ",4,2015,03,15
15,Fantastic boutique hotel,"We loved this place! A perfectly located boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona! Great rooms. We had a junior suite on the courtyard side (quieter) that was superb. 
Probably there greatest asset is there people. They treat you as if you are guest in their home. Florencio in Guest Relations could not do enough for us -- restaurant reservations in difficult to get into restaurants, museum tickets, etc. 
a fantastic stay!",5,2015,03,14
15,Brilliant Mercer Again,"This was our second trip to the Mercer, and we were delighted to be upgraded for our five night stay to the Premier Junior Suite, complete with its own private garden. The hotel location is perfect in the Gothic quarter within easy walking reach of the centre, the Born and the Port area. There are fabulous restaurants and tapas bars nearby, not forgetting the Bouchon bar in the Mercer itself. The staff are positive and keen to make your stay special. In our case this meant rose petals on our Super King bed and chilled cava on arrival ( it was our wedding anniversary !!) A wonderful relaxing experience in the bustle of the city. Would not consider staying anywhere else in Barcelona!",5,2015,03,14
15,Second fantastic stay !,"This was our second visit to this very special hotel! The staff are very very polite, happy and nothing is any trouble to anyone! The hotel is spotlessly clean! A delight to return to!  We were fortunate to have room 108, Premium  Junior Suite, with private terrace! We were celebrating a special anniversary and the Hotel provided a wonderful atmosphere for this! A bottle of Cava and some cake left in our room! Rose petals! Simply wonderful! Our previous visit was for a special birthday and the same thought and care was experienced then!
We had a wonderful time and the staff seem genuinely happy which makes for a fantastic, relaxing atmosphere! One of the best hotels I have ever visited!
Thank you to all of you! You should be very proud!
Highly recommended!",5,2015,03,14
15,An Oasis in a well located Hot Spot,"The Mercer Hotel is perfectly located for tourists, as it sits right in the middle of the two nice neighborhoods in Barcelona: El Born and The Gothic District.

In fact, the Mercer is probably the only hotel I'd recommend on this area, as it is somehow pin drop quiet in an area known for noise and rabble until all hours of the morning.  It is located in an old guard house that was part of the original city wall, making it both charming and historic.

The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, and the included breakfast is simply fantastic!  The rooms are a bit funky, as the bathroom is open to the bedroom, making it awkward as there is no privacy in the shower.  They also suffer from a lack of outlets, as there are none anywhere near the bed, and my room only had a single tiny window.

Most importantly, the bed and linens are exquisitely comfortable, and the rooms have their own temperature controls for both heating and A/C.  

Given the fantastic location, great staff, quiet and comfortable rooms, and amazing breakfast, I give the Mercer my highest rating, despite being on the pricey side...",5,2015,03,08
15,Amazing hotel,"The reviews precedes this hotel and for good reason. Its a beautiful, cosy and comfortable hotel in one of the small alleys in the Gothic quarter. 
The location is amazing- everything is walking distance and the quarter itself is great. 
The staff was outstabding, very helpful and nice. 
Will definitely come back. ",5,2015,03,08
15,I love this place,"I love this place.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. I had fourour star accommodations in historic district. The hotel is located to the heart of Barcelona. The restaurant excellent, breakfast, lunch and dinner. R",5,2015,03,04
15,"great hotel, great location","The hotel is tucked away in a quiet road in the gothic quarter but our taxi driver had no difficulty finding it. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and our room, in the tower, was lovely with a delightful bathroom. There is a small but well designed roof terrace with a plunge pool and bar, although these were shut in February, the beds and chairs were still available and the weather was good enough to make use of them in the afternoon.
The location is perfect for exploring the city and we would certainly stay here again.",5,2015,02,22
15,A jewel of a hotel,"Fabulous little hotel tucked away in Barcelona's Gothic quarter.  A beautiful, well thought out room overlooking a quiet alley.  Wonderful, very accomplished food and staff that can't do enough for you.  We loved it!",5,2015,02,20
15,One of the best boutique hotels I have ever encountered,"This small hotel was an absolute delight!  Everything about the property is charming and well thought--out.  The staff was marvelous, helpful and responsive.  Even the lobby furniture was extraordinarily comfortable.  The dining room was lovely, and our breakfasts (included) were delicious.  The room was relatively small but beautifully-designed, quiet, and most comfortable.  And the location in the Gothic section was extremely well-located for exploring the city -- on foot, taxi and subway.

I would highly recommend the Mercer and will return again myself.",5,2015,02,20
15,Fabulous staff.,"The staff at the Mercer are friendly, attentive without being overbearing and extremely professional. From the booking to checking out everything was perfect. I was upgraded to the Mercer suite and it's huge. The hotel is perfectly situated in the Gothic area and great for exploring the city by foot. Breakfast was delicious and the young gentleman that served us was a delight and a credit to the hotel. Dined in the tapas bar and the food was very good. A really beautiful hotel with staff that enhanced my experience.",5,2015,02,18
15,"Phenomenal, Outstanding and practically perfect in every way.","Where to start?! 

A few months ago, I decided that I wanted to ask my girlfriend for her hand in marriage, I knew I wanted to do this in Barcelona, but I wasn't sure where I wanted to stay. Like many of you I took to TripAdvisor to read some genuine and no-holds-barred comments about the various places to stay. I couldn't believe the consistency of the rave reviews that this hotel was getting, every single one I had seen; the author had been blown away by the service and the hotel. I decided after a good solid hour or so of reading feedback that I would give it a go and I booked a one night- two day stay with my soon to be Fiancée. 

I called the hotel and spoke with one of the night-shift receptionists. I had a few ideas that I was keen to have incorporated into the stay and so I needed to run the ideas past them. I left my email address with the receptionist and the next morning I received an email from Gloria in the guest relations department. She asked me exactly what I wanted, gave me a few ideas and we played email tennis for a few days. Everything was set in stone well before I was due to leave. I was still at home and seriously impressed with the level of service I had received!

Zero hour- arriving at the hotel.  I took it upon myself to grab a taxi from Barcelona-El Prat airport. This cost around about €30 and a small tip to the driver.  It is true that some of the drivers just don't know how to access the street and we were dropped off on a road next to Carrer del Lledó  and had less than a minutes walk down an alleyway but the hotel was easy to find and I appreciated the leg stretch after the fight. 

As we arrived on Carrer del Lledó I recognized the banner of the Mercer Hotel which was stood next to a grand glass door which led into the lobby. Straightaway, I was in awe of the contrast in design and temporal juxtaposition of the authentic Roman city walls and the modern, bright design of the present day which blended together impeccably. 

The door was opened for us by the Host and we were warmly greeted with a smile. Our bags were immediately taken from us by the host and we were shown to the reception. I gave my booking, passport and card details over, a completely painless process which had us checked in, in no time at all.  We were then offered a chilled glass of Cava from a crystal flute. Which we gladly accepted. Just as we took our drinks we were made aware by the reception staff that we had been upgraded to a junior suite! This was a fantastic start to our break and it no doubt afforded me some extra brownie points with my soon to be Fiancée. 

Berta escorted us to our room, not before giving us an informative tour of the hotel including the on-site orange tree courtyard.

We made our way to our room, Cava in hand and arrived on our floor. The sheer size of the corridors became quickly apparent, immaculately clean and tastefully decorated with lots of natural light. As we approached our room we were met by two huge doors, much bigger than those of my own house with a key card lock and the room number engraved into the body.

We were shown how to operate the key card which is a touch-based system and makes life easier when carrying items/souvenirs.  We entered into the room and walked into the very spacious lobby area which had it's own beautifully lit Roman wall and table area. We all went straight through into the main room. Amazing.

The room was absolutely stunning, impossibly clean and perfectly ergonomic. We were shown how all the lights work, the air-con and given a tour of the room. The bed was extremely comfortable and you are provided with  two chilled glass bottles of water and crystal tumblers.
The mini-bar is complimentary and a really nice touch. Through to the living area with a comfortable sofa, (to be honest we did not use this much, just due to the length of our stay but I can vouch, that it was comfortable for the five minutes I used it to to tie my shoes. 

The most stunning part of this room is the bathroom. A large double shower, grand vanity area complete with complimentary Molton Brown products and a bath bomb. The pièce de résistance is; in my opinion the substantial, free standing, single-cut stone bath. This really made the room for me. 

Our bags were brought up to the room by Berta and we were left to plan our day.  The hotel is situated in El Barrio Gótico which is essentially the Gothic quarter, full to the brim with ancient walls and retro-fitted buildings inspired by Gothic architecture, a great example of this is the Barcelona Cathedral which, until the 19th century looked completely different. This is a five minute walk from the hotel and a must see. 

Whilst my partner was in the room I went downstairs to speak with Gloria from guest relations, an amazing woman, so polite and very sweet who put my mind at ease that everything had been taken care of and I could begin enjoying my break.
I had booked a table in the Mercer hotel restaurant for our return. We were shown to our table and benefited from a complete silver service. The restaurant was situated in one of the Roman defense towers with original and untreated walls compared with the crisp, modern linen, crystal glasses and beautiful lay garnishing  the table made this very aesthetically pleasing.  Whilst at dinner we met Miko and Daniel, both clearly expert restaurateurs.

We were given a choice of three menus, The Taster menu - incorporating around 12 dishes of half portions to suit everybody's palate. This was priced at €90 per head. A winter menu -seasonal and local food. Lastly, the general menu, consisting of many items for each course of the meal. 
We decided to have the general menu and ordered our food and drink. Each course was carefully explained to us upon ordering. I asked Daniel, a true sommelier to recommend wines to accompany our courses, which he did, beautifully. One of my wines was a lovely Catalonian red which was rich and full bodied. I won't go through a list of all that we had to eat, just know that I am certain you will be astounded by the taste, quality and presentation of the meal. However I feel it necessary to mention that my partner ordered the venison as her main course. This was absolutely sublime, I cannot stress to you how good it was, my partner gave me a taste of hers and I just couldn't stop smiling whilst eating it, it was that good! 
In between courses we had small, light entremets which were again, consistently sensational in taste and appearance. The food served in this restaurant is most certainly of Michelin star quality, better compared to some I have eaten in previously. Don't take my word for it, try it. 

Whilst we were at Dinner, the hotel staff were aware of my plans and I had arranged for Miko to take some photographs of us at dinner so that I could keep the moments. Again the staff took this one step further and I had pictures of inside the kitchen, the staff and the wines which we had been drinking  which was a lovely gesture.  
After I had proposed and become a Fiancé, we celebrated with a beautiful champagne, again recommended by Daniel. The staff came out from the kitchen and stood in a line, applauding us after our beautiful meal. This really stuck with me and made it an unforgettable moment. The chef came over to the table and talked about our food, I applauded them all for their outstanding culinary skills and we finished with coffee. 

The staff were so kindhearted and made us feel so relaxed throughout, I cannot express to you how good they were at dinner.  
I had opted for rose petals, candles and bubbly to be put on ice upon our return to our room so that my Fiancée could relax in a bath and tell everyone the news whilst using the free Wifi, courtesy of the hotel.  
When we entered the room, everything was perfect, exactly how I had imagined it to be. Beautiful candles and rose petals carefully spread throughout the room, real roses and of course flutes to enjoy our drink, this was a really nice surprise for my Fiancée and perfectly executed whilst we were at dinner. 

The next day we had a tour booked and explored Barcelona a bit more, all the staff were so genuinely kind and all congratulated us on our news on our return. After taking my Fiancée to a really bad Tapas restaurant in Las Ramblas the first day, for which I will no doubt ever live down, I decided to play it safe and took her for lunch in the Mercer Tapas bar. 
Again, I was so pleased with the quality of food, the buñuelos de bacalao (sweet cod fritters) were a favourite of ours. The Tapas bar is competitively priced and is so worth going to just for the overall quality. The bar is beautifully decorated in a chic style and the staff again are brilliant. 

When it came to leaving, my partner and I were genuinely sad, The staff at the mercer had exceeded my expectations with their level of hospitality and service, all of my needs were catered for and I was amazed by the professionalism shown throughout our stay.  The staff are beautiful people with the guest's best interests at heart, they clearly strive to give you the best possible stay and we were treated like royalty. I have stayed in many five star establishments, but none, I think will ever compare to the Mercer hotel. I can now absolutely understand why this is the number one hotel in Barcelona on TripAdvisor and completely relate to the reviews from other people. I cannot stress how perfect this stay was, one which I will definitely be doing again. Barcelona has always been my favourite place in the world, and this hotel and it's staff have completely reaffirmed that feeling for me. 

Stunning hotel, exceptional service, and genuinely brilliant staff. 

Thank you Hotel Mercer. Bravo.

15,Perfect,"This is an architectural and design delight situated in a central position. Our room was very attractive with a really comfortable bed. The housekeeping staff kept it beautifully clean and well stocked. The breakfast menu was comprehensive, delicious and charmingly served. We had dinner one night in the hotel which was quite an experience - in a good way. 

All the staff in the hotel could not possibly have been more pleasant, friendly and helpful. Nothing was ever too much trouble. We thoroughly enjoyed our time in this hotel and sincerely hope to return before too long.",5,2015,02,15
15,Beatiful and well-located hotel with excellent service,"The décor is beautiful, and the rooms are comfortable and well designed.  The staff could not be more attentive,  The hotel is very well located, within walking distance of the cathedral and about a 30 minute walk from the Eixample district.",5,2015,02,12
15,"Building, location and staff.....all wonderful !","We had a four day break in this wonderful hotel. We have stayed in many hotels around the world and have discovered that smaller hotels in prime locations best meet our needs. When booking our stay in Barcelona, Mercer Hotel seemed to meet our criteria and we were not disappointed, everything about it exceeded a high expectation.
The location was perfect. Set right in the Old Town it is in an ideal position for exploring the history and culture of the city as well as being close to most of the many good restaurants that the city has to offer.
The building itself is just perfect, steeped in history actually built on 'tower 28' of the ancient Roman walls. However there is nothing ancient about the renovation of the building. It has been done lavishly with great design flare and taste which blend the ancient stones into a bright, modern well appointed hotel, a delight to have the privilege to stay in .
We had breakfast in the hotel each day and Dinner on our last night as well as having afternoon snacks in the Tapas bar. The service was always exemplary. Breakfast was always an excellent meal setting us up for a day's exploring whilst the Tapas bar was good for recovering at the end of it.
Lastly, the best part of all, the staff !
It would be difficult to find a more caring, polite and exceedingly helpful group of people. Nothing was too much trouble, our thanks to all of them !
In short, we had a great holiday and when we return to Barcelona, it will certainly be to the Mercer !",5,2015,02,11
15,Very attentive staff and excellent location.,"For us the outstanding feature of this hotel was the helpfulness of the staff.  From the moment we arrived they did everything possible to make our stay as perfect as possible.  We could not fault any of them, and everything was done with a smile.
The hotel is also ideally located for sight-seeing in the Gothic Quarter of the city, which made it easy to stroll to many of the historical places of interest that we wanted to see.
Despite all the history associated with the hotel and the Roman wall the rooms are very modern and provided excellent comfort.  The mini-bar also provided complimentary soft drinks which was a nice touch.
However, due its location in the city there is little in the way of views, and even the pleasant roof terrace was not sufficiently high to afford a view over the surrounding buildings, although this wasn't really an issue.
A nice touch was the complimentary tapas and drinks in the hotels own tapas bar (because we booked for 4 nights), and this made for a nice lunchtime break from the sight-seeing.
We would choose this hotel again, although it is at the more expensive end of the price range.",5,2015,02,10
15,Wonderful hotel,What a fab place. We absolutely loved it and has made it into one of my top hotels ever. Beautiful large room and great architectural features. In a great location for wandering out for tapas. We will definitely be back in the summer to enjoy the roof terrace. ,5,2015,02,06
15,Really nice,"Located in the Gothic walled area so make sure you have a map with direction for Taxi.  Amazing hotel and love, love, love the design + service.  I bit pricey but well worth it.  This is now by home in Barcelona when I return!",5,2015,02,05
15,Excellent Hotel and Lovely staff,"I was here for a Business Conference and the staff was amazing right from the planning stages. I just found this hotel on the internet and based on reviews on Tripadvisor and chose this because our first choice W Hotel was not available. However, I would say this was a blessing in disguise. The hotel was really fantastic. This is a Heritage property (so were we told by a taxi driver) and the rooms were fantastic. It has a certain old world charm and the service is impeccable. We used the meeting room for our conference and it was fanstastic. The room is just about right for 10 people and more than that tends to be a little bit of a squeeze. We were around 14 people, but we were all very happy. Infact all of us were very happy, which is rare when you do a Group event. 
As I had read on tripadvisor, not all taxis come right in front of the hotel, we had to walk a little. However, there were some taxis which actually came there. On my return trip the taxi actually bumped into a wall while turning as the road is really narrow. The location was fantastic as the sea and the shopping belt are both walkable if you wish. We hd done a couple of activities and the tour guide also colmplemented us on the choice of the Hotel. The breakfast was amazing. I think the croissants there were one of the best I have had. However, for a Vegetarian like me, the only hot breakfast choice was either a veg sandwhich or grilled veggies, which kind  of gets boring if you are staying there for more than 2 days. The snacks during tea break were also very nice. The rooms were good and very modern. They have paid great attention to detail. Infact they also have a free packing service for someone who may do with some professional help in packing their suitcases. Not that I used it, but I am sure it would be really good if you need it and if your bags are burgeoning after shopping extensively. 
I would blindly recommend this place to anyone, who does not mind to live in a boutique property with a very personalised feel.",5,2015,02,03
15,Fell in love with this hotel!,"I loved this hotel! After researching and reading TripAdvisor reviews for a last minute girl's trip to Barcelona, I chose Mercer Hotel for a 4 night stay. A huge reason I chose Mercer was that I noticed the hotel's response to almost every review-I'm a fan of customer service! The location was smack dab in the middle of the old Gothic area and we were able to walk to most of the attractions we wanted to see (and only got lost once!) My friend and I booked a private transfer from BCN to the hotel-the hotel is on a tiny maze of a street and a few reviewers suggested that taxis don't come down the street. We had the hotel book the transfer and we were dropped right in front. The hotel did call taxis for us for dinners, etc...which they picked us up right in front of the hotel. Every staff member was wonderful and friendly and spoke English. Upon our arrival we were greeted with a cold glass of Spanish cava. We had a nice tapas dinner in the adjacent restaurant Le Bouchon-wonderful!  I booked a deluxe room (103) on the first floor. What a fantastic room! Really large, lots of storage, desk area, chairs for sitting. The decor was lovely, sort of rustic, modern-my room looked out onto the tiny street at the front of the hotel, but noise was 
never an issue. Loved the sink area-lots of room for everything, large enough shower and separate toilet area. The linens were lush, the towels fluffy, pillows and bed so comfy. The only problem I had with my room was the lighting-it's too dim. We had drinks in the bar every night-the bartenders really got to know us! My friend asked for port and they didn't have any, so the bartender went next door to get some. Another night we asked for champagne cocktails and they made us their special drink. Breakfast was another wonderful experience-and one I've not encountered. It was a buffet (included in my room rate), but you ordered what you wanted off of a menu and it was brought to the table freshly made. Fresh fruit and a bread/pastry basket was brought to the table and the coffee was delicious! Everything was delicious!There's a beautiful roof deck that would be awesome to hang out in the summer. Lovely views of Barcelona's Gotic district, a bar, lounging area and small pool.  I can't say enough about how much I loved this hotel-the rooms, restaurant, staff, public spaces. The next time I go to Barcelona, we're staying at Mercer Hotel.",5,2015,01,30
15,Fantastic hotel,"I can't imagine staying anywhere else but here when visiting Barcelona. The location is perfect. The hotel is stylish, clean, has everything you need and more. The service is excellent. Friendly professional staff go out of their way to make a memorable experience. Richard was incredibly helpful ensuring our stay was fantastic, and the doorman (the one in the leaflet) made us smile every time he opened the door for us.
We stayed in room 205 which was lovely. As said in many reviews, the beds and bedding are sooo comfy.
The food in the tapas bar in the hotel is delicious and the atmosphere relaxed and friendly. The food in the restaurant is sublime and well on the way to deserving a michelin star. Again, the service throughout the hotel is faultless.
In terms of location and activity in the 4 days that we were there the best things we did were:
1. A tour with Edgar through Segway Glides. We booked this before travelling. It's a fun and informative way to see Barcelona. Edgar is a great instructor, he's funny and can tell you a lot about the history of Barcelona as well as pointing out some fantastic cafes/restaurants.
2. Fumir at Trescant took us on a tour up Montsurrat which was the highlight of our trip. It was arranged through the hotel but i'm sure you can do it direct. It was breathtaking.
3. La Sagrada Familia is stunning. There were no queues when we went in January but apparently you can queue up to 3hrs in other months so best prebook online. Go up the Nativity tower, a lift takes you up 100ft and then you walk down a spiral stone staircase. It's great fun.

Places to eat:
1. The hotel of course.
2. Taverna del Bisbe - Good for lunch. 3 good courses, bread, wine and coffee for 11 euros on set lunch menu. Good choice of dishes too.
3. For breakfast/brunch/lunch go to Milk. The food is delicious and big portions.

15,Impeccable,"My partner and I stayed three nights at the Mercer Hotel in mid-January. It was one of the nicest hotels we’ve ever stayed in – modern but comfortable, and impeccably clean; gorgeous rooms and beautiful, luxurious bathrooms. The staff could not have been more helpful or more welcoming. We had dinner in the restaurant on our first night- the food was glorious. The taster menu is a must - not cheap but well worth it. Very, very highly recommended.",5,2015,01,27
15,"Wonderful service, perfect location","My husband and I booked this for 2 nights and just loved it. I did print the directions to the hotel from the site as suggested from other reviewers. Our taxis would not have found it without! We loved the size of the hotel and the very personal service. Both of the concierges were very helpful and provided us with fun ideas everyday. We loved our room- 307 and slept great. Two things we loved in Barcelona- the bar at Boca Chica (we just turned 40 but appeals to all ages as it's stunning and wonderful drinks) and taking a cooking class with Barcelona Cooking- we ended up having a private class it's it was the low season. Our breakfast at Mercer was divine- seriously I photographed the spread (below) and posted on Instagram and my friends were swooning. The service again was personal and friendly. We will definitely come back to the Mercer! Once you figure out the location, it was easy to find with no map everyday.",5,2015,01,22
15,Mercer,"A very nice boutique hotel situated in the historic part of Barcelona near the port. Part of the building dates back to Roman times, but the Architect has used imagination to make this a very trendy and interesting hotel.

The restaurant is first class and well on its way to earn a Michelin star under the watchful eye of French F&B Manager Mikael Lasne.

The rooms are less impressive, but comfortable and OK.",4,2015,01,19
15,Amazing service! Cool hotel.,"We spent 3 days in Barcelona (first-time visit) without the kids. As others have said, the airport taxi wouldn't take us to the hotel and we had to walk the last few hundred metres, and we got lost. 
Great location, although abit 'edgy' for some perhaps?
The service here is really excellent without being at all suck-upy. just genuine helpfulness and pleasantness.
The rooms was lovely, clean, quiet, modern, although not large. The bed was very comfortable to the point that we felt like we'd had the best sleep that we'd had in years!
Thankyou!",5,2015,01,15
15,Marvelous hotel in a great neighborhood,"Our 4 day stay was not long enough. The hotel is immaculate and well designed. Large and open rooms with relaxing and comfortable decor. Staff was warm, friendly and extremely helpful. 24 hour room service is great to have. Rooms were clean and well maintained, as was the entire property. Unfortunately, we did not take advantage of the wonderful restaurant on site. We only had the complimentary welcome tapas and cava, which were divine. Highly suggest this destination.",5,2015,01,13
15,FABULOUS location and wonderful staff!,"The Mercer is located in the famed gothic neighborhood in Barcelona. A small boutique hotel with very friendly and truly genuine staff who were ALWAYS happy to help with any need. We were truly able to walk almost anywhere. Walk to the beach, La Rambla, La Catedral, many fabulous restaurants and boutique shops. Restaurant on-site as well as an adorable, cozy wine bar. Juan Manuel recommended and arranged a tour to Montserrat that was one of the highlights of our trip. Beds were very comfortable, free wifi, and complimentary mini bar. If traveling during warm months, there is an adorable rooftop bar. Rooms were a bit contemporary for my taste especially considering we were in the gothic neighborhood. However, I would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend.",5,2015,01,11
15,Excellent hotel in a beautiful area,"Excellent and friendly service, beautiful hotel, beautiful room. The breakfast was delicious and the waiters very friendly.
The location in the gothic quarter is fantastic. Both lively and quaint.

All in all very happy with my stay.",5,2015,01,11
15,Wonderful Vacation in Barcelona,We spent 8 days in Mercer Hotel in January 2015. I would like to thank all the people who work there. Service was absolutely incredible. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. Special thank to Jose Manel for his tips about restaurants! Excellent choices! We had indeed very good rest. In addition to that the location is very good! Easy to get everywhere and in the center of old city. Highly recommended!,5,2015,01,07
15,Excellent Hotel - Will be BACK,"Had perfect time in the Mercer, all was really great, service and breakfast were all top of the class. 
I do recommend to use the hotel car service (if you can) from the airport as they know exactly how to find the hotel. The location is amazing no matter why you are in the city for and especially if you like to be in a perfect spot, all is walking distance.
The concierge team is very professional , front desk will always do the best for you and the breakfast is very tasty and special.",5,2015,01,06
15,Fantastic,"We just came back after 5 nights in Mercer Barcelona.the location is in the heart of the Gothic Area,near to good restaurants,museums,tapas bars,and shops.the stuff was very kind and helpful and upgrade us to junior suite.next time we'll come again to this hotel",5,2015,01,01
15,Great location to everything,"We fell in love with this boutique hotel boasting only 28 rooms.  We stayed in a Junior Suite that we highly recommend (very comfortable bedding).  Mercer arranged our transportation to and from the airport.  The staff was very helpful, especially with our gluten free needs, even the evening treat was gluten free.  Also, breakfast had some of the best GF breads and they offered  almond milk for my coffee in the mornings.  The staff helped to map out our plan for each day of our stay from e-biking, hiking Montserrat to touring the city on foot (and an awesome run in a nearby park and along the beachfront) they assisted us thoroughly.   If you plan breakfast with them in advance it is 25 euro, and this includes everything, you will not need much to eat (other than a treat maybe) until dinner.  The restaurant next door has wonderful wines and delicious tapas and the restaurant in the Mercer provides a five star experience.  If you venture to the La Rambla there is a hugh market with all the fresh produce you would ever want.  Even with five stars there are a couple of things to mention.  Our suite was an open concept, so that the sink and shower area was open to the bedroom, which is difficult when your partner wants to sleep.  Also, we could clearly hear the water running when our neighbors took a shower next door and could also clearly hear the neighbors as they walked on the wood floors up above.  Regardless, we really enjoyed our few nights and highly recommend it to others.",5,2014,12,26
15,Beautiful hotel,Small trendy historical place that is thoroughly modernized. I gave it 4 stars for the room because the rooms are a little small. Also 4 stars for value because it is a bit expensive. But overall a great hotel. Highly recommended. ,5,2014,12,26
15,Charming Hotel in Barcelona,"Mercer Hotel in Barcelona reminded me of the Santa Clara Hotel in Cartagena, Colombia.
Charming very elegant and with a perfect mix of vintage and contemporary. 
Mercer had a balance between art and beauty to accommodate modernity in the Gothic quarter of Barcelona.The Gothic Quarter is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. I would definitely go back to Mercer in Barcelona the service  excellent.",5,2014,12,23
15,Wonderful place to stay in Barcelona,"We stayed six nights and found the Mercer to  be an exceptional place to stay. Location in Bario Gotik is very convenient as you can walk to most major tourist destinations. The staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the concierge who went out of their way to help with some quite challenging issues.  We skipped breakfast as it was too expensive and there a great local places to have coffee and a pastry but everything else about the Mercer is recommended without hestiation.",5,2014,12,22
15,Excellent!!,"My wife and I visited Barcelona recently and we had the pleasure of staying at Mercer Hotel for 3 nights. The location of the hotel was really good as it was at the old part of Barcelona so its quieter and more peaceful. The staff from the doorman, concierge, reception, and restaurant were all very friendly, helpful, and courteous. The room is really nice too!  Worth every euro I paid! An absolutely excellent hotel and staff! Easily 5 stars!

15,"Beautiful, quiet retreat in heart of old city","The Mercer was a beautiful hotel in the old part of Barcelona.  Location was excellent for walking to most sites and attractions -- Palau Musica, Sagrada Familia, Barcelona Cathedral, La Rambla, Picasso Museum, the beach, etc. Rooms were large and beautifully appointed in contemporary style. The staff is extremely attentive in a classy, low-keyed way.  The experience of staying there felt private, quiet and very personable.  Highly recommended!",5,2014,12,17
15,Excellent,"We loved this place! The hotel it's in one of the most beautiful area in Barcelona, easy walk around in a very safe and clean area. The room was very clean and very well equipped, breakfast was very nice and rich! What we enjoyed the best was the service provided us by the wonderful staff working there, they were professional and friendly, special thank to Juan Manuel who recommended and bioked for us excellent restaurants around the city. Hope to be back soon.",5,2014,12,16
15,A Modern Gem in the Gothic Quarter,"This boutique hotel deserves its high ranking and works incredibly hard to maintain it.  Yes - the rooms are a bit dark and I do believe they should try to resolve it with additional lighting.  

Having said that, the highlights of this hotel include first and foremost, the staff.  They genuinely want to be helpful and create a very warm and welcoming environment. 
 
The hotel is located in the the Gothic quarter -- one of the most interesting parts of Barcelona.  We loved just walking out of the hotel and stepping on to the interesting streets, filled with restaurants, shops and ancient history.  We walked everywhere from this location.  (And do arrange transportation through the hotel to/from the airport or train station as we did -- we still don't know how the taxi managed through those tiny streets).  

The hotel itself is a tasteful blend of ancient roman walls and sleek modern décor; it is immaculate and beautiful.  The breakfast was among the best we enjoyed in our travels -- fresh, diversified and delicious.  The tapas restaurant was wonderful as well!  

You are provided with water each day and there is a refrigerator stocked with beverages for your enjoyment.  There is turn down service each evening -- and, yes, the bed and linens are incredibly comfortable!  Also, the Wi-Fi worked flawlessly.  

We can't say enough great things about the Mercer Hotel.  When we return to Barcelona, this is where we will stay.",5,2014,12,14
15,Simply perfect,"The Mercer is a gem in Barcelona. The hotel itself is sophisticated, stylish, and luxurious with staff to match. We were treated to a suite with a private patio. The room was excellent. As mentioned in many other reviews the bed was extremely comfortable. Although a little on the dark side, the lighting complemented the mix of modern and gothic style. Breakfast was outstanding and a perfect way to kick off our long days exploring Barcelona. The eggs benedict were delicious. The hotel restaurants were also excellent. Staff was incredibly helpful. The concierge service was one of the best I have experienced. They arranged wonderful dinners and helped us enjoy the city. The hotel is ideally situated and was walking distance to most everything. This hotel is perfect in every way. We look forward to a return visit and highly recommend the Mercer.",5,2014,12,13
15,Perfect Boutique Hotel,"Small and beautiful, this hotel provides everything you could wish for. We stayed here recently for three nights and enjoyed the excellent food, the very comfortable beds and really good personal service.  The rooms were squeaky clean, contemporary and well equipped. Our only complaint would be a request for more overhead light as the rooms are a little dark.  But this would not prevent us from returning.  Breakfast was excellent, if a little slow,  and the tapas were amongst the best we found in the city.  Great location in the Gothic quarter. The staff were all charming and helpful especially one concierge, Juan Manuel, who went out of his way to give top service every time.",5,2014,11,30
15,Perfect oasis in a busy city,Spendt one night here. Hotel is nicely located in the centre of BCN. Taxi driver was not able to drive us all the way to the hotel so we had to walk for a bit. It is located in a very narrow alley. Hotel is beautiful and trendy. Rooms are spacious and modern and breakfast was very nice. Overall a very nice stay in Barcelona. Would definetly return,5,2014,11,29
15,Great stay and great staff,"We moved to Mercer from the Neri, and we're SO glad to make the move.
This IS a 4 star hotel. Why? 1)Staff, 2)Facility
In a small alley, someone is always outside waiting to greet you and welcome you in. And the staff makes sure that they interact with you to see how they can help. And in ways you might not think of to help make your stay more fulfilling.
Great facility, over old ruins, with some outdoor tables 4 story atrium and a roof deck with pool.
Room was quiet, contemporary, unique use of new architectural materials, fairly spacious, white, soft and well appointed.
The restaurant is exceptional, great service, very friendly people, and I would recommend it over almost all the hotels we checked out in the area. We walked by all of the top 20 in and around the Barrio Gotic, and this was the best place, for us.
The staff doesn't sit behind desks, is young, energetic, and wants to take the model elsewhere.

15,The place to stay in Barcelona.,"It is clear why The Mercer is a top rated hotel in Barcelona. The facilities are a wonderful combination of old and modern.  The location in the heart of the Gothic Quarter is perfect.  What truly sets The Mercer apart is the staff. Everyone was friendly, welcoming and helpful. You have to spend some time at the bar and have Lenka create some cocktails handcrafted to your taste.  I will certainly stay here again.",5,2014,11,27
15,Outstanding Service,"We only had the opportunity to stay 1 night, but it was a wonderful experience.  The hotel is beautifully restored with all of the modern services.   The location is in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona, so you can explore all of the small streets right outside the hotel front entrance.  After a long day of exploring, nothing like spending some time in a large soaking tub.  All of the small details made for a wonderful experience .  We highly recommend the Mercer Hotel to anyone who wants all of the luxuries and special attention, without the large chain hotel experience.  Just wish we could have stayed longer.",5,2014,11,24
15,Great place to stay in Barcelona,Stayed 2 nights at this lovely hotel in Barcelona. It is in a great location in the Gothic Quarter which allowed us to walk to most of the best spots in the city. What was most impressive besides the beautiful room and common areas was the service. We arrived early in the day from our cruise and our room was not yet ready the concierge was extremely helpful in getting us on the right path to see things and have a great lunch. His recommendations for dinners and those of the night concierge were excellent. We had two fantastic and different meals. We would return to this hotel in a heartbeat.,5,2014,11,24
15,Small luxury oasis,"Stayed at Mercer Barcelona for 3 nights. Overall an excellent experience highlighted by the perfect location, the quiet and well appointed rooms and top notch service.

Best nights sleep in a long time, dead quiet (patio facing junior suite), great size bed and quality matress and stable (and silent) climate control.

The morning concierge was exceptional, we followed his advice twice, spot on (forgot his name)

The breakfast was outstanding, the eggs benedict the best I 've ever had. We also had a bite at the bouchon (tapas) restaurant, great quality and reasonable prices.

In our mind there are only two areas where there is room for improvement: Pricing and some additional minor facilites/services in the room (espresso machine, ipod dock, etc).

We will be back when next visiting Barcelona and we have already recommended to friends.",5,2014,11,24
15,Unparalleled Customer Service!,"Although I was not personally a guest at the Hotel Mercer, I am the executive assistant to a rather particular CEO and needed to make arrangements for him and his team for business in Barcelona, as well as a client arriving from Geneva.  I booked their rooms using Travelocity and the following day I received an email from their Sales Manager, Mr. Jordi Garcia, and Ms. Gloria Anglora, their Rooms Division & Events Manager, informing me that an error occurred and their hotel had been overbooked.  They apologized profusely and made arrangements at another comparable 5-star hotel within walking distance of the Mercer.  They also volunteered an assortment of favors for the switch and turned what could have been an incredible inconvenience into a genuine opportunity.  They also promised to offer our client the room back if there were to be a last-minute cancellation.  True to their word, when a room opened up, they put our client back in their hotel.  And since, from the time of my booking online, this client needed to arrive one day earlier and the Mercer did not have a room for that night, they continued to offer assistance with his booking at this other 5-star.  Their level of assistance, professionalism and communication was the best I have ever experienced and felt compelled to sing their praises on line…. now that’s what I call service!!!!",5,2014,11,19
15,Magnificent,"We recently stayed at the Mercer Hotel in Barcelona which is located in the Gothic Quarter.  The hotel is relatively small in size but enormous in character.  The Hotel is beautifully restored blending the ancient heritage building with modern services and furnishings.  The hotel is close to bars, restaurants and attractions.

The Hotel staff were accommodating and the services spectacular.  Food and wine was of an exceptional standard.  I would definitely revisit this facility and recommend this hotel for a stay in Barcelona.  Tree Patio.",5,2014,11,19
15,Outstanding,"We decided to stay at The Mercer due to ratings off Tripadvisor .
We had read about problems with taxis not knowing where the hotel was....we printed the map off the hotel website .....gave it to the taxi driver .....no problem whatsoever ....he dropped us directly outside ......albeit a bit of a hair raising experience due to the really really small streets ....taxi will cost approx. 28 euros from the airport.
We had a room with its own garden / patio area which if we had more time in Barca ,....we would certainly have made more use of ....it was truly beautiful, our room was definitely a great size for a boutique hotel and a huge walk in shower with Molton Brown products replenished daily. I had previously read on here about the beds and how comfy they are ....probably the most comfy bed I have ever slept in.
We asked the concierge about recommending a local authentic restaurant ....he phoned them up and booked us a table .....then proceeded to walk us to the restaurant as it was down some winding roads and we would never have found it .....that was a really nice touch and the food in the restaurant was second to none.
We didn't eat in the hotel .....there are so many restaurants on the door step....we also used the restaurant in the square next to the hotel .....with the church bells ringing .....it sets a lovely scene.....also the little bar next to the hotel ....is really welcoming and friendly ......
The Hotel is in a really great location .....really easy to find once you get your bearings .....literally 5 mins from the amazing La Ramblas .....I would highly recommend this hotel and would readily return the next time I visit Barca. Thank you to all the Hotel staff for making our stay special.",5,2014,11,15
15,Excellent Hotel in the Gothic Quarters!,"This Hotel has 5 star written all over it!  From the decor of the rooms, the great staff, great ambiance of the hotel and the great food, this place is perfect for any visitor to Barcelona.  Located right in the heart of the Gothic Quarters, you're literally minutes away from many of the main attractions Barcelona has to offer!  I thought it was pretty interesting to see my chauffeur from the airport squeeze his Mercedes Benz into the tight streets located within the Gothic quarters to drop me off on the front steps of the hotel but he got it done and did it with ease!  Everything was perfect for me at this hotel and I can't stress enough how great the staff is here!  I will definitely be back to stay here when I visit Barcelona again!",5,2014,11,13
15,Mercer is Tripadvisor Number One for a Reason,"Because of similar reviews and Mercer's number one status in Barcelona, I booked a junior suite for this last weekend.  Prior to arriving I contacted the concierge staff regarding restaurants, tapas bars, and interesting sites.  Their advice was flawless.  
1) Website and reservations: excellent
2) Pre-arrival assistance: excellent
3) Helpfulness upon arrival:  excellent
4) Location in Gothic Quarter:  excellent - within walking distance of 90% of our destinations
5) Greeting upon arrival:  excellent
6) Room appearance and size:  very good - very clean
7) Comfort of bed and pillows:  very good
8) Rooftop terrace:  very nice
9) Breakfast: outstanding and delicious
10) Best Advice:  Barra Canete for Tapas and Restaurante Montiel for set menu dinner",5,2014,11,13
15,OUTSTANDING!,"This is a first class hotel....it is everything and more that you have read.  The location of the hotel is special because when you step outside you really feel as if you are in a story book from another time.  The hotel is a hidden gem in the gothic section, and I have to say that one of the highlights of our stay was the outstanding service we received from Mr. Joan Manel.  We had a great time exploring...it was easy to go everywhere, left with an appreciation of Gaudi's work, and went to a great soccer game. We will return to Barcelona again in the near future and without question, we will be staying at the Mercer.",5,2014,11,10
15,A gothic delight,"My wife & I stayed for one night on Sunday 9 November &wished that we could have stayed longer. Tucked away in the heart of the gothic quarter the hotel is within easy walking distance of the cathedral,the picasso museum,placa de riel, las ramblas,& Guell palace. The gothic facade has been retained whilst the interior is well appointed with delightful achitectural features. Our room was spotlessly clean beautifully presented& quiet. The staff were welcoming & obliging & assisted us with a dinner reservation at a local restaurant & confirmed our onward flight & printed out our boarding passes. As the hotel is located in a narrow lane I recommend that you take with you a map showing the location of the hotel or use a taxi with a gps as some taxi drivers are not familiar with the location of the hotel. We will definately stay at the hotel when revisiting Barcelona .",5,2014,11,10
15,Superb in every way!!,"Everything about this hidden gem surprised and delighted. A special Birthday celebration was made so very memorable by the warm and gracious hospitality of all at the Mercer.  Elegant, sophisticated ambiance enhanced by thoughtful and caring staff who ensure your stay is special.I was unable to speak my thanks fully, having lost my voice, and would now like to express my gratitude for the additional attention given which I really appreciated.  A lovely room with huge tub was a welcome retreat from the hub of city life and to start each day with a leisurely breakfast if you enjoy being spoiled with attentive service and personally prepared gourmet food,is a must. 
The rooftop terrace and pool was the perfect place to read the papers before launching into the delights that Barcelona has to offer. The location could not have been more perfect for us- as to be in the very heart of the Gothic quarter but so central to everything was the icing on the cake. Thank you all so much for an exceptional experience- we will definitely be back.",5,2014,11,09
15,Fabulous Hotel!,"We were very pleased with our stay at the Mercer.  The hotel is beautiful, the room was lovely (we recieved a free upgrade to a junior suite) and the staff was friendly and helpful from the moment we checked in.  Both restaurants at the hotel were amazingly good.  Le Bouchon, the tapas restaurant, had a very understanding staff, as we ordered tapas at the most bizarre times (for Catalans) and they never batted an eye.  We will be back!",5,2014,11,08
15,Boutique Elegance,"Mercer is wonderful. Staff is always available and ready to help with anything you need. Hotel is smaller, boutique type property with less than 30 rooms. Was there for small business meeting, used the conference room facilities. Food is excellent, but be advised quality takes time, we thought breakfast was quite slow. Location is central to old city, lots of restaurants close by. Beds were incredibly comfortable. Hotel rooms were a little on the dark side, could use more light (we had courtyard facing room). Overall this was a great hotel, very well kept with conscientious service. Would stay here again.",5,2014,11,08
15,LOVED It!,"Stay here!  Great location in the middle of the Roman city blocks from Cathedral, in the middle of the Gothic area.  So, great location.  Now, beautiful restoration of an antique house, beautifully executed with a modern feel.  Add to that an incredibly friendly and helpful team that always sports a smile, really nice and comfortable rooms and GREAT breakfast…  We loved it and will only stay here when visiting Barcelona.  Try it, you'll LOVE it too!  And, i haven't slept this well in years.  Can't wait to go back.  Thank you!",5,2014,11,04
15,Vacation,Awesome location at Barr gothic. Architecture was part of the wall that surrounded Barcelona so have an uniqueness to the hotel. Restaurant offered great breakfast and awesome tapas. Staff was excellent and extremely helpful. Rooms are spacious and comfortable.,5,2014,11,04
15,Always going the extra mile,"In May I stayed at the Mercer before and after a cruise, first and last time cruising, but fell in love with Barcelona and the position, ambiance, design and service levels of the Mercer. Being in the Gothic area I found it ideal for exploring the local architecture and though in the midst of the tour areas a quiet beautiful boutique design hotel ""away from the madding crowd"". 
I returned to  Barcelona this October, prior to a business trip, to continue my exploration of the cities architectural wealth of visual delights this time for five nights. 
My initial incoming flight was delayed resulting in my luggage only arriving the next day, the reception staff tracked the luggage on my behalf and contacted me the following morning on arrival.
I was upgraded to a junior suite, very pleasant but the design and ambiance of the three rooms I have stayed is very similiar only a size difference. 
On the second evening ate in the restaurant and was intrigued by the sauce dressing the fish dish. I ask the waiter the ingredience, the manager arrived shortly after with a slice of Sobrassada from Mallorca a pork sausage and explained method used to create the sauce. Pork with fish different possibly but very pleasant to the taste buds. On arrival at the restaurant the waiter placed a small table next to my companion for her handbag. These may be small things but speaks volumes of the hotels attitude to their guests.
I'm sure less expensive hotels are available, but where all the staff go out of their way to be genuinely friendly and helpful would be very difficult to find.
I am planning another trip to Barcelona next May and will certainly book into the Mercer.",5,2014,10,29
15,Simply beautiful,"My partner and I had an excellent stay at the Mercer. The Hotel itself was an amazing blend of old and new - which was a compromise as I like modern architecture and my partner likes historic buildings. Nothing else about this stay was a compromise at all. The room was slightly small but totally adequate and beautifully appointed. We stayed in Room 101 but our friends had room 109 for the same price which was larger and quieter. The staff are amazing, they were friendly and incredibly helpful. Florence and Manuel in particular made our stay very memorable and are one of the reasons that we will definitely be returning. It was our friend's birthday and the Hotel noticed this and arranged for a bottle of Cava to be delivered to the room as a lovely surprise. It was 27C which was great for late October so the roof top pool was just the finishing touch.  We did not have breakfast in the hotel or any other meals due to there being an abundance of nice places to eat near by so I cannot comment in relation to that but the bar service was great. In my opinion the Mercer is  one of the best choices in town, there is no better choice if you are looking for the perfect boutique hotel with amazing service. CM",5,2014,10,29
15,Superior Spot in Barcelona,This hotel is like being in a luxurious private residence.  There are only 26 quiet rooms and it has a sense of old world and contemporary.  Wonderful breakfast and superior consierge services. Roof-top lap pool and cava offered throughout the day.,5,2014,10,27
15,Fantastic service - perfect location,We stayed for two nights in October 2014. As this was our third visit to Barcelona we know the city layout fairly well. The location of the hotel is ideal. Reception professional and the staff without exception helpful and courteous. Superior room had ample space and a bed we would have liked to take home with us. The room had all amenities and was cleaned to perfection. Free Wi-Fi worked perfectly in all places. Had an excellent dinner in the restaurant. Don't miss the roof top terrace. Our only regret - why we didn't discover the hotel for our earlier trips. Amazing experience.,5,2014,10,25
15,The best of the best,"The Mercer hotel was by far the best hotel we have ever stayed at. The hotel staff was great, the concierge went above and beyond, the mixologist at the roof top bar made the best drinks! Awesome location, walking distance to great sights. We will definitely return to the Mercer Hotel.  Simply the most awesome place to stay!",5,2014,10,24
15,This is an extraordinary hotel in the best location!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a full week at the beginning of October 2014. What a delightful experience! The location in the Gothic Quarter in the medieval part of the city is truly the best location in all of Barcelona. We were able to walk everywhere. The hotel has a lovely rooftop terrace. The bed was super comfortable. The decor of the hotel is modern, classy, and impeccable!  The best part of our stay was the truly outstanding staff at The Mercer. The concierges and the front desk staff were spot on with their recommendations for dinner.They made reservations for us every night. The name ""The Mercer"" has quite a lot of pull around the city, so I strongly recommend using their concierge services. We are world travelers and found the staff at The Mercer to be the best of the best!
Sincerely,
Marianne and Julian",5,2014,10,22
15,Wonderful hotel in the heart of the Gothic Area!,My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights during our trip to Barcelona.  It is located in the heart of the Gothic Area where you truly feel the spirit of Old Barcelona.  The hotel is modern with nice amenities and rooms.  The hotel staff are 5 star all the way!  Very friendly and helpful.  The concierge was invaluable as we planned our daily outings.  The central location of the hotel also made it easy for sight-seeing.  We walked to most of the sights and took the subway to those that were farther away.  There is a subway station about 3 blocks from this hotel.  The hotel is on the expensive side but worth every penny!  We stayed at another hotel for one night at the end of our trip (after a transfer to Mallorca) and it was terrible.  We wished we had come back to the Mercer.  We will stay at the Mercer the next time we go back to Barcelona.,5,2014,10,21
15,A hidden gem,"When our taxi dropped us off at a main street and said sorry I cant drive to the hotel entrance. I got nervous. We walked about a block and found the hotel entrance, it is then we were greeted with champaign... I started feeling much better! If its your first time in the ""gothic quarter"" of Barcelona it can be a little sketchy at first. But then you realize its actually a bunch of small boutiques. Anyways back to the hotel. It is a absolutely AMAZING hotel and staff!!! The rooms were extremely clean and spacious, they were cleaned every time you left the room! The concierge was world class! i do not have 1 bad thing to say about our experience at the Mercer. We will visit this hotel again, as far as I am concerned they have a customer for life.",5,2014,10,20
15,Beautiful Hotel in the Gothic Area,"We stayed 4 nights in this hotel. The staff are friendly and welcoming and couldn't do enough for you. The rooms are modern but sympathetic to the old building that the hotel is housed and gave a romantic feel to our stay
Located in proximity to the main attractions of Barri Gotic and a handy metro stop meant most if what you want to see in Barcelona is not too hard to get to
",5,2014,10,20
15,Charming deep in the old city,"This is a very charming smaller boutique hotel with only some 28 rooms (if I remember correctly) 
The staff is very friendly from the minute you reach the hotel - actually from the welcoming email which is send some days in advance - till your check out 
It is nice that it is the same staff and guests you meet during the day.
The hotel has all amenities necessary and the interior and furniture is of high quality - We had some drinks at the small cocktail bar and service and drinks was very professional 
We did not have a chance to try the restaurant but looked to be good 
There were however a few smaller mistakes : We had ordered breakfast for both mornings but had to cancel the last breakfast because we simply did not have the energy to go through this circus again - The concept of the breakfast service is that a few waiters serve everything for you - Even bread and jam etc. The idea is of course to offer a high service level but the concept simply does not work and on top of this the service and attention of the breakfast staff was simple sub average (as the only ones in the hotel) 
Also you should be aware that the hotel is located in a very narrow street deep in the old quarters of the Gothic neighbourhood which means that taxi have difficulties getting all the way to the door and that the rooms are not big but we just found this to be charming - instead you have several of the small cafes and bars in walking distance in a very charming neighbourhood - We would come back (but would avoid breakfast)",4,2014,10,13
15,"Excellent location, charming hotel","The location of the hotel is excellent, right in the middle of the gothic quarter, close to the marina.  The building is very old, but the hotel has done a nice job of renovation.  We stayed in one of the suites, since we had our two sons with us.  Even with two rollaway beds, the room was spacious.    Our concierge and the rest of the hotel staff were very nice and helpful.  There is a cute courtyard for having breakfast.  I would have two points of criticism only : (1) The serving time of eggs and coffee (second cup) could increase - we had to wait for a while for those, and (2) the music that plays in the lobby (Michael Jackson's Bad at noon time) as well as during breakfast (Lucky - nice song, but it played at least three times during we had breakfast) could be reconsidered to better match the general ambiance of the hotel.  The second point of criticism is of course subjective and quite personal.  Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at Mercer Hotel.",5,2014,10,13
15,A MATTER OF TASTE,"This hotel is located inside city center. But what does this means?? You are unable to reach this hotel with your own car. You cannot park infront of the house. Even taxis will not (!!!) always bring you direct to the hotel. Then you might need to walk with your luggage and suitcases to the hotel. The reason is: The street is to narrow, to small. And even while walking you need to be very concentrated to find this hotel. But maybe or perhaps you have a mobile phone or GPS Navigation System or software. Then I guess you will find this hotel without help from a third party. And of course you cannot reach this hotel with a bus. 
If you are still satisfied with this and you will accept it then you can go on to think about booking this hotel. 
Next thing you should be willing to pay and average price of 350,00 € per night including breakfast. You should also accept that the rooms are very simple or spartan. There is no wallpaper. The walls look like visiting men at work. The furniture or interior design is very poor. Our room has only had a shower. The bottom is made out of planks!! These planks were shaky!! Shaky including noisy. It was not fixed in a correct way!!! The view out of the windows was very poor and it looks more like having a look through embrasures (loopholes). At breakfast you will not find a buffet. There is only one very small table where some items will be presented. You will get a small menu for breakfast. Then you can make your individual order. The service at breakfast was good. But I prefer a buffet then I can see what is offered and how it looks like. And I can take as much as I want to get. Of course the quality of breakfast was good. So everybody has his own taste or imagination how a breakfast should look like. The Bar is integrated in the lobby. It was not my favourite Hotel-Bar!",3,2014,10,11
15,Delightful hotel. Great location !!,"We ended our trip abroad with 4 days in Barcelona. This hotel was special. It was tucked away in the Gothic section of the city. It is a well appointed boutique hotel that gives you a feeling of experiencing the local flavor of the city. The rooms were very comfortable, although, my only complaint, is the lack of lighting; frustratingly dark. The staff was wonderful. They gave us good advice and great recommendations. The tapas bar was wonderful. The food and wine were great, as was the bartender. ",4,2014,10,11
15,"We loved our stay st the Mercer, it was soo nice and the service from everyone made us feel so welcome.","The concierge was friendly & professional. The tapas bar waiter attentive, as was the barman, in fact all staff were very good and my Aunty, my husband and I all felt this was a great hotel. My husband and I booked the Aire de Barcelona as an optional extra and it was amazing.  Would happily recommend it. ",5,2014,10,10
15,What a Hotel.,"We really enjoyed our stay - great location, great staff, understated, and a great bar / tapas / bistro attached. We made sure to visit the bar each evening where the wines were great - the local house red most recommended. 

Expensive thought really worth it.",5,2014,10,07
15,It's a keeper,"We stayed there for a week in September and are planning to return next year. I would have to say that the staff makes this hotel extra special, especially the front desk and concierge. Our room, 307, is well appointed with a very comfortable king size bed. My wife thought it was a little dark and could use more light. Breakfast is superb with many items to choose from. The old town location is perfect for walking to many of the must see attractions. Well worth every euro.",5,2014,10,04
15,Loved it,"Stunning hotel with amazing staff and wonderful service.

We had 4 nights here and loved it.  We had a room over looking the pretty courtyard.  The beds were super comfy.  The shower was wonderful along with the lovely Molton Brown products provided.

The staff were very helpful.  One staff member even called the local Irish bar to check if a certain football match would be on.  They provided maps with tips on were to eat and what to see.

The breakfast was more than enough to set you up for the day. May we recommend the fried eggs.  My husband had these every morning!

The hotel is little difficult to find but that didnt detract from our experience.  We loved every minute.  Thank you.",5,2014,10,03
15,Our favorite hotel. Exceeded our expectations!,"We just returned from Barcelona last night. My husband and I stayed at the hotel for two nights.  We just finished a six day bike tour in the Pyrenees so a cozy bed was a must. We were swept away by the impeccable service in every aspect....
.1) The check in (we were upgraded to a jr suite) and treated by the nicest concierge and front desk. 
2) the concierge provided terrific guidance and advice and selected two incredible restaurants. 
3) the room was one of the nicest rooms we have ever stayed in (we only stay at Four seasons or Ritz)   The bed was the best hotel bed. Linens and pillows were top notch. 
4) breakfast on the terrace was delicious!!
5) location.  Superb. Tucked away in the Gothic district   Private. Ideal location by being steps from the best restaurants and shops and site seeing spots.  

 We will not stay anywhere else but Mercer when we return to Barcelona.",5,2014,09,29
15,A Great Hotel in the Gothic Area,"My wife and I recently spent four nights at Mercer - our room (107), in the 4th century tower, is beautifully appointed and is very well-thought out and overlooks the ruins and relatively quiet back street. The staff were nice and friendly and made our stay very pleasant (for example, whilst talking to the concierge I mentioned that I Iiked reading the FT - the next day there was a copy in our room!). The restaurant overlooking the street serves great food.

The location is excellent - very close to historical sites in the Gothic Area, beach, restaurants, cafes and of course La Rambla.

Would highly recommend Mercer for discerning travelers.

Atul + Sangita

PS: if arriving by taxi, would recommend showing the driver the hotel's location on a map as very few have a clue where it is.",5,2014,09,29
15,Perfect boutique hotel in Barcelona,"My spouse and I spent 3 nights at this beautiful hotel tucked in the Gothic area of the city. We were greeted by Juan the concierge on our arrival and offered glasses of champagne to welcome us. It was quite warm for September but the rooms were super comfortable, very modern and well appointed. Our room was on second floor and overlooked the narrow quiet street below. The hotel has a rooftop lounge and plunge pool. There are many tapas restaurants in the area and the hotel has a nice restaurant as well. We were within easy walking distance from the beach and Las  Ramblas. Overall this was a great pick for our stay in Barcelona.",5,2014,09,26
15,Five-star brilliance at Mercer Barcelona!,"My husband and I spent a lot of time planning for our honeymoon, and we wanted to do it right. After a lot of discussion, we landed on the Mercer for our stay in Barcelona. I am thrilled to say, it lived up to our expectations, and then some. It was five-star brilliance!

The Mercer is a beautiful hotel. The location can't be beat, right in the heart of the gothic quarter.  The hotel is about three years old and is built right into an old Roman wall. The wall is a central feature of the hotel, which also highlights high ceilings and a modern clean aesthetic. I absolutely loved the feel of this 28-room hotel - small and boutique, private and quiet.

Our room took our breath away when we first entered. The bed is large and incredibly comfy, with a small terrace outside overlooking a central orange tree-filled patio in the middle of the hotel. I was a bit worried about noise carrying up to our second floor, but the terrace doors and blackout shutters were wonderfully sound proofed. I have never had a better sleep in a hotel in all of my travels!

The bathroom was separated from the bedroom by a ""floating wall"" so the room felt very open and there was lots of room for us to share the space. We marvelled at how the temperature was always just right the moment we turned on the large rain shower (no waiting for it to heat up). The Molton Brown toiletries and other bathroom amenities (soft bathrobes, slippers, and a fantastic hairdryer) were top notch.

But the real shining star of this hotel is the amazing staff. We received exceptional and personalized service from each and every staff member we spoke with during our five-night stay. One of the reasons we booked the Mercer was the Concierge service. The recommendations, tips and warmth we received made our trip go more smoothly than we could have ever managed on our own. We would have never found Montiel restaurant or had a perfect Gaudi day (perfectly booked, timed and mapped for us) without their help. One Concierge in particular deserves extra recognition. Joan Manel Salamanca was always there with a smile and made our foodie dream come true - getting us reservations at Tickets on our last night in Barcelona. We don't know how he did it, but we are forever grateful!

Another staff member also made an impression on us. Daniel is the bartender, an outstanding one! You just have to let him know the flavours you like, and he will make you something incredible. We can't believe the amount of work Daniel does.. he's all alone as bartender serving the terrace, the bar lounge and any other drinks throughout the hotel! Get this guy some help!

The hotel tapas bar - Le Bouchon - was really tasty and we loved the look and feel. We didn't try the restaurant for breakfast or dinner, mostly because there are so many options right outside the hotel that we wanted to explore.

The Mercer Barcelona and its incredible staff made our honeymoon a wonderful and perfect memory that we won't ever forget. We spent many days there thinking... how lucky and blessed are we to be able to stay at a hotel like this?? Perfection.",5,2014,09,26
15,Magnifico,"My husband and I spent two nights at the Mercer and couldn't have been happier.  Our room was very cool and contemporary yet it included a section from an ancient wall.  The staff was amazing, the food delicious and the location was perfect.  It was fun to go to the rooftop bar and sit and have a cocktail after a long day of sightseeing.   Although the hotel is actually off an alley and cars cannot enter, the staff took any inconvenience away from us and made it an easy transition from taxi to lobby.   We absolutely loved it and hated to leave.",5,2014,09,25
15,Worth the price.,"We chose this hotel because it had top ratings in Trip Advisor, but to tell you the truth, I was very nervous about spending 700 euros a night for a hotel. The hotel is small and located right in the middle of Old Town. It is a great location to get pretty much anywhere, but it is a block off the Main Street, so it is very quiet. It is fun to look out the windows at the tiny Old Town streets. One note on the location, though, Taxi's have a little trouble finding it when you are out and about and they are reticent to drive into the Old Town streets, so best to be dropped off a couple hundred yards away and walk in. A small price to pay for the lack of street noise. 

The hotel itself is perfectly renovated with a large courtyard in the middle that is seating for the restaurant. We had the Mercer Suite, which is this ridiculously large apartment with a sofa and dining table and separate bedroom. Our favorite part of the room was the two-person bath tub. It is perfect to cool off in after exploring the city each day.

Because it was expensive, I kept thinking during our stay, what more could they do? The answer is nothing! The service is really what sets this place apart.  From the champaign at check-in to the very attentive concierge, all of our needs were taken care of. One of the things we liked is that they serviced the room when it was convenient for us, not for them. Even if that was 5pm. We also opted to pay for breakfasts. This was a good choice as it included fantastic pastries, cakes, fruit, fresh-squeezed juice and a nice selection of hot entrees. And we discovered that we could order as much as we wanted all within the all-inclusive breakfast price and even have it delivered to our room if we wanted... which we did!

If you want to experience true luxury in the heart of Barcelona, this place can't be beat. Prepare to be pampered.",5,2014,09,23
15,Heart of the City,Hotel is the in the Gothic Quarter great location for sightseeing and shopping.  The staff is really friendly and eager to help.  They have a quiet rooftop bar for lounging.  Upgrade to the junior suites for they come with outdoor space.,5,2014,09,23
15,Great location. Great hotel.,"While it may be hard to find (our taxi driver had no idea!) it is worth the effort.
The location right in the centre of the Gothic quarter, is perfect for exploring the must see sights of Barcelona. The staff are very helpful and reflect the style of this luxury boutique hotel.
On the downside, our room was small and it is difficult to manoeuvre around two large suitcases!
Highly recommend providing you have small luggage!",4,2014,09,22
15,Perfect Peace in the Center of Barcelona,"Have just returned to the USA after 3 weeks visiting friends and family in England & Spain. By far, our 4 nights stay at the Mercer Hotel in Barcelona was the highlight of the whole trip! The Mercer is without question a marvelous, luxury, boutique hotel right in the centre of Barcelona's Gothic quarter. Initially hard to find when our taxi from the airport declined to navigate the narrow streets and gave us erroneous walking directions; However, once we found our bearings (helped in large part by the doormen at the Mercer), it was clear that the location was not only historic but also perfect. The room was very modern but comfortable and very nicely appointed. The Staff were exceptional, professional and personable. Difficult to single out any one because all were so nice and helpful but Jokasta in the breakfast restaurant / patio, Florencia in reception and Daniel in the bar and on the roof top pool terrace were worthy of special mention ...but that designation would apply to virtually everyone at The Mercer! The only disappointment was the 8.30 pm opening of the restaurant for dinner. Not really too unusual for Barcelona but perhaps a little too late for international guests. Whilst there were a number of earlier opening, fine restaurants in the vicinity, we missed what was said to be a very fine restaurant in the evenings at the Mercer. This hotel is definitely 'a keeper' and we truly look forward to a return visit.",5,2014,09,20
15,Incredible choice!,"I cannot speak highly enough of this hotel and the guest service. The staff is second to none! 
It was not easy to find from the train station, but it is in a great, central location. When the doorman realized we were looking for it, he met us down the street and carried our bags to our rooms. Everyone always met us with a smile and a genuine conversation of how we were enjoying our stay and the city. They are all multilingual, and always speak to you in your native tongue. Whatever we needed, they were always there for us. I would absolutely stay here for every future trip to Barcelona!",5,2014,09,17
15,As good as it gets,"Had a wonderful 5 night stay at the Mercer as a treat for my 50th birthday.  A warm and hearty welcome on arrival was matched by similar attention throughout the stay.  The staff were very attentive and happy to help with restaurant bookings (the Windsor for my big night - see separate review - on return I was met with cava and hand-made chocolates in the room) and other needs generally.
Our room was a junior suite - the layout was linear (bedroom, lounge and wardrobe area and bathroom) but works. Plenty of storage, plus a convenient curtained space to hide luggage etc.  Linens and towels of a high standard as you'd expect (niggle 1: the pillows are too soft and there wasn't an alternate) and well-stocked with toiletries by Moulton Brown.  Great shower (instant hot water and lots of it) and a soaking bath with bath-bomb for those who like that.  A mini-bar with soft drinks and water (complementary) topped it off.  Room service is prompt and efficient (but amounts of coffee etc not always consistent from day-to-day which is niggle 2).  Air conditioning is great (niggle 3: the outlets are in the bathroom which makes that end of the room very cool).  But all in all, a lovely room.

We didn't use the restaurant (closed Sunday and Monday btw) but did use Le Bouchon, the small tapas bar (the patatas bravas, croquettes and quice are highly recommended) which was nice (if a little pricey, but this is a luxury hotel).  The sun deck (with bar) is nice, but (the 8) sunbeds can be at a premium from mid-afternoon as the area is small even with only 28 rooms.  The pool is a plunge pool (waist depth), but works to cool off and to lounge in with a beer.

The hotel is clean and well maintained and has been designed well to fit with the old frontage and roman wall elements (use your camera, some great shots).  Most rooms look onto internal wells - these can be a little echo-ey (niggle 4) if your room overlooks the restaurant as ours did - but well-fitting shutters block out all light and most sound.

Finally, location: In the gothic quarter, moments from great restaurants and sights (arriving by car which nagigates down the tight access lanes between the 4-storey houses is an amazing way to see the hotel) and 10 minutes from the Cathedral, La Rambla and the marina makes this a great base for visiting the city.  Jaume 1 metro stop is around the corner which makes all the other major sights and shopping accessible (it's also a convenient landmark for you to use with taxi drivers who might otherwise not know where the hotel is in the maze of streets).  The drive from and to the airport was less than 20 minutes.",5,2014,09,16
15,Lovely hotel but..,"As I write this I'm conflicted about whether I'm being too harsh or not, but I basing my review purely on its No 1 rating on Tripadvisor for Barcelona. All you would expect from a 5 star - email prior to your arrival, a 3rd floor room as per my request plus their standard nice touch to celebrate my birthday.

The low was in connection with not being advised of the 300 yr celebration of Catalonian independence, as a result:
1) the shops were closed during 25% of our stay (last day also).

2) We advised of this by 'castle experience' staff who organised our 'Monserrat and wine tour'. When I returned to the hotel I asked concierge about this and as it was due to be a peaceful protest, it was downplayed and no notification of shop closure was advised. I made this known to concierge when we collected our bags on departure, he agreed this would have been a good idea. See 3) below for the reasons this wasn't done from what I can see.

3) We were using the 'Aerobus' as we do in cities in order to get our bearings so after we check-in we're then able to sighsee. I got the impression the staff are demanded by management not to recognise 'Areobus' and to promote their driver service, as the staff didn't even check the site to see what affect the protest would have on the airport bus routr on our last day. We were told instead to go the bus station and ask the driver. This left a sour taste for the second half of our stay. Whether we arrive by Airport Bus or driver, our money was good enough to be accepted.",2,2014,09,16
15,"Wonderfully comfortable, stylish and lovely staff.","We just had 5 nights in Barcelona staying at this über stylish hotel in the Gothic quarter of Barcelona. The room was stylish, of generous size for the buildings in the area, and wonderously comfortable. Being on the 1st floor the room was a little dark but you are in the gothic area where century old lane ways are so charming. The roof top deck and lunge pool were a significant plus for the hot afternoons. But what made the visit even more special was the absolute charm and helpfulness of all of the staff. Their help significantly increased the pleasure and seamlessness  of our stay. Special thanks to Daniel for his attention and wonderful cocktails. ",5,2014,09,12
15,"Perfect Hotel in Barcelona, A+ Location.... some staff need to go","Barcelona is my favorite city...besides London. I have stayed in a total of 5 hotels here. I find there to be many hotels available which are well priced and wonderful in this city, I am picky and have always been pleased. This hotel was the priciest but not by a lot. It is one of my favorites. I also love Pulitzer. They all have their charm and an excellent modern style. The W is an exception...it is excellent but could be anywhere...though the beach makes up for this! 
Mercer hotel: Absolutely lovely in design and history. rooms are super comfortable, stylish, and quiet due to incredible windows- which was very important to us as we were exhausted. It is tricky to find and on the way there, in an alley-like walking street, a con artist sprayed my coat with yellow goo...then tried to offer help saying it was a bird. This is a common distraction for pick-pockets in Spain so be very careful and aware. When we finally found the Mercer the bellman offered to have it dry-cleaned that day. All bellmen were super nice and fitting of the hotel. I can't say the same for Florencia, who was rude and told us we didn't need reservations at a restaurant...When we did. The bellman said we did. When we asked her about it and told her to better advise her next guests she made excuses and acted like waiting for 15 min outside (like we did thanks to her laziness and poor advice) should be fine for us!? she then said the hotel cannot make reservations. Yah, right. She could have told us to just call from our own phones...she never really apologized. We and the other guests she offended agreed that she is an embarrassment to the hotel.
The bartender at the negroni bar was also disappointing. Surely many bartenders would kill for his job and remember who was the guest and who was the server. 
The Mercer is in walking distance from some great restaurants..I think we tried them all! the room service foie gras is very tasty, as are their salads. This hotel has been a dream we really enjoyed the rooms and the location and front desk staff as well as door staff. Housekeeping did an excellent and detailed job keeping the room fresh...Mercer, you are amazing...just fire those two who think they are more important than they are.",5,2014,09,11
15,"""Exceptional experience""","When I made my reservations I asked for a suite with a view as my wife and I were celeberating our 50th anniversary. When we checked in we were told that they had upgraded us to their preium suite at no additional charrge. As we entered the room we found the entire bed and pillows covered in rose petals and, as if that was not enough when we returned to the room later that evening there was a bottle of champagne in a bucket of ice and a plate of gourmet chocolates by the bed. What a touch. I can also say without any reservations that the accommodations and staff were superb. You may pay a bit more for this hotel but it is worth every penny.",5,2014,09,10
15,Exceeded expectations,Have just spent 5 nights at this fabulous hotel in the heart of gothic Barcelona. The location is outstanding. The room was tastefully appointed. There was not much natural light in the room but this is the trade off for staying in this exquisite historical building. The rooftop terrace and plunge pool are a bonus. A special mention needs to be made about the staff who were without exception delightful to deal with. From the friendly door men to the outstanding assistance provided by the front desk staff and thank you to housekeeping for the red rose placed in our room on the 3rd night.  Highly recommend getting Daniel to make you up a cocktail. His skills are impressive and we really appreciated his efforts to please us. Overall highly recommended. Will come back.,5,2014,09,10
15,Excellent,"Not much to add to what has been written.  My wife and I stayed there for 4 nights.  Two thing to highlight: in addition to being stylish, comfortable and very clean, the rooms are very quiet, which is increasingly uncommon in hotels.  And Danny at the rooftop pool / lounge makes truly excellent, artistic cocktails (gin and tonic is amazing).  I travel for a living, and this hotel really stands out.",5,2014,09,10
15,Excellent boutique hotel in the heart of the Gothic quarter,Really comfortable and stylish hotel in the heart of the Gothic quarter - within walking distance of all the main attractions and yet quiet and very beautiful/atmospheric area. Particularly liked the hotel breakfast - delicious food served in stylish setting - and the rooftop bar and plunge pool - a lovely way to relax after a days work / sight seeing. The concierge was also very helpful with good local restaurant and tapas bar recommendations and organising taxis etc. - would definitely stay here again,5,2014,09,09
15,Outstanding Hotel,"This hotel ticks all the boxes! As a fussy traveller, in particular when it comes to accommodation, there is not one fault with this hotel. Location is fantastic without being too 'touristy' great tapas bar, lovely staff and rooms are stunning. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,09,07
15,Superb mix of modern and traditional in wonderful location,"Excellent boutique hotel in the centre of Barcelona. Our two rooms on the first floor were an exceptional mix of modern comfort and traditional architecture.  The breakfast was first class, the location perfect for a short stay in the city but the best was the staff and how we were treated. Nothing was ever too much trouble and they all went the extra mile to make our stay memorable.  Expensive but worth the money.  Will certainly make a return visit.",5,2014,08,30
15,Amazing design and ambiance - loved it,"Wow!  One of the best hotel rooms I have ever experienced.  From an architectural and design perspective, this hotel is a masterpiece.  Understated and elegant.  Service was spot on.  I certainly appreciated the cold water with ice and towel every morning when I returned from my runs too!  Highly recommend.",5,2014,08,30
15,Greatest Barcelona experience possible,"For the second year in a row, my wife and family stayed at the Mercer (no relation to the NYC hotel). A gorgeous mix of modern and historical, with a roof pool and bar that is heaven on earth, service that is unparalleled, a restaurant that is itself a destination among stylish barcelona folk, rooms that are stunning and huge by city standards, this is a hotel that delivers on all fronts. The price is insanely reasonable for the quality you receive. I would stay here again in a heartbeat rather than stay at some corporate hotel (hotel arts, mandarin oriental, etc). 

It a boutique hotel with class, style, beauty and heart. 

Here's just an example: I stupidly left something in our rental car in Italy. I waited until I got to the mercer to try to sort out what everyone else said was impossible. They took the information, made the calls, negotiated with the Italians, and got my property back. All after I checked out. They could have said ""sorry: impossible"", but instead they happily helped and made the impossible possible. This is a gem among gems. ",5,2014,08,27
15,Truly world class. Amazing hotel.,"Without being too wordy, I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Wonderful rooms, huge bathrooms, central location yet very quiet. Everything and more you could want. Don't miss the pool and terrace.",5,2014,08,27
15,Wonderful but pricey hotel,"Hotel is in a beautiful area, right in the heart of the gothic area.  Easy walking distance to various sites and bicycles to rent within 4 blocks of the hotel.  We were in a smaller sized room (a superior), on the street side and in the morning it was quite noisy with street chatter.   The bathroom shower area is not private (if that matters to you).  Adjoining tapas restaurant and bar, along with their staff, are very good.  Room service is not worth the $$ as is very expensive so if you need a late night/early morning snack get it before you return.  Pool area is nice and chill.  Bartender from the downstairs bar works a bar set up there in the afternoon/early evening.  Concierge that greeted us on arrival was great, welcoming and helpful.",4,2014,08,24
15,Delightful in a lovely location,"We arrived over an hour before check-in time and were greeted warmly, and were happy to leave our bags while we went off to explore the mediaeval area of Barcelona.  I should also add that the gentleman who greeted us was happy to look after our son's bag too, even though he wasn't staying at the same hotel.

The location is excellent - a stroll away from Barceloneta, the Ramblas, and most of the main tourist attractions - but for me the main attraction of Barcelona is the Barri Gotic and this hotel is smack in the middle of it.

The hotel itself is an old building which has been very sympathetically refurbished in a modern style but showing off the building's origins.  Our room (206) was spacious and bright.  I read the comment about the bedside lamps, but if ours were the same design they had a dimmer switch and at their brightest were more than adequate.  

What sets this hotel apart for me was the service.  From the fantastically warm greeting to check out, our needs were anticipated and acted on.  We asked for restaurant recommendations for somewhere laid back (our son only had shorts) with good seafood, and were given three choices, each with differing merits which were highlighted and discussed.  For me, the only downside of the Mercer was that we drove there and those mediaeval streets are very very narrow.  I lost some sleep the night before we left, panicking about driving out of that labyrinth.  When I said this to the receptionist at check out, he told me not to worry, that he would contact the gentleman who was bringing back our car and it would be left at the back of the hotel for me.  This was a much broader street and a much easier route for me.  

The next time I am in Barcelona, I hope to stay here again - I cannot recommend it highly enough.",5,2014,08,22
15,5+ rating - Best Hotel,My husband and I stayed at the Mercer Hotel in Barcelona in August.  It is a beautiful hotel and all the staff are excellent.  The food is superb and the service second to none.  The roof top pool and bar is a nice place to relax after sightseeing.  The rooms are perfect and very clean.  The concierge staff are fabulous and always had top recommendations of restaurants and attractions.  We would highly recommend this hotel and we will come back to stay there again.,5,2014,08,22
15,Beautiful Gem tucked Away,"My fiancé and I stayed at the Mercer in late March 2014.  We got kind of nervous when the taxi driver told us to walk down a very narrow and dark alley because the street was too narrow for the cab to go through.  We walked about a block and came to this beautiful, very old but completely lovely hotel in the alley.  The hotel is surrounded by many tapas restaurants is near a central area of Barcelona full of restaurants and coffee and tea shops.  It is also within walking distance of the harbor.  The room was lovely. We got a suite, which was spacious with a large comfy bed, plenty of room and a nice bathroom.  The bathroom is not closed off so there is no privacy if that is a concern for anyone.  We didn't eat in the hotel because there was too much going on around us.  The staff was super helpful.  They helped us tickets to a soccer game and also to a flamenco dance and music show at the national music palace that was a wonderful experience.   I would go back in a heartbeat.",5,2014,08,19
15,urban heaven,"My expectations were exceeded. A beautifully restored heritage building in the heart of the Gothic Quarter with a service standard that 5 and 6 star hotels would die for. The interior is beautiful, elegant and contemporary. Everyone who works at the hotel knows and loves Barcelona, were extremely professional yet warm and accessible. I cannot fault anything, enjoy a drink on the rooftop bar listening to beautiful music and make sure you try every piece of Tapas delivered from the restaurants downstairs. Breakfast in the courtyard is a beautiful way to start any day in Barcelona. If only more hotels were like The Mercer.",5,2014,08,17
15,The best hotel I have ever been,"The Mercer hotel is excellent in all ways!  It is extremely well-located in the beautiful and charming gothic quarter so you can walk to many of the attractions in Barcelona. The architecture is a lovely blend of ancient Roman ruins with modern amenities. Our stay was so good... Also the staff was superb, Stefan, Florentina, Juan Manuel...

In the late afternoons, we enjoyed staying on the superb rooftop deck enjoying a glass of wine or cava. Excellent!!!!!",5,2014,08,15
15,Lovely 3 night stay in Barcelona,"We stayed here for 3 nights in August. The hotel is situated in the Gothic part of Barcelona with easy walking access to bars, restaurants, shopping, museums and the beach. The hotel seems small but has two restaurants, a cocktail bar, outside courtyard eating and a small pool and terrace bar. Our room overlooked the small courtyard and was nicely decorated, spacious, clean and well appointed and the mini bar was restocked daily with non-alcoholic drinks. The staff were lovely, very friendly and helpful. It was my Partners 50th birthday and we received a lovely bottle of champagne with compliments from the hotel, which was an unexpected but lovely surprise. We would definitely recommend this lovely hotel and will return the next time we visit Barcelona.",5,2014,08,15
15,3 night visit with 10 year old son,"Superb, well located, excellent service. 

The fusion of old and new is very well done. Our deluxe room looked over the courtyard garden on 3rd floor. It was spacious and stylish. 

The concierge was charming and particularly helpful in suggesting and booking restaurants and other activities. 

I will definitely return with my wife.....I have my eyes on one of the suites!!

",5,2014,08,14
15,best stay in Barcelona,"beautiful hotel, genuine staff, perfect location.
I stayed at Mercer Hotel with my daughter (15) for two days in august.
From the moment we were greeted by the doorman I realized I had picked the right hotel.",5,2014,08,14
15,Superb stay,"My husband and myself have stayed at Mercer 5 nights beginnging of june 2014 with our 6 weeks old daughter and the hotel was superb: the location was perfect to explore the city, the staff was very helpful, especially to accomodate the needs of our daughter. The hotel itself is very beautiful and the rooms decorared tastefully with design furniture. the rooftop terras is great, very relaxing with a nice swimming pool and the drinks and food are fantastic. The tapas bar is great! 

When we left, we noticed that a bag containing a Tintin tshirt we had bought as a gift for our 13 years old son was missing, and after i sent the hotel an email, they went to the store located on the same street and retrieved the same tshirt we have chosen and sent it to our home adress, without charging us for the expenses, which was a really classy move.

Would definitely return.",5,2014,08,08
15,Good location and top notch staff,"After much research and based on feedback we found on trip advisor and other travel websites, my husband and I decided to stay at the Mercer Hotel for our very first to Spain. We were so glad we did!

The hotel itself is an architectural marvel built on top of Roman ruins. Make sure to see the cellars and dining area in the hotel's restaurant/breakfast area. Check in was a breeze, the concierge was super friendly and offered us Cava champagne, which I indulged in even if it was a bit early in the day. 

We chose a deluxe room and since our stay was for four nights we were given complimentary tapas vouchers at the tapas place next door called Le Bouchon. Overall thoughts on the room: size of room was quite comfortable, bed and bathroom space quite creative (look on the website's room 360 view), Molton Brown amenities (love them), double glass windows that block the noise out from the busy street below. Wish we had an electric kettle so we could make tea in the room instead of having to order room service every time, but the daily complimentary water bottles, juices and soda made up for it. One quam about the shower was that it tended to overflow and seep out to the room floor. But once we complained, the staff was right on it and fixed the problem. 

We didn't get to eat at the restaurant but did have breakfast there. A bit pricey for the limited spread offered compared to other boutique hotels we've been to. But the quality of the food was good and waiter was very attentive. It was nice to have breakfast served warm to our table rather than having to queue at the breakfast table. 

Location wise, this place is just smack in the middle of downtown. Walking distance to Las Ramblas and Boqueria Market as well as to the Barcelona Cathedral and to the seaside. 

Concierge felt very personalized, and we got good recommendations about how to spend our time in Barcelona, got help with restaurant booking, tickets and reservations for tour buses, etc.
Check out was also effortless and concierge helped us again to book a taxi and make sure we had plenty of time to get to the train station and catch our train to Madrid. 

Overall very happy with the hotel and service and would stay at the Mercer if we ever get to visit again.",5,2014,08,07
15,Hard to Beat,Recently returned from staying at this super hotel.  We had a room on the 3rd floor facing the vertical planted wall.  Nicely stylish with a rough painted feature wall and painted beams.  Simple but very comfortable and great rain shower.  The lighting is highly imaginative too..  Only wish it had a coffee maker.  The breakfast was great - though it was hard to do it justice if you enjoyed a marvellous dinner at one of Barcelona's great restaurants the night before!!  The service was very attentive and friendly - they always went the extra mile.  Not to mention the fantastic location which was hard to beat - and literally a couple minutes walk to the metro.  Definitely highly recommend this hotel.,4,2014,08,05
15,Best in Barca,Excellent in all ways !!!! We been so good taking care of. From the minute we steped in Stefan in the door greated us and reception service and also Florentina gave us the best of service. Thanks from the Lack family !,5,2014,08,05
15,An excellent choice in Barcelona!,"The Mercer hotel is excellent!  It is extremely well-located in the beautiful and charming gothic quarter so you can walk to many of the attractions in Barcelona.  The architecture is a lovely blend of ancient Roman ruins with modern amenities.  Our room faced the center courtyard and was very quiet.  Barcelona was our first stop on our trip to Spain and we were thankful to have such a quiet room with such a comfortable bed to help us quickly recover from jet lag. Everything was spotless and fresh and we appreciated the wonderful shower and separate large tub in the bathroom.  One suggestion to the hotel: The towels are plush and large which is great but there should be some extra towel racks in the bathroom.

The service was excellent, especially Juan Manuel and the women at the front desk who greeted us upon our arrival.  Juan Manuel gave us a tour of the hotel and showed us to our room.  He was extremely polite and personable and he made a very positive impression on us.  We also enjoyed visiting with Jocaste (sp?) our lovely server at breakfast each morning.  She was very friendly, professional and polished and we really appreciated her service each morning.  The breakfast was truly delicious and there were a variety of options to choose from.  We loved listening to the church bells ringing nearby as we ate breakfast in the courtyard.  We ordered room service for one of our meals (a late lunch) and was also delicious.

In the late afternoons, we enjoyed sitting on the lovely rooftop deck while enjoying a glass of wine.  There is a very nice pool on the roof, though it is small - like a lap pool or plunge pool - but certainly very refreshing and very pretty.

Everything at the hotel was outstanding except for one of the concierges who proved to be a disappointment.  We wanted to go to the Park Guell and we asked the concierge how to get there on the Metro.  Though he seemed nice enough, we were disappointed to discover that he didn't give very thorough directions as to how to get from the metro to the park once we arrived at our stop.  We got very lost and wasted time walking around trying to find the park entrance for close to an hour.  Also, while we were able to see some Gaudi buildings at the park, the main attraction required tickets and the line was - and usually is - a wait of an hour or more.  Unfortunately, I think he wasn't a very experienced concierge because, if he had been, he would've pointed out the fact that the wait is a long one and he would've made the extra effort to get us tickets online in advance.  Other than that, however, we absolutely love this hotel and we recommend it without hesitation!",5,2014,08,04
15,the best!!,"To put this review in context, I am a bit of a hotel snob.  The Mercer is a true 5-star hotel from the hotel itself to the exceptional service to the PERFECT location.  Roof top pool & bar is small and classy & has nice views & excellent drinks/snacks.  Breakfast was included and had lots of gluten-free options. The hotel is on a very small street in the middle of the Gothic district which is a perfect location to walk to many of the great sights in Barcelona.  It is also easy to get to a cab or the subway if you want to go out to the beaches or say to Montjuic.  Only negative would be that the high ceilings and stone/stucco walls inside do not dampen sound very well, so you can sometimes hear your neighbors.  We stayed in a huge beautiful suite - room 301.",5,2014,07,31
15,Perfect location!!,"I expected a great hotel and everything surpassed our expectations. Staff at the front are very helpful, beatiful room and great location close to many attractions and restaurants.The restaurant is superb I strongly recommend.",5,2014,07,30
15,Beautiful boutique hotel in Barcelona,"What a find! Gorgeous personal hotel right in the heart of the old cIty of Barcelona, the Barri Gotic. The hotel building incorporates part of the original Roman walls, dating back to the 1st century. Only 28 rooms, each with its own hidden treasure, part of the original heritage of the site.
Perfect location, quiet and surrounded by a maze of medieval lanes to wander in and discover the heart of Barcelona.
Staff were amazingly attentive, from doorman (Mathias), concierge, barman in Le Bouchon (tapas bar), and bubbly staff at breakfast each morning. They think of all the little nice touches; complimentary water, juice & soft drinks in your bar fridge replenished everyday, free wifi throughout the entire hotel; fantastic recommendations of restaurants and local businesses (hairdresser Christine 2 mins walk away) and their all round professional but friendly manner whenever we saw them.
A must stay for any visitor to Barcelona who wants an extremely personalised and luxurious stay in a fabulous Mediterranean City.",5,2014,07,29
15,Charming hotel in an old gothic building.,"In the heart of the Gothic quarter; can be hard to find--even for taxi drivers due to narrow streets. But worth the hunt. The old building was gutted. Small hotel. Excellent and attentive service--very helpful staff with restaurant selections and touring possibilities. Rooms are modern and simply furnished--small to moderate in size, but ample unless you spend a lot of time there. small rooftop pool and terrace. No fitness facility but lots of walking opportunities.",5,2014,07,28
15,Outstanding small hotel,"Mercer hotel, in the heart of the old town of central Barcelona was excellent: great location, very modern, but comfortable design and rooms, fantastic staff.  The staff were extremely helpful with our many requests for information, attractions, routes, luggage, car parking and restaurants.  The hotel and its people made our stay in Barcelona one of the highlights of our travels in Spain.",5,2014,07,25
15,BEST HOTEL EVER!,"We went to the Mercer Hotel with 4 other friends as a fun gateway week end and a break from the children for 4 days. It was also my husbands' birthday the day we arrived. From the minute we stepped in the hotel, we were greeted by the most friendliest of staff. The hotel smelled beautiful and the cool air was welcomed! We were offered a complimentary glass of cava and because we booked through Mr and Mrs Smith, we were also offered a tapas styled lunch and wine on behalf of Mr and Mrs Smith. It was delicious. We all had booked junior suites and were showed to our rooms. Each one had a balcony and the room were luxurious and stylish. We then went to have a drink on the roof terrace where we were all pleasantly surprised by the size of the pool, we all assumed that it was smaller than it actually was. We had a swim and enjoyed the roof top views, the bar staff were too, extremely friendly. It was paradise and when we thought it couldn't get any better, on our return to our room, we had a knock on the door and we handed a bottle of Cava and some sweet treats on the house for my husbands birthday. We hadn't told them but they had noticed from his passport, such attention to its customers. This hotel continued to impress us throughout our stay, the breakfast was table served and delicious, the bed and bedding was the most comfortable bedding we had ever slept in..Honestly, I had never in my life slept so well. The hotel is stylish and impressive in its décor, everything is luxurious and comfortable.  The staff team is amazing and helpful. Nothing can be faulted! Outstanding place, I will tell the whole world about the Mercer and will never stay anywhere else in Barcelona!",5,2014,07,25
15,Gothic and Groovy,"My wife and I stayed here three nights. I loved the clever design which incorporated sections of the old roman walls into the building. Our room was chic and comfortable. One problem was that it overlooked the street below which meant we did here some noise at night time. The pool area on the top floor was excellent. The pool was shallow and of modest size but it allowed you to cool off. We ordered food from the rooftop bar but it was expensive and the club sandwich was not a club sandwich but four tasteless dollops of pastry with some side lettuce for 18 euros. Their French fries were great. We found the price they wanted for breakfast was way to expensive at over 30 euros per person. Instead we e found tapas bars within 150 metres that served fresh orange juice, delicious coffee and croissants. The hotel was a 20 minute walk from the beach and the hotel helpfully provided towels and a beach carry bag. The staff at the hotel were outstanding. They were always pleasant, helpful and courteous while allowing themselves to relax and enjoy a laugh with you. The location was excellent, with quality restaurants all around and interesting sights. I would recommend this hotel to others. Unrelated to the hotel, I would like to mention a problem that we had with World Airport Transfers who I paid in advance to meet us at Barcelona airport and drive us to the hotel. Their representative, Splash, did not show and WAT is not providing a refund. Be warned fellow travellers!",4,2014,07,25
15,Staying here as we speak ,Everything about this hotel is great. I have been to Barcelona a few time and each time I try a new place. I think I will come back to this one the next trip I have. I feel comfortable and at home. The staff is friendly and understand my special needs. It's hard for me to adjust my sleep schedule but they are very helpful in helping me create a dark atmosphere. ,5,2014,07,23
15,Perfect stay,"The Mercer Hotel is in an ideal location, in the Gothic area on a quiet, picturesque street and walkable to/from most sites.  From the moment we walked in, the service was perfect - the friendly, knowledgeable staff made our stay particularly memorable.  The concierge knew the exact location of every restaurant I asked about, marking my map with precision and making reservations for us when needed.  When the taxis went on strike the day of my mother's departure, the bellman walked her to the airport bus at Catalunya at 6:00 am.  When we arrived home and were missing the soccer shirt my son had proudly purchased with his own money (not the hotel's fault), the Mercer Hotel staff went out and purchased another shirt and shipped it to us in the U.S.!  We were upgraded to a beautiful suite, with an amazing bathroom, large living room and bedroom.  The room was well-appointed.  There is a bit of street noise and you can hear doors closing from the hallway.  The rooftop deck and very small pool are lovely - although the first day we had trouble getting chairs as it was crowded.  These are the only downsides I can think of (other than the price, it is expensive, both the rooms and the bar menu on the rooftop, e.g., 12 Euros for a smoothie).  Breakfast was delicious, and we ate at the restaurant attached to the hotel one evening, which was also very good.  We hated to leave this hotel - we felt spoiled, and also felt like it was home.  We will definitely return!",5,2014,07,22
15,Home Away From Home,"I ""lived"" at this hotel for one week and it was one of my best hotel experiences. Each day when I returned from work I felt like I was coming home. I ate nearly all of my dinners at the downstairs 'tavern', Le Bouchon. After a long day working at a teaching hospital, I wasn't feeling very adventurous and wanted to relax. The one night that I planned on having dinner in the restaurant, there was a private event, so...I ate at Le Bouchon, again. I enjoyed all of my meals, which were reasonably priced (Prior to my stay, I had spent 2 weeks in France so the prices were much less than what I had been used to).
When going to the hotel from the airport, print the directions on how to get to the front door. The hotel sent this to me in advance of my arrival, but I did not print them out, and had to hike uphill to get to the hotel's main entrance. I did not speak Spanish well enough to explain directions through the Gothic quarter, and made the assumption that every taxi driver knows their way around the Gothic quarter. I was traveling on business for one month in the winter, so I had quite a bit of weight to drag up the hill AND it had just started raining when I started my trek.
Anything that I needed - a place to re-pack my bag after I had checked out, store my luggage for the weekend while I took a quick trip to Bilbao and San Sebastian, directions, taxi, extension cord for my room...I just had to ask and the Mercer staff delivered. My room overlooked the inner courtyard and they had fantastic black-out shutters so that my room was like a cave when I went to sleep.
Every day I walked to the metro to travel to work and it was a beautiful and easy walk. 
When I think of hotels that I want to return to one day for vacation, the Mercer Barcelona is on my list. Thank you!",5,2014,07,22
15,Great location,"We had a really lovely stay at the Mercer. The location is excellent, lots of unique little boutiques, bars, restaurants, massage parlour and places to rent bikes (10 euros/day) near by, a short stroll to the Ramblas and a 10 minute walk to the train station. The staff and service was excellent. Had a junior suite, was much smaller than expected and for the price paid, and not brilliant lighting. Really wish I had requested a room with the stone wall feature as that truly is the charm of the hotel and what we were looking forward to.",4,2014,07,22
15,Pure joy ,"I really enjoyed this hotel and would say it's one of the best places I have stayed at over the years, the rooms are great , meals top notch , staff are so helpful and bend over backwards to help you every day. We stayed 5 nights and could have stayed on more! Loved how everything wasn't a drama and so chilled made it a great time for us both. Would def come back again ",5,2014,07,21
15,Amazing hotel,"One of two ""monument"" hotels in the Bari Gotic, the Mercer is built into the Roman wall that surrounded the original settlement that became Barcelona.  The location, on one of the small winding passages in the Gothic quarter -- you can't even tell that it's a hotel until you are standing at the entrance -- is very cool and very convenient.  The interior is very modern, but the walls of some rooms reveal the old stone from Roman and medieval times.  Great rooms, fantastic rain shower, and exceedingly quiet.  But despite all of the comforts and great amenities, it was the fabulous, helpful, friendly service that stands out.  I can honestly say that I've never felt more at home in a hotel ever.  The entire staff is friendly and helpful, but Isidro, who was the Guest Relations manager in the afternoon and evening, stood out.  Starting from arranging a transfer from the train station so that we would not have to try to find the hotel at night in the rain (most taxi drivers will not try to drive these narrow lanes and will drop guests a couple of blocks away), to the glass of cava at check in, to making spot on restaurant recommendations and getting us tables (and even having someone walk us to the restaurant on our last night so that we would not get lost and so they would ensure that we really would have our table), we've never felt so well cared for in a hotel.  I can't wait to return and would never try any other hotel in Barcelona.",5,2014,07,20
15,Exactly what I was hoping for in Barcelona,This hotel was exactly the kind of place you want to come back to after walking around the city all day.  It's close to everything and is an easy walk to the beach. The rooms are very nicely done.  They were so comfortable that we were happy to stay in when it rained.  The rooftop deck perfect for a lazy afternoon.  It was really the staff that made our stay great.  It felt like they knew us and it made the hotel a little bit more like home.,5,2014,07,20
15,"Outstanding hotel, superb service and great location","My wife and I used the Mercer Hotel as a base for a recent vacation to Spain. We stayed there 3 times over 3 weeks. The hotel cannot be faulted in any way. The service is superb with all staff prepared to go out of their way to help. The rooms were great. The location is fantastic, really convenient for exploring el Born (awesome shopping and restaurants) and the Bari Gothic. Do not think about staying anywhere else as this hotel is very special.",5,2014,07,20
15,"Special  location, superb staff!","Our visit last week to Barcelona was only enhanced byt the wonderful Mercer Hotel. Wonderful boutigue hotel.   It is in the heart of the Gothic area in Old town Barcelona. We had fun exlploring all the diffrent finds in the hotel as it was renovated out of old ruins.  We even had a view of a dig taking place that we could see from our balcony.  It is a very special place to explore, you never get bored
From the moment I made the reservation in Feb, the staff was a help in securing dinner reservations in resturants I found and even suggested some they know of.  They arranged for a private tour the day we arrived so we could acclimate ourselves with the city. 
We know we are returning to Barcelona and we will look no further than Mercer Hotel!
Bravo for a wonderful jom",5,2014,07,16
15,One in a million!,"The mercer hotel is simply perfect in every way! Every detail is fine tuned and the service is exceptional. A few things I think are worth a mention are... 

Delicious breakfast where you can order whatever you like 

A bed so comfy I actually never wanted to get up (the linen is amazing!) 

Staff members who literally will do anything for you and go out of their way to make you feel welcome 

Beautiful amenities in the room and special treats each night before bed 

Books galore to look at 

A beautiful rooftop pool 

The building is built into the old remains of the roman walls to the city 

I am actually staying here at the hotel now. I never write reviews on trip advisor but this place is so amazing I wanted to tell the world about it! The best hotel I have stayed at! The mercer has gotten everything right! 
",5,2014,07,14
15,Very nice!,"My daughter and I stayed here for 7 nights. Very classy, elegant hotel in the middle of the Gothic area. Excellent location. Staff are amazing, very helpful and most speak English. Florencia and Emmanuel in concierge were awesome...always willing to help. This hotel has a homely feel which reminds me of the Portrait suites in Rome. 
Only minor negatives were no gym, but the DIR gym was within 20 min walk, and the shower water temp was really lukewarm. I highly recommend this hotel with no reservations!
",5,2014,07,14
15,Oasis of calm,"Just got back from a four night stay at this hotel.  Can't fault it at all.  Superior service and attention to detail.  The hotel is spotlessly clean and smells amazing.

We stayed in a first floor room with a balcony overlooking the courtyard where breakfast was served.  The room was a good size and married the contempory with the new seamlessly.  The mini bar was always stocked with free cokes, waters and juices which we found invaluable when coming in from the hot weather.  The beds are amazing, you will get a good night sleep here!

The hotel is ideally located in the Gothic quater and everything is a short walk away.  We didn't try any of the resturants as we prefer to try and eat in local eateries but they did look good.

I would stay at this hotel again, it was my oasis in the middle of Barcelona!",5,2014,07,14
15,"Pretty nice, but not nice enough for the price","The place is capital-A classy. Well decorated, carefully designed and curated, well appointed with very friendly staff. It is a Very Nice hotel if that's what you're looking for. (We paid 710 euros for two nights in July.) It's also in a tremendous neighborhood, far enough away from La Rambla to avoid the noise and tomfoolery.

But every little thing costs a lot of money. Breakfast is 25 or 30 euros. The bartender on the roof told me that the entry level price for a cocktail would be 14 euros, and it wasn't clear he was familiar with the cocktail I wanted. 

Fortunately, the neighborhood is packed with great eats and drinks, so we took advantage to get out of the room and enjoy the more affordable, more focused offerings of the rest of the gothic and born neighborhoods.  As a result, what the hotel actually had on offer to someone without a fire in their wallet felt pretty bare bones. 

On the rooms, they're quite nice if not spacious, but they carry noise incredibly. Our neighbors could hear my wife knock on our door better than I could. And I had trouble sleeping through a loud dripping noise in the plumbing both nights (which only ceased around 3am last night). Finally, I'm pretty sure most wives wont appreciate the incredibly skinny toilet seat surrounding the huge basin. All of these just seem like obvious knocks against a hotel priced similarly to some of the world's most esteemed, relatively flawless properties. 

The experience didn't justify the price. We're currently staying at Casa Camper for a little over half the price and have been blown away by the amenities, in comparison.",3,2014,07,12
15,Class act all the way!,"I found this hotel based on the reviews from Trip advisor and the fact that is was rated #1 for Barcelona.   Boy am I glad I followed this advice.   I can't say enough about this amazing hotel.   First off, the location.   We were able to walk EVERYWHRE from the hotel.    Shopping, sightseeing, the market, and great restaurants all around.  The staff totally went out of their way to accommodate us with anything that we asked for.  When we returned at night, it felt like we were coming home and were greeted with warm smiles. They remembered where we were headed when we left and asked about our evening when we returned.   The hotel's architecture is stunning and has a really cool vibe to it with lots of history.   The rooms were unique and stylish.   Really enjoyed  the roof top terrance for an evening cocktail before heading out to dinner.  The only regret we have is that we were there for just one night.  Will defiantly stay longer next time.    Thanks Hotel Mercer for making the start of our girls trip through Europe a fabulous stay.",5,2014,07,11
15,great stay,"located in the old city and conveniently close to all main attractions, the tapas restaurant was very good. Our suite was spacious and elegant and we had great views from our window.
staff -very happy and helpful and overall we had a great stay.
it is true we didn't spend too much time indoor, but everything was comfortable and well apointed.",5,2014,07,11
15,Muy Excellente!!!,"All around excellent hotel! Top notch! Location, ambiance, accommodations, food/drink, service & warm hospitality were all quite fabulous! The most comfortable beds ever! EXCELLENT!  So comfortably designed with great taste. Understated modern luxury in the heart of the oldest most romantic part of town. Easily accessible to all. The most lovely and warm staff made our stay a wonderful experience!",5,2014,07,10
15,Cpalomar,"The hotel is located on a quiet narrow street in the old city, an ideal location for walking. The interiors are very fresh and attractive. Our room was quiet and very clean with very high ceilings. The tapas restaurant at the hotel is excellent. The roof bar has beautiful views and is an excellent place for a late afternoon glass of wine before heading out to dinner. What rounded off the five star rating we have given is the very attentive and helpful service we received from the staff. If you are not sure where you want to go for dinner and want to experience some of Barcelona's best cooking, put yourself in the hands of the concierge.",5,2014,07,10
15,Mercer in the Gothic- Very Nice,The Mercer hotel is nicely situated in the Gothic area within walking distance to many sites and eats. The service was very warm and friendly and the rooms are nicely decorated and clean. The outdoor pool and patio are very nice and relaxing.,5,2014,07,09
15,Luxurious!,"I should have written this review immediately after my stay in Sept 2013. The positives started from the moment we arrived. The staff was fantastic, very accommodating, and friendly. I loved the decor and mix of old and new. The room was luxurious & quiet and the bed & pillows were the best I've ever experienced in a hotel. The only small complaint would was the toilet which was possibly too modern.",5,2014,07,07
15,Loved the Hotel Mercer,"We just got back from Barcelona where we stayed for six days, all at the Hotel Mercer.  We loved everything about it.  First and most important, the location is fantastic.  The Gothic quarter is by far my favorite part of the city.  The hotel atmosphere is very calm.  The rooms are sparkling clean, the beds and pillows VERY comfortable, breakfast wonderful and the rooftop terrace is charming.  The staff was always helpful.  We would absolutely recommend this hotel.  The only thing that wasn't great.....the toilets!  Unusual seat design, but we got used to it.  Everything else.....excellente!",5,2014,07,07
15,There's a reason they are #1,"We just returned from several days of pure luxury. Everything and everyone exude quality.   Many places try to handle all the little things but here's a hotel that excels in those finer points. Even the interior and architectural design are outstanding. - an amazing blending of Roman,  Medieval and modern 

From our initial reception, to service in the restaurant and pool and throughout our stay, we always felt like VIPs.

We were even able to have a masseuse come to our room for afternoon treatments with little to no warning.  

The pool deck is small but totally appropriate for the size of the hotel. It felt like something that you could have on a roof top if you had a penthouse condominium.  The bartenders were all terrific offering custom drinks to ensure you received what you wanted. There was a vodka on the shelf I never saw and was interested so I asked if I could taste a bit. Well it was a generous pour so much that I shared some with my wife.  And here' what is surprising, there was no charge. What other place would do this?  Really, the entire time we all felt as though everyone was there to take care of us, despite being there with a full hotel. 

There are many places to eat in the City but do make sure you find time to eat here.

We can't wait to return and when we do, it will absolutely be at the Hotel Mercer! ",5,2014,07,06
15,"A+ aesthetic, but a C in functionality","We stayed at the Mercer Barcelona based on the rave reviews and Traveler ""Hot List"".
The hotel is in a great location in the Barri Gothic section and next to the Born, two of the best areas to be in for the restaurants, cafes, sightseeing etc.The hotel design is contemporary and appealing in contrast to the old architecture in the Barri Gothic.  The staff was excellent, especially the concierge staff who were very helpful with directions, reservations etc.The downside to staying at this hotel and why we wouldn't return are the room amenitites :the lighting in the room was terrible, the bedside lights are not practical if you want to read, the light at the small desk was dim, and the lighting in the bathroom was insufficient, down bed pillows were worn out.",3,2014,07,06
15,This is a fabulous boutique hotel with excellent service and within walking distance to many sites.,I stayed at this lovely hotel with my family of four. From the moment we arrived in the taxi we were treated with 5 star service. The doorman and concierge greeted us when we arrived and instantly made us feel welcome.  Both rooms that we stayed in were lovely. We were even pleasantly surprised to have one room upgraded to a junior suite.  This room was even larger with a private terrace and rooftop garden with loungers and a table.  Our stay was highlighted with a special event gourmet dinner in their restaurant. The food was amazing! I highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Barcelona!  It's location within the Gothic area added to its charm!  You won't be disappointed!,5,2014,07,06
15,Wonderful Boutique Hotel!,"The hotel was hard to find in the beginning as it is hidden within the old walls in one of the small little streets. Despite that, the very welcoming service you get the moment you reached the hotel doors make us feel we made the right choice. A cosy hotel where everyone recognizes us and always on hand when we need help. 

The hotel staff from guest relations to the porter is always there to help with recommendations, reservations, and anything we may need help on. This is by far a most comfortable stay, exceeding the services usually expected at a regular corporate hotel. Perhaps this is why they are so well rated. 

Overall, we loved our stay here and would not hesitate to book again.",4,2014,07,03
15,VERY SPECIAL HOTEL !!,"Extremely beautiful and modern . We were greeted by an excellent Concierge , who explained all we needed to know as we have been to Barcelona before . Breakfast in the courtyard was superb ( yogurt parfait , delicious  ) . Staff friendly , bed fabulous .. mostly the feeling you have staying in a restored .. historical period building ! My husband loved his beer , sunning himself next to the rooftop pool .. as I shopped ! Lydia Shire  PS: I wish the cab drivers were a little more helpful in dropping us off , they were not too keen driving into Barri Gotic w/ it's tiny streets .",5,2014,07,03
15,Wonderful hotel,"My wife and I booked a Junior Suite for 6 nights for our honeymoon and we loved it - it's a special hotel.  The staff were first class - perfectly attentive, always helpful and never intrusive.  We booked a Junior Suite and the room was great - more than enough space and hands-down the biggest and most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.  The hotel is small which gives it a friendly, intimate and relaxed feel - and it smells fantastic... every time you walk in off the street the unique fragrance they use to scent the lobby is the first thing that hits you, along with a welcomed sense of calm.  We had dinner in the hotel restaurant one night and it was tremendous, really first class.  We also opted to include breakfast in our deal which was a great move - definitely worth the extra!  I would not hesitate to recommend the Mercer.",5,2014,06,30
15,Very friendly boutique hotel,"We spent 5 nights here for our first visit to this lovely city. It's in the heart of the old city, and only opened about 6 months ago. It's built into the old city walls, with features of the walls left prominent in different parts of the hotel. 
All the staff are very friendly, from the door porter to the manager, who was often seen around, eg helping with waiting at breakfast. On arrival we were given a glass of cava, and while drinking this we were shown around the hotel, and then taken to our room. One of the most welcoming hotel arrivals we have experienced. 
We ate breakfast in the hotel on our first morning, but at €25 each for continental (€30 for cooked) it's pretty expensive. We looked at the evening meal menu but it was too way out for our tastes, and too expensive.
However there are plenty of small cafes in the nearby streets, where a coffee and a croissant could be bought for under €2.50. 
The room (called Superior, but really the basic one) was still very nice. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was very nice, with a walk-in shower. The only complaint here was the toilet seat - the most uncomfortable I have ever sat on!!
The rooftop bar was very relaxed, with a live guitarist one evening. Didn't get chance to sample the small rooftop pool though.
Would have had 5 stars but dropped one because of the food prices and the toilet seat.",4,2014,06,29
15,Perfect stay in the heart of Barcelona!,"This hotel absolutely lived up to the many wonderful reviews we read here before booking.  The hotel was incredibly clean and modern, with many small touches that went above and beyond -- free bottled water, even when we were just passing through the lobby; Moulton Brown bath products; gourmet desserts with turndown service, etc. The staff was phenomonal - so attentive and friendly.  Bed was extremely comfortable.  And the location was perfect! We loved wandering through the narrow streets of the gothic quarter, finding a new bar, restaurant, or cathedral at every turn.  Check out the Bootlegger bar just down the cobblestone street.  We enjoyed a nightcap there a couple of nights in a row.  We did not do the hotel breakfast as I heard it was very expensive and there were plenty of options for breakfast very nearby.  Not a cheap place to stay, but I definitely thought this was worth the money!  Hope we can get back sometime.",5,2014,06,27
15,Such a small room,"Having read glowing reports by Harper and Platinum Anerican Express, we were terribly disappointed when shown to our tiny room. Upon requesting to pay for an upgrade we were informed that we had already been upgraded and nothing else was available. When I asked if they really had smaller rooms, I was not answered. Actually, I don't blame the hotel, 
it is well appointed , etc.. And  the staff was lovely, except for a reception clerk devoid of personality.
I have read reccomedations by the above named sources in the past describing room size so was not prepared for this. 2 tallish people had a bit of a comfort problem.",3,2014,06,26
15,Incredible experience,For my grandmother 90th birthday present I took her to Barcelona and we stayed at the Mercer Hotel. The rooms are lovely and the place is simply breathtaking! I highly recommend it. Oh and the bed was the most comfortable one I have ever slept on.,5,2014,06,26
15,Outstanding !,"I can only agree with all the previous positive reviews of the Mercer Hotel.  Location was great.  The level of service from the staff members was probably the best we have encountered, and we are experienced travelers having stayed at a number of high-end hotels both in the US and EU. Breakfast, while not inexpensive, was outstanding both in terms of quality and quantity. We are not really big fans of modern, sparse room decor.  However, the bed was very comfortable and the room very quiet - we slept well ! One minor complaint: we had some difficulty controlling the temperature in our room.  However, I would not consider this a major issue.  We would be very happy to stay at the Mercer Hotel when we visit Barcelona next time !",5,2014,06,25
15,Great hotel in the heart of Barcelona,We stayed in this hotel before a cruise. The hotel and staff are wonderful. The staff is very attentive and did everything to make our stay perfect. We were greeted at the door and offered drinks and maps. Juan Manuel was very helpful and welcoming. Everyone was extremely nice and spoke perfect English. The hotel location is great for walking anywhere in the Gothic Quarter. The rooms are new and immaculate. The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet. The garden area was relaxing and the breakfast was delicious. This is a great little hotel. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and plan to stay there again when we return to Barcelona.,5,2014,06,24
15,Lived up to reviews!,"I chose to book this for mini break for my husband and I based on tripadvisor reviews. I have been let down by tripadvisor reviews in the past, but this was not the case here AT ALL. From the moment we arrived we were treated so attentively. The hotel itself is beautiful with preserved old medieval walls intermixed with luxury modern features. The hotel is light, clean and although the room was small it was perfectly sized for two people with an enormous large very very very comfortable king bed and beautiful bathroom and shower (with excellent pressure). We enjoyed a drink on the rooftop bar and dinner at the restaurant and daily breakfast -it is truly a luxury hospital with the personal touches only found in a hospital this size. The hotel wasn't noisy ( which surprised me given it is so close to everything) and we could walk absolutely everywhere with ease. I would stay again without hesitation.",5,2014,06,24
15,Wonderful Hotel - Fantastic Location!,"We stayed in this hotel for a week and frankly cannot fault it!

The hotel itself is in a wonderful and central location in the old town, and is a few minutes walk from many of the important sites to see in Barcelona - and is also next to a metro station to get further afield. The hotel is very new and really nicely designed, with a good use of space and quality fittings and materials. Our bed was VERY comfortable, the bathroom facilities were perfect, with a great shower! Our room was really quiet, and the windows remove all noise - aside from the numerous church bells! The terrace area is very sunny for the whole day, and the pool, whilst not huge, is great for cooling down in.

The staff are extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful and obviously realise that service is as important as a great hotel. Actually, owing to a serious illness it was necessary for us to change our planned holiday dates at very short notice. Even though we had booked a non-refundable and non-rebookable deal, the hotel responded to our email request within 3 hours, and moved our booking to the new dates at no cost - thus allowing us to enjoy the full week we had wanted.

The breakfast/retaurant area is really nice, and we recommend booking and enjoying the full breakfast each morning - don't rush it, the food is excellent. We also had a superb evening meal in the hotel on the last night.

If this hotel is in your budget range, then don't look elsewhere - book now!",5,2014,06,22
15,Fantastic,"We have been in Barcelona several times, and stayed at many first class hotels, but Mercer is definetly the best. All of the staff were professional and attentive, and wanted the very best just for YOU. Located in the Barri Gotic the location couldn't be better. The garden inside where breakfast is served, is just amazing, and the breakfast is served by the table - no buffet!! The roof terrace is so charming, relaxing with a glass of wine at night before going to bed is alone worth the visit. This is the very best hotel we have ever visited. Looking forward to our next visit to Barca. 
Aud & Terje from Norway",5,2014,06,21
15,Fantastic,"Stayed here for a couple nights before leaving for our Disney Cruise. 

We chose this hotel because it was close to the cruise ship port and was in perfect proximity to the old streets and tourist attractions of Barcelona.

From the airport, it was about a half an hour taxi ride which cost us about 35 Euro. I speak a little bit of Spannish so was able to figure out the cab driver was explaining that he could only drive so far before we would have to walk to our hotel. The hotel is located in an older part of Barcelona where the streets are essentially inaccessible by vehicle. Thankfully, from the street it was only about a 200 meter walk to the hotel. Just to be sure, we pulled it up on our iphones and used GPS to guide us.... that was probably overkill. We felt very safe and it is a very youthful area.

The reception was fantastic. Champagne and a warm welcome. We were shown to our room and given an explanation for where everything was and how things worked. 

We were starving and were in no mood for an adventure so we had dinner at the hotel. We found the menu somewhat limited and was geared more towards a 'fine dining' experience. We otherwise ate at the local cafe's and restaurants which were a short walk away and considerably cheaper. We highly recommend the restaurant ""Milk"" for breakfast.

The rooms were excellent. There was some noise outside and this was expected for an older building. It didn't bother either of us. Spain lost the game that night so that probably helped keep the noise down.

I didn't see a fitness centre; however, there is a small roof top pool if you wanted a swim.

Staff were very friendly, professional and spoke perfect English. It was also our experience that every shop/restaurant we went to that English was also spoken. 

If we come back, we'll definitely be staying here again. Too bad it was for such a short time! There was so much to see and so little time.",5,2014,06,21
15,"Wow, Wow,Wow","We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights - wow, what a brilliant hotel.
All we could say about the Mercer is you MUST stay here when in Barcelona. 
From the moment you walk through the front doors and are greeted by the Concierge you know you are staying somewhere special - because you are treated as special.
The rooms are brilliant, beautifully designed, beautifully finished, great attention to detail.
Located within the Gothic section and on the ancient streets you have access to great shopping and the history of Barcelona is on your door step.
The staff are brilliant at the Mercer, the bed is sooooo comfortable-as are the pillows.
We can't wait to go back to Barcelona and stay at the Mercer.",5,2014,06,20
15,Go to Barcelona just to stay at Mercer Hotel,Truly a perfect stay! Upon arrival we were greeted by the excellent staff at the Mercer Hotel. The service began even before we stepped inside the hotel. Our sightseeing was planned within minutes and we were escorted to the beautiful deluxe and junior suite rooms we booked for our stay. We were amazed by the stylish design of the hotel and the rooms were both so luxurious. Part of the hotel is built into the side of an ancient roman tower which makes it so unique and is so fitting for the beautiful Gothic Quarter. The furnishings and linens were more than five star and the roof top pool made us want to just stay at the hotel and forget the sightseeing! No questions asked...just stay at the Mercer Hotel..you will thank me. Is there a rating better than excellent??,5,2014,06,17
15,Perfection!,"We had two nights here at this beautiful hotel following our cruise. We did have a bit of trouble with the taxi to the hotel as the driver was not familiar with it & spoke no english at all. He did find it & then was kind enough to not charge the usual amount for our bags. 
Check-in was great with the glass of prosecco in the garden & the paperwork brought out to us there to sign etc. 
The moment we entered our room ( deluxe 203) we loved it - everything has been well planned & no detail left out: amazing furniture, bed, toiletries, robes, slippers in little cotton bags etc etc. We loved the design of the room with the vanity/basin in the room - great shower & toilet completely separate. We realise some others have commented on this style of bathroom & have not liked it but we loved it. Of course you would not choose this type of room if you were not travelling with your spouse! 
Service was amazing as everyone has previously stated - charming & friendly.
We found the location great as we could walk around this gorgeous old part & also walk to the beach etc. 
The terrace on the roof was very nice & we had a drink up there which was good, however the night we arrived we were very tired & decided to have something to eat there instead of going out - it was then we discovered that the prices were a bit steep - 22euros each for bread with a small amount of roast beef & a handful of potato crisps - I am gluten intolerant & so could only eat the couple of slices of meat & the chips - we live & learn! We also found that the breakfast was very expensive - 35euros . I had seen on the website that you could order separate dishes( not on there any more) - so we were able to have a delicious omelette for 10euros - all in the beautiful courtyard garden with roman wall & arch & lovely flowers.
We also had free bottled water & soft drinks in our room - we did however miss our cup of tea in our room as there are no provisions for this - that would have just added to the perfection of this hotel.Overall we really loved our stay & would return should we ever come back to Barcelona.",5,2014,06,15
15,"It's all about the service. Great location but tiny ""superior"" rooms","Great location in the Gothic Quarter... it is a charming area, and walking distance from several attractions. (Note: it's a bit difficult to find the first time and your cab driver may drop you off a bit further from the hotel - but follow the map that the hotel will send you and the cab can drop you right outside the front door). The hotel is a built in a beautiful historic building and they have merged the old and new very well.
My only disappointment was the size of the rooms. We had booked a ""superior room""... it was TINY. The bathroom was not a separate room... instead the basin was part of the bedroom. There was an enclosed WC area, and the shower area had a glass partition. Not what I had in mind, for the kind of money we shelled out. It is definitely not the kind of room for sharing with anyone except your significant other.
That said, the service was fantastic. The staff was warm and friendly... always greeting us with a smile, eager to help us with any requests, etc. The concierge even managed to get us a table at Tickets, which is usually booked-out months in advance. 
So overall, our 3-day stay was enjoyable. Not sure I would pick this hotel again, if we were staying for a longer duration though.",4,2014,06,14
15,Pretty much faultless,"What a great hotel. 
Amongst the narrow streets of the old part of Barca, it's in easy walking distance of many of the key sights and close enough to a metro to get you to all the others!
The staff are lovely - friendly, welcoming and happy to help. Room was fabulous - spacious, clean and quiet. Great cocktails in the bar or on the roof, very friendly service in their Tapas restaurant next door. And even a bottle of bubbly on my wife's birthday.
Would stay again without a doubt.",5,2014,06,13
15,Beyond 5* Standard!,"Just got back from our short break from Barcelona, stayed at Mercer Hotel for 3 nights.  This is the best 5 * hotel we ever stayed.  It's so beautiful, a historic building with a modern touch.  Location of the hotel is walking distance to all major attractions.  The services in all areas are excellent, we booked the Switched Off Barcelona and Gourmet experience packages, it was well organised and we enjoyed every single minute of it!  All staff are very cheerful, helpful and professional.  Our room is clean, big and quite, come with a private terrace.  Truly 5* hotel.",5,2014,06,12
15,Perfect 50th Birthday Treat.,Fantastic hotel in great location right in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. Difficult to find first time but after that its secluded location is a winner. The renovation of a historic building shell to modern hotel is tastefully done. Was upgraded free of charge to a junior suite which was the icing on the cake. Roof top terrace and small pool much appreciated after a hot day of walking. Main restaurant is genuine Michelin star but only complaint is that the restaurant is spartan and lacks atmosphere. Impeccable service and great wine list. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel.,5,2014,06,10
15,"Stunning hotel, great service","The hotel's architecture, location, design, and decor are stunning but it is the service that sets it apart. Everyone you meet will go above and beyond to make your stay perfect from giving you a full history on the property to telling you where to go in town to keeping your complimentary minibar stocked. This was our honeymoon so we splurged when staying here as it isnt cheap but we still hope to return!",5,2014,06,08
15,Loved it!,"Very comfortable rooms, A-1 service, great food! We plan on returning! Best concierge service, everyone with a smile and very respectful. Their 5 star service is for real! One word of advise, don't drive through the streets of Barrio Goti!",5,2014,06,04
15,Exquisite - again!,"The Mercer was a definite choice when we decided to re- visit Barcelona this May with friends. We stayed at The Mercer last September (2013) & loved it for the superb location, great architecture & decor, but most of all for the wonderfully welcoming service provided by all staff. We immediately let them know we were coming again with friends this time. Because the location in the exciting Barri Gothic can be a bit 'tricky' to find, we emailed the hotel management to organise airport transfers. This made for a totally seamless & stress free arrival where we were warmly welcomed. We have loved our second stay here - and loved our beautiful room with a great deck which we used for a delicious afternoon wine & tapas with our friends! Thank you! 

We sadly depart in the morning, but will be back the next time we re visit this vibrant city. This is a small, intimate hotel that provides a wonderful 'oasis' of calm after a day in the clamour & vibrancy of Barcelona. It is a hotel where the staff are friendly & welcoming, the beds sublimely comfortable, the food delicious. Thanks to the lovely staff who have once again given us such a welcoming stay at The Mercer Barcelona.",5,2014,05,31
15,Trip Advisor was right!,"We chose to stay at the Mercer Hotel because it was the top rated hotel in Barcelona on Trip Advisor. It lives up to the ratings and then some. We arrived early to check after our flight from the states and they were happy to accommodate us. We needed a nap before we began exploring the city. The bed was great and room quiet even though we were on the street side of the building above the hotel entrance. The location is amazing. Walking distance to most of the great sites. The maze-like alleys in the Gothic quarter were fun to explore with interesting shops and restaurants around every corner. We were lucky to be in the city for St. Jordi's Day, which is a local celebration of the patron Saint of Barcelona. Not really a holiday, but it felt like one, with traditional music and dancing in the plazas, book sellers and other vendors lining the alley-ways. The hotel has an exceptional Tapas bar attached to it where we eat a couple times during our short stay. Lovely rooftop pool deck, although too cold to get in the water, it was serene oasis for a sunset cocktail. Don't hesitate to stay here if they have rooms available.",5,2014,05,31
15,Loved it,"My husband and I just got back from 3 days at the Mercer and I can't say enough good things. We loved the location (in the Barri Gothic), the service, the style. The concierges (especially Joan) were incredibly helpful and kind. It was my husband's 50th birthday and they arranged to have cava and sweets in the room without my asking.  We stayed in a suite that looked into the courtyard, which was great for quiet nights.  The breakfast was delicious and high-end. Go!",5,2014,05,30
15,Amazing!,"LOVED my stay at this hotel and would recommend it for everyone.  The staff goes the extra mile to make sure everything is perfect.   We loved the breakfast at the hotel,  Jokastha was a very attentive waitress that remembered our likes/dislikes after only one morning.  Loved the Molten Brown products in the rooms, everything smelled amazing.  The location was perfect.  We were able to walk to beach, Las Ramblas, Boqueria, Barcelona Cathedral, shopping, bus tours etc
A definite MUST in Barcelona.  We will be back.",5,2014,05,30
15,"Outstanding, amongst the very best boutique hotels.","An absolutely wonderful boutique hotel nestled in the Roman walls of the old city's Born district. It is conveniently centrally located in a lovely narrow winding street, close to good restaurants, little bars, the beach, and tourist attractions. We walked everywhere, grateful for recommendations and directions offered by the most helpful Concierge. Our room was extremely comfortable and quiet, with a lovely view of the old city. The hotel has two very good restaurants, the casual Le Bouchon, a tapas bar, and the one star Michelin, a must experience (see my separate reviews), we enjoyed both. Service exceeds all expectations, it is simply outstanding and exceptional from every member of the wonderful staff. I would specifically like to commend Gloria Anglora (Director of Reception) and Francesc  Holgado (Director General) for their very kind and personal attention to their guests. One of the very best hotels in every respect... 6 stars out of 5! We will definitely return.",5,2014,05,29
15,excellent hotel,We spent a long weekend at the hotel Mercer in May and found the staff delightful and very helpful. The hotel is beautifully appointed and the beds are amongst the most comfortable we have ever slept in! The sheets are lovely too. The toiletries are lovely..everything is a very high standard. The position of the hotel is great...right in the old city within easy walking distance of everything.,5,2014,05,28
15,Ugh...not THAT Mercer.,"Silly me, thought it was the Barcelona branch of the NYC boutique standard.

That said, a nice hotel in a great setting. Rooms are decently sized and a great blend of old and new. I loved the vertical wall garden and the staff was extremely courteous during the check in process.

I'd stay here again.",4,2014,05,26
15,Visiting Barcelona? Look no further!,"Hotel Mercer is located in a stylishly renovated mansion in the heart of the old Gothic quarter of Barcelona. You could not be better located if your mission is to explore this city's ample charms.  The only real drawback is that many taxis will not know where it is and others may not wish to negotiate the very narrow streets to get you there! It's probably worth getting the hotel to book a transfer from the airport.

We had a super stylish, comfortable and peaceful room overlooking the ""vertical garden"" - really just a light well. But I am not complaining. The rooms in this hotel are silent! No traffic, police sirens, metro rumbles. Amazing.

The best feature? Possible the staff who could not do enough to help arrange bookings, suggest restaurants, etc etc.

The ""worst"" feature? Well for the price 35 euros, breakfast was beautiful but a little disappointing! Next time I will remember that seeking out a little cafe for breakfast is just one more attraction that Barcelona has to offer.",5,2014,05,26
15,A perfect hotel in a perfect location,"We have just had a lovely stay at the Mercer Hotel in Barcelona, it is a beautifully renovated old building in the heart of the Gothic quarter; no cars or traffic noise disturb the peaceful atmosphere, and it is in a lovely position near the sea. The staff are very kind and helpful; they will book your theatre tickets, call a taxi, check out times for museums, nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, bathrooms well-equipped, housekeeping staff conscientious and discreet and the bed was the best I have ever slept in. I can certainly recommend this as the perfect place to stay in Barcelona, close by there are excellent small cafes and restaurants and the cathedral is within easy walking distance. We shall return as soon as possible. Thank you to all at the Mercer Hotel.",5,2014,05,23
15,perfect,"Absolutely perfect, no negative thing to mention, the location is perfect, everything of interest in the city is within walking distance.
Room are quiet and confortable, with a nice view.
Staff very helpful and  fantastic.
Highly recommended.",5,2014,05,23
15,Has to be experienced,"We were advised to visit The Mercer to experience 5 star quality even if just for a glass of wine and a bowl of olives
From the debonair doorman and his warm professional welcome to the delightfully friendly and informative maître d at the cocktail bar we were made to feel very important
The wine and olives were delicious, the service superb and the cost reasonable
We found the history and the surroundings amazing
Ancient culture and architecture mixed superbly with the modern 
day elegance
Should not be missed!",5,2014,05,22
15,Hard to fault,"This hotel deserves its top spot (held currently anyway) on Tripadvisor.

The rooms are comfortable and the service is impeccable. It is in a good location in the old town and there are plenty of good shops, bars and restaurants within easy walking distance. The sea and beach are not far away.

There is a roof garden, with a small plunge pool, that we used every day to rest our feet, read our books and enjoy a sundowner.

Breakfast was the only meal we took in the hotel. It was varied and generous.

We would certainly recommend it as a base for anyone visiting Barcelona. The concierge was a great help in organising tickets for our sightseeing and suggesting places to dine.",5,2014,05,20
15,Excellent Hotel Friendly Staff Great Location,"Just back from two nights in Barcelona - a very quick trip to go to the Barcelona Atletico  Madrid Football game for my son's 18th birthday.  

Arrived late to the hotel as our plane was delayed and the gentleman on reception when we arrived was a pleasure to deal with.  Very helpful and charming.  We had a quick drink at the bar with a cheese plate (it was now 12.30 and we were starving) and then off to bed.  

The rooms are basic enough, modern and clean.  The sheets on the bed were gorgeous.  Beautifully soft cotton.  We had continental breakfast which was very good, with delicious cakes!  We then set off to explore Barcelona so did not spend much time in the hotel, but did manage a very quick lie out in the sun on the roof top garden for 1/2 hour whilst waiting to go to the match.  Back that night to go to bed!

Loved the hotel, loved the location in the old part of town, staff very courteous and friendly.  The hotel is a mixture of old walls (one of them an original roman wall) and modern architecture.  I really liked the atmosphere of the hotel and would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,05,19
15,Fantastic service,"The Mercer is in a fantastic location- an oasis of calm in the cobbled streets of the Gothic Quarter. The architecture is stunning with a beautiful courtyard and a roof terrace that is quiet but has a bar and a small pool. The rooms are like an apartment- they have a homely feel but are also sleek. The bed is one of the most comfortable I have slept in. However, for me the best bit is the service- so friendly but discreet and nothing is too much trouble. I went out for a run one morning and when I got back, the concierge had laid out a bottle of water and towel for me in reception. Not cheap but worth every penny and they don't charge for wifi and even the mini bar is free. I will go back.",5,2014,05,18
15,Fabulous Hotel,"This hotel is tucked away and a little difficult to find, but other than that, is is absolutely perfect.  The reception staff were so friendly and the hotel room itself was beyond comparison.  We were able to walk easily to several shops, restaurants and historic sites.  We would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2014,05,14
15,A simply stunning hotel,"The Mercer Barcelona is simply the best city centre hotel I have ever stayed in. The location is perfect, down an atmospheric narrow street in the Gothic Quarter with the cathedral turrets a stone's throw from the rooftop terrace. Everything of interest in the city is within walking distance, from the Gaudi storefronts in the Passeig de Gracia in one direction to the harbour and beach in the other.
I particularly the imaginative architecture, slotting it in to the Roman and medieval walls with clean modern effortlessness. But modern doesn't mean plain and white, which is too often the case in modern hotels. The public spaces are gracious and beautiful (as are the staff), and the rooms are interesting and extremely comfortable. I really enjoyed the surprise of the bathroom placement behind the bedhead panel, which I thought really worked. The gardens slotted into the outside spaces add a sense of space and tranquility.",5,2014,05,04
15,Excellent Service,"My experience here was great... lovely reception and very beautiful service oriented staff. i really enjoyed my stay ... and to your manager not sure of his name i think Marques, he is a great guy. thanks for making my stay worth it...",4,2014,04,29
15,Oasis of tranquility,"There are a number of things that stood out about this hotel including its great location inside the Gothic Quarter, its tasteful and harmonious modernisation of the historic architecture, the pitch darkness of the rooms at siesta time, great roof top views etc. What stood out the most for me however was the impeccable service.  
I would love to give the Mercer 5 stars however a couple of things stop it from being a true 5 star: unlike other reviewers I didn't mind the bathroom being open plan however its design made it feel like an after thought, almost monastic in nature with not enough space for two people to comfortably use the space. Second short coming was the toilet seat - visually the suite is stunning however this truly is a case of form over function as it was uncomfortable to use.  
I would like to get back to the service though: it was flawless. Thank you!",4,2014,04,28
15,"Fantastic location, exorbitant breakfast","I was sad not to give the Mercer five stars. It is elegant and charming, in a wonderful location (on a medieval street behind the great cathedral), meticulously clean, and has everything you need for a good night's sleep: great mattress, fluffy pillows, shutters to block out the tiniest ray of sunlight. And the staff are uniformly gracious and helpful. This is a well-run hotel. But whoever did the brilliant renovation of the public spaces did not give much thought to the bedroom interiors, which are dimly lighted and quirky. (There is no door on the shower room, for example, and no decent reading lights). And the cost of breakfast is simply outrageous in a city full of good cafes. So, four rather than five stars.",4,2014,04,26
15,have a great time in here,"The second time we came back to Spain, we decided to stay at Mercer Hotel Barcelona. The hotel had vintage, old and antique design. I love it. It reminded me of historic castles. The room was more modern than its look, so I felt a little disappointed. Btw I still love view from my room, great city view with old streets and old houses. I am quiet romantic and  old-fashioned, so I spent most of time sitting at inside hotel restaurant, it was much more classic. And if you love something fresh or new, you should try hotel rooftop swimming pool and restaurant. My hubby is extrovert and creative, so he loved it so much.",5,2014,04,25
15,Love this hotel; one of my favorites ever.,"Really love this hotel. Would come back in a nanosecond.  We poneyed up for junior suite and were not disappointed. In center of Barrio Gotico quarter, near some great restaurants, a metro stop and w/in walking distance of many highlights. 

Mercer is on a little street, a bit hard to find for taxi, but not a real problem.  Staff were fantastic, especially the charming concierge, Florenzia.  Nothing was a problem for her or her colleague.

Room was very quiet and well appointed. Looked out on back side of hotel, therefore, no real view, but not an air shaft.  We had room 208 and we're very comfortable.  Keep in mind the Gotico quarter is dark with narrow streets, so rooms are not light filled.  The renovation of this very old building is cleaver and tasteful -- quite elegant and calming.  Most importantly, can't find a negative thing to mention.",5,2014,04,25
15,good location,peaceful rooms but in the centre of things. Good welcome and very helpful staff. Not too sure about the shower and basin being in the bedroom as it's a bit noisy for the other half trying to sleep in and the loo seats involved a balancing act! The modern and ancient mix of architecture is interesting and very relaxing and comfortable. Glad we used a taxi rather than trying to get through those streets in our hire car!,4,2014,04,21
15,Lovely,"I travelled with my wife for a long weekend.
This hotel is positioned in the Barrio Gotico near Via Laietana.
While taxis occasionally access the small streets, approaching the hotel by feet is the best option.
The hotel is located in an old building fully and nicely restored.
We liked the hotel from the first approach as the valet came toward us to collect the luggage before we arrived in front of the hotel’ door.
All the rest of our stay went seamless.
The hotel is very nice; the service fantastic, attentive and discrete.
We found our room (101) nice and silent. We could sleep very well in a soft and cocooning bed.
I confirm that our room was dark. However, please note that you are in the historical center of a once medieval town; streets are narrow and the building in front is very close.
However, curtains are protecting intimacy at the detriment of external light.
There is a very nice patio and lovely terrace on the top of building.
One of the best hotels I have ever been and I would recommend it for sure.",5,2014,04,18
15,A great experience,"The hotel is about 18 months old, but incorporates a part of the Roman wall dating to 15 B.C. Modern and tasteful, it has done a great job of incorporating old stone and in capturing the available light from above and giving a very open feeling (being in the Barri Gotic, it is surrounded on all sides by buildings and narrow alleys.)
Our huge room was on the third floor on the front of the hotel, along the ten- foot wide alley.  It had original artwork from Catalonian artists, designer furniture and a big, open feel.  The bedding was among the most comfortable I have ever had.  My wife commented, as she drifted off to sleep, “You can go on back to Munich.  I might just stay here!”
The walls were partly stone; the wide floorboards were of pickled oak; the vaulted ceiling had wooden beams.  There were through- tenon oiled walnut tables and leather easy chairs with footstools.  There is one TV in the living room and another in the bedroom.
There was a large wardrobe with guest safe and enough hangers to hold a month’s worth of clothes.  Molton Brown soaps and amenities were in the bathroom, which had separate rooms for toilet, shower and bath + sink.  
Service was outstanding.  We were served fresh- squeezed orange juice while we were checked- in by the gracious and attentive staff.  We were there around 11:30am and no surprise that our room was not ready -- but we were offered coffees and pastries and treated as though they were late, not that we were early!  There was none of the “You can check in early for 50% extra payment” nonsense that you get from so many hotels today.  The Mercer treats its guests very well indeed.  It must be said that the Mercer is expensive, but well- worth it, and I have stayed in many expensive hotels which have come nowhere near the Mercer’s caring service.  So in that light, the Mercer is a bargain.
We did not try their Michelin- starred restaurant, but when we returned from our evening meal it appeared to be full and they were turning away walk-ups – a good sign.
The location is fantastic.  In the middle of the old city, it is a short walk to the Jaume I metro stop, a  ten minute stroll to Seven Doors (a great seafood place), a six  minute walk to Irati (great Basque tapas place with an amazing pil-pil (cod) and Txistorra (small and juicy chorizo sausages), a six minute walk to Placa Catalunya, numerous good restaurants all around, and only 20 min by cab from the airport (this was on a Sunday a.m., NO traffic, could be double at normal traffic conditions.)
My wife joined me at the end of a conference and we tacked- on the Mercer to extend the stay.  Next year I am going to take the Mercer for the whole time and pay the difference!  Highest recommendation.",5,2014,04,12
15,The epitomy of good taste and quality,"I booked this not knowing it was number one on Trip Advisor - what a stroke of luck! The hotel is nestled down a tiny street in the lovely old Gothic area, centrally and conveniently positioned. It  has been beautifully furnished, everything was very tasteful with very high quality furniture and fittings. It even smelt nice! The staff could not have been more helpful and obliging, it really is a centre of excellence in every way. The weather was wonderful so we spent some time on the roof terrace - again tastefully and thoughtfully furnished.
The only slight problem we had was that the electronic door cards were a bit temperamental and we had to renew ours on three occasions. But really that is the only slightly negative thing I can find to say! Unfortunately we didn't eat in the hotel restaurant, but certainly would have done had we realised there was a well known and Michelin starred chef! We shall save that treat for our next visit.",5,2014,04,12
15,Perfect spot,We thoroughly enjoyed our 3 nights at the Mercer Hotel.  The staff from the moment we arrived were very helpful.  Nothing was a trouble for them.  We like sparkling mineral water  - no problem We asked for extra pillows and no duvet but sheet and blanket - no problem.  We wanted an early meal as we had been travelling 21hrs and the concierge suggested a suitable cafe as many do not open until later and we were very tired.  Also the tapas bar is excellent and our waitress very attentive.  We would definitely recommend this delightful boutique hotel.,5,2014,04,10
15,BEST CONCIERGE EVER,"If you are thinking about going to Barcelona, Mercer Hotel is defenettely the best place to stay. 

The Hotel is amazing and beatifull but your stay gets even better with the gently and kind and wonderful concierge, Mr. Juan Manuel.

Mr. Manuel is the kind of person that hás the ability of making everything even better. He is extremely  competent and treat you like of you are the last person in the world to tale care of. Undescrible!

Do not think twice, go to Mercer Hotel.

15,Great staff!,"My stay at the Mercer Hotel was fabulous. The staff were friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful.  The rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable.  The fixtures were very new.  Location was very convenient, within walking distance to most of the sites we visited and near a metro station.  Highly recommended.",5,2014,04,07
15,Highly Recommend,I chose this hotel because of the reviews. My husband and I spent the weekend and it was an ideal location.The hotel and staff were excellent. Very helpful and friendly. A very unique building with a very good restaurant. A shame we didn't have dinner there. I would highly recommend it.,5,2014,04,07
15,Perfect stay.,"We chose this hotel according to TripAdvisor recommendations. And it was perfect. We stayed in Mercer  for 3 days. The room, the staff, the location, everything was perfect. Our room was very unique with modern furniture and interesting design. The Guest Relations and the staff in general were like a big friendly family and we felt ourselves special. The prices are kind of expensive, but with all due responsibility we must say that it was worth every €. InshAllah we will return to the Mercer Hotel on our next trip to lovely Barcelona!!! ",5,2014,04,06
15,Excellent ,"It is probably first hotel where I can't complain. I stayed at this hotel 4 nights and it was my first time in Barcelona. I love this city and Barca is our top city among European cities. We hand Grand deluxe room, big room with view on inside small hotel garden. Breakfast fabulous and staff during breakfast made me I could feel like King. It is not Swedish table they prepare what you want and only for you and it is really good solution for this type of hotel. Check in and out was quick. Price I paid was high but when you come to this hotel you will understand why. We got chance to eat Tapas in their tapas restaurant but I know better one around hotel Tonja de Tapas. They have better staff and more tasty tapas. ",5,2014,04,06
15,Romantic 5 star hotel,"Right from the moment you step in you know you are in a ""boutique"" environemwnt, the beds, pillows, shower, bath tub, toiletries and little treats they drop off in your room are all amazing Highly reccommended.",5,2014,03,31
15,Great Hotel,"One of the best hotels that I have stayed in! Great staff, all incredibly helpful. Spacious and quiet rooms and delicious food. In a great location in Barca built into the walls of the Old City.
A special hotel.",5,2014,03,30
15,What a lovely experience,"We went to the hotel for a long weekend, the one thing that makes the hotel so special are the staff, they look after you so well and are very proud of the history. Rooms were nice and food good. Will go again ",5,2014,03,28
15,Superb Stay at the Mercer,"Spent 4 nights there after reviewing TripAdvisor feedback.  It was as good as the accolades.  Location is excellent.  Easy walking to great areas, and access to Metro nearby.  Service is also excellent.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  We had room 108, which was great.  Had requested an interior room for quiet.  This room is nice, but the private terrace makes it wonderful.  Room enough for an outdoor living set, table and lounges.  Very nice!  We got the breakfast plan included, and it was good (but expensive).  Could get continental or egg dishes.    I could go either way on the breakfast as there are many places nearby.  We also had tapas in the bar, and they were very good.   No gym available, but there's enough exercise available walking around Barcelona.    A tip if you decide to stay there...you will get a note from the hotel a day or two before the trip, with a map attached.  Print out the map and give it to your taxi driver...it is very hard to find...especially driving.  I would recommend, and would stay there again.  ",5,2014,03,25
15,Suprior hotel with unmatched service,"Booked at the mercer following the high reviews. We were upgraded to suite from deluxe room. In one word, the room is excellent. The welcoming of the staff is unmatched, the help of the concierge, the immediate response of house keeping for any request, even the doorman wait for me with water and towel when I returned from a morning jog!!!
With such a great location this is a must",5,2014,03,25
15,Short stay.. Long waiting..,My husband and I got to Barcelona in three days visit at 7:30 pm after a long over night flight. The hotel location and service is excellent. It is also very clean and staff are friendly and helpful. The only problem is that hotel only has 20 rooms and we had to wait from 8:00 am to 2:00 pm so that our room get ready. I felt that we lost one of our three days of stay in Barcelona waiting for our room to be ready. ,3,2014,03,24
15,"stay here, it's heavenly","this place is really too good to be true, from the doorman who came out to find us and take cases as we walked along to the welcome from the staff. The rooms are design perfect, huge beds, masses of storage , excellent bathing facilities. we asked for quiet and had a room of the second courtyard which was silence in the city.The staff really did seem pleased that you were guests.on the roof, there are blankets spread and a garden of aromatic herbs.",5,2014,03,17
15,"Fantastic service, comfortable, close to everything and yet quiet","Very nice hotel, perfectly situated in the old gothic zone of the city, within walking distance of mostly evrything. Spacious, comfortable and quiet rooms. The decoration was a little too minimalistic for a romatic weekend and even if the food is very good in the restaurant it could improve it's athmosphere to make a more complete experience. Candles, textiles..? However, we have rarely experienced such a service minded and friendly staff. They helped with everything from reservation of private guides to packing material for the wine we bought. The wonderful consierge even had Cava (local ""champage"") to our room when he leared it was our aniversary. A perfect memory of Barcelona.",4,2014,03,16
15,BEST location,"We had three hotels in mind for our Barcelona vacation: Mercer, El Palace and Majestic.  We are so happy we chose the Mercer for location and ambience.  Room 308 is ultra quiet, large and the balcony is delightful (low key church bell free of charge). The small mini fridge with water and soft drinks complimentary was a nice touch.  As we made our way to Casa Mila, we checked out El Palace and the Majestic and although lovely hotels, we did not enjoy the frantic pace of the area, so our hotel choice was again rewarded. Isidore, our wonderful concierge, recommended and booked major sights thus avoiding all waits for us, which even in March can be horrendous at a few spots.  Trust Isidore when he says always keep the hotel map with you as we got horribly lost one night and walked the labyrinth of the Gotic for an hour.  The area is safe and the restaurants terrific especially El Salon which is 5 minutes from the hotel.  Enjoy!",5,2014,03,15
15,Lovely hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"I’ve stayed in some really lovely places but this is the first time I’ve written a review. This past week I stayed at the Mercer Hotel in Barcelona with my husband and teenage daughter for four nights. The location is unbeatable, the décor is serene, the Roman ruins that make up some of the walls in the hotel are an impressive historical statement, and the food is delicious. We did not eat in the restaurant but we did enjoy tapas in the bar, Bouchon, and chatted with the delightful Sicilian bartender. We had two junior suites - they were different but both of them were lovely. All of these features would be worth five stars in a review, but the truly extraordinary aspect of this hotel is the service. From the moment we walked into this gem of a hotel, nestled along a small, quiet lane in the Gothic district, the service was exceptional. Isidro, the concierge on duty when we walked in, greeted us, showed us around the hotel, organized much of our four-day trip, gave us tips about when to visit certain sights, organized advanced tickets for us, sent us to unique (and marvelous) restaurants (and ensured they could accommodate my daughter’s vegetarian diet), and suggested off-the-beaten-path shopping areas. Isidro just happened to be the concierge on duty when we needed something but the other two concierges were equally delightful and no doubt equally competent. This is a wonderful hotel – we will certainly return.",5,2014,03,15
15,AMAZING hotel in Barcelona,"We could not be more pleased with our experience at Mercer Hotel in Barcelona. The only unfortunate part was having to leave at the end of our very short, 2-day stay. We had room 310, a Deluxe Room (one-step above the base level), and couldn't have been happier. Our room overlooked a courtyard with greenery planted on one side. It was very spacious, with a luxurious bathroom complete with a luxurious soaking tub and rain shower. 

Beyond the room, all of the facilities are beautifully done. The hotel is built on the remains of an ancient Roman watch tower, and there is a blend of old world and modern decor.The lobby, bar, restaurant and rooftop terrace were all excellent spaces to spend time. Don't miss getting a gin cocktail at the bar (it's very unique!), or the smaller tapas restaurant connected to the hotel - Bouchon. 

Every staff member there is incredibly pleasant and there to make the stay the best it can possibly be. Greeted with a glass of cava upon arrival, too!

Location is ideal in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona. By far the prettiest area to walk around -- Las Ramblas is close, and really loved the Born (artsy) area. Lots of great architecture, restaurants and shops within walking distance.",5,2014,03,10
15,The Mercer hotel; a must !!,"We stayed 4 nights in the Mercer hotel in march 2014. It is very well situated. 
Our room, as we asked for, was very quiet. The bed is extremely comfortable. All employees are at your service. 
Breakfast is great. Really a great way to start the day. 
Try some tapaz at the ""The Bouchon"", the tapaz bar of the hotel. They are good and the service is impeccable.  
Barcelona is a city to visit. It was our first time. We come back; that's for sure; and we will stay again in the Mercer hotel !",5,2014,03,10
15,Best hotel I've stayed at here,"I've been at most of the best hotels in BCN and I enjoyed this one the most.  You can walk for hours with this as your base, and see everything in the city.  The bed is amazingly comfortable and all the textiles are fine and luxurious, as is the shower and bath.  The rooftop is wonderful and the pool will be great in the summer!   The staff is amazingly helpful and friendly, all first class with zero pretension.  And the 12 course tasting menu at the restaurant is breathtaking, truly.

Highly recommended on all counts!",4,2014,03,06
15,Mercer,"Fantastic location, outgoing staff personalized service. The decor is a good mix of idiosyncratic and sophisticated choices. The hotel is built on the remains of an ancient city wall, and certain details are well integrated into the building throughout. Stayed in a  Jr. Suite, good room, faced the interior courtyard. Didn't eat at the attached restaurant, but had a bite at the Tapas place--good food and service, cool vibe. Different than Mercer Soho, but certainly not inferior--really enjoyed the combo of unique decor, fantastic location, great staff, and overall experience. I will be back.",5,2014,03,03
15,Awesome hotel centrally located in Old Quarter,"We chose this hotel based on very positive Tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed at all. Having originally booked via Hotel booking aggregator then found a better deal booking with the hotel directly. We booked a junior suite for roughly the same cost as via Booking.com and were treated to our own private outside terrace. Ask for room 108 if booking direct with the hotel.

All the staff were super friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Room was very comfortable and breakfast whilst not cheap was worthwhile and certainly set us up for the day. 

The hotel is quite quirky based in the heart of the old quarter but is located superbly for enjoying Barca being only a short 5-10 minute walk to La Rambla. 

We shall certainly be back! Thank you for a fabulous stay.",5,2014,02,23
15,Amazing building... Amazing hospitality,"This hotel is ranked #1 on here and rightly so. From the moment you arrive till the moment you leave the staff can not do enough to look after you. Staying here for 2 nights as a city break you are right in the middle of the gothic quarter and a 5-10 minute walk to everywhere in this popular part of town. 

Concierge email you the day before to check your arrival time and your room is ready and waiting for you. In this case it was around 11am and the room was fully prepared. On check in you get a welcome drink and the staff are warm and friendly. The concierge give a short and interesting introduction to the history of the building as they take you up to your room. The room was a deluxe room and faced onto the street at the front of the hotel. Large big windows, high ceilings, double cubicle shower, fast wifi and a superb bed with top quality linen. Soft drinks and water in the fridge along with a comfortable area to sit with 2 chairs.

We didn't have dinner at the hotel however we did take breakfast on both days and the level of service and quality of food was exceptional. In fact it was that good breakfast becomes a very leisurely affair with a never ending supply of food, freshly squeezed orange juice and coffee.  If breakfast was anything to go by the dinner would have been superb, we just opted to see the city instead of an evening.

Lovely cocktail bar with knowledgeable staff when it comes to mixology. Huge selection of spirits and very well made drinks, makes this bar a great (albeit quiet) place to have a final drink before heading upstairs.

On checkout a taxi was called and your bags taken to the vehicle.

To summarise, this place is not cheap far from it... but it delivers on all levels so if you can stretch to the room rates then it comes highly highly recommended. In fact it's that nice you almost feel guilty for spending all day out of the hotel exploring the city!",5,2014,02,22
15,Barcelonas Best,"I had organized a 4 night stay to celebrate my partners 50th birthday,all the reviews I had read were excellent and may I say how true this is.
From our arrival to our departure the staff made our holiday one to remember,so very helpful and friendly,so much so we didn't want to leave.
The Deluxe room was spacious,with a huge bed,complimentary soft drinks replemished  daily,shower etc is to a very high standard.
Breakfast set you up for the day ahead,a superb breakfast menu for you to indulge.
A truly remarkable hotel in a ideal location in the middle of the Gothic City of Barcelona sets the standards of other hotels to follow.
Thank you to all and hope to visit again in the very near future.",5,2014,02,22
15,The Best Hotel Ever!,"Based on the reviews that I had seen on this hotel, I was expecting a great experience and this hotel really delivered.  From the minute we arrived, we were offered drinks and any help that we needed.  The staff were especially helpful with our daughter who is 7 and the concierge made sure she always had a business card of the hotel in her pocket.  Great recommendations were made for meals and for site seeing; everyone was extremely friendly.

The Gothic quarter location was perfect for many of the attractions and museums.  This hotel is  on a narrow street which made for a lovely, quiet location albeit some taxis were hesitant to drive down the street.  Breakfast in the hotel was lovely and the service fantastic.  We also ate in the Tapas bar and found the food good and wine recommendations tasty.  There are also a couple of good cafes nearby, close to the subway entrance (which is also very close) if you just want a quick coffee or sandwich.

We stayed in Room 206 (it looks like after reviewer Tim C -ha) and found the room finished in a very high standard.  I stay at a lot of hotels in Europe and the US and I found this bed one of the most comfortable hotels beds I have slept.  The linens were very high quality too which was very different than the last hotel I stayed in the previous week.  The room was spacious too as we had a rollaway bed in for our daughter.  The design of storage and desk space was clever and modern...just be careful of opening the door to the room if someone is in the shower as it is a open plan design.

The hotel made our holiday a lovely experience and I will stay at the Mercer again (and possibly sister hotels too)!",5,2014,02,20
15,"Personalized services, hotel integrates well the old building with stylish modern amenities","The hotel was hard to find in the beginning as it is hidden within the old walls in one of the small little streets. Despite that, the very welcoming service you get the moment you reached the hotel doors make us feel we made the right choice.  A cosy hotel where everyone recognizes us and always on hand when we need help. 

The hotel staff from guest relations, Juan Manel & Florencia to porter Juan is always there to help with recommendations, reservations, online booking and anything we may need help on. This is by far our most comfortable stay, exceeding the services usually expected at a regular corporate hotel. Perhaps this is why they are so well rated. 

Overall, we loved our stay here and would not hesitate to book again.",5,2014,02,20
15,Wonderful hotel in perfect location,"Stayed 4 nights on our first trip to Barcelona. Hotel is hidden away on narrow streets of gotic area. Quiet, interesting hotel ( modern interior design in historic space-part of which includes Roman walls and watchtower) with exceptional service. There are several excellent restaurants within a 5 min radius and the hotel restaurant is among the best. ",5,2014,02,18
15,Superb Staff set this very good hotel apart from the norm,"This is a really fantastic hotel. 

Location: A+ Perfect.

Style: The communal areas are very smart and stylish. The Room (206) was excellent with lovely furniture and very well equipped bathroom with lovely Molton Brown. We enjoyed the space a lot as it was not rammed full of superfluous furniture and the bed was huge and very comfortable.

Food: Breakfast was very good and we also had the Menu Degustation for dinner on Valentines evening and whilst some of the food was a little hit and miss you accept that on a tasting menu and overall we really enjoyed it. On our last day we also had some Tapas whilst waiting for a taxi which again were very good.

So all in all what you would expect from a Hotel like this however what sets the Mercer apart are the staff. Everyone we had contact with from concierge, check in staff, waiters, cleaners everybody was just that little better than you expect. I honestly can't speak highly enough of them, so helpful and so friendly. Outstanding.",5,2014,02,18
15,Stylish Hotel.,"Stylish Hotel right in the heart of the Gothic Quarter, staff were so helpful and accommodating.  We were upgraded to a suite as it was a special birthday and we were given Champagne and chocolates as a lovely surprise! Highly recommend for a romantic getaway!!",4,2014,02,18
15,"Wonderful hotel, first rate!","Beautiful, clean, great location and the nicest hotel I have ever stayed at. The staff are friendly, helpful and genuinely interested in making your time in Barcelona the best trip you have ever had. We fell in love with Barcelona and can't wait to go back and stay at this hotel.",5,2014,02,15
15,Wonderful Hotel,"My partner and I for a break away stumbled across this hotel at a fantastic price, everything about this hotel deserves five star, the beautiful rooms, staff, and food. We enjoyed an unforgettable weekend and will most definitely return.",5,2014,02,14
15,Wonderful stay,"Really lovely hotel, beautiful rooms and a great location.  We were met with a glass of champagne - what more could you ask for.   Would highly recommend this hotel especially out of season where we paid the same price as we would have done for a B&b in the UK.
The staff were lovely too.
The roof terrace and pool were being renovated but it was Jan/Feb so we did not miss them.",5,2014,02,13
15,A beautiful and elegant Hotel,"We enjoyed an absolutely wonderful time at the Mercer, friendly staff, elegant surroundings and the perfect location made our stay the very best introduction to Barcelona. Special thanks to Bogdan for his brilliant explanation of the hotel site history and its present day evolution into the fabulous Mercer Hotel. It is quite obvious that the staff have great affection and pride for the Mercer Hotel - lovely people and faultless cuisine made this a very memorable and enjoyable stay that I would happily revisit! 10 out of 10",5,2014,02,12
15,Unforgettable stay!,"Great location, close to everything. We were here on our honeymoon. Without request, we were upgraded to a suite upon arrival. The hotel staff was very accommodating and accessible. We were given a thorough tour of the hotel and it's history. They've done an incredible job adapting old with modern flair. Each time you entered and exited the hotel, there was always a doorman to open the door. The continental breakfast was beautifully displayed with an array of choices and the service was exceptional. . It was one of the most comfortable room we've ever stayed in. The beds and linens were top-notch. You will sleep like a baby. 5 stars all around!",5,2014,02,10
15,Great hotel,We had a Great time. Staff and service truly exceptional. Attentive but never pushy. The suite was beautiful and the location great for exploring the city it was a great spot. The staff gave us great ideas for places to eat and nothing was to much trouble. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great place to stay in the city historic centre ,5,2014,02,05
15,As Good as it Gets,"My wife and I have travelled to Europe over a dozen times and can now say that the Mercer hotel is our absolute favorite.  The hotel is perfectly located for exploring Barcelona, as it is in the gothic quarter and only a 2 minute walk to the metro.  The staff was by far the most helpful, courteous and knowledgeable we have ever had the pleasure to encounter.  The hotel was chic, modern and very well maintained.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone!",5,2014,02,02
15,Beautiful Hotel,"I stayed her for only one night with my Mother and I couldn't of found a more beautiful place.  The hotel is a little difficult to find, so it might be best for you ask for written directions from the hotel so you can give it to the taxi driver.  

The rooms are lovely and spacious. Very clean and modern.  Very close to everything.  Metro station just a block away. 

We loved this place. The staff is also very courteous and helpful.",5,2014,02,01
15,little gem hidden away,"An excellent base for touring Barcelona in the gothic quarter. The staff could not have been more helpful if they tried.
Rooms are lovely and spacious, very clean and modern, with everything you need.
Walking distance of all major attractions.
Wouldn't have a problem recommending this to anybody.",5,2014,01,21
15,Very comfortable stay,"A very chic hotel in the heart of the city. The hotel has been built in some old building, but has a very contemporary design. The staff was very courteous and helpful. We found the hotel a little hard to find the first time though. Other than that, no complains. Would love to go there again!",5,2014,01,20
15,A fabulous place to stay,"My husband and I had a brief vacation in Barcelona and chose the beautiful Mercer Hotel. The location could not have been more perfect - in the Gothic area and in walking distance to the subway.  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and were able to steer us to restaurants and points if interest. The hotel was clean and hospitable. If I were asked about the negatives I would say that the rooms, which could have had better lighting, are on the small side and the concierge staff, although extremely helpful and available, was not always correct about closures (so check it out yourself too).  We would, however, highly recommend this hotel.",4,2014,01,18
15,Loved it!,"Went to Spain for business for only 2 night, and i was very please with how unique the rooms are. Beds were very comfortable, and it was quiet as a mouse at night while sleeping. If you can afford the Suite, get it.",4,2014,01,18
15,Memorable stay,"Leaving this enchanted paradise behind, you need to hang on to the notion that one day you will return.
Perfect location, gorgeous architecture, attentive staff, and excellent food.
Would definitely recommend.",5,2014,01,15
15,Concierge is terrific!,"We visited Barcelona in October with our 5 kids.  The concierge at Mercer helped us get tickets to a Barcelona FC game, reserve tables at the best restaurants and even arrange a babysitter! The hotel was fabulous too!  The kids loved the rooftop pool!",5,2014,01,11
15,Ancient and modern,"Beautiful hotel in a great location in the Barri Gotic. The back end is actually built into the remains of a roman watchtower and the rest of the hotel is built into a medieval house. However, the rest of the design is ultra-modern. A great contrast!  the staff was super-helpful and the location can't be beat. The room was commodious and comfortable. The only drawback was the formal restaurant (not the tapas bar), which was by Jean Luc Figueras. It was definitely a disappointment and one of my friends actually sent a dish back (I saw someone else do the same with another dish as well). maybe they're still getting the kinks worked-out. This didn't detract from the hotel itself which was outstanding.",5,2014,01,07
15,Fantastic location in a great hotel,"We've just come back from spending 4 nights in the wonderful Mercer hotel in the Gothic region of the city of Barcelona.  The hotel is ideally placed for all sightseeting and right in the centre of fantastic restaurants.

The hotel its self is a high end boutique hotel with staff who can'd do enough for you.  It really is a very good experience all round.",5,2014,01,06
15,Luxurious,"A wonderful luxurious boutique hotel tucked into the winding medieval narrow cobblestone streets.  The room was modern, large, very quiet and comfortable.  The Restaurant in the hotel has a tasting menu with wine pairings that was delicious, refined and fun.  The service is wonderful!  We stayed here for 7 days and would highly recommend this fabulous hotel.",5,2014,01,06
15,Luxury in the old quarter,"Stayed at the Mercer 24th to 28th December.  Booked on Trip Advisor recommendation and were not disappointed.  A little hard for the taxi to get to but it is only a short walk to main street, and the surroundings being in the old Gothic Quarter are fantastic.  The room was excellent, very clean, only complaint was the lighting was a little dim.   Breakfast was very good but very expensive.
All the sites are very close by and the Sagrada Familia not too far.  The staff were excellent and very helpful especially the concierge.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2014,01,05
15,we will definitely come back,"Love the location very central. Room was big enough. Staff was very helpful. We were there for three days in these three days we walked every where from the hotel.the staff was lovely.
We will definitely come back.",5,2014,01,04
15,An early Xmas present from Barcelona,"Thank you so much for a lovely weekend of 13/15 December. Room 202 was perfect and we will choose it again one day.  Your staff were amazing, Juan Manuel made us feel like the only guests he had, Roger quickly sorted out our early check in and Gloria our late check out! Florencia found out which terminal we were heading for and we had already left in our taxi!  And last but by no means least, the young lady who assisted us with our check out on Sunday - I'm sorry but I did not get your name.... was that really a week ago? And the room service people were so polite and helpful.  Thank you so much, Pierre and Lesley x",5,2014,01,03
15,Very Disappointing,"The good thing about this hotel is its location in the Gothic Quarter, after that, for us at least it was all downhill.
We stayed for a couple of nights over New Year. First impressions of the common area's were pleasant, not amazing, but OK. We were then shown to our Deluxe (dark) room (110), which was described to us by the staff member who took us there as having an ""internal patio and view over the Roman Walls"". We were confronted by a room with a blank wall (Roman) towering, some 3-4 metres away, to a height of around 15 metres, and of course 2 walls of the side of the Hotel. It was more like a luxury cave than a 5 star hotel room. Roman or not, a 15 metre wall is a 15 metre wall. We asked to be moved, but were told that this was not possible.

We were unable to enjoy any of the other facilities of the hotel as the roof terrace with pool, cocktail bar  and views over Barcelona was closed for the winter and the restaurant was already booked out for both nights of our stay.

The following morning we were woken  at 7:00 am.  The room was  next to an office and store room for the hotel staff and the constant coming and going and banging of this door, and general chatter continued to wake us until I finally confronted the various hotel staff I found outside our door and theirs. 

The Hotel Management later tried to persuade us that the noise had probably been from other guests, until I pointed out that I spoke Spanish, and other guests would be unlikely to discuss whether they had already made up bedroom number x. 

After going out  for the rest of the morning and returning around 2pm we found that the room had not been made up, and we were informed by the duty manager that they only made up rooms between 3pm and 6pm.... but he did apologise for all the inconvenience we had suffered and he offered to knock the cost of a beer and glass of wine which we had had the night before, as compensation....... The offer of a beer and a glass of wine as compensation for the failings on a 370 Euro a night room, is at best a little mean, and at worst, purely insulting

In my opinion, this Hotel falls far short of a five star status. Upmarket 3 star maybe, but even then room 110 should not be used as a guest room. The staff, while outwardly pleasant, had no idea how to cope when something goes wrong, and continued to compound the problem and make a bad situation worse.

I have to say we couldn't get out of the hotel fast enough, and I have no doubt the Hotel felt the same.

Poor value for money, and for us an extremely unpleasant place to stay, in a city we love.",2,2014,01,03
15,Excellent,"Here are the plusses:

+ location: in the Gothic Quarter, a stonesthrow from the beach and El Born
+ interior: the hotel design respects the history of the building, rooftop terrace is a joy, so is the lobby / garden terrace
+ rooms: beautifully furnished, high ceilings and a extremely comfortable bed. (do check the bedside drawers for magazines)
+ staff: extremely helpful and always friendly, you never have to wait

Keep this in mind when booking:

- the hotel can be hard to find in the small streets of the Gothic Quarter (do your research)
- at some point you have to leave (unless you decide to live there) and it will hurt",5,2013,12,31
15,New and Good Location,"This is a new boutique hotel built in the Gothic Quarter (old city) area of Barcelona. Within easy walking distance to the old cathedrals and museums as well as shopping and revitalized port area. Condition was very good. All staff were outstanding (extra friendly and helpful). Restaurant was very very very good, for breakfast and dinners. Rooms were functional but our junior suite was small with sitting area only useful for dressing area (disappointing). Would stay here again if visiting Barcelona.",4,2013,12,30
15,Excellent stay,"When we first arrived at the Mercer, my husband and I were lost. We had driven our rental VW convertible through the narrow streets of Barcelona and we weren't even sure that vehicles were allowed, whoops. Anyways, I ran up to the Mercer since we wanted to drop our bags before we returned the car, and instead they said they would come out and help us navigate our car. It was a great first impression. From then on, our stay was nothing but fantastic. We celebrated my birthday there so pretty high standards. The room was so sleek (and the bed was so comfortable). We spent many August evenings on the rooftop. My husband would dip in the pool, we'd order several mojitos and just relax. That rooftop was heaven. You'd forget you were even in the busy city for a few hours. We met some very nice people from the hotel up there, too. The staff was impeccable. After breakfast on the morning of my birthday, they showed up with a glass of cava. It was so wonderful. The hotel is in the best location - everything is right out your front door. I love the mix of old and new - beautifully done.",5,2013,12,29
15,Perfect blend of old and new.....,"After reading reviews on Trip Advisor, I stayed at the Mercer for four nights with a friend in December 2013. Located in the Gothic Quarter the area is perfect to explore the laneways, stumble across cool bars and restaurants, and admire ancient monuments and public squares. As a smaller property it has a unique 'boutiquey' feel about it. The amazing staff are consistently attentive, friendly and professional. The barman mixed sensational drinks and it was the perfect place to unwind at the end of the day. I particularly liked the preservation of the Roman walls alongside the chic, clean minimalist lines of the European fittings. Overall, a very cool place to stay......",5,2013,12,22
15,a hidden gem in the old town,"All the reviews are true, this is a wonderful hotel and what makes it even more special is the personal, each member of the hotel we had contact with was very attentive, smiling and really willing to make our stay special. and they did succeed! from the morning, till afternoon, even the night shift was charming and gracious. i say even because in some of the hotels they tend to hire grumpy serious people for night shift, but not here!
we loved the architecture of the building and the way it mix both antique style and minimalist scandinavian style. our room (superior) maybe wasn't too big, but definitely well arranged and facing an interior garden. it was very quiet and if i add that the bed was the best ive ever slept on, you can only imagine how hard it was for us to wake up every morning.
we are from france, living in the uk, travel a lot and we stay only in 5* hotels, but this one beats all of them.
thank you so much for making our stay so wonderful and see you next year!",5,2013,12,19
15,The Romantic Holiday Place,"Barcelona is busy, bustling, and raucous and amidst this din nestles the Mercer hotel, a dream place for romantic couples.  On your next anniversary be sure to book your room in this intimate place.  You will enjoy your togetherness more.  The tone and décor of the hotel blends supremely with the gothic architecture of the city.  The rooms are contemporary and the restaurant and bar are located in one of the historic towers.  The location is superb as a majority of the historical sites are easily covered by foot including Las Ramblas and the sea front.  Your stay will be more memorable if you visit the roof top with its well stocked bar.  Do enjoy the great service.  One trick is not to announce your anniversary.  Spring it as a surprise on the hotel and you would probably get an upgrade.",5,2013,12,17
15,Modern meets medieval,"We spent a couple of days in Barcelona and stayed at the Mercer - mostly because of the glowing reviews that the hotel got on TripAdvisor. The reviews were not wrong - it's truly an excellent hotel. The hybrid of medieval walls and Scandinavian minimalism works really well - the ambient is elegant, but not sterile. We stayed in a Gran Deluxe room which was high up overlooking the inner courtyard. The room was very spacious and the bed was amazing. 

The breakfast was excellent with fresh locally produced food. You can choose items from a set menu and there's a buffet with various goodies. The buffet is not self-service so it was amusing to look at the waiters desperately trying to intercept guests before they helped themselves. 

Service was superb. The staff was very attentive and willing to help with just about anything. At the same time they left you alone when you wanted to.",5,2013,12,17
15,Five Star in Every Respect,"This was my third stay in Barcelona in the last 18 months and it was definitely a case of third time lucky.  This is a small hotel in a very quiet side street but is very centrally situated in the City Centre.  Everything about the hotel was first class: the rooms, the food and particularly the service.  The staff went out of their way to make us feel at home.  My principal reason for the visit was to see a football match but my ticket got lost in the UK postal system so I arrived the day before the game without one.  The staff went to a great deal of trouble to ensure I got a ticket and even kept my elderly mother entertained while I was at the game.  The hotel is quite informal - not at all stuffy - but the whole experience is very much 5 star.  This is the hotel I shall use for future trips to this wonderful city.",5,2013,12,15
15,Fantastic location,"This is the first time I have written in Trip Advisor but felt it was my duty to tell you about this hotel. We visited Barcelona late November 2013. The Mercer Hotel is a small, intimate, beautifully designed hotel with a combination of the old ie the Roman and  Medieval walls merging seamlessly with the modern minimalist design. Our teenage kids were in the slightly larger Deluxe Twin room and very comfortable with 3 beds, a wonderful bath and shower and we were in the adjoining but not interconnecting perfectly fine Superior Room which has a large modern shower but no bath. The rooms were facing the pretty internal courtyard and very quiet. Just to note there is only a half wall dividing the bedroom from the shower/ sink area with a separate private toilet in the room- there is not much privacy if in the shower. We ate the breakfasts there which were delicious.
The staff were delightful- I have never been in a hotel where they have been so genuinely charming, happy and helpful. They recommended good areas to eat and excellent restaurants and were lovely to our kids. They were happy to book tickets for museums, football tours, buses etc. 
The location was perfect- we walked to most places from there occasionally taking a taxi. It was a perfect stay for 4 nights by which time we saw all the sights we wanted to see and had a wonderful time in Barcelona.",5,2013,12,15
15,Beautiful Property,"The service here is remarkable - anything we needed, the concierge assisted us with - getting discounted tickets to Casa Batllo or any recommendations for our next stop to Seville because one of the staff was from there. They were always attentive to our needs and very amenable to everything - this is definitely a recommended hotel that we'll stay at in the future. 

Location wise, this is perfect - not caught in the loud hustle and bustle of La Rambla or Placa Reial but close enough that everything is only a five minute walk at most within the Barri Gotic in any direction we go.

I would recommend not driving directly to the front of the hotel - there's a reason why taxis don't drop off directly in front of the property - the ""roads"" can narrowly fit in a compact car, but trying to get out of the Barri Gotic in what was a novice American's second attempt at driving stick shift was quite possibly the most stressful part of our trip! (laughable now, but nerve wracking when your car is stuck between another car and a wall and there's only two inches of maneuvering space to get out of it). If a cab drops you off at the city hall, it's literally only a one minute walk to the property.",5,2013,12,13
15,Wonderful!,"This beautifully designed modern hotel is set within the pale stone of the Roman & medieval walls & is perfectly located to explore the city, whilst away from the crowds.  Everywhere is furnished & equipped to the highest standards & it makes for an extremely comfortable stay.  
We cannot praise the staff highly enough.  Before our stay, they provided a list of restaurants & booked one for us.  They recognised that it was a milestone birthday & upgraded us to a fabulous, spacious room.  They provided a bottle of cava & a tray of savouries on the day. & at breakfast even surprised me with a tiny cake with a candle. 
Staff were most helpful in suggesting places to visit.  They booked the Sagreda Familia on line for us to avoid the need for us to queue & they assisted with local transport.  Their efficiency & welcoming manner made us feel really special & cared for.  
We thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,12,11
15,Loved it!,This hotel was such a nice surprise.  The decor is beautiful and so cozy.  We will definitely choose this hotel again if we return to Barcelona.  The staff is amazing and so helpful.  You can't beat the location and Barcelona is such a beautiful city.  I highly recommend this Mercer Hotel.,5,2013,12,06
15,Unbeatable,"I've stayed in some great hotels but the Mercer tops them all. Hidden away on the back streets of the gothic quarter you enter via huge woodern doors into a modern reception and bar area mixed with historical foundations.

The team couldn't be more attentive, offering a glass of cava on arrival to me and also a friend who wasn't even staying there!

Check in was simple. The rooms are large, designer and very quiet. Huge walk in shower, Lowe tvs, soft white towels and a huge and very comfortable king size bed.

Cosmetics are all Molton Brown, that says it all, class.

Will definitely only stay here from now on.

Incredible.

",5,2013,12,03
15,Excellent!!,"We went to Barcelona over the weekend, and made the reservations just two weeks in advance, but luckily manage to get the last available room at Mercer.

The Hotell is really nice, and the service was excellent! 

I want to send an extra thanks to the guest relations-team who helped us arrange table reservations at the best restaurants in Barcelona (according to me); Pakta and tickets, even thought you normally need to book it 3 months in advance. 

If you are looking for a first class hotell, I can warmly recommend Mercer!",5,2013,12,01
15,Beautiful Hotel With Outstanding Service,"We recently returned from what was a truly lovely stay at the Mercer Hotel in Barcelona, which we will never forget.  The building is absolutely gorgeous, beautiful and modern, while taking full advantage of the Roman structures within and around it, and our room also was fabulous and luxurious.  The location cannot be beat, as we were right in the middle of all of the sights and restaurants.  The thing that makes the hotel stand out however is the phenomenal level of service, as the hotel staff really went above and beyond with their responsiveness and kindness--everyone was amazing, from the staff of the restaurant at breakfast (and kudos to the folks who made the cafe lattes and baked the pastries!), to the guest relations staff who arranged for us to get tickets to an FC Barcelona soccer match, as well as tickets to the Picasso Museum and a Gaudi tour, and reservations at restaurants that were precisely what we said we were looking for.  We were in Barcelona with our 7 year old son and they truly achieved what may have seemed impossible--providing sophisticated and responsive service, but also making sure that we had everything we needed to make the experience ""kid friendly"" for him (he wanted me to mention the breakfast pastries again!).  Definitely obtain the map the hotel can provide via email in advance to give to your taxi driver at the airport, that allowed us to come right up to the front of the hotel at check-in.  Overall, truly marvelous, it was such a great visit, at a really spectacular hotel.",5,2013,11,30
15,Charming hotel and service,"This was such an amazing hotel - my only regret is that I didn't find it sooner.  The hotel and room architecture are fascinating (ask the concierge for a quick tour), the staff are lovely and the decor beautiful.  The free wifi throughout was such a nice touch relative to the price gouging other hotels engage in for this service. 

This hotel reminded me why I stay away from the big, corporate, hotel-factories",5,2013,11,25
15,Excellent Hotel,"Our stay at the Mercer Hotel was one of the most pleasant of anywhere in Europe.  The staff were consistently friendly and helpful and genuinely interested in making our stay the best possible.  The room and hotel common areas were very clean and sharp looking.  The Internet worked great!  The air condition/heating system was the quietest I've experienced anywhere in the world -- a really good system!  Significant drawback:  the bathroom didn't have a door.  Our room overlooked a small courtyard, but was very quiet.",5,2013,11,24
15,Thank you,"Such an amazing hotel! Great decor, great history, AMAZING staff. I can't wait to go back! I was welcomed by a glass of cava whilst checking in and that was just the start of the amazing service, they just couldn't do enough to ensure your stay was amazing and amazing it was.",5,2013,11,20
15,Brilliant in Barcelona,"We stayed here for 5 nights to celebrate Loraine's 65th birthday, and enjoyed a fabulous time. The hotel is a stylish blend of ancient and modern, set in and around the impressive Roman remains excavated in the Barri Gothic area. The location is ideal, with easy access to the central city area, and to Ribera and the port. The hotel boasts a lively Tapas Bar and  a fine restaurant. There are many bars and restaurants nearby. The atmosphere around the hotel is delightful. It's also quiet at night!! We had a Grand Deluxe room with balcony, which was perfect. What made our stay so special was the way all the staff made it their business to ensure our needs were being met. Nothing was any trouble, it was smiles and greetings all the way. We appreciated the bottles of cava and the impromptu birthday cake and candle produced by Lisa!! Thank you Mercer for a memorable holiday.",5,2013,11,17
15,Perfect place in the centre of Barcelona,"In a small street parallel to via Laeitana, in the middle of the old quarter. Perfect place to visit the center of Barcelona.
The rooms are very spacious, with high quality modern decoration with respect for the old elements in the magnificent palace.
Service was excellent and very friendly.
Cocktailbar was a perfect place to start your evening.
One point of criticism: breakfast was excellent but the formulas are a bit weird; and the buffet was not really a buffet: they did bring everything to the table, with some strange pauzes in between.
A full breakfast for everyone would be better.

Certainly a place i would come back on a next occasion.",5,2013,11,17
15,Wonderful memorable stay...,"A wonderful hotel! Really fantastic location in heart of Gothic quarter, but very quite, very modern, luxury feeling, nice decor, delicious food, good wine list, kind knowledgable staff is happy to help with everything. Really good value for money. Definitely will come back!",5,2013,11,17
15,Helpful service,"Despite an incident we ""experienced"" the day of arrival at the tapas restaurant “the bouchon” we enjoyed a very pleasant stay. We have to say that the full young team around the Sales Manager Jordi Garcia did an excellent job: always helpful, providing good pieces of advice for excursions or restaurants, keeping smiling all the time. All the staff members we met tried their best to fulfil our wishes: thank you so much for that! The hotel location is very adapted to discover Barcelona, it’s perfectly situated between the port and the old city. The hotel offers a flawless mixture between an ancient and also historical construction and modern decoration, what we truly appreciated. We slept very well with the windows fully closed (the first evening we tried with open windows but it was impossible because of the pedestrians shouting on the street at night). The hotel generously gave us a late check-out till 6 pm for free, what was a benediction with our flight taking off at 8.30pm!
Queerly we didn’t see the manager during our 4 days’ stay.
To be honest the main frustration apart from “the bouchon” came from the room: it was beautiful but dark and lacking of equipment. We missed especially the minibar in the room and storing place for our clothes! 
On the whole the stay was good but the hotel should concentrate on adding some equipment and services (for example a gym!) to compete with the conventional 5 stars houses.",4,2013,11,13
15,Simple Elegance,"My wife an I often disagree a little about hotels.  I like overt luxury and she prefers understated charm. Mercer Hotel in Barcelona hits the sweet spot for us.  The Hotel, built into an ancient city wall, is unique and distinctively charming.  The architectural details used provide modern luxury while retaining the essential and often beautiful characteristics of the original building. The service matches the building in its simple elegance - attentive but not intrusive.  This is a beautiful hotel in a fantastic location where the service and structure provide a peaceful and elegant oasis from the exciting bustle of Barcelona.",5,2013,11,12
15,The Best European Experience,"What more can I say. I wanted to do this trip up right, just like all vacations I go on. So in terms of expense I tend to say ""well, I only live once"". The Mercer blew away all my expectations. I seriously wanted to stay at this hotel from the moment I laid eyes on it and read the reviews. It was in prime Gothic Quarter location - perfection. Within 5-10min walking of the best restaurants, shopping, and the most beautiful architecture I've ever seen. 

1. The staff are the most pleasant, helpful, delightful hotel staff I've come across (and as a portrait & travel photographer the most stunningly gorgeous women and men). Kind of wish I booked a session. Seriously. Supermodels work here.   

2. We were treated to a tour of the hotel. Since when does this happen? We felt like royals.

3. The hotel is gorgeous. From floor to ceiling, stunning. Guys, bring a girl here and she will be in awe.  We stayed in the junior executive suite after being upgraded and requesting a cot (we made this request over the phone - 3 months after making the request the staff still remembered our conversation and knew who exactly I talked to).

4. The staff are at your beck and call. My brother and I enjoyed gin and tonics on the roof top next to the pool on an absolutely gorgeous day, enjoyed a delicious breakfast and splurged on tappas in the hotel bar.

Notes:
If you're taking a taxi here: They'll drop you off on the main road and you'll have to walk about 5min to get to the hotel. Expect 30euro-ish from the airport.

My brother spoke Spanish and this helped quite a bit throughout our trip as not everywhere did people speak English.

Try not to walk by yourself in the gothic quarter after dark. It can be nerve racking and you can easily get turned around.",5,2013,11,12
15,Great experience at the Mercer,"Even before you officially set foot in the Mercer there is much anticipation as you walk the streets of the old city.  You really do feel transformed and transported into a different time.  We were greeted with much warmth and the check-in was a breeze.  After check-in is complete the concierge gives you a tour of the hotel and describes the surrounding neighborhood.  The concierge team was very gracious and very helpful if you needed any destination or restaurant suggestions.  Rooms are modern/minimalist and the bathrooms and shower are very functional and modern.  Beds were super comfortable.  One drawback is the lighting in the room as it is not a very well lit room to read a book in the evening unless of course you own an iPad or an e-reader.  We chose not to eat in the hotel as there were so many places to eat near the hotel.  Also the hotel had a nice terrace to rest and lounge with a very small pool.

Location is central to many locations which include the waterfront, Picasso museum, shopping, and most of the great restaurants in the city.  For sights like the La Sagrada Familia you can definitely walk or take the excellent metro system which is quite easy to use even if you speak no Spanish.  We found Barcelona to be a great walking city with so many different and distinct neighborhoods.  

Overall it was a great experience and we will definitely stay here on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2013,11,11
15,What a gem!,"Currently staying here for a week and loving it! A little hard to find but that just adds to the charm. Staff incredibly friendly and attentive and our suite is superb, well laid out huge bathroom and bath.
Bed very comfy and great amenities although only a courtyard view.  Price reasonable and easily the best hotel we have stayed at in Barcelona....make the effort and find it!",5,2013,11,11
15,Best Hotel Experience in Barcelona,"If you want to experience true Gothic Barcelona in a luxurious, design-driven setting then Mercer Hotel is just the place for you.  Built in 2012 into the ancient Roman walls that once enclosed Barcelona, the Mercer Hotel is one of the most exceptional boutique hotels to hit town and is even listed as a historical monument.

Location:

Located at number 7 on Calle Lledó, the building incorporates part of the Roman walls of the ancient city of Barcino, some of which date back to the 1st century A.D. What’s more hotel guests have exclusive access to the medieval paintings of the 28th defence tower.  Another of the historical features of the hotel is the library on the ground floor. This part of the building has great historical significance in that it used to be on the sentry route between the 28th and 29th watchtowers of the Roman walls and features mediaeval frescoes uncovered during the renovation process.  This means you will absorb history and culture in your sleep!

Decor:

Imagine Spanish meets Scandinavian. Not sure what that means? You will once you stay at the Mercer Hotel. Medieval columns and restored frescoes have been brought up to date by Spanish architect Rafael Moneo’s streamlining of old and new.  The glass courtyard, Scandinavian furniture and pale wood floors create a contemporary vibe.

The Rooms:

The guestrooms are spacious, and the beds are supersized not to mention the egyptian cotton sheets and down blankets which really made it hard to get up in the morning. Although sleekly minimal in style, each of the 28 rooms has its own special feature, such as Catalan vigas, exposed brickwork, a private terrace or a two-person bathtub. Luxe detailing abounds, from the touch-sensitive Finnish beechwood bedside lamps and deep-pile rugs to the Loewe products in the minimalist bathrooms.

Facilities:

The terrace is located on the fourth floor of the hotel, between the two watchtowers, from where you can pick out the dome of the Santa María del Mar church, the Basilica of San Just i Pastor and Barcelona’s Gothic Cathedral. Here you can take a refreshing dip in the pool,or enjoy a drink at the poolside bar. At dusk, the terrace opens to the public, providing a unique setting for enjoying a cocktail whilst taking in the unparalleled view over the most ancient rooftops of Barcelona’s Gothic Quarter.

 

Service:

The staff is exceptionally professional, courteous and friendly. Everyone from the doorman to the concierge were more than helpful, giving us insider tips on how to get around and where to go to dodge the crowds. The concierge was fluent in several languages and made sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed everyday. He even went out of his way to get us into our room before check-in time. They upgraded us to one of the nicer suites without us even asking. Every evening we walked in to our room to find a little treat. The first night was a bottle of champagne and strawberries with a personal note from the staff. We really could not have asked for a better experience.

Dining:

The breakfast was served in the glass enclosed gallery in the middle of the hotel. While a table of cakes, cheeses and fruits was displayed in the middle, it was in no means a buffet style service. Each guest was asked to choose from the table along with anything else from the wide range of options on the menu.",5,2013,11,10
15,Amazing - all around,"Stayed here in April when traveling with friends.  The hotel was amazing, everything about it. From walking down the narrow road to the great service from all the staff.  Next year when I visit this is where we will stay.  Highly recommend as it is a small boutique hotel in the gothic district ",5,2013,11,07
15,fantastic !!!!,"we are old marrieds and stayed for 3 nights in a junior suite , from the moment we arrived we were treated so warmly and nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff , the doorman was wonderful and so helpful with local information as to where to go and what to do , food was lovely and the service was exceptional , room was perfect .great cocktails and relaxing in the library after a day of sightseeing  . thankyou for a lovely first visit , we will definately be back and wouldnt think of staying anywhere else !",5,2013,11,05
15,Perfect Blend of Ancient and Modern,"We stayed at the Mercer after a stay at Casa Fuster (an architecturally interesting classic 5 * hotel at the head of Passeig de Gracia - also highly recommended but very different than the Mercer.) Our taxi driver did not believe he could reach the front door of the Mercer because the street in the Gothic quarter was too narrow and Google maps concurred. (In fact you can drive there, but it's narrow and indicative of the hotel's location.) Once we pulled our luggage to the Mercers entrance we were immediately assisted by two gracious staff.  The Mercer's ratio of staff to guests is high and the quality of service is noticeable. The service is gracious without being pretentious - a hard note to hit. Stepping through their entrance one is immediately struck by the blend of modern glass expanses and ancient walls with high ceilings. The common areas are generous in size, brilliantly lit with natural light and everything has a museum like quality. In fact the several common rooms have first century walls showing and blending seamlessly into glass walls 2,000 years newer.The Mercer's design is unique.
Though our room was small, it was finely appointed and the common areas, inviting and spacious had us actually using them. 
We had several meals in both the restaurant and tapas bar (recommend the sweetbreads) and they were deserving of Mercer's Michelin status. The inner courtyard, which is open to the sky was elegant and romantic. There is food/drink service in the courtyard and on the roof top pool/deck which has interesting views of the surrounding quarter.
The Mercer's location, hidden in the narrow winding streets of the Gothic quarter was a pleasant surprise after staying on the Passeig de Gracia, a broad street with a boulevard and palm trees visible from our window. The balance was perfect. 
The Mercer is elegant, architecturally interesting, small and intimate and the service is excellent.",5,2013,11,04
15,Great hotel and location...,"We stayed at Mercer Hotel in September 2013.  We had decided it would be this hotel or the W-Hotel.  I must admit we picked the right hotel.

We arrived at the hotel and was welcomed to refreshments whilst checking in.  We were shown to our room which was lovely.  Relaxing and comfortable.

The roof top pool was a little gem considering it was a city break, great weather and we made full use of the pool.  If the bar was not staffed, you could order drinks using the phone that was located on the pool side bar counter.

We were room only but did purchase breakfast on one of the mornings.  It was nice but overpriced.

The drinks in the hotel were again expensive but to end the night, it was nice and worth paying.

We didn't take advantage of the hotel taxi transport due to the cost and found booking it online prior to arrival was very good and much cheaper.  The transport company managed to find the hotel (narrow streets) but we always took a map with us.

Overall, we loved this hotel and will return!

Yes its not cheap but worth every penny.....

We visited the W Hotel and found that the hotel was located on the beach around 10 mins from the main centre and was very impersonal compared to this hotel.

PLEASE PLEASE BOOK THIS HOTEL - IT WAS GREAT!!",5,2013,11,01
15,Simply the best,"This hotel is superbly located in the  Barre Gotic area, my wife and I stayed 4 nights and were blown away by the high level of service at every touch point in the hotel. Wether it be arranging train travel, restaurant guides, receiving packages every thing is done efficiently and with a smile.

The hotel itself is beautifully appointed, we stayed in a junior suite which was magnifico !!!
You will be close to the action and attractions yet the Mercer is hidden in a quiet lane which is a beautiful sanctuary for the hustle and bustle, that is Barcelona.",5,2013,10,29
15,We'll be back!,"We stayed at the Mercer Hotel from 12 - 18 October and had a fantastic time. As soon as we arrived at the hotel we knew we had definitely made the right choice and that was before we even got to the room. Upon arrival we were given a voucher to sample some tapas and a complimentary drink at the bar which was very enjoyable.We upgraded to a grand deluxe room and were delighted with the size, the little extras such as Molten Brown toiletries, free soft drinks daily and my son especially enjoyed the chocolates every night!  We had a massive bed and there was a roll-up bed for my son which was also of a great size and they are the most comfortable hotel beds we have ever had anywhere in the world and we are very well travelled!  We also had a balcony that overlooked the courtyard which was lovely to sit in with a drink at night as it was so peaceful.  The hotel is in a fantastic location for getting out and about yet being off the main streets it is so peaceful and quiet and you forget that you are in the middle of a city. We choose to book bed and breakfast which I would highly recommend - the lovely girl (sorry cant remember name but she's Russian) who looked after us every day was so helpful and by our 3rd day she didn't even ask us what we wanted it just arrived  on our table - excellent service! She even came up with different things that my son might like to try which he took her up on every time.We had fresh fruit, pastries/toast etc and a choice of various things from the menu and it was all freshly prepared as you ordered it.
The hotel staff go out of their way make your stay as pleasant and memorable as possible and even prior to us arriving I emailed the hotel as my son is a keen basketball fan and wanted to see Barcelona V Valencia Ticket and Joan emailed me back information on where to get tickets and how to get there etc. The hotel booked tickets for our visit to Sagradia Familia which I would highly  recommend as the queues are round the building but we were able to walk in straight away. All in all we had a fantastic trip to Barcelona and we will return again and most definitely stay at The Mercer:)",5,2013,10,28
15,Elegant and Welcoming,"We stayed here for four nights in October and just loved our stay here.  The staff were welcoming and helpful - our room was elegant and had the most divine bed.  It was wonderful to receive the complimentary water and chocolates each day.  Also enjoyed the welcoming plate of tapas on arrival in our room and at the Hotel Bar.  The Mercer Hotel is very central to everything, the concierge were very helpful with restaurant recommendations, and booked and printed our tickets to Sagrada Familia for us.  Nothing was too much trouble.  We enjoyed the rooftop area although sadly didn't get a swim in the pool (but maybe next time).   We would happily stay here again.",5,2013,10,28
15,Exceptional in every way. ,"From the extraordinarily hospitable and knowledgeable staff to the remarkable aesthetic of a masterfully rejuvenated Roman wallscape, the Mercer is quite simply exceptional. Situated in perhaps the most convenient area of old Barcelona, the Mercer's indulgent luxury and enticements (the best and most creative meal we've enjoyed in this city; a delightful and intimate roof terrace pool and bar area; rooms exquisitely and sumptuously presented) lead you to be forgiven for not venturing out enough. 

Forget the apartment block chain hotels; the Mercer's style, friendliness and quiet opulence reflects Barcelona perfectly. ",5,2013,10,27
15,Fantastic Mercer,"Stayed 4 nights in this fantastic hotel in a deluxe room on the third floor. The room featured a massive bed, huge closet and wonderful soaking tub. The windows open and overlook a quiet courtyard with a green wall. Loved the free minibar stocked with bottled water everyday and chocolates by the bed at night. Checked out the rooftop pool (small) and deck once. The amazing city beach is within walking distance and the hotel will provide you with beach towels. Many other sights are within walking distance due to the hotel's super central location in the gothic quarter. The hotel's best feature is the amazing guest relations team that came through with awesome restaurant recommendations every night of our stay. Mercer is a great hotel in a great city! Highly recommended!",5,2013,10,26
15,A fantastic experience awaits you.,"We found a truly great hotel The Mercer Hotel located in the historic Gothic section of Barcelona comprised of ancient stone paved alley ways lined with shops and restaurants. The hotel is a gem consisting of 28 rooms providing all the luxury and amenities one would desire. We enjoyed early evening cocktails and delicious tapas at the hotel's Tapas Bar. We dined at the hotel's very special restaurant and enjoyed food that was prepared and presented beautifully.

The common denominator in making this hotel so memorable is the staff. The General Manager commented to me that they strive every day to make the hotel better and it shows in every way. The rooms are pristine and artfully appointed incorporating parts of the walls of ancient ruins. There is turn down service every night with chocolates. A complimentary bottle of Cava, fruit and confection plates all appearing unexpectedly in our room. All the staff work very hard to make you feel welcome and always greet you with a friendly smile. All arrangements for sightseeing and restaurant reservations can be made right at the hotel.

We highly recommend the Mercer Hotel.

John & Sharon",5,2013,10,25
15,Historical Heritage Meets Contemporary Design,"Hidden in the Gothic walls of the ancient city a bellman rushed to our aid welcoming us to the Mercer Hotel Barcelona.  We were quickly relieved of everything we owned, offered a cold glass of water, a packet of lollies for the kids to keep them busy, and a friendly, speedy check-in while we caught our breath.
The Mercer Hotel is a 5 star luxury indulgence. Our room was huge, plenty of room for all of us, stunning bathroom and I love the chocolates at turn down service, felt very naughty. 
t was a leisurely morning the following day and we received the opportunity to witness the delightful breakfast service. The food served was simple, yet refined and executed with a high level of precision and quality. The superb personalised service was definitely the highlight for us. Every hotel staff member was warm and friendly. The central courtyard was a concert of aromas with fresh coffee brewing and delicate flowers adoring each table. 
he hotel is conveniently located in between the ancient walls with restaurants either side and a short walk to the Gothic cathedral, and walking distance to the waterfront. Despite the exclusivity of such a historical hotel, every time we passed through the lobby the staff were extremely welcoming, especially with the children.
Read more at our blog with lots of pictures.",5,2013,10,24
15,Worth every penny,"What an experience! We stayed in the old tower of the roman defense wall. Our room had the charm of history with the amenities of a 4 star NYC hotel. Great food and service on site and the staff are the most accommodating I have come across. They printed our tickets to Sagrada Familia and our boarding passes for us. The rooms are perfectly hip with amazing beds and great television. There is a nice rooftop with bar as well - we got to sneak a peek but it rained so we were unable to enjoy it.

We came here after spending five days on vacation knowing that we would need a full service hotel for our last night. We finally relaxed at the Mercer and enjoyed every minute of it.

Great WiFi and room service. They do sneak in your room occasionally to leave you treats and prepare the room for the evening.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND A NIGHT HERE. While there, make sure to visit their best neighbor Formatgerie La Seu.",5,2013,10,23
15,"Discreet, hospitable, beautiful.","This place was beautiful. Situated in the most charming area of Barcelona. Warm and incredible staff. 1st class everything. We treated ourselves and it was worth every penny.

Note to travelers: beware of thieves and gypsies. The husband had his phone nabbed on a charming street in the Borne area. Do not walk around with google maps unless you have your iphone tucked away. The guy swiped in on a bike going very fast.  Mind you , we travel alot and consider ourselves to be smart and safe travelers. Have a strong wrist strap on you phone if you think you will be walking around with it.",5,2013,10,22
15,Style and location,"We spent 5 days at the Mercer in September and October returning twice. The people, especially Migel, could not have been kinder nor more helpful.  The physical plant is modern and charming with numerous beautiful architectural touches from ancient Barcelona. The new chef at the restaurant is fabulous as is the location in the Gothic quarter. ",5,2013,10,22
15,Just like a dream!,"The Hotel in the heart of Barcelona's gothic district is architecturally beautiful with its combination of the warmth & history of ancient stone. Townhouse was restored by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Rafael Moneo. The Roman-era walls, exposed brickwork and soaring ceilings pair with minimalist Scandinavian decor.
After a delayed trip from Norway we arrived at this exceptional hotel. We got a great welcome from a very professional staff, after a glass of cold cava our relaxing stay started. We stayed at room 108 junior suite, this gave us all the luxury we needed, especially to have own private outside big terrace was exceptional. We got excellent room service despite the late hour, what a way of relaxing drinking a good bottle of Bollinger sitting outside at this beautiful place. Next morning we had our breakfast at a nice open area, well prepared and excellent served by an extremely polite waiter. Since the hotel is very central located shops and other places are on short walking distance.  Sadly that on all good times there come an end, but we decided that this hotel will be on our list on top favourite places so we will for sure return soon!",5,2013,10,21
15,Where the cool kids stay,"Very much enjoyed my stay at the Mercer. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. Stayed in room 310, it was spacious, stylish and had the most amazing bathtub and shower. The hotel is tucked away on a side street in the Gothic quarter and is close to Las Rambles, Born (great shopping), the waterfront, and Boqueria market. I like that the hotel decided to forgo the stocked bar fridge and the staff fill it each day with complimentary bottled water. There is not much of a view from the rooftop patio but it is a lovely place to spend time relaxing in the sun. I would absolutely return to the Mercer if I ever found myself back in Barcelona.",5,2013,10,20
15,Treated like Royality! Best service ever!,"On September 24th, my sister(Sandra Mercer) and I arrived at the Mercer Hotel, Barcelona, all the way from Canada.
We were totally exhausted after only three hours of sleep and with the 6 hour time change.
We arrived outside your hotel to be greeted by two lovely men,Roger and Isidro.

We were escorted into the desk to confirm our reservations and then we
were offered a room upgrade at no extra charge! This was a wonderful
bonus!
Then we met Bogdan who took us on a tour of the hotel, giving us a
thorough history of the building and the new additions. Bogdan then took
us to our room to ensure everything was suitable, and we entered a
beautiful, bright, clean and stunning room which opened up inside the
courtyard, a nice and quiet room so we could not be disturbed and we
could rest without noise.

Our suitcases arrived next by Bogdan.
My sister and I freshened up then went out to explore the city. Before
departing the hotel, we were given hand drawn maps from Isidro. Isidro
also told us about restaurants very close and some must see sights. He
wrote out the name of the street we were on, in addition to a local
courtyard, incase we got lost we could show this place to a cab driver.
The directions were fabulous. Isidro went above and beyond to ensure we
were given accurate directions.

Finally we returned to our room to sleep, and we were surprised to find
cold water, and some delectable sweet treats.

The experience was fabulous! We have certainly recommended your hotel to
many people. If returning to Barcelona, I would stay at the Mercer Hotel, without hesitation.

Located in the centre of the historic region, yet located on a cozy side street! Best of both worlds!",5,2013,10,20
15,Charming! You won't want to leave!,"We stayed at the Mercer Hotel in Barcelona for 4 days.  What a gem!  With just 28 rooms, and built on old Roman Ruins, this hotel is bursting with charm.  It is located in the old district tucked away on a back street near the Barcelona Cathedral.  From the moment we arrived, the staff did their best to ensure we were comfortable.  We arrived early following a cruise so our room was not ready but we were offered breakfast and given suggestions as to what we could do until the room was available.  Guest relations staff Joan Manel and Roger went above and beyond ensuring that we were happy with our accommodations.  We had dinner at the hotel Le Bouchon the first night; the food was wonderful (cod was succulent and the squab was cooked to perfection) but there are plenty of good tapas restaurants in the area.   The hotel’s roof top terrace was closed but because the weather was so warm, the staff said they would bring us a glass of wine to enjoy on the terrace.   We stayed in #307 our room over looked ruins and with three windows offered plenty of light. If you want a make-up mirror, ask for a room that has one located in the bathroom area.  Some rooms have the make up mirror on the desk and the task lighting in this area is very low. The decor is modern and the rooms are well appointed.  Shopping around the hotel is plentiful – leather, jewellery, clothing and there are many churches, cathedrals, and museums to visit.  It is a 5 - 10 minute walk to Barcelona's famous La Rambla. This hotel is a fabulous find.  We will stay here again the next time we come to Barcleona!",5,2013,10,15
15,"Gorgeous Hotel, Great Location","We planned to stay in Barcelona for 2 nights after our cruise in August. I searched tripadvisor to find a good hotel. (I'm very particular.) the Mercer hotel had so many wonderful recommendations that we chose to stay there. We were so glad we did. Although we had to get off the ship by 8:30 and were at the hotel by 9 AM, they had a room ready for us. The room was big and modern and beautiful and extremely clean.The shower was amazing! The hotel is located in the medieval and gothic part of Barcelona, and everything we wanted to see was in walking distance! There is so much to see nearby. The staff was so warm and helpful and engaging at every point during our stay. There was free wifi so that was nice. We asked for a recommendation for dinner one evening. We ended up walking further than we expected, but it will remain one of the dining experiences we will never forget: a series of delicious tapas and a pitcher of sangria, and very reasonably priced. Breakfast was included and it was served in a delightful small courtyard and very elegant! We cannot wait to go back to Barcelona and we will certainly stay at the Mercer. I recommend the Mercer as one of the finest hotels I have ever stayed at.

There had only been one negative comment on tripadvisor about this hotel: that it was located in a small alleyway and the taxi driver dropped people off a couple of blocks away. I emailed the hotel and asked about this and they sent me a very specific map of the alleyways so that taxis can take you right to the front door.",5,2013,10,14
15,Top Notch Service,"My husband and I stayed at the Mercer Hotel for six nights in September.  I cannot say enough about this hotel.  From when we checked in (and were given a nice cold glass of cava) until when we left, we felt welcome and that whatever we possibly needed would be taken care of.  The location (The Barri Gothic) was our favourite area in Barcelona and we could walk everywhere from the hotel.  Our room, which faced out onto the street and on the second floor, was spacious and quiet.   The shutters on the windows blocked out any exterior noise and the room was nice and dark so we slept very well.  The bedding was fabulous.  We ate dinner one night at the restaurant - the food was divine.  We have travelled extensively throughout Europe, Canada and the United States and I can say, with no hestitation, that the service we received from every staff member at the Mercer was exceptional.  Special mention must be given to Juan Manuel, who not only gave us a nice tour of the hotel on arrival, but managed to get us tickets to see FC Barcelona, as well as Florencia, who gave us excellent advice on sightseeing and restaurants.  Thank you very much to both of you for making our stay so pleasant.   We will definitely be visiting The Mercer Hotel Barcelona again!",5,2013,10,11
15,"Great, interesting boutique hotel","We stayed here with 3 other couples in Sept 2013 for 3 nights, and had an excellent stay.  The concierge, Juan Manuel, was probably the most helpful we have ever had (and we just got off an excellent cruise).  We could walk everywhere - and did - from this great location.  The rooms are very modern in this very old area.  Be forewarned that taxis seem to have trouble finding the hotel because it is on such a tiny street.  They have to get you close, then you call the hotel and they walk out to get you.  (This happened to all 4 couples). On our departure, the driver did come to the front door, and then we had an interesting ride out.  There is a nice rooftop sundeck with pool.",5,2013,10,10
15,The jewel of Barcelona,"my first stay at the Mercer could not have been better: Great location within walking distance to all major sights and shopping, lots of good restaurants around.
Great architechture and cool interior design. My room (106) on the 1st upper floor was large and quiet with a little sit on balcony. Well equipped bathroom with separate WC and walk-in closet and generous selection of English luxury toiletries.
Breakfast a la carte was a must, served like in a 3 star restaurant, very tasty and incredible selection of cakes. The real plus is definitely the staff, The evening concierge a top professional, Gloria and Jordi  and all the others i don't remember the name of were so helpful and efficient",5,2013,10,09
15,Outstanding Mercer*****,"My husband and I held our wedding reception at the Mercer and it was one of the best decisions we could have made.  From the first meeting with the staff to go through the requirements of the day they made us feel welcome and at ease. The attention to detail and the personable service is second to none. The food at the reception went beyond our expectation and the service through the night was exceptional.  A HUGE THANK YOU to Joerdi for having the wedding completely under control and for making us feel so special during our stay - he was never seen without a big smile on his face! Thank you also to Gloria, Joan Manel (see you in the Valleys) and to the lovely Nicoletta... 
I cannot recommend this beautifully renovated hotel highly enough; The food, the decor, the room (401 - WOW), the location, I could go on and on...a truly memorable experience.",5,2013,10,09
15,Beautiful hotel,"My sister and I stayed at this hotel for 1 night in September 2013 prior to our cruise and our stay was a wonderful experience.  The hotel is situated in the centre of the old section of Barcelona (Barri Gotic) and is an easy walk to restaurants, site-seeing, etc.  We were welcomed like stars, given a tour of the building and shown the ancient Roman ruins into which the hotel is built, the service was very personalized, and first rate. The hotel itself has high end amenities, is very clean and quiet. Our room had a view of the interior courtyard and was gorgeous and most importantly, quiet.  We were even treated to bottled water, fruit and a small tray of dessert. Staff provided us with everything we needed - from help with restaurant recommendations, tickets for the hop-on, hop-off bus tours, taxis, etc.  After a great night's sleep, we ate breakfast in the restaurant next door which is part of the hotel (separated from the main check-in area by a curtain) and it was delicious. Fantastic stay...hope to be able to come back in the future!!",5,2013,10,07
15,The just perfect Mercer,"We are here for 4 days following a Backroads cycling trip to Mallorca. We arrived Friday evening after a harrowing flight from Palma in a terrible storrm. Our cab driver heroically negotiated the narrow streets to bring us to the entrance of this lovely hotel in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona. Manuel's very personal welcome was most appreciated and a perfect example of the fine service and professionalism of this hotel. Our room(106) is lovely and we are at this very moment enjoying the balcony requested when we first made our reservation. Breakfast taken al fresco in the courtyard is quie nice and we have also availed ourselves of the lovely pool terrace on the fourth floor. We enjoyed an excellent dinner the first night at the hotel's tapas restaurant  Le Bouchon.
The setting of the hotel is perfect for exploring the Gothic Quarter, El Born, Las Ramblas and El Raval.  Expectations have definitely been met on this trip!",5,2013,10,06
15,Outstanding service in a beautifully renovated palace in the Barrio Gothico,"Benefiting from a beautiful synthesis of old and new (an old palace was carefully reconstructed and complemented with appealing modern architectural elements), this hotel creates an aesthetically extremely appealing and, at the same time, relaxing atmosphere. The rooms are modern, while integrating pre-existing old architectural elements whenever these had survived.  It is worthwhile mentioning that this hotel is one of the very few hotels in e old town of Barcelona that are very quite despite their central location!!! The staff was extraordinarily helpful (including in respect to rather unusual requests, for example regarding curtain fabric stores) and welcoming. We travelled with our three-year old daughter, who was treated with a lot of affection and patience by the staff. The quality of the breakfast is excellent. One caveat: There is some room for improvement for the restaurant. While it offers an attractively-priced menu for dinner, the quality of this low-price option was mixed and the flexibility of the chef  in substituting another dish from the a la carte menu for one of the courses was limited. However, after we had complained about this, we were very pleasantly surprised at the time of the check out that the hotel had not charged us for this dinner. It is clearly our impression that the hotel management and the staff of this relatively new hotel is doing its utmost to resolve such issues and we certainly look forward to staying at this hotel again (many times!).",5,2013,10,06
15,Beautiful hotel,"Great hotel in the Gotic. Deserving of the hype. Public areas, rooms and service were outstanding. The rooftop pool and terrace were beautiful. We did not dine in the restaurant but the tapas bar was amazing",4,2013,10,01
15,"Fabolous hotel , opulance meets elegance","Loved the beautiful restyling  design the attention to detail in the decoration , the ambience as a whole was tremendous .  The location was great ( we really loved this part of gothical barcelona)  the staff were very welcoming and helpful with everything. Food and service was  exquisite",5,2013,09,30
15,"Outstanding service, wonderful ambiance, perfect location","My daughters, close friends and I recently returned from a marvelous vacation in Barcelona. We spent six nights at the Mercer and staying there was one of the highlights of our trip. The Guest Relations staff is truly exceptional--so helpful and always ""going the extra mile"" for their guests. 

Everyone we met at the hotel was wonderful and helpful, but I particularly want to commend Florencia and Isidro. Florencia was so helpful before our arrival in setting up restaurant reservations (even getting us into the highly acclaimed Tickets) and arranging a car to pick us up at the airport among other very helpful suggestions and recommendations. Isidro was also very helpful (even providing great shopping tips in the nearby El Born area).  The dining staff was also charming and the food was very good. 

From our first impression (a glass of cava while we checked in and awaited our room) to check-out, we had a great experience. 

Since the hotel is only one year old, the rooms are very well-appointed with all modern amenities. That said, the hotel is also very charming; taking advantage of its location next to the old Roman city walls. 

I could not be more enthusiastic in recommending the Hotel Mercer!  We have stayed at many fine hotels abroad (including several Four Seasons properties) and the Hotel Mercer experience is one we will always remember always. 

One last comment on the location. It is simply perfect. We were a short walk to the waterfront, Las Ramblas, Placa Catalunya, numerous great local restaurants and shops, the Cathedral, museums, etc. 

We can't wait to return to Barcelona and stay at the Mercer. On a 5-point scale, I rate it a 6+++!
",5,2013,09,29
15,"Top notch, best ever.","We just came home from the tail end of our 2 week Spain trip. As a finish to our trip, my wife booked two days a the Mercer before flying home to  the states. We have to put this hotel at the top of our ""best hotels ever"" list, supplanting the 4 Seasons in Vancouver, BC. (Sorry 4Seasons)!
Everything about this place is perfect, from check in to check out. Service is impeccable, without being stuffy or overwrought. Its a small place, only 28 rooms I think. I think that's a  big piece of what we loved. The staff knew our names, and even though we were  there for a whirlwind 2 days, we felt like we'd been there for 2 weeks. The hotel restaruant ""Le Bouchon"" was one of our favorite places we went in the Barri Gothic area. And we ate at a lot of places in 2 days (lots of small meals...)! We sat in there 3 times I think, and each time I told my wife, ""I'd be happy to just sit here all evening..""  Dibbern china, Cutipol cutlery. Fantastic. 
My wife just said, ""I'm not sure I want you to review that hotel, because I love it so much, I kind of don't want anyone else to know about it!!!!"".
Very highly recommended.",5,2013,09,29
15,Perfect from start to finish!,"The Mercer is one of the finest hotels we have stayed in.  Extraordinary service from the moment you arrive (we were three hours early and our room was ready and we were offered complimentary orange juice, and cafe con leche's in a beautiful lobby area.   A wonderful tour of the facility then took place and then we were shown our  fabulous room.  A super modern room built upon ancient Roman walls (the hotel is in the Gothic section of Barcelona, a historic location). In addition this hotel is at the crossroads of the finest sights of Barcelona. Wonderful restaurants, shops, and markets abound.  Match this with the fabulous service of Theresa, our check in person, Manuel and his crew,  a top restaurant, a phenomenal bartender, whose name I am sorry but cannot remember but who makes a killer Negroni, a remarkablly attentive restaurant manager who seemed to be there all of the time from morning to night and our roof-deck, poolside waiter Alex and you have an experience in fantastic Barcelona that you will be hard pressed to beat.  Be wary of staying in the most exclusive big hotel areas as these are rife with tourists. Stay in this Gothic section which is close to all and so ""SoHo"" in appearance and vibe.  The hotel has great wine and tapas bars nearby.  It is a bit difficult to find at first, but once you arrive you are in a really special hotel.  5+ stars.  Close to the amazingly clean and efficient subway system which is only 4 stops to the incredible Sagrada Familia (do not miss this!!)  Other sights are within walking disance such as the Picasso Museum.  In summary, a gorgeous, hip, new, immaculate place with incredible service to call home for a few days that is truly worth the $$$!",5,2013,09,27
15,Exquisite hotel with exceptional & personal service levels,"The Mercer Hotel in the heart of Barcelona's gothic district is architecturally beautiful with it's combination of the warmth & history of ancient stone with clean modernism. The private dining courtyard is a sanctuary after the stimulus of the gothic quarter exploration. Our dining experience here was wonderful.  

However what sets The Mercer apart is the exceptional and very personal level of service - from every staff member we encountered! From the moment we walked in to request our luggage be stored while we were in Madrid we were treated as honored guests. The assistance from Bogdan in navigating the intricacies of the Spanish post office & the procurement of clear packing tape was  unbelievable - as was the assistance of Isobel the sommelier in selection of Spanish wines! Thanks to all the staff & our complements to General Manager Francesc Holgado & his team. This is a wonderful place to start exploring the wonders of Barcelona! We will be back again! ",5,2013,09,27
15,Amazing!!!!,"This place is AMAZING!!!!   First off, the entire staff is incredible and go above and beyond the call of duty to make your stay comfortable, help with activities, cater to your every need and always with a smile and a ""we want you to be happy"" attitude.  Breakfast is amazing and tapas bar is also awesome.   Housekeeping is faster than the speed of light.    The rooms are spotless, cozy, quiet, and the junior suite (204) had an amazing big tub and a separate room for the toilet.      PERFECT LOCATION in gothic section of town. Close to everything.  We walked to all major attractions, but we were still tucked away in this cute, small hidden alley.    It was sold out but not once did it feel crowded.   Roof top lounge is also very cozy and comfortable.  The entire place is private, intimate, luxurious and romantic.   Big thanks to the entire Mercer Hotel staff for making our stay so unbelievable.   Traveling at 6 months pregnant can be challenging due to my picky food and comfort needs, but I slept better than I ever had in any hotel in their super cozy beds, and not once was I given a hard time with my picky preggo food needs.      If you are looking for a small boutique luxury hotel tucked away from the crowds and the Rambla and for a truly unique Barcelona experience, look no further.  We spent our last two nights at Hotel 1898 (which I also reviewed if you care to check it out) and we wished the whole time we had never left the Mercer.",5,2013,09,25
15,Brilliant,"All the reviews are right: perfect hotel, fantastic location, staff could not be more helpful...

...never stayed at a better hotel.

(Trip Advisor needs a minimum of 200 characters, but what more is there to say?)",5,2013,09,22
15,Style But No Substance,"The fact that the Mercer Hotel ranks number two of all the Barcelona hotels is a damning indictment on the quality of the city's tourist accommodation. My wife and I recently spent five nights at the Mercer and in several crucial respects the hotel was a shambles. Firstly, we booked a deluxe room but, situated at the raucous front of the hotel, we were woken every night by revellers, dust-carts (3.30am) and the infernal buzzing of pesky motor-bikes. Despite all its architectural flourishes, the hotel has not installed secondary glazing of the kind found in similar establishments and as a result, guests are forking out upwards of 360 euros for the same noise-interrupted sleep afforded by a cheap pension. It is simply not good enough.
    Elsewhere, service was patchy and chaotic. In the quaint hotel pool at the top of the hotel, service ends at five in the afternoon and guests staying on to enjoy the sun resort to nipping out and bringing food back in. Perhaps the hotel is cutting costs and has not enough staff to go round. Asking the concierge for help was a lucky dip. One bearded staff member gave us brilliant instructions on how to walk to the Miro Foundation from the hotel but a female concierge booked us a restaurant table, forgot to tell us she had done this and when we got to the restaurant, the booking had only been made for one hour!
   Worst of all was the lack of service in the tapas bar in the evening. Here, events  bordered on farce as it took twenty-four minutes for our order of Campari and soda to arrive despite the fact that at one point there were four members of staff peering at the bottle and wondering how to pour out its contents. A friendly American couple, who were also hotel guests, had undergone  a long wait for drinks and also had tales of breakfast confusion to relate that were reminiscent of the bumblings of Manuel, the hapless Barcelona waiter from Fawlty Towers.
   I spoke to the Mercer's manager about our noisy room and he insisted that the guests' needs were a priority. I see it that way but he is not leading from the front and instead is presiding over a third-class establishment. The staff are mainly young, enthusiastic and full of potential but they are untrained and lacking in direction. Until the Mercer, provides a service to match its prices, it will continue to frustrate.",3,2013,09,22
15,Wonderful hotel!,"A beautiful boutique hotel in the Gothic quarter.  The hotel staff were amazing....excellent service, friendly and professional.  The room was a little on the dark side, and brighter lighting would be good.  However, the room was a good size and very quiet.  The beds were comfortable.  The location is fabulous, an easy walk to the Las Rambla and the old Cathedral.  We really enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.  ",5,2013,09,21
15,Excellent modern hotel in the gothic quarter,"We had a fantastic time at Mercer Barcelona and cannot thank Florencia enough for all that she did to make our stay such a pleasure.  The accommodations are beautiful 21st century set against the historic walls of 1st century Roman empire.  The food is fantastic, the service is second to none and this hotel is one we will recommend to anyone we talk to who will be traveling to Barcelona.

Thank you Mercer, you made our trip so much more enjoyable.",5,2013,09,16
15,Perfection,"We spent three perfect nights at this beautiful hotel.  The best part of our experience was the Mercer staff.  The entire team at this hotel was professional, gracious, welcoming, friendly and helpful.  They made our stay in Barcelona so much more enchanting.  The hotel itself is a perfect melding of ancient walls and chic, modern decor.  Breakfast is served in a charming courtyard.  The rooftop deck is a delightful oasis where we enjoyed delicious tapas, wine and sunsets.  Our room on the third floor (overlooking inside courtyard) was spacious, comfortable, quite, nicely decorated with every modern amenity.  The entire hotel was sparkly clean.  The Mercer's location in the Barri Gothi is ideal, yet the hotel inside is so peaceful.  I will caution that the taxi driver from the airport struggled to find the hotel and would recommend that the Mercer provide incoming guests, upon booking, with directions that they can then provide to the taxis.  Definitely was one of our best travel experiences.  Thank you to the whole Mercer staff and in particular, thank you to Juan Miquel and the absolutely delightful Ukrainian doorman whose name we did not catch.",5,2013,09,10
15,"Relaxing, quiet, oasis in center of busy Barcelona","We had a day to spend in Barcelona between disembarking a cruise ship and getting a train in the evening. 

The hotel was happy to welcome us as guests even though we were not staying the night. And what a welcome. When we got out of the taxi they were expecting us and welcomed us by name! The staff took charge of our luggage whilst we had coffee and then let us know that all the hotel facilities were available to us, including the roof terrace.

We spent a couple of hours in Barcelona before returning to the hotel for a leisurely lunch in the restaurant. And it was an excellent lunch with well cooked flavoursome food served by attentive friendly staff after which we were able to relax in the lounges in true Spanish siesta style.

The hotel décor is stunning with the mix of very old and very new architecture. Inside, the hotel is a quiet oasis in the bustling city of Barcelona. This coupled with the excellent staff and service make it a superb hotel.

I would not hesitate to use it on a return visit to Barcelona.",5,2013,09,10
15,Awesome property awesome staff,"Located deep inside the gothic quarter of Barcelona this is one hidden gem. After a lot of research and reviews on trip advisor we chose to stay at Mercer. The hotel can be a bit difficult to find as its new and taxi drivers are still yet to know about the place. We got lost some 100 mts away from the hotel but the hotel was helpful enough to send a member of staff promptly to help us. First impression of the hotel was wow so cool. It forms a part of the old city hall and they have one of the guard towers converted into a nice cosy bar and restaurant. They upgraded us on our arrival as we were celebrating our anniversary. The room is very modern but retaining some elements of the history. The lane outside the hotel is quiet and not noisy (as is the case in several properties in Barcelona). Located walking distance from most sites including the sea front and Las Ramblas. The hotel staff was brilliant and helped us book restaurants in advance and managed to get us into the top nightclubs on a very busy friday night (as some big music festival was on at that time). The hotel has a lovely rooftop with a small pool and bar and its very relaxing.

Only one ""fault"" we did notice was the Loo. The WC was one of the best brands - Antonio Lupi. Looks real sexy but the seat was so bad to sit on. Beyond 30 secs really hurts. Maybe the management can think of replacing the seats.

We highly recommend this hotel and we are definitely going to stay here again next time.",5,2013,09,06
15,Excellent. Hotel,"Suite was super. Friendly staff , comfortable bed and linen . Shower , bath had all you need . 
Restaurant , bar and roof terrace all fantastic . Hotel very clean . After one year opening doors i hope the quality , standard of higiene and maintence will remain. Highly recommend if staying in Barcelona . Patrick Pure Allure Interior",5,2013,09,04
15,Genial - Awesome Hotel,"Mi novia y yo queríamos celebrar un momento muy especial para nosotros, y en el Mercer conseguimos el escenario perfecto.  Situado en el corazón histórico de Barcelona, encontramos después de un agradable paseo, este hotel monumento, donde se combinan perfectamente la arquitectura romana y medieval de sus bellas paredes y techos, con la elegancia y el confort de un hotel 5*. Buenísimo el desayuno del restaurante y la cena en su Vermut de tapas. Y queremos dedicar una mención especial y afectuosa al fantástico trabajo del Guest Relations y del resto del staff del hotel, con su ayuda y atención, nos hicieron sentir como en un cuento desde el primer al último segundo. Volveremos sin duda, es un lugar que nos ha conquistado.

My wife and I wanted to celebrate a very special moment for us, and the Mercer was the perfect scene. Located in the historic heart of Barcelona, you'll find this monumental hotel after a nice walk, mixing carefully Roman and medieval architecture of its beautiful walls and ceilings, with the elegance and comfort of a 5* hotel. We had a wonderful breakfast of its restaurant, and also a great dinner of ""tapas"" in its Vermut. Finally we want to dedicate a special mention to the fantastic work of Guest Relations and the rest of staff of the hotel, with their help and attention, they made us feel like in a fairy tail, from the first to the last second. We'll definitely back for sure, it's a place that has conquered us.",5,2013,09,04
15,A must stay!,If you are going to Barcelona you must plan a stay at the Mercer Hotel. The staff goes above and beyond with the service. The rooms are amazing and the food was excellent! I can't wait to go back! Don't let the location fool you. You will love walking through all the amazing alley ways.,5,2013,09,04
15,Great place to stay in Barcelona!,"My wife and I stayed at the Mercer for 5 nights in late August, 2013.  We really enjoyed our stay from beginning to end.  The hotel itself is very stylish and perfectly located in the Barrio Gotic.  The rooms are quiet (we stayed in room 203 which faces the alley over the entry of the hotel) and comfortable - my wife who can be a sensitive sleeper slept very well (win!).  The only critique that we could come up with is the lighting in the entry way of our room was pretty dim which made it tough to dig through our luggage...pretty minor issue.

The service was impeccable - we leaned on the concierge staff to help with dinner reservations, one of which successfully helped us to get into the hard-to-get-into Albert Adria restaurant 'Tickets' which was one of the highlights of our stay.  They also helped with train tickets and were generally pleasant throughout our stay.

This is definitely not the cheapest hotel (you may be able to save by booking through a 3rd-party booking engine, like Expedia), but if you do decide to splurge you can rest assured that this will be money well spent and will go toward ensuring a fun stay in Barcelona.",5,2013,09,04
15,"Simply Stunning, Wow!","This hotel is just gorgeous. Set amongst an old roman building, the architecture and design perfectly combine beautiful old stonework with contemporary furnishings. We stayed 3 nights in the Suite where we were greeted with a complimentary bottle of cava upon arrival. 
The location is ideal for exploring Barcelona and we liked that the rooms are not subject to a load of street traffic. 
Staff could not have been more helpful and courteous with restaurant  and taxi bookings. 

We can't wait to go back!",5,2013,09,02
15,One of the best hotel we have ever been,"We stayed in this boutique style hotel 11.-14.7.2013. We have been in many 5-star places in more than 30 different countries all around the world. This was definitely one of the best we have ever been. We got a super nice room and the staff was wonderful and very helpful. We liked also breakfast very much. Hotel Mercer did our holiday perfect! Thank you so much!

Kind regards,
Johanna and Antti from Helsinki",5,2013,09,01
15,Updated review to recognise excellent customer service,"Due to a misunderstanding through a third party reservation, the Mercer Hotel, the General Manager and management team, has responded to our  cancellation issue, in a sensitive and understanding manner, which reflects their reputation for excellence, justly deserved. 
Thank you.",5,2013,08,30
15,"Excellent Hotel, Ideal Location","We selected Mercer Hotel after reading reviews on Trip Advisor and were not disappointed.  The hotel is a fabulous combination of a full service modern hotel with historic ambiance.  The location is fabulous, allowing exploration of the narrow, winding streets of the old city, Ramblas, the Cathedral and even more.  It's true that taxi's don't want to drive right up to the hotel, but the hotel is good at getting ones who will come to the front door.  The room was great - large, comfortable, incredibly quiet, with a terrific shower.  Complimentary water was very welcome after a long day of sightseeing.  The staff were excellent and very pleasant.  They were great at answering questions and really knew the city.  A few shared the history of many places in the city.  One night, we were even walked to a nearby restaurant by one of the staff.  That was excellent service.  The only small criticism is the hotel didn't have a lot of nearby restaurant recommendations.  After eating at an excellent restaurant very close to the hotel, the only other recommendation they gave was a restaurant that ended up being closed.  When asking for others nearby, they didn't have others to recommend.  It may have been because it is August.  After a long day of sightseeing we didn't want to get back in a taxi for dinner and it would have been nice to have more than one suggestion that was walking distance from the hotel.  All in all, we had an excellent stay at Mercer and would come back to the hotel on a future trip to Barcelona.",5,2013,08,29
15,Outstanding Boutique Hotel!,"If you are looking for a high end boutique hotel in the old city part of Barcelona, The Mercer should be on your list.  Large comfortable rooms, Incredible bathrooms!  Rooftop bar was a nice retreat from a busy day of touring and a nice place to launch and have a cocktail before going out for the evening.  Staff was incredibly helpful and nice to interact with.  This is always appreciated when you are visiting a new city and trying to maximize the experience.  I agree with other reviews that mentioned the part about getting there, you'll see what I mean when you arrive.  I view that as part of the charm of the location, which I think is excellent.  Have the hotel order a car for you to bring you direct to the door and avoid the chance a taxi won't take you up the narrow streets in the old city.  Great experience and I'll definitley come back to the Mercer when I retrun to Barcelona.  Thanks for a great stay!!!",5,2013,08,26
15,One of a kind experience in Barcelona.,"Fancy as it is, that whole scene takes place behind careful urban camouflage. The tourists and shoppers that crowd the sidewalks in Barcelona would have a hard time picking out the hotel; there's no sign, and the ancient building blends in fairly seamlessly with the Gothic Quarters neighborhood. But unlike celebrity-grade hotels, all of the very good-looking staff members, including the doormen and bellmen, offer prompt, unpretentious service. Each is trained as a concierge, so just about anyone working at the hotel can help with nearly any request. The one employee that stood out the most for us was Bogdan, he was very thoughtful and helpful to all of our needs.",5,2013,08,26
15,Old World Charm and Fabulous Service!,"This morning we (sadly) had to check out of the Mercer after an extremely pleasant two-night stay after our cruise. As the hotel is new and in Gothic Quarters (where the streets are a bit difficult to navigate/EXTREMELY narrow), our cab driver from the cruise ship port did not feel he could navigate his car safely through the streets, so he had to drop us off a block away. (Side note: some cab drivers will drive through the street if they feel comfortable - this morning the hotel directly called us a cab that picked us up right out front and took us straight to the airport!). Anyway - with absolutely no idea where we were after being dropped off, Bogdan the doorman could see us a block away and ran to us, carrying our luggage back to the hotel. It was an incredibly lovely gesture and truly reflective of the fabulous service you get at the Mercer. Everyone, from the front desk to the concierge to the general manager, goes above and beyond to help you and ensure a wonderful stay in Barcelona. The hotel combines historic (walls from the 2nd century? I believe) with the modern (minimalist art/furniture) - it was incredibly unique and special. Rooms were very large (even by U.S. standards) and the beds were awesome. (So soft and cushy, wish I could have taken it home with me). The complementary wi-fi and mini bar beverages were a nice touch. The pool area was also amazing - not large, but perfect given the size of the hotel. It had a lovely wooden sun deck as well as a plunge pool and bar (that served tapas as well as drinks). I would have lounged there for the entire day if I had more time in Barcelona! I would absolutely recommend this hotel for a number of reasons but the service was truly a special asset to the hotel. My only critique would be that while the breakfast looked very pleasant in the courtyard, starting at 18 euros for a continental breakfast seems a bit high even for Barcelona, but there are other less expensive options in the area.",5,2013,08,24
15,"Great service, location and lovely place","Our experience at the Mercer Hotel was wonderful. It is an excellent location, completely accessible (and safe), the staff were wonderful as well, helpful in recommending restaurants, attractions and attentive in serving food, drinks, arranging for beach bags, etc. Breakfast in the courtyard was delicious and peacful and Simon and another server (a woman whose name I can't remember) were both lovely. The terrace was a great place to hang out after a long day of sight seeing but before dinner, delicious tapas and quick dip in a small pool refreshed us to go out on the town for late Barcelona dinners. I would suggest NOT DRIVING HERE (or Barcelona in general) because the streets are so narrow it was difficult for our taxi to even get there. Our room, a junior suite facing the courtyard was beautiful. I can't say enough good things about this lovely boutique hotel that combines modernity with beautiful design and old architecture.",5,2013,08,20
15,"Great location, great staff, great hotel","We spent 3 nights at Mercer from day one the staff were brilliant. Our taxi driver stopped at the bottom of a small hill the Mercer staff appeared to carry our luggage up the hill to the hotel. The staff assisted in advise and how to mail all that excess luggage home after a cruise to avoid over weight charges from airlines. 
The hotel is in a wonderful location a short walk to main attractions. The fat tire bike tour leaves from the square just nearby and of course there is an Irish pub just at the back of the hotel, it's a good one as well.
Our room did not have a fridge Iam not sure if this is the case for all rooms but in mid summer a cold drink in the room is always nice, room service delivered a bucket of ice on request. 
We would stay here again.",4,2013,08,20
15,Excellent staff,I was impressed with this hotel.  The rooms were great.  The staff were very friendly and spoke good English.  It is hard to find with GPS but if you call the hotel they can help you get in.  If you are driving I would suggest getting someone to come help you get the car into the parking area. They sent someone right away to help us out. The hotel is close to the beach and and has good restaurants close by.  ,5,2013,08,18
15,Cosy hotel with helpful staff,"The room is quite modern and spacious (love the rain shower and big bath tub). Although the hotel is surrounded by relatively busy streets (5 minutes away from the beach and Cathedral only), you don't hear any noise at all, which is a big plus for me personally.

The pool (bar) is amazing. Staff is very friendly and helpful. I would recommend taking breakfast either very early or late, as they get stressed out when the place is full (and would forget half of your order).

Another important point to mention is that, if you want to see a flamenco show, do not let them book it with dinner/brunch, as the food is horrible (very touristy and low quality).",4,2013,08,16
15,"We went to see the hotel and have drinks here, cool and modern design and friendly service!","We did not stay in the hotel but went inside for a drink on their terrace and to take a look how this relatively new hotel is designed. Super cool interior! Very clean modern design, a lot of glass was used to give the feeling that you have free space sll around. The location is not too god, in born which is an upcoming cool and arty district but where at night many prople you wouldnt want to meet hang around. We had a few drinks which were very good and the service was good as well. The hitel is very clean and if it was in a different location we would definitely stay here the next time!",4,2013,08,15
15,Stylish courteous hospitality,"We stayed at the Mercer hotel for three nights and enjoyed one of our most memorable city breaks.  From the moment we arrived, Gloria and the guest services staff went out of their way to welcome us.  We stayed in a Junior Suite (room 108) which was lovely and had its own terrace.  Last time we visited Barcelona, we stayed in La Rambla but the location of the Mercer Hotel in the  Gothic quarter is so much nicer.  The area is much more interesting to wander around and there are loads of great places to eat if you don't want to rely on the hotel (although that is good too).  Bliss is a good breakfast option (a few steps to the right from the hotel).  Joan Manel in Guest Services couldn't have been more helpful in suggesting good places for dinner and in making bookings for us.  He also wanted to know what we thought of the food afterwards.  The hotel also have tickets for shows and museums, including the Picasso Museum, which saves a lot of time in queues.  Although the tickets give a time for admission, this is pretty flexible.  It is the attention to detail in this hotel, the friendly service and great location which make it well worth a trip and we plan to return soon.",5,2013,08,11
15,Fantastic place in the very heart of Barcelona,"Excellent and very special hotel with fantastic service and great location in beautiful Barcelona!
Good value for money for a five star hotel.
Great breakfast concept even though it means that staff is a little busy.
Complementary mini bar with water and soft drinks highly appreciated.
Fantastic roof-top terrace (but note that - for obvious reasons - the pool is quite small).
Would definately like to return to Mercer Hotel Barcelona in the near future!",5,2013,08,10
15,Best luxury boutique hotel in Barcelona,"Mrs Nite-Tripper & I spent five nights at the Mercer as part of our Honeymoon (we were upgraded to the suite on arrival) & fully enjoyed our stay. I can only reiterate the comments already made about the hotel - the fantastic design, spotlessly clean, ideal location, classy ambience, very polite, friendly & helpful staff (especially that chap with the beard!) We had breakfast once or twice at the hotel & found it a little expensive (so we went to Bliss or Bootleg next door for fresh croissants & coffee) We also visited the wine bar for tapas - which were cooked-to-order, absolutely delicious & unlike the breakfast, weren't expensive. Overall, I'd have no hesitation recommending Mercer to anyone looking for a first-class boutique hotel in a perfect city location.",5,2013,08,10
15,Best of the best!,"Over the years, we have traveled a lot and stayed in various luxury boutique hotels around the world, but none of them can be compared to the Mercer Hotel Barcelona. What a fantastic place to stay. A real gem! Everything said in the reviews is totally true. Whatever I write, it will be a repeat of what other reviewers wrote. Although our original booking was for a superior room, we were upgraded to a deluxe room, which it was the one we asked for, during our prior communication via emails. We stayed for 5 absolutely magical days. Perfect location, stunning architecture/ mixing old and modern (the room with the old Roman tower of the original city wall is a must see), amazing environment, fabulous and spotlessly clean room and bathroom, good sleep quiet nights, divine food and to top everything up, an utterly professional and kind staff! All of them were extremely attentive, polite and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for them. We didn't even want to leave the hotel's ambiance to go for sightseeing! We will most definitely return to the magical Barcelona and stay at the Mercer Hotel again and again. Thank you so very much Gloria, Sonia, Teresa, Isabelle and Juan Manuel!",5,2013,08,09
15,Spectacular Stay,"We chose to stay at the Mercer for our first trip to Barcelona based on its reviews in TripAdvisor. What a great hotel! This is a relatively new property (less than a year) in the old Gothic Quarter of the city. The area is a great place to stay—very narrow, charming streets, lots of sights, terrific local shopping, and good dining, and easy walks to many of the wonderful sights of Barcelona. The hotel itself is very special. Our room was quite large, modern, beautifully appointed, impeccably clean, and very quiet.  Our room faced the internal outdoor courtyard of the hotel, which was also where they served a terrific breakfast. The staff at the hotel was wonderful—endlessly helpful, gracious, and genuinely committed to making our stay as enjoyable as possible. Special mention goes to the dedicated concierges, Florencia and Sophia, who helped guide us to sights, arranged tours, recommended restaurants, helped us navigate the excellent transportation system of Barcelona, and assisted with anything else we wanted. They love their city and wanted us to love it as well. The hotel has a rooftop pool and bar that was a great place to relax and talk with other guests.

Barcelona is a magnificent city and we could not have chosen a better and better-located home base. It was a wonderful three-night stay and we look forward to our next visit.",5,2013,08,01
15,Great boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"We stayed for 10 nights at Mercer Hotel. Our overall impression: great hotel.

What we really liked: 

+ Staff. Very friendly and helpful. They managed to get us a dinner reservation at Tickets Bar, a restaurant which is usually sold out for months. 
+ Rooftop terrace. A cosy and relaxing place where you can spend hours, even though the pool is a bit too small. 
+ Interior design. Beautifully designed hotel that mixes the old roman building structure with modern steel, glass and fabric. 
+ Location. Located on a small street in El Barri Gotic, this is close to the Jaume 1 underground station and Born. The beach and shopping areas in Eixample are within walking distance or a short cab ride. 

Reading some confused reviews below, I'd like to sort out some things:

+ Taxis DO stop in front of the hotel as long as they get proper directions. 
+ This is not a big hotel chain like Marriott or Four Seasons but a small boutique hotel. Know the difference and what you like.
+ Spanish ham is cut from the whole pigs leg including hoof, stored in room temperature. It's considered a delicacy that can cost several hundred dollars per pound. 
+ El Barri Gotic is a very old part of the city, built by the romans (might explain why it's dark and old - it's not a mall).",5,2013,08,01
15,Amazing stay!!,"We have just returned from an amazing 3 night stay at the Mercer Hotel. We couldn't fault the hotel, from the amazing room, unbelievably comfortable bed and superb mojitos on the roof top terrace. A superb gem in the gothic region of Barcelona. I loved everything about it and would definitely return.....5 stars",5,2013,07,31
15,Expect a european boutique hotel,"We stayed 6 nites, based off TA reviews.  Be advised, this place is small.  It is a converted SMALL townhouse. The ""lobby"" is a small room, with a curtain to the Tapas bar.  There are 6 or so tables in the restaurant. The ""pool"" is 3 feet deep and about ten feet by 5 feet. The terrace that the pool is on has 8 sun chairs and a tiny bar. Its more like staying at a friends house. We didnt find the warm friendly helpful service.  Our first room, 306 was directly under the terrace, which is open til 11pm and then they LOUDLY clean it for another hour.  So, you will be woken up.  Yes, the shutters make it dark, but the noise cancels that out.  on website, gran deluxe has a balcony, our gran deluxe did not. It was a room. After my husband called front desk about noise at midnight, it did not stop.  He went up to see, and they told him they would be done soon, they didnt stop. They did upgrade us to an awesome suite for last 3 nights, but that does not change the experience others will have.  The bartender at the terrace disappeared for long periods of time. TOok forever to get service. Not sure what breakfast others had, but the ones we had were awful.  Undetectable, and it was eggs and bacon.  Not edible. Ate there 2 days, and then had to go find food. Soupy eggs (even fried ones) and grey bacon. The ham in the tapas place came off the whole hog leg that was on display there, all day long.  Hoof included.  Even the rolls were tasteless, and we tried!  Need electrical converters if you are US.  Asked front desk to send them up, had to ask again next day. Asked for a restaurant suggestion, they gave us a touristy pit. Went around and found our own.  Arranged car with hotel from Airport to hotel. He had no idea where the place was, we had to walk several blocks, luggage in tow.  For over $100 euros!  Leave crumbs when you leave the hotel, you will never find your way back.  And noone local knows where it is.  It is new, it is clean.  People seemed to WANT to do a good job.  But, the staff was very young and inexperienced.  This is a good place, it just does not warrant the perfect ratings.In order to keep the AC on, you have to leave a key in a slot.  Somedays we got turn down and water, and some we did not.  Dont go with over the top expectations, as we did, after being misled by reviews, its ok, not WONDERFUL.",3,2013,07,30
15,Excellent Staff,"If someone asks me if I would recommend Mercer Barcelona, I do know what to say. The staff is excellent. The location is very good, in the middle of Barrio Gótico. However, it is good to advise you that the majority of taxi drivers will drop you some meters of the hotel and you will have to walk something like 3 or 4 blocks. This did not bother me at all. What I did like of the hotel is that is a kind of place that I am always looking for: quite and calm. The hotel was full but I did not notice that. Before booking Mercer, I almost booked W Hotel. Thanks god I did not. I went one night to W Hotel to have drinks with friends who were guests there and W Hotel would be the last place I would like to be: crowded, noisy, parties in every where, big hotel that the staff have no idea if you are guest or not. So going back to Mercer, the hotel is the opposite of that. Also the bed is really good, one of the best. But for the price they charge (470 euros on weekends and 350 euros on work days), they have to improve many things. In my room it did not have mini-bar. They have a sort of swimming pool, and at 7 pm the Terraza is transformed in a bar, literally. They take out the long chaises and put tables and chairs,  that means that if you want stay longer at your chaise long, they will ask you to move to a chair and a table. In a nut shall: good staff, nice hotel, but pricey. Could be better. Next time in Barcelona I will try Mandarin Oriental. Let´s see.",4,2013,07,29
15,The big question...,"Based on the great reviews I had chosen this hotel as a surprise to pop the big question to my girlfriend! I wasn't disappointed.  3 nights at a great hotel.

On arrival we were met by a smart friendly concierge service, reception had drinks waiting for us and on route to the room we were given a personal tour of the hotel informing us of its rich history.  A great start. 

The room itself was smallish but pretty impressive, they had made good use of the space and made an old building look modern while keeping some character (wooden beam, archway feature).  We came back on our first day to find a bottle of sparking wine in the room with fresh cherries and chocolates. We accidentally left the 'do not disturb' sign on the door one day so the room didn't get cleaned, to our surprise we got a knock on the door at 8.30pm asking us if we still wanted it to be cleaned and they offered to wait until 9pm when we went for dinner.  Very polite and accommodating.

The roof top terrace/pool is clean, smart and the barman was attentive but still gave you plenty of room to feel relaxed.  One barman was particularly helpful and came to our rescue to retrieve the cork from our post engagement celebratory bottle of bubbly which had popped off in the wrong direction.

The hotel is in a great location, close to bars and restaurants, 5 mins from a subway, 10 mins from Las Ramblas.  

The concierge was helpful providing tips and recommendations.  The best tip was that you could buy tickets at an ATM for the Sagrada Familia, this meant avoiding the huge queues.

We would definitely recommend this hotel and this should set the bar for all other 5 star hotels!",5,2013,07,28
15,"Nice place, but let down by average service","Having read the glowing reviews we looked forward to our recent stay with high expectations. These were not met, primarily due to pretty average levels of service. The location is great - right in the middle of the old quarter and walking distance to the Cathedral and the marina district. Architecturally the hotel is interesting - a good mix of the old and the very new - in a highly atmospheric and characterful part of town. The rooms are large, but inclined to be a bit dark, and the aircon arrangement means it's freezing in the bathroom area and warm in the bed area. Make sure you like open bathrooms. 

However, the hotel struggled on the service front. Our early morning incoming flight was delayed so we called ahead to the hotel to ask them to call our privately arranged guide that we would be late. This wasn't done, mainly because the guy on the desk at 6.30am seemed to struggle with understanding what we wanted, so our guide turned up and we therefore had to pay for an un-used day. In addition, the house-keeping team seems to struggle with simple things like bottle-openers for the fridge, no laundry bags (without being asked 3 times), and the restaurant occasionally seemed short-handed. None of these were big issues by themselves but all added up to a degree of irritation we didn't expect, and didn't expect to pay for. Next time in Barcelona, we'd probably go and stay at the Mandarin Oriental, where you know that service standards are high.",3,2013,07,27
15,Solid stay,"We recently stayed at the Mercer hotel for a four night sojourn in Barcelona.  The location is the absolute best for exploring the gritty/cool Bario Gotic section of the city.  The hotel is tucked away on a quiet street with an unassuming entrance.  Although it is located in an ancient building is has been renovated beautifully to provide a gorgeous reception, bar, restaurant and outdoor breakfast area on the first floor, beautiful and well sized guest rooms on the upper floors and a petite but well proportioned pool, lounge and seating area on the roof.

Our room was a junior suite overlooking the courtyard.  It was nicely proportioned with a king bed dressed in crisp and cool percale sheets, a nice sitting area and large bath with a designer tub and shower.  The toiletries are provided by Molton Brown (my favorite) and are amply replaced each day.  Also there is sparkling and still water along with Coke and Diet Coke in the mini fridge which is complementary, a nice touch.

This property's best (and sometimes most perplexing) attribute is it's service.  We had a wonderful experience with the front desk and concierge personnel who went out of their way to provide help, advice, reservations, etc.  At the same time we had some frustrating experiences at breakfast and on the roof patio with servers.  Although well meaning I think this can be chalked up to the newness of the hotel and have great hopes that these small inconsistencies can be worked out soon.  

This hotel is a great value, in a great location and makes visiting Barcelona sexy and fun.  Don't miss it.

Note, do yourself a favor and have the hotel provide transfers.  The location is challenging for cars and if taking taxi you risk having to haul your bags a few blocks.",4,2013,07,24
15,"Charming hotel and location, location, location.","The location of this hotel is perfect. Right in the middle of Barri Gotic, near the cool El Born and more touristy Las Ramblas. Walking distance to Boqueria, Barceloneta, the Gothic Quarter sights and near the subway for easy connection to Eixample, Sagrada etc.
This boutique hotel is very charming, with beautiful stone work, wooden beams and sleek design. 
The concierge Florencia was excellent, extremely professional and helped us secure hard-to-get dinner reservations and made great recommendations.
Our only disappointment was with the room, ours had particularly low ceilings, ""half"" windows, ugly construction view below, and poorly connected. By poorly connected we mean that the minibar was stored in the closet, where there was no electrical outlet, so we had to put the fridge in the middle of the entryway so that the cord could reach the outlet to keep the drinks and jamon/manchego snacks we picked up at the market cool. But since the electricity is linked to the hotel key being inserted near the door, when we would leave the room and housekeeping came through, they would remove the key (probably to save electricity) and so we would come back and the drinks/food was warm, the room was hot, and again in an effort to save electricity: the window shutters and drapes shut tight. While we commend this effort, we found it a bit excessive for what is supposed to be a 5-star luxury hotel. Overall, an excellent option in Barcelona for charm, location and wonderful service...they just need to work on the rooms a bit and also add a fitness center which was also a miss.",4,2013,07,23
15,"Personal, private and new!","The hotel is in a great location in the gothic quarter and walking distance to the rambla and many other areas of interest. It is a boutique style hotel with beautifully decorated and laid out rooms. As with most European city hotels, the rooms are quite small and the views are only the inner courtyard or the cobbled walkway in front of the hotel. The small tapas bar served Iberian ham, after tasting it we totally agree with the bar man who said it was the best ham in the world. All the staff were friendly, helpful and professional. We would stay here again. It was expensive, but this is expected in peak season, in the heart of Barcelona.",4,2013,07,23
15,A gem in the Barrio Gotic,"We just returned from an outstanding trip to Barcelona (and Cadaques) due in no small part to our friends at Mercer Hotel. The hotel is totally beautiful and impeccable—true to the photos, it looked as if we were the first guests to stay there. Our room was gorgeous and soooo comfortable (I must email to ask them what makes those beds so DIVINE!?!). The public spaces were always cool, clean and comfortable. The rooftop deck is perfect for drinks and a quick dip (it's more a plunge pool than a real swimming pool). Tucked away on a tiny street, it was in a great location in the Barrio Gotic, just a short walk from El Born (another cool neighborhood for food and shopping) and Barceloneta (the beach). It's a true boutique hotel (with just about 2 dozen rooms) which allowed for a warm, intimate feel (not at all pretentious, which is the trap of many other hotels of its kind) with a diverse and elegant international crowd—families as well as couples, young and older. 

The best part was the staff, who knew us each by name (my husband, myself and our two kids, 5 and 8) and bent over backwards to be sure we were all comfortable. Service was warm and friendly, never overbearing or stuffy. No request was too big; they were always happy to help and to over-deliver when they could—whether that meant bringing the kids sweets as a treat, keeping the pool open a little later to let the kids take a dip on a hot day, chasing after us with baked goods ""in case the kids get hungry"" for a road trip, or shrugging off a broken curtain after a game of hide & seek gone awry.",5,2013,07,21
15,An amazing staff compliments this beautiful hotel,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at the Mercer Barcelona in the Gothic Quarter for 5 nights during our honeymoon and were simply blown away.  The location itself is stunning, as tucked away in the Gothic Quarter is this hip, stylish, yet warm blend of contemporary architecture  and ancient ruins.  (One wall of the property is actually a Roman wall from the second century)!  That said, for as beautiful as the property is it's true star is the staff, who are welcoming, friendly, and helpful, which isn't always the norm for a hip boutique hotel.  They speak excellent English and were beyond helpful and gracious to us at every turn.  Tony, Florencia, Jerzy...all of the 5 or 6 people we dealt with were absolutely phenomenal at all hours of the day.  We truly felt at home, and this is just a perfect location and way to vacation.  The property itself also has a cool rooftop bar and pool, and it is very quiet, which is a nice compliment to it's huge, comfortable beds!  We strongly recommend this hotel, and can't wait to return!",5,2013,07,19
15,GOOD HOTEL WITH SOME ISSUES,"The Mercer Hotel in Barcelona is rated as one of the best in the city, and I was very excited to get a reservation during high season. The location is great- just a few blocks behind the Cathedral in the Gothic area. It's walking distance to just about everything you want to see in Barcelona- La Rambla, the port, flower market, Picasso Museum and lots of wonderful restaurants. 

If you're arriving by taxi, the driver may tell you that the streets are too narrow for a car and drop you on a near-by street corner to fend for yourself. DO NOT BELIEVE IT! He just doesn't want to navigate the narrow, crooked streets.  

As for the hotel itself... The public areas are an interesting overlay of modern design on the original ancient structure. Our room was very modern, almost minimal but large and comfortable. 

The only issue I had was with the bathroom. It's visually appealing, but the design stresses form over function.The sink, tub and shower are separated from the sleeping area by a partial wall. Since there are no doors, the sounds and lights carry throughout the entire room, which may be disturbing to someone trying to sleep. There is a huge free-standing bath tub, which is very inviting but not practical. There is no soap dish, shelf or towel bar within reach. The toilet is closed off behind the door, but there is no bidet. 

The quirky bathroom design not withstanding, we did enjoy our stay at the Mercer.",4,2013,07,17
15,Heaven,"Just returned from Spain,
I must say the Mercer Hotel was the best part of the trip. From the moment you walk in attentive service and help provided at your door step. The concierge bends over backwards to arrange accomodations for your trip.
The breakfast environment is in the lovely glass open ceiling enclosed room where  you hear bird chirpings and is serene.
The location in the Gotic quarter is surrouded by so many shops and restaurants that you have so many options to find something to do.
The hotel is well situated  so when walking turning to your left is the water and to your right La Rambla.
The rooftop pool over looks the Basilica and is very peaceful.",5,2013,07,15
15,Amazing place to rest your head,"Our group of 2 couples stayed at the Mercer Hotel Barcelona recently.  It is in the old gothic part of Barcelona, which has cool bars and little restaurants.  The hotel was fantastic from the moment we got there.  The rooms are excellent, very quite for such a big city.  The décor was beautiful taking into consideration the old town walls.  One of the special things is the interior courtyard where we had breakfast each morning, a lovely oasis in the middle of a city. The pool and pool bar at the top was a great place to unwind after a day of sightseeing.
We will certainly be staying here for our next Barcelona visit.",5,2013,07,15
15,"Beautiful hotel, great staff, fabulous location","The Mercer hotel is situated in a great and convenient part of Barcelona - just a step out the door and you are in the fabulous cobblestone streets of the old quarter.

The building presents the best of both worlds, all modern amenities without losing the heritage.  The rooms are large and well equipped.  Pool deck is fabulous in summer.

Staff are welcoming, friendly and always happy to help, and remembering your name.

The only improvements I'd like to suggest (and they are minor) - complementary water is an expected given in a 5 star hotel.  The breakfast, which is served in an amazing courtyard was lovely but overly priced at $30Euro - should be included in the room rate.

Overall we had a great experience (stayed 5 nights) and will definitely be returning.",5,2013,07,13
15,Great boutique hotel,"We stayed at the Mercer for our first time in Barcelona based on the reviews on Trip Advisor and a recent listing in Conde Naste Traveler.  We were not disappointed.  This new hotel is quirky but in a good way - parts of the old Roman city wall built into the design of the hotel; a high ceiling made the room feel larger; and a small but nice roof top bar and pool allow you to relax and take a dip (not a ""swim,"" mind you, but a ""dip"") in the middle of the Gothic Quarter.  The location is great - centrally located and an easy walk from most all of the key sights.  The staff was as friendly and accommodating as they could be.  They really try hard to please.  We let them know we were there on an anniversary trip, and they had a bottle of cava waiting in the room for us when we arrived.  Would definitely stay there again.",5,2013,07,12
15,Amazing hotel,"The Mercer is an excellent hotel!! We had a great 5 day stay in the hotel. We had plans to go stay at the beach the W for part of our stay but we disliked the vibe of the W so much and LOVED the Mercer so much that we went back to the Mercer. 

Centrally located, this hotel is close to everything or a short cab ride away. The staff is lovely - as foodies, the staff made every effort to help us with reservations and guide us to excellent restaurants. The drinks at the hotel were expertly made and the food there was very good as well (when one of the waiters cut the serrano ham, he proceeded to explain where each slice was cut from and what was the best part - very impressive).

The roof deck was great. Just big enough for guests, with a nice refreshing pool, it was a great escape after touring all day. 

One of my all time favorite places!",5,2013,07,11
15,Excellent throughout,"I want to write this for the staff of Mercer who were thoroughly exceptional, from front desk to concierge, to bar and breakfast staff. They were all so hospitable, warm, friendly and made the return each day welcoming. The hotel itself is faultless. It's excellent interior design was its first attraction to us but was topped off by the way they treated you. I urge whoever reads this to say here. You wont be disappointed.",5,2013,07,08
15,Great Location,"My wife and I just returned from a trip to Barcelona. Found the Mercer on Tripadvisor. Great boutique hotel in the old city. Service at the hotel is awesome. They are willing to help you in anyway they can... Restaurants, museums, shopping etc. very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are very nice and roomy. ",5,2013,06,18
15,Simply Outstanding,"We spent two nights at this contemporary but quaint Barcelona hotel and loved every second of it. We had just two days to discover Barcelona and they ensured we got the right recommendations. The first afternoon, we took a walk through the Gothic quarter and Las Ramblas. The shopping and sightseeing was great. We also saw a Flamenco show as suggested by the hotel which was very nice. The rooms are large, spacious and contemporary in a heritage backdrop. Wonderful design in terms of all fixtures and fittings in the room. The breakfast in the inner courtyard is simply outstanding. The pool deck area is great to relax with the backdrop of roofs of Barcelona. The personnel are very friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for us. Loved every moment of our stay and will definitely recommend to all friends and family. The best location this hotel enjoys. A short stroll to the cathedral and other sights.",5,2013,06,18
15,Lovely end to a beautiful trip,"My husband and I went on a 12 day Mediterranean cruise that began and ended in Barcelona. We decided to stay an extra day there before flying home and stayed at the Mercer. The hotel was hard to find but once there we were very pleased. You can see the historic walls incorporated beautifully into the contemporary style if the hotel. The room we had was very large, bright and clean. The service was amazing. From the staff at the restaurant where we had breakfast to the front desk who went out of their way to help us find s good place to eat (it was Sunday and most of the really good restaurants in the area were closed). It was within walking distance to the beautiful Barcelona Cathedral and many other sites. I hope to stay again!",5,2013,06,13
15,Incredible experience,"We had an unforgettable stay at the Mercer. I hesitate to describe the treatment we received there, in case everyone expects it as standard... My wife and I were staying in Barcelona with friends, but I took the opportunity to surprise her by booking us into the hotel for the night of our wedding anniversary. In the event, the surprise was on both of us, as we were upgraded to the finest suite in the hotel - a gesture of incredible thoughtfulness and generosity. From that point on, everything about our stay was perfect, from the relaxed but fine dining lunch we enjoyed on the inner courtyard, to the surprise gift of quality Cava and home-made chocolates that were left in our room after an afternoon by the pool on the rooftop terrace. The hotel itself is tastefully designed and furnished; the staff were all incredibly warm, helpful, and attentive without being overbearing. The reception manager who looked after us made us feel very special in a VIP kind of way without any stuffiness or faux-grandeur. This hotel represents consummate professionalism and discrete class, as experienced by us in their personalised attention. My wife felt like a queen without the pomp; she noticed every detail, from the herbs in the vertical garden to the china used to serve breakfast. The Mercer made our anniversary memorable in every possible way.",5,2013,06,11
15,Oasis in central Barcelona,"Delightful new hotel in the Gothic Quarter, stunningly built into the ancient Roman wall in the city. Very friendly staff, all with excellent English. Great terrace on roof with bar. Easy access to port and central city on foot. Very safe area at night, with plenty of restaurants and bars. Our bedroom was slightly quirky in design, in that it was open plan, apart from the loo. Would prefer something bit more traditional, with a shower and sink enclosed in a large bathroom. Worth noting that not all rooms have baths.",4,2013,06,09
15,Great hotel all round,"I was enormously impressed with the Mercer.  The location is stunning being nestled in amongst the old narrow streets of the Barri Gotic and the quality of finish to the whole place is outstanding.  The hotel exudes quality but, unlike some other places I have stayed, it comes without the pretentiousness.  The staff were universally friendly and relaxed whilst also being on hand for anything you might need.  I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and I am not usually driven to write reviews but it was worth every penny.  Don't even get me started on the bed - the best nights sleep I've had in years!",5,2013,06,05
15,Fabulous Hotel with exceptional service.,"Stayed in the Mercer Hotel from Friday the 31st May to 2nd of June, and it was a little peace of heaven! Although it is in the middle of the City in the Gothic Quarter, you walk in and it's quiet and relaxing immediately. The staff cannot do enough for you and the terrace on the roof where the sun beds and pool are is great for relaxing after a hard day site seeing. The rooms are spacious, the beds very comfortable and shower good. 
The Hotel is in a perfect location, in easy walking distance of The Ramblas and the Beach/Harbour. The metro is very nearby so easy to hop on and go to the Cathedral and Gaudi Parc. 

I would thoroughly recommend this hotel, my only negative is that the person that ordered the toilet seats never sat on them! as they are really uncomfortable and cut into your legs (but this is a small price to pay to stay at this hotel, it just makes you quick!)",5,2013,06,05
15,Blissful Oasis,"We stayed over the weekend at this oasis of tranquility in the middle of the Barri Gotic.  The hotel is very conveniently situated near a Metro stop and in walking distance of several good restaurants.
Our room (202) was facing the narrow street, but there was no street noise at all noticeable.
With the shutters closed, a perfect nights sleep is guaranteed.  The bed is blissful and the bathroom is well equiped with a large walk-in shower.
Breakfast is served in a lovely outdoor patio, surrounded by small orange and laurel trees and lillies.

The staff made every effort to make our stay the best possible ever : 
We had hard to get reservations at Comerç24, which needed to be confirmed before we arrived in Barcelona : The concierge took care of it. Our flight was 1 hour delayed : The doorman was waiting for us OUTSIDE the hotel to show us the way in these narrow streets and the staff at the reception desk called the restaurant not to cancel our reservation.
The friendly staff serving the breakfast in the morning was extremely helpful and ready to fulfill every wish.

We have stayed in several luxury (boutique) hotels in major cities all over the world.  But this weekend the MERCER BARCELONA skyrocketed to the top of our list of favorite hotels (N°1).
Next time in Barcelona we will be staying here again.

We would like to thank all staff for their excellent customer service and for making our weekend a complete succes.

Only one negative point : Our stay was way too short",5,2013,06,04
15,Superb!,"Lovely room (we were upgraded when they front desk noted it was my birthday on may passport).   Perfect location, very helpful concierge in getting us a tough dinner reservation.   Great rooftop deck for afternoon relaxing and a cocktail.  Would stay here again and recommend to friends.",5,2013,06,03
15,Amazing boutique hotel in Gothic quarter of Barcelona,"Our experience at the hotel was amazing!!  The hotel is gorgeous, designed by architect Rafael Moneo- perfect combination of old and new.  Rooms are simple and elegant, quiet and peaceful.  Charming to stay in the Gothic quarter- short walk to everything, including the beach.  Breakfast was delicious sitting in their beautiful courtyard with the smell of lilies.  Gorgeous rooftop which we unfortunately did not use enough.  Staff took great care of us and could not have been nicer pointing us to all the right places.  We would come back again!!",5,2013,06,03
15,Beautiful Hotel but some rooms are dark...,"We stayed at the Mercer Hotel for 3 nights in May.
The building is beautiful and very elgant, combining luxury, modern style and antique charm.
The staff was pleasant and very helpful. 

The manager was also nice and very efficient when we asked to change room because it was really too dark although it was 4 pm and sunny (Double de Luxe, 1st floor + no minibar, no bottle of water... we can expect this kind of attention when we stay in such a hotel). We were first very disapointed. The manager finally found us an other room which was very nice, larger and less dark (1st floor overlooking the courtyard, with minibar and bottle of water). 

The breakfast was amazing. 

In the end, we had a great stay.",4,2013,05,31
15,Just GREAT!!!!!!,"We stayed for 3 nights in the Mercer Hotel in Barcelona and it was really just great!
From the moment we stepped into the hotel first time until our check out - everything was just wonderful!
Every one of the people was always and 100 % anxious to help us and to feel our wishes......
and always with a smile :-)
The unique and wonderful rooms - so clean, I never saw it in a hotel - earns a special point!
The breakfast was delicious and a wonderful variety!
All I can say is:
I hope and would love to come back in this beautiful hotel in Barcelona!!!!
We recommend  this hotel with all our conviction!",5,2013,05,30
15,Best Boutique Hotel in Barcelona,"Our experience with this Hotel was so amazing.  We always stay at 5 Star Hotels and I have to say this was one of the most stunning boutique hotels we have stayed at.  The hotel itself is clean and historically interesting with tastefully modern touches.  The rooms are spacious and very clean.  The food was amazing.  Get the breakfast and make sure you order the beans and sausage......so good!!!!  The location was perfect.  The staff was so pleasant, helpful and made our experience unforgetable.  Thank you to Mecer Hotel and Staff; we will be back.",5,2013,05,29
15,Lovely experience,"We stayed at the Mercer Hotel for 6 days in May.  It definitely was the highlight of our trip to Barcelona!  The week we were there was the European ""spring break"" and the city was extremely crowded with tourists.  The Mercer was a quiet, beautiful refuge.  

All the reviews here are accurate.  The hotel is absolutely lovely….but the real difference between this and other hotels you may choose is the staff.  They went out of their way to do extra things for us.  Here are just a few examples:

-  I had seen a room on their website with a four-poster bed and emailed the hotel requesting it for our stay.  I got a prompt email confirmation that the room was available for us.  Sure enough, when we arrived we were given the exact room I requested.  

-   I emailed before our arrival and asked if they could call a particular store for me and inquire about a pair of boots that I couldn't find in the United States.  Again, I was sent a very prompt email assuring me that the boots were being held for me at the store, in my size!

-   I bought some chocolate bars at an outdoor market in Barcelona and then couldn't find them again.  The front desk called the chocolate company for me to see when and where they would sell the chocolate again in town. 

-  On our last day, I misplaced my reading glasses.   They not only helped me look for them (to no avail), but after we departed for the airport I received an email letting me know that the cleaning staff found the glasses and they would be mailing them to me!

These are just a few examples of the extra effort put forth by the wonderful staff at the Mercer.  
Thank you especially to Roger, who was a true delight.  Also, the sweet man who ran around with me looking for my glasses.  I'm sorry, I don't remember his name.  

The Mercer is a beautiful gem.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Barcelona.  You shouldn't either!!",5,2013,05,28
15,Best Service I Have Ever Experienced,"A stunning boutique hotel in the amazing Barrio Gotic. A beautifully renovated property that includes some of the original walls of the city - there is something magical about staying in a modern hotel that has been lovingly renovated to include and honour elements of the city's history.

Rooms were immaculate and well appointed, and the location is very quiet considering how central it is. 

But what really sets the Mercer apart is the tremendous service that the staff provides. And the service seems sincere as well. You really feel like you are at a home away from home and not in a hotel. From Juan Emmanuel's warm welcome to Bogdan's history lesson about the hotel and the neighborhood, to Isidro's great suggestions for places to visit when travelling in Andalucia to the staffs perfect recommendations for restaurants and their honest opinions about what to see in Barcelona, everyone at the hotel works their hardest to ensure that your stay is a comfortable and memorable one. I feel guilty just singling out these three staff members, because EVERYONE at the Mercer was friendly, helpful and sincerely dedicated to their guests.

One incident illustrates the Mercer's dedication to its guests. On a Sunday night - when much is closed - Isidro at the front desk arranged a reservation at a nearby restaurant. But as it would be hard to find, he walked us from the hotel to the restaurant and made sure that our table was waiting. And he absolutely refused a tip.

In short, the Mercer is worth every penny. Highest recommendation possible.",5,2013,05,28
15,Amazing hotel with equally amazing service!,"If you are traveling to Barcelona I highly recommend the Mercer Hotel. We found this property on Jetsetter.com and immediately booked five nights in the property. If you love the idea of staying in an ancient Roman ruin that has been tastefully updated with modern design you will love this property.

In my opinion a property is equally defined from service and attention to detail.  This property excelled on both accounts, I felt like I was staying with old wealthy friends who never tired of my requests.  

Next time I am in Barcelona I will absolutely be staying at this property, thanks for a job well done!  
",5,2013,05,26
15,excellent!!!,"I just got back from Barcelona with three friends and stayed at the Mercer Hotel.We have been traveling together for around 20 years staying at some really nice hotels along the way. If you like boutique hotels, this is the best one we have stayed in BY FAR.What made it great was it's location(in the middle of the old town) but especially it's staff. Juan Manel and the entire staff were incredible.They make you feel like you are the only guest in the hotel and can't do enough for you.(I lost my iphone in the back of a taxi and one of the staff insisted that he meet the driver(at 1am) to retrieve it and suggested I wait safely back in the hotel.They are extremely knowledgeable,friendly and gracious. This really is a 5 star hotel. It's the real deal.",5,2013,05,21
15,Our favorite hotel,"Great service, great room, great location. We look forward to returning. We arrived on weekend and the staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. The cab driver had a hard tie finding the place and when you find it you'll know why. The location is fantastic. You can walk the old city and the subway is 2 blocks away.",5,2013,05,17
15,Stunning hotel!,"We have just returned from a weeks stay in Barcelona and as we couldn't decide which hotel to stay in, we chose two! We stayed at the Mercer for four nights and it was amazing!! I simply cannot speak highly enough of the hotel and its amazing staff!

The main reason for our visit was for the grand prix so we had booked our room at the Mercer in November. Upon room selection we ensured we booked a deluxe room that came with a bathtub. When we checked into our room we discovered that there wasn't a bath, and as we had booked so far in advance the staff went out of their way to come up with a solution for us. This is just one example of the fantastic service we received. The staff are probabaly some of the best I have ever come across in a hotel, they were polite and helpful and went out of their way to ensure our stay was perfect.

The hotel itself is absolutely stunning, the mixture of old and new is amazing. I love the exposed brickwork all through the hotel mixed with modern glass walls and furniture. The hotel looks just like the pictures!!

Our room was perfect. We had a suite with a very large living room area, a large bedroom and a very big bathroom complete with walk in shower and large bathtub!

The location is great, the Gothic district is a lovely place but as we stayed over the grand prix weekend we didn't get much chance to explore the area but what we did see was lovely! 

The hotel also has a terrace on the top floor with a swimming pool which we used on the last day to relax and top up our tans! This is a lovely touch, particularly in a city.

One thing to be aware off is a lot of taxis wont take you to the hotel entrance as its down an extremely narrow road so just be aware of the location in case you do get dropped off slightly away!

Overall our stay was perfect and I would definitely stay in the Mercer again if I ever return to Barcelona.",5,2013,05,15
15,Phenomenal Hotel,"This hotel is perfect in every way.   Fantastic location, super helpful staff, wonderful rooms.   One of the best boutique hotels we have stayed in.    From the moment we saw it from the street - knew this hotel was going to be magical.   And it was.   Already planning our return trip",5,2013,05,14
15,"Fantastic Stay, Perfect Location, Excellent Service","Excellent stay in every way.  Location is fantastic right in the heart of the Gothic district. The area is filled with character and walking distance to everything we wanted to see. The staff were consistently enthusiast and friendly.  Not only did they provide great service, but this hotel is staffed with fantastic people.  As a business owner, I know how difficult it can be to find top notch people, but the quality of the people working a this hotel really impressed me. First class staff.
From check-in to check-out we had a thoroughly satisfying experience.  The hotel is beautiful and so unique - the pictures on the website and tripadvisor accurately reflect the unique beauty and character of this hotel.  What a gem. 
The restaurant and bar were superb. The multi-course meal with wine pairings that we had in their restaurant was one of the top dining experiences we've had. Breakfast each morning was excellent. 
Room was clean, modern, and comfortable. I will definitely stay there again any time I'm in Barcelona.",5,2013,05,13
15,Simply the best,"We have been lucky enough to stay in some of the best hotels around the world and this hotel, for us,was just perfect. We booked with the day before and took the one remaining room which was superb with its own garden terrace. Even the pouring rain did not spoil it. Loved the way the old city walls and even a tower complete with frescoes were encompassed within superb contemporary surroundings. The tapas bar was first class and breakfast a delicious leisurely treat. Will have to return for longer. 
If coming by taxi it is probably worth getting the hotel to arrange it since we were dropped a street away and had to pull our cases uphill  
The service was impeccable.  Great location. VERY STYLISH.",5,2013,05,12
15,A Perfect Hotel,"I recently spent 5 nights in this perfect boutique hotel in the old quarter of Barcelona. I cannot fault anything about my stay. The hotel is new, fantastically designed with beautiful rooms and a small roof terrace with pool. The bed was very comfortable, the room quiet. The staff always smile and cannot do enough to help. I don't hesitate to recommend the hotel.",5,2013,05,09
15,Perfect in every way!,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and experienced fantastic service throughout this excellent hotel. The rooms are lovely with, as previous reviews state, the most comfortable beds! 
Even though the hotel is in the heart of the Gothic quarter it's very quiet so after a long day seeing the beautiful sites of Barcelona it's the perfect haven. We have stayed at many top end hotels however the service really is second to none with friendly knowledgable staff. 
There are so many bars and restaurants to visit with the beach just around the corner we believe this was the only place to stay. 
The roof terrace is just another example of this hotel having everything. 
We had dinner at the restaurant and it was delicious I would highly recommend eating here you will not be disappointed. 
One issue which is not down to the hotel but something you need to be aware of is arriving my taxi - they don't know where it is and we got dumped in the middle of town and told to find our own way! Thankfully we had read this could be a problem so we took a map and found the hotel ourselves. Please have this kind if back up plan. 
I only have one concern ... If we want to come back to Barcelona will this hotel have any rooms available to book!
Thank you to everyone at Mercer Hotel Barcelona",5,2013,05,07
15,Beautiful boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona's Barri Gotic,"My husband and I spent three nights at the impeccable Mercer hotel at the beginning of May 2013.  Everything from the very beginning of our stay to the moment we left for the airport was perfect and thoughtful.  The staff is very welcoming and made you feel at home in this stylish, yet approachable hotel.  All our requests were promptly attended to and each and every staff member we encountered held true to the high level of service.  Our room (105) was spacious and tranquil and the small balcony looking over the interior courtyard was an added bonus.  We enjoyed dinner at the hotel's restaurant, Mercerino, and it was also wonderful from start to finish.  Elegantly presented food that was also delicious.  We thank the Mercer for being part of our wonderful visit to Barcelona!",5,2013,05,06
15,Great Stay in Barcelona,"My recent stay at the Hotel Mercer was restful and wonderful.  It's a well designed and well run boutique hotel, quite new, in the Bari Gotic.  Our room was a junior suite and the layout was rather like a loft apartment and cleverly designed.  The decor is modern and the room was spacious and had a nice balcony, huge bathtub and huge shower.  We stayed four nights and could have stayed longer, it was so comfortable and relaxing.  The location was perfect for most of what we did; we cabbed up to the Segrada Familia and other attractions in the Moderne part of town but could walk everywhere else, including to the beach.  You won't go wrong at the Mercer.",5,2013,04,30
15,Delightful boutique hotel,"My partner and I have just returned from a very pleasant week at the Hotel Mercer.  What is amazing is the combination of very old historical buildings with new up to date design and furnishings. The bedroom we had was lovely and the beds were extremely comfortable.
As previous reviews stress, what makes this hotel special are the staff.  I really enjoy going to a good gym and although the hotel does not have a fitness centre, the staff really put themselves out to find us a very good gym nearby at a reasonable rate.
Breakfast is a feast and so relaxing sitting in a beautifully designed breakfast room and being looked after by delightful staff.
If you can treat yourself, staying at the Mercer Hotel is a must.

15,"Everything You Want in a Boutique Hotel, and more","Mercer Hotel Barcelona is the essence of everythng you want in a boutique hotel. A 33 room gem, tucked away on a narrow side street in the GothicQuarter. Great location, 5 minute walk one way to Barcelona Catherdral, 5 minutes the other way to the beach. It is very hard to find, so be sure that you have either very specific directions or a map for your driver.

The hotel is new, having just opened in September, 2012. Open , soaring spaces, with wonderful use of warm, honey-coloured local sandstone. Decor crisp and minimal. Very comfortable rooms, high ceilings, hardwood floors, great beds. Bathroom is not enclosed ( except for WC ), simply tucked behind the headboard on the bed. That means that the light and the noise is part of the space. An elegant, egg shaped bathtub stands on its own beside the shower stall ( rain shower, lots of hot water, good water pressure ).

Staff are wonderful, frienldy, helpful, knowledgeable and proud of the property. Command of English ranges from sort of adequate to excellent. Senior staff, i.e front of house and maitre d'  areexperienced and helful.

Hotel has a small bar / tapas grill off the lobby, a very pleasant open air enclosed dining courtyard, and a small formal dining room with an adjacent bar.

There is a rooftop deck with comfortable outdoor furniture, a small plunge pool and a bar.

The brochure on the hotel website has very good photos of the property, and unlike the usual photo-shopped stuff, the real thing looks just as good as the photos.

We had two excellent dinners in the main dining room. Be aware that breakfast is absurdly expensive, a continental breakfast is 23 Euros ! That is actually more than most of the entrees on the dinner menu. Curiously enough, off the ala carte breakfast menu, you can get eggs, bacon and toast for 10 Euros.

Rooms are in 3 differentcategories, over 3 floors. All things equal, best bet is rooms on the top floor, so you don;t have to listen to the click of high heels on the hardwood floor above.

In summary, we loved the Mercer, and only wish there were more of them.",5,2013,04,26
15,Amazing!,"This is probably the best stay we ever had in any hotel world wide! The staff is brilliant, professional, helpful and totaly devoted to fullfill your needs at any time. The location is great, the rooms are tastefully decorated, and the beds are wonderful. All in all, the smallest details, like little treats on your bed, makes this  complete happening. So thank you all at Mercer Barcelona, for making our visit a dream come true! Best regards from Mr & Mrs Skaare",5,2013,04,25
15,Fantastic weekend at the Mercer!,"Fantastic stay for my husband's 40th Birthday. The hotel is in a superb location in amongst the winding alleys at the heart of the Gothic Quarter - very handy for numerous tapas bars, shops and local sights. The interior is beautiful and we had a lovely room overlooking the atrium. We were welcomed with chocolates and bottle of champagne on arrival. 

Whilst we did not have dinner there, the breakfast was extremely enjoyable and there is a lovely bar (with amazing gin and tonics!) for pre-dinner drinks.There is also cute roof terrace and plunge pool.
 
It is the staff however who make the Mercer such a great hotel. I made numerous requests from the concierge desk both before and during our stay and they could not have been more helpful. One of the waitresses made an impromptu birthday cake for my husband (at breakfast!). The porter brought extra lamps to our room when we said we thought it was a little dark and he even brought a DVD player from his home when we found out the hotel didn't have one! The concierge made all of our dinner reservations which were great.Every member of staff we came into contact were friendly, polite and clearly very keen for us to have a wonderful time. 
 
The Mercer really is a high class boutique hotel and I would encourage anyone going to Barcelona to stay there.",5,2013,04,24
15,perfect hotel,"from the minute we walked in to our hotel, I knew that we had chosen the perfect spot..From  the charming location on the narrow winding streets of the gothic quarter to the beautifully designed rooms and incredible warm and friendly staff, I would say it was a mirror reflection of the charming city of Barcelona itself.  Old world meets contemporary style in a perfect way. This is my third time to Barcelona and Hotel Mercer made it by far my most enjoyable.",5,2013,04,22
15,Modern luxury in a perfect hotel,"I stayed at the Mercer Barcelona for 4 nights and it could not have been a more wonderful experience. It was my first time in Barcelona, but sometimes I found myself wanting to enjoy the hotel more than go sightseeing. 
It is situated in the heart of the Gothic quarter, a maze of beautiful and narrow streets. You get the feeling of history and old Barcelona while staying in one of the most luxuriously appointed hotels you could probably find. This place is a real gem. The staff is friendly and helpful, the lobby and common areas are stylish, modern, spotlessly clean, and smell amazing. My room (103) was huge with one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. One afternoon, I decided to relax on the beautiful roof terrace with a book. I was even presented at check-in with a certificate for a free drink and three free tapas at their tapas restaurant. 
I absolutely loved this hotel and would stay here again in a heartbeat. You are in for a real treat.",5,2013,04,20
15,A hidden gem,"This was my third trip to Barcelona and I knew the location which I wanted to be in - somewhere in the gothic area that was close to the beach and Las Ramblas. I arrived at the most beautiful Hotel Mercer - it's stunning and the pictures on the website are true to life!.  I had been upgraded to a junior suite on arrival. The room was large with a balcony and very comfortable and stylish. The staff are incredibly helpful and friendly and the entire setting of the hotel is truly wonderful. At the end of the day the rooftop pool and lounge area is a relaxing way to spend a couple of hours. Sadly we didn't take the opportunity to eat in the hotel as we wanted to experience more traditional and local cafes, bars and restaurants. It's only a five minute walk to the marina and the beach and the same again to Las Ramblas and the El Borne district so the location of this hotel is perfect. When I go back to Barcelona I will definitely stay here again. There is no better location and I can't think of anything more I'd like from a hotel. PS. The taxi did not take me the last 50 yards as the road is so narrow but that's not a problem with hand luggage. The hotel organised my return taxi and it came to the front door - so it can be done, particularly if you have large heavy suitcases.",5,2013,04,20
15,Wonderful stay,"We live in barcelona and sometimes take a city break with my husband just to relax and enjoy ourselves (we have 4kids).We stayed just one night and we loved it very much!Hotel is very nicely renovated in the part of the old city.Interesting that you are like integrated in the very old part,yet modern.Excellent breakfast,very quite so you dnt hear any noises from outside. I would never stay on las Ramblas, for example. And here, you are in the center but enjoy privacy. Special thank you to the personal of the hotel, each one of them actually love being part of the hotel, the old history and working there.We had a nice little introduction with Jordi when we arrived and another interesting details were added by Joan manuel when we were checking out, Teresa at the reception was very nice and helpful. We will be back for dinner and to spend few nights again.Highly recommend.",5,2013,04,19
15,Just wonderful,"Just back from 4 nights at this recently-opened (Sept 2012) hotel in the Barri Gotic of Barcelona.
Location: 5 minutes' walk from the Cathedral, in the heart of the biggest and best-preserved conglomeration of mediaeval buildings anywhere;
Building: A magnificent adaptation of a site dating back to Roman times - one room is in an old Roman tower of the original city wall, room 202, above that, has a 700 year-old ceiling.  The renovation has been carried out with sympathy and style - there is evidence of the highest quality of materials, craftsmanship and design everywhere you look, with generously appointed public areas and a terrific roof terrace;
Room: Quiet, with luxuriously comfortable beds, beautiful modern furniture and bathroom fittings, high-end toiletries and wonderful fluffy and linen towels;
Service: Exceptionally friendly and helpful throughout - nothing is too much trouble for the English-speaking staff;
Food:  We only ate tapas in the hotel but these were imaginative reworkings of old favourites, and extremely good - the main menu looked excellent.  Good, reasonably-priced wine list.
I have put all of the above as succinctly as I can, because if I started to rave about this hotel, I'd probably never stop!  We loved this place, and would recommend it without hesitation - one day soon we hope to return...",5,2013,04,14
15,Excellent!,"We spent 3 nights last here last week and from arriving in Reception to getting into the taxi on leaving, all the staff were really friendly and helpful. The Hotel is in a marvellous location for exploring the area. We ate in the restaurant twice and the service and food were first class as were the breakfasts. If I had to make a teeny criticism I expected the toiletries to be replaced once over half used and we had only 1 bar of soap for bath, shower and sink which was never where needed!",5,2013,04,14
15,Great hotel with great staff in a great location,Spent three nights in this hotel with my wife and our two teenagers. Very well located in the old part of the city. Very quiet location. Staff is outstanding: helpful and kind. I encourage you to have your breakfast at the hotel as this is good value and staff extremely nice. Will most definitely return.,4,2013,04,13
15,"stunning, unique, and best service ever!","For us, there are not enough superlatives to describe the Mercer Hotel.
To begin with, the location sets it apart from most of the other popular 5 star hotels in Barcelona. If you stay in one of the large popular hotels on one of the main boulevards, it’s not much different than being in any bustling city anywhere. The Mercer, however, is located in the Gothic Quarter, and being in that area gives you a whole different experience of Barcelona. Although you can visit the Gothic Quarter if you stay somewhere else, it’s quite a different experience staying there. It’s a picturesque area of narrow, winding streets, with a new adventure around every corner – great restaurants, coffee shops, tapas bars, and mini-plazas.  
The Gothic Quarter is part of a walled city, with several towers having been built along the wall. The Mercer has been constructed along one of the walls and incorporates one of the towers. The décor, however, is what we would call “contemporary elegant”, so it’s a unique combination of melding great contemporary design into a structure that was initially built by the Romans, and they’ve executed it superbly. While the design is contemporary, it’s not “minimalist” like many other contemporary hotels. There is a richness and elegance in the hotel rooms as well as the public areas. We’ve stayed in some of the best hotels worldwide, but the Mercer has a “wow” factor that is unique, exciting, and lovely. The interior design is truly a marvel.
The rooms are quite large, and the layout is perfect. We spoke with the general manager, and he mentioned that he regularly stays in one of the hotel rooms to make sure that everything is perfect, and it is. They have not missed a thing. 
The staff is beyond fabulous. The Mercer is part of a small chain, and they treat every client like they’re the most important ones in the hotel. We wanted to get tickets to see the Sagrada Familia, and instead of trying to explain the rather convoluted route to where the tickets were sold, one of the people at reception walked us there. We cannot rave enough about the level of service at this hotel.
Staying at the Mercer is a real treat.  It enhanced our trip to Barcelona in so many ways.  We’re going back to Europe next year, and we were not planning to return to Barcelona, but we wouldn’t miss having another stay at the Mercer and spending time in the Gothic area, so we’ll be there again in 2014.",5,2013,04,10
15,Luxury in a hip location!,"My husband and I just finished a 4 night stay at the Mercer and wouldn't think of staying anywhere else upon our return. 

Room: I'm a hotel snob and this is the cleanest hotel room I've stayed in to date. The beds are to die for, perfect sized room with a queen bed and the details are perfect.

Location: perfect central location 10 min walk to La Boqueria, 15 min to l'eixample and less than 5 to El Born. Super close to beach and the neighborhood is unlike any other.

Staff: The staff could not have been more helpful. Everyone was super friendly and down to earth.

Overall, this is a top notch hotel and HIGHLY recommended.",5,2013,04,09
15,The perfect place to retreat to after a busy day sight-seeing,"We visited Hotel Mercer with two older teenage children for a city break over the Easter period.
Hotel Barcelona is set in the Gothic Quarter, very easy walking distance to shops, lots of restaurants and the sights. 20 minutes from the airport (approx. €35 in a taxi).

It was more expensive than we would usually chose for a short break but we felt the quality of the hotel and staff was a fair reflection of this.

The rooms have shutters which keep them nice and dark in the morning and the beds are genuinely the most comfortable beds and pillows we've ever slept in! 

The A la Carte restaurant looked very pleasant, but was a little too formal for our taste. We therefore opted for the more casual tapas restaurant one evening where the waiter was very helpful in choosing dishes.

We also enjoyed the cocktail bar and the rooftop terrace. Both very pleasant with attentive staff.
We chose to go out for breakfast every morning as there was so much choice nearby for a fraction of the cost and with more ambience in the city.

Departure is a very reasonable 12md and we were offered a later checkout without requesting one. 
We also left our bags at the hotel until the evening whilst we explored and returned to find them waiting, along with a taxi that had been organised for our trip to the airport. 
I left a ring in the bathroom as we left and the Hotel managed to contact the taxi driver en-route to let us know!

All in all, the hotel has been beautifully designed. Very well thought out and no corners cut. 
Designer, but with a really warm, welcoming feel.
We would love to return.",5,2013,04,04
15,Excellent hotel and fantastic service,"My husband and I stayed at Mercer Hotel for our Easter break 2013, and we really enjoyed it! This hotel has everything going for it: great location, great interiors, all the mod cons and creature comforts, a courtyard in the middle with orange trees, a bar and restaurant, a library, a wonderful roof terrace with a pool, attentive staff - you name it, it is there. Everything was spotlessly clean, the shower is very good, there is free wi-fi, and the best thing was the bed - so comfortable that I could sleep there all day! By the way, we stayed in Room 306. 

We were lucky to have found it, after long and tedious internet research. Tucked away in an incredibly narrow and picturesque mediaeval street, it is an oasis of modernity and tranquillity in a crazy touristy labyrinth of streets in the Gothic quarter. You do not really expect to see something so modern and comfortable in a building that must have been there for hundreds of years! In fact, after a few close looks, we decided that one of the walls of the courtyard must be Roman (just like lots of other walls in that area!). 

The people working there were incredibly attentive and kind - they went out of their way to give us directions, show us around and make their guests feel comfortable. They even warned us about the clocks going forward and put a note with the weather forecast for the next day through the door. 

I should also say that in spite of very narrow streets, it is possible to get straight to the door by taxi but not all taxi drivers are aware of that... 

In short, we travel a lot and have seen a lot of hotels in different counties, and I should say, this one is one of the best! We would highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates quality service, peace and quiet, and attention to detail. We ourselves are planning to come back!

We would also like to thank the hotel staff for a very pleasant stay!",5,2013,04,01
15,Hidden gem of Barcelona,"This hotel is one of the most beautiful hotels i've stayed in! Modern architecture is combined with the old parts of Barcelona. The effect is gorgeous! We stayed in a superior room which was also very beautiful, large and very clean. The staff of the hotel is very friendly and helpfull. The hotel is perfectly located in one of the narrow streets of the Gotic quarter with its many restaurants, bars and boutique shops. The breakfast of the hotel is very good, but if you don't want to spend too much money on breakfast, there are many little places nearby where you can can get a coffee with a croissant. And after a day walking around Barcelona, there's a massage studio next to the hotel where you can get a perfect footmassage!

Anyway, two words: hidden gem!",5,2013,03,25
15,Loved It!,"We had one night in Barcelona and stayed at the Mercer. The hotel is great. It is brand new and the entire place is beautifully finished. It is built right into the old city walls and there is an excellent blend of artifacts and modern style. The rooms are simple but well appointed and because it is so new, everything is perfect. 

More importantly, the staff all seem proud to be affiliated with this hotel and give 110% to your comfort. They also love giving tours of the hotel both to showcase the amazing archeological feature as well as the amenities. The service is great as well.  When we were running late from some last minute shopping, the staff was aware that we had a flight leaving at a certain time and made sure a cab ready for us with bags loaded when we got back. i was really amazed, because we had only mentioned to them that we were leaving for a few minutes and would need a cab when we returned.  just great personal attention.

Finally, the location is great - on a small and quiet road that is 3 minutes from the cathedral and close to shops, plazas and restaurants.  Just perfect.

Beware, however, that the hotel is on a road that cab drivers seem to believe is a pedestrian walkway. As a result, we were dropped off a few blocks from the hotel.  That is totally wrong as cabs can and do easily come right up to the hotel door.",5,2013,03,24
15,fantastic friendly Staff,"We stayed in the Mercer for a two night break and cannot recommend it enough.  The hotel itself is wonderful with a great location in the heart of the Barri Gotic quarter, literally beside the cathedral.  But the most attractive feature of the hotel is the outstanding staff.  They were all without exception friendly, interested,  but at all times professional. They could not do enough for us and seemed to accommodate any request.   I do not recall ever staying in a hotel and feeling quite so welcomed and immediately at ease and relaxed.  A special mention to Juan Manuel who has a wonderful sense of humour.",5,2013,03,21
15,Lovely Hotel,"We have just returned from a 4 day break in Mercer Hotel. A wonderful experience in this new hotel in the Gothic Quarter. Everything we could have hoped for, good staff. stylist decor, wonderful bed, lovely breakfast. Thank you",5,2013,03,20
15,Fantastic Fantastic Fantastic!,"Initially we had some issues with our booking as we had to reschedule due to a bereavement, however, Gloria from the hotel emailed us and was extremely helpful by making sure this was possible.  We were very grateful for her assistance and it was lovely to meet her when she introduced herself to us on our first full day on this trip to Barcelona.

We were very impressed by the hotel itself, the building is lovely, and has been brilliantly renovated incorporating modern features into the old foundations.  

Our room was very large with a balcony that you could sit out on, Loewe toiletries in the bathroom, and an awesome shower. There is also a turn down service where a card with what the weather will be like the next day is left in your room, with a couple of chocolates - such a thoughtful touch.

Also, the bed is the most comfortable that I have ever slept on; that, including how nice and quiet the location is, made for an excellent night's sleep.

The roof terrace is beautiful and in warmer weather, would be great to spend a few hours.

We ate a couple of times in the tapas bar next to the reception area.  The food there is fantastic, well priced, and the staff are very helpful.

One person who really made our trip, was our concierge who showed us round the hotel when we checked in and brought up our luggage.  We were hoping to see him again before we left but he wasn't working the last 2 days we were there so were unable to pass on our thanks.  He was really helpful with ordering us a taxi to Poble Sec where we were meeting a friend, and he also kept us up to date with the football score on Tuesday night, which my husband really appreciated!  

Overall, this hotel is just fantastic, the staff are wonderful, the food is great, the rooms are brilliant - you really should stay here if you ever have the opportunity while in Barcelona.",5,2013,03,16
15,We'll be back,"One of just a few in the Barri Gotic, this small hotel would be considered a gem anywhere in the world. Modern redo inside an ancient shell, the atmosphere is wonderful. The rooms are equally modern and very well appointed. However, the staff is the key here. Incredible people that take great pride in their work and this new hotel. Their restaurant is superb, don't miss it. Many thanks to everyone at The Mercer for a great trip to Barcelona.",5,2013,03,13
15,Unique boutique Hotel in the heart of gothic Barcelona,"Booked the Mercer Hotel for a long weekend getaway with my husband. I could not have been more pleased with the stay. As frequent visitors of Barcelona; we've stayed in several 4 and 5 star hotels in the city, but this was definitely our best stay so far. Decided to book Mercer due to it's location and esthetic design.

The Hotel is fairly new and has a unique feel as it has been built around some of the remaining Roman walls. The hotel has been designed tastefully and the rooms are beautiful and airy even though light is limited due to the narrow streets surrounding the hotel as it is in the gothic quarter.

If you are visiting in the warmer seasons you can enjoy the gorgeous and shady courtyard or the roof terrace with views of the city, complete with a swimming pool.

The hotel's own restaurants and bar lacked people during our visit, but there are wonderful little bars and restaurants all around. 

Location of the hotel is just perfect as it is walking distance from the marina and all the old city's attractions. It is hard to get to by car due to the narrow streets so the cab might drop you off on the Career Princesca, but you will only have to walk 20m to the hotel from the street corner. Jaume metro station is just around the corner.

Last but not least, the staff of the hotel were super helpful and really ensured that we enjoyed our stay.

Will definitely stay at the Mercer next time as well.",5,2013,03,10
15,Best Boutique Hotel In Barcelona By Far!!!!,"I took my girlfriend to the Mercer Hotel for a combined Valentine's Day/Birthday celebration in February. Originally, I'd reserved another hotel where I've stayed before but having found the Mercer on TripAdvisor I fell in love. 
This was my third trip to the fabulous city of Barcelona...glorious Gaudi, the raucous Rambla, the bustling Boqueria and the peace of Parc Guell this city has it all. I've stayed at various different hotels including the famous Arts Hotel and I have to be honest the Mercer tops the lot. Admittedly, it's tricky to find (the cab driver got a little lost) but when you do find it...Wow!!...What a find it is!! Centrally located in the heart of the Barri Gotic the hotel has everything you would need for a city break. 
The hotel is design led with stylish with great decor and a lovely ambiance. The inner courtyard is ideal for pre-dinner drinks or relaxing after a busy day's sight-seeing. The rooms are extremely comfortable with plush beds, soft towels and all the mod-cons you need for your stay. Oh and did I forget to mention the rooftop terrace complete with swimming pool which comes into it's own in the summer months??
Service at the Mercer is impeccable with staff who are friendly, courteous and only too happy to help with restaurant recommendations, bars and local life.
It's not often that I rave about a hotel but without doubt the Mercer Hotel was one of the highlights of the trip and I would highly recommend it.",5,2013,03,07
15,Perfect mix of antiquity and modernity,"The Mercer Hotel is a very unique property that successfully combines the past and present. The public spaces are breathtakingly beautiful. There is a sense of peace and tranquility when you enter the hotel. We stayed in a deluxe room that overlooked the inner courtyard. The room was very large, peaceful and totally comfortable. The linens, towels, furniture, lighting were all perfect. There was a large closet with plenty of storage space.  Our daughter stayed in a superior room, which was also quite large by European standards. 

We especially enjoyed the breakfast experience. The food was beautifully presented and expertly prepared and served by a wonderful staff. 

We would like to thank the bellman Isidro for all his assistance. He went out of his way on several occasions to make our stay in Barcelona and at the hotel special. in truth, most of the staff went out of their way to make our stay special. The only shortcoming was the failure of the front desk staff to confidently recommend a variety of restaurants in the area. 

Thank you to the Mercer Hotel for making our stay in Barcelona so special.",5,2013,02,28
15,I love this hotel!,"I just recently spent a wonderful weekend in Barcelona with my husband. The Mercer is located in a historical building inside Barri Gotic, the very old Gothic Quarter, and it was built around roman walls of the ancient city of Barcino dated back to the 1st century A.D.. We absolutely loved staying there! The modern design by Spanish architect Rafael Moneo is amazing! The combination of modern with ancient roman walls makes it a sight to see. 
Their restaurant Mercerino is also delicious and there is a special room right by the restaurant where medieval paintings were discovered during the remodeling in the 28th defense tower. 
Their staff is extremely friendly and helpful. It is a small hotel and you’re addressed by name. 
The hotel is also very clean and quiet. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious for European standards. Ours was #309, one of the rooms featured in their website. Our bathroom didn't have a tub but we had a very nice rain shower so we really didn't miss having one. It may not look like it from the pictures but cars can actually drive into the Gothic’s very narrow alleys and our taxi dropped us off right in front of the hotel.",5,2013,02,28
15,Great Valentine's Stay,Excellent stay at this very central hotel. Right in the middle of the old town. Staff were really great - reception was really helpful in finding and booking us restaurants and clubs. Bar staff were very friendly and helpful. Requested champange and flowers via email. Everything was prepared in the room when we arrived.,5,2013,02,20
15,Superb!!,"We have just got back from a 4 day break in Barcelona, staying at The Mercer.The hotel was one of the best boutique properties I have stayed in. The staff were phenomenal (particularly Gloria on reception, Jose the Sommelier and Tony the night receptionist), always friendly and very helpful. The room was light and airey with an incredibly comfortable bed, the tapas were excellant and the location in the Gothic quarter is perfect for reaching almost all the local shopping and places of interest - in fact, apart from travelling to and from the airport, we didn't use a single taxi. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting this beautiful city",5,2013,02,19
15,A truly exceptional experience,"Last week we stayed in Hotel Mercer for 4 nights and it was an exceptional experience. First of all because of the staff. Every member of the staff was completely dedicated to offering us the best possible service: the people at the reception desk, the bell man, the people in the restaurant and the tapas bar, they all responded with enthousiasm to our requests. Secondly because of the building and the way it is decorated: the combination of old and new, the choice of every piece of furniture, the materials used. All those details make a stay at the hotel a real pleasure.",5,2013,02,18
15,"Fantastic decor, shame it wasn't comforfable","Stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel was a joy to behold; beautiful restorations, great design and perfect location. 
However, the bed was unusually hard, the aircon couldn't be turned on, and there was no drinking water in the rooms. 
This meant that we did not really have a solid night's sleep while we were here, and over the days my opinion went from a ""great fantastic"" to a ""meh, I guess I can sleep at the next stop""",4,2013,02,17
15,Luxury in a great location,"Our stay in this hotel began really well with an email exchange with certain requests such as a room next to each other, all of which were well dealt with.  When we arrived the staff were very friendly, helpful and attentive.  I really appreciated the fact that this hotel was very quiet, a sanctuary away from it all after a day's sightseeing and yet easy walking distance to many of Barcelona's attractions.  
The breakfast was a several course gourmet delight and well worth including in the room rate in advance.  This was helped by the lovely waitress Anya who made my mother and I feel very special and remembered every detail such as how I like my tea!
The rooms were modern and spacious with lovely bathrooms and everything you would expect from a quality hotel.  We really enjoyed our stay, felt the price was really worth it and would most definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2013,02,06
15,Modern elegance in the old town,"Stayed for a weekend break without children so splashed out for something special and expected something special in return. We were delighted then with the service and attention we received at the Mercer. The bed was super comfy, the room service was swift and delicious, the room was beautiful and the windows shut out every sound when firmly closed. Perfect. The design of the whole hotel was a clever blend of modern fittings over an ancient frame. The location was ideal for walking round the old town or down to Barceloneta and although there are taxis everywhere it was nice to have a rank available 3 minutes away. Great stay and well recommended.",4,2013,02,04
15,Sleeping with (great) history,"We decided to stay one night only in a luxury place in Barcelona and the choice could not have been better.
Instead of the ""typical"" 5* hotel this option seemed the most appealing due to building itself. The affable bell porter took us for a mini tour inside the hotel and we could see and touch parts of the hotel that belonged to the Roman City Wall of Barcelona. In fact our room was within one of the 28 towers that the Medieval City had.
Besides de historical charm the Hotel has been designed by Rafael Moneo so it is a combination difficult to beat if you are interested in modern architecture.
The rooms were quiet and spacious but there was one drawback: the toilets. It definitely felt like they were not part of the room, simple, and cheap looking were reasonably uncomfortable and not really well designed. 
In summary I think it is a great place in an awesome location that has only the little issue of the toilets to be perfect,",4,2013,01,22
15,"Luxe, simplicity and pleasure...","We enjoyed a full weekend at the Mercer hotel. Ideally located to discover Barcelone as a tourist.

If you like stylish and trendy place you will like the place. Here luxe is synonym of simplicity. The building by itself is incredible and the mix between the gothic and the modern style have been perfectly managed. Rooms are well equipped and perfectly soundproof. 

The personnel is willing to help and advices given for restaurant were very good.

Compare to “big hotel” where you feel as a number, here you immediately feel like home: The second day of my stay the waiter already proposed me my favorite beverage for  the breakfast.",5,2013,01,14
15,Wow!,"My son and I just stayed here and had a great time.
The service and friendliness of the staff was amazing. The location in the middle of the gothic quarter is great.
The room was luxurious and super clean.
We will be back!!",5,2013,01,06
15,Luxury with attention to detail,"This was one of the most pleasant hotel experiences I've ever had, and I travel quite a bit. We were looking for a quiet spot to relax and both room, facilities and staff made this stay very comfortable. Great comfortable bed, very good breakfast service and attentive desk staff. The room was very quiet, as was the rest of the hotel. We tried the excellent breakfast which was worth the hefty price tag. Bilingual TV programming (where available) in spanish/english. The rooftop terrace was nice, quiet and relaxing. Great location in el gothic, very close to el born and the water. A selection of amazing restaurants practically on your doorstep. Only drawback was that we couldn't get wifi in our room, but 3G reception was almost full bars so that didn't matter much for us. We will be back. ",5,2013,01,01
15,Outstanding,"SItuated centrally in the Gothic quarter, the new Mercer Hotel is an outstanding experience and a real surprise. A comfortable and delicate designer's hotel carefully crafted into the old walls of the Barcelona old town, with large rooms, balconies, even private terraces, as well as a roof terrace with swimming pool and a magnificent view.

Our room (No. 108) was huge, with a very comfortable sleep and a spacious terrace outside. The bathroom(s) were beautiful and functional, and had none of the fancy rubbish you may find in high class hotels. The main decorations of the hotel is the very building, with a gentle architecture integrating the modern with the old.

The staff is extremely service minded and helpful, and the service is given in a personal manner. Great breakfast, quite and very comfortable. Having visited several top hotels i Barcelona, this stands out for its combination of comfort, style and service. Highly recommended.",5,2012,12,20
15,Spectacular,"Absolutely perfect.  Really a winner.  Elegant.  Great location. Great staff.  Innovative comfortable.  Spotless. 
As a hotel owner I know this business :  they nailed it.  Bravo ! Couldn't recommend more highly. ",5,2012,12,01
15,"sleek, minimalist design carved out of an ancient structure","This sleek, new and modern hotel is carved out of the remains of a centuries old structure. Glass fronted, loft style ceiling height, open bathroom and shower, light switches that are sensor controlled, Loewe toiletries, a huge bed and very very luxurious bed linen. Add to this the friendly Spanish staff and there is little more one could ask for bang in the heart of this eclectic city.

The hotel is situated on a very narrow street, barely wide enough for 1 car. It is surrounded by shops, restaurants, museums, and a short walk from the harbour and it is easy to find something to suit the tourist, the adventurer, or the local haunts seeker.",5,2012,11,30
15,A very special hotel in a great area,"We just returned from staying 3 nights at this small luxury hotel. It was a pleasure from the moment we wallked in the door until we left. The hotel is built into the old walls of the Gothic quarter and the architect combined new and old in a stunning way. Ths overall ambience is extraordinary and we loved the feel of the hotel. We were upgraded to a junior suite which was quite spacious, a shame we could not use the balcony due to the weather. The staff could not have been more accomodating from the the tour they gave us when we arrived to a cup of coffee while we were checking out quite early in the morning.  I loved the old streets around the hotel, and in truth it is easy to walk to almost anywhere from this location. We are already looking forward to our next visit. Bravo to the team there who are working hard to make this a very special place!",5,2012,11,28
15,Small luxury boutique hotel in Gothic Quarter,"We have just completed a 4 day stay in Barcelona and were so pleased we chose this fabulous new hotel after hours of research.  From the moment we arrived until we left, our experience at the Mercer was first class.  We stayed in a Junior Suite and were thrilled to have our own gorgeous outdoor deck/garden area.  Everything in the room was lovely (king size bed, bathroom and decor).  The staff were so friendly, informative and professional, much more than staying at any of the larger chains. After exploring other areas of Barcelona, we were so glad we choose the Gothic Quater for great shopping (boutiques and one off shops) as well as the great dining options/tapas bars all within walking distance.  We were very happy with the dining at the Mercer, including the breakfast and bar.  
Thank you to all the wonderful staff at the Mercer for making the end of our European trip most memorable.  We will certainly return and recommend this hotel to all of our Australian friends and family.",5,2012,11,11
15,Fantastic new opening in BCN,"A great 5 star experience in the middle of the Gothic quarter in the old town of Barcelona. The original Roman walls of the ancient city are actually part of the building and are visible inside. We did not eat dinner at the restaurant as there are numerous excellent places nearby that we wanted to try instead. Breakfast was of a very high standard. If you go, do not miss the rooftop terrace and the excellent tapas bar that is also part of the hotel.

The room (junior suite) was spacious enough, had a modern, minimalist interior of a very high standard. It is difficult to mention anything we did not like in fact - perhaps the lights and lamps in the room could be better arranged, but this is purely subjective. Also, this is a typical place for couples or families with older children, if you have small kids, I would look elsewhere.

At last but not at least : the staff was extremely helpful and genuinely very nice (barmen, waitresses, receptionists, everyone).

Thanks for a great weekend and keep up the good work!",5,2012,10,28
15,Fabulous new boutique style hotel that dates to 1st Century,"My Wife and I stayed for three nights as part of our joint 40th Birthday celebrations.
I have traveled extensively for business including all the Hawaiian Islands and in many 5 Stars including Four Seasons.

Without Doubt this is the best hotel experience I have every had out of Hundreds of stays.

The location is perfect for exploring Gothic quarter and has a lovely Tapas bar the Bootleg next door where locals eat, always a good sign. 

The architecture with Fresco's being restored as we stayed is awe inspiring mix of old and ultra modern.There is a awesome roof terrace with pool and the hotel with only 28 rooms feels intimate.

The staff are the friendliest I have encountered anywhere always willing to help and genuinely friendly day and night. 

The food was wonderful amazing breakfasts in a unique courtyard and a great Tapas Bar as well as lovely dinners are available .

Highly recommend to couple looking for a peaceful and relaxing stay in Barcelona, we will be back !",5,2012,10,07
15,Beautiful boutique hotel with so much character,Stayed thee nights at this hotel and loved it! Beautiful old building very tastefully restored with original roman stone walls blended with modern architecture. Rooms were beautiful as was the rooftop terrace and small pool. The breakfast was 10/10 and the dinner and choice if wines were excellent. The staff were very friendly and attentive and just aimed to please with any request. The hotels location is fantastic -  right in the middle of the gothic quarter near lots of little tapas bars and quaint shops.,5,2012,10,07
15,Memorable experience,"Beautiful immaculately designed boutique hotel tucked away in historic Barcelona. Fabulous roman architectural features including frescos beautifully integrated with classical modern design. Staff were extremely attentive and warm. Food was exceptional, particularly breakfast which you should allow an hour for. We will definitely go back ... This is a hotel which is truly unique and perfect for a special occasion. Not the easiest to find so get directions before you go!",5,2012,10,07
15,relaxing beautiful hotel,"The room was spacious with a great bathroom area and huge bath and the bed was at least 6ft wide and very comfy. The only down point in the room was that the lighting was a little too ambient for us oldies with not so good eyesight and it could do with a standard lamp which lights the room a bit more.  The staff, without exception were friendly and very helpful, sorting on-line tickets for the sagrada familia which had huge queues the day we visited. The hotel is in the centre of the gothic quarter and not far to the seafront. The room we had was very quiet at night too. All in all a super small hotel.

Hopefully we will be back soon.",5,2012,10,07
15,Not sure we will be back,"My partner and I stayed 3 nights at Mercer Hotel Barcelona (14-17.9.). It was open since one week.

General impressions:

- The architecture is very nice and welcoming, although you don’t get the impression entering a boutique hotel (rather entering a museum of modern art, or a private bank)
- Staff was helpful at all times, albeit not always very effective or professional.
- We were under the impression that everyone was trying its best, but we clearly missed the guiding hand of a general manager, tying the loose ends together and telling people what they needed to do. This impression was confirmed when we sent the general manager a feedback-Email, but never got a reply.

Rooms:
- First impression: beautiful and impressive with its high-ceilings. Bathroom also thoughtfully arranged with the rest of the room.
- Room 206 had no working mini-bar nor a pol to hang our cloths. When we came back from our dinner, we were therefore told we could change to room 106.
- Room 106 had no working mini-bar either and it was empty. We were also missing some complementary water (which usually is available in 5 star hotels). There was no waste-bin (neither in the room nor in the bathroom). The drawers in the cupboard need refitting after first use.
- We missed beach towels with a beach-bag in the room.

Room service: We waited about one hour to get two glasses with ice and a bottle opener (also missing in the room).

Gym: We were missing a gym.

Bar: we had nice tapas and wine. Service was slow, but friendly.

Restaurant: we did not eat there and we also had no breakfast (at EUR 30/Persons it is too highly priced).

Terrace: there is no phone to order from room service; no bin in the toilets.

In a nutshell: We usually stay at five star boutique hotels when travelling abroad. This time however we are unsure whether we got the right value for the price we paid.",3,2012,10,05
15,Fantastico!,"This hotel had only been open for 5 days before we arrived.  We'd got a good deal for a Deluxe Room through lastminute because of the soft opening. We'd told them it was our anniversary and they surprised us by upgrading us to a Junior Suite. 
There are only positives for this hotel. 
Great location. Smack bang in Barri Gothic. Close to all the touristy bits but down a quiet street. 
Great room. We the first to use the room (108). Not only was it big, but it also had its own large private decking. Good quality toiletries. Turndown every evening with chocolates on the pillow. Really comfy bed and superb shower. 
Friendly staff. They couldn't do enough.
Certainly one of the best hotels we've ever stayed at.",5,2012,09,18
15,Beautiful hotel,"Me and my boyfriend went and stayed at this hotel in a superior double double room just after it opened and I would fully recommend it. The hotel itself is right in the middle of the gothic district of barcelona and is stylish and nicely built, with a lovely courtyard with orange trees where you can eat breakfast/dinner and a nice decking area upstairs with a fairly small pool. The staff were very friendly and happy to help with all of them speaking english (though some better than others) and some also speaking french. They also met us with a map of the city and leave a card on your bed every day with the weather forecast for the next day.

There are only 3 things I would say:
1.) breakfast is delicious (though not included in the price of your room) but be careful before ordering hot food. I made the mistake of ordering an omlette without realising breakfast already comes as 3 courses!
2.) make sure you know exactly where it is, as its on a narrow road and our taxi driver couldn't drop us directly outside and we ended up a bit lost.
3.) if you are going for a holiday where you lie by the pool and swim, this hotel may not be for you. There is a nice decking area upstairs but only around ten sunbeds and the pool is neither large nor deep.",5,2012,09,17

ristorante con giardino nella hall sono entrambi molto belli. Le
camere erano uniche ed allo stesso tempo moderne.
Il personale, soprattutto Edward, ha fatto di tutto per rendere il
nostro soggiorno un'esperienza indimenticabile ed ha davvero reso questo un viaggio memorabile. Consiglio dell'esperto: dopo la prenotazione, l'hotel invia consigli sui ristoranti. Prendeteli e chiedete loro di aiutarti a prenotare! Ogni ristorante della lista è stato fantastico!",5,2020,03,03
15,Muyyyyyy caroooo. no recomiendo,"Hotel muy caro sin marcar la diferencia, ni desayuno incluido. Muchos hoteles de 5 estrellas con mejor servicio y mejor precio. Desilusión y demasiado dinero tirado. Esperaba lo màximo y llegó algo normal y mediano.",3,2019,11,27

15,"Schönes Design, zentrale Lage und dennoch....","Das Mercer ist ein Luxushotel, dennoch sind wir von diesem Hotel nicht begeistert. Zunächst fuhr das Taxi nicht vor das Hotel, da es in einer Gasse mitten in der Altstadt liegt. Ein Shuttle vom Hotel wurde uns für einen horrenden Preis angeboten. Sodann war das Zimmer nicht ausreichend beleuchtet, es war und blieb schummrig. Besonders störend war, dass wir im 1. OG nachts ständige Geräusche hörten, die sich anhörten als ob die Heizungspumpe immer wieder an ginge. Auf unsere Nachfrage wurde der Sachverhalt verneint und wir konnten nur mit Oropax schlafen. Das Personal war zwar sehr zuvorkommend, aber Vorstehendes veranlasst uns, dieses Hotel nicht mehr hau buchen.",3,2019,01,06

Se ti piace il luogo elegante e alla moda ti piacerà il posto. Qui luxe è sinonimo di semplicità. L'edificio di per sé è incredibile e il mix tra lo stile gotico e quello moderno è stato perfettamente gestito. Le camere sono ben attrezzate e perfettamente insonorizzate. 

Il personale è disposto ad aiutare e i consigli forniti per il ristorante erano molto buoni.

15,Wunderbarer Aufenthalt,"Wir hatten ein Deluxe Zimmer gebucht. Es liegt zum Innenhof und ist normalerweise sehr ruhig. Am ersten Abend war eine geschlossene Gesellschaft im Restaurant so daß die Raucher bis in die Nacht den Innenhof nutzten. Da die Klimaanlage sehr geräuscharm war konnten wir trotzdem ruhig schlafen.
Das Zimmer war wie in der Beschreibung , es war sehr sauber und die Minibar war im Preis enthalten .
(Wasser und Softdrinks)
Das Frühstück mit 32 Euro pro Person war gut aber nicht aussergewöhnlich. 
Das Beste am Hotel sind die Lage und die lieben und hilfsbereiten Mitarbeiter. 
Sie machen das Hotel zu etwas Besonderem.
Da wir oft in Barcelona sind werden wir das nächste Mal wieder dieses Hotel buchen.",4,2017,02,08
15,Empfehlenswert,"Positiv: Ein wirklich schönes Boutique Hotel. Empfang war angenehm und herzhaft. Zimmer war toll ausgestattet.  Die Lage absolut genial, die Taxifahrer tun sich allerdings schwer mit der Adresse. Personal höflich und zuvorkommend. 

Mankos: Bett war einfach zu hart, Kissen zu weich. Frühstück war genial aber nicht dem Preis entsprechend. Zimmer mit Balkon gegen Hof können laut sein, wenn sich im Hof viele Leute aufhalten. Zudem hört man im ersten Stock alle Schritte des Zimmers von oben sowie das WC und die Dusche

Jammern auf hohem Niveau aber zu diesem Preis für mich notwendig. Das Mercer ist eine tolle Erfahrung, aber für ein solches Top Hotel erwartet man einfach mehr. Eigentlich schade, den nächstes Mal werden wir ein anderes Hotel wählen. Denn guter Schlaf in einem gutem Bett ist einfach sehr wichtig.",4,2017,02,08

15,Sobrio e efficiente ,"Sono stata in questa struttura per il mio 50^ compleanno, organizzando 2 giorni a Barcellona , non avevo idea in che albergo pernottare, così mi sono affidata su tripadvisor , che come sempre non mi delude mai.
Arrivati al 1,00 di notte del sabato, siamo stati accolti con molta gentilezza e attenzione, camera perfetta e come da conferma online, abbiamo chiesto per un room Service, ci hanno subito accolto nella nostra richiesta, anche nella tarda ora, servizio rapido e comunque curato nei minimi dettagli.
Un soggiorno perfetto, alla reception tutti indistintamente gentili e cortesi, e per non finire il giorno seguente avendo visto sul mio documento la data del mio compleanno , ci hanno fatto trovare in camera una deliziosa e buona torta con tanto di bottiglia da parte dell'hotel, sorpresa molto gradita!
Che dire esperienza super positiva,  l'hotel in posizione strategica, anche se mi era stato riferito che sarebbe stato scomodo in quanto in zona gotica, invece perfetta a pochi isolati dal centro dalla rambla , ci siamo trovati benissimo, e non nel caos caotico.
Colazione  perfetta, elegantissima e con la giusta musica sottofondo ,tutto buono, nulla di negativo, a parte la nostra partenza che dovevamo tornare ai nostri doveri, ci saremmo fermati volentieri ancora per qualche giorno anche solo per la location 
Insomma super consigliato , esperienza da fare  sotto tutti i punti di vista.
Grazie Mercer per aver contribuito a rendere il mio compleanno speciale!

15,Cocktail di nozze a Barcellona.,"Avendo deciso di sposarci il 15 gennaio a Barcellona, da anni nostra città di adozione (e di ataviche origini riguardo uno degli sposi), abbiamo da subito pensato per la cena ricevimento a questo bell'hotel cinque stelle gran lusso molto vicino alla nostra casa, di cui conoscevamo già la splendida terrazza in cui avevamo passato bei momenti in estate e gli interni magicamente sospesi tra antica Roma, Medioevo e contemporaneità. Abbiamo dunque contattato il management al riguardo e da quel momento nulla più è stato non dico un problema, ma anche solo un pensiero. Se abbiamo da sempre la sensazione che Barcellona sia una città che risolva i problemi anziché crearne, il Mercer hotel ha rafforzato e confermato tale convinzione: organizzazione, cura del dettaglio, attenzione nel rapporto col cliente, tutto coniugato nel verbo ""accogliere"". Accogliere nell'eleganza, nel lusso, nella sobrietà, nella buona educazione. Venendo poi alla cena in senso stretto, abbiamo avuto un'altra fortuna: proprio a gennaio lo chef italiano Giuseppe Iannotti, una stella Michelin e orgoglio della nouvelle cousine del sud Italia ha aperto il suo primo ristorante internazionale (Kresios Barcelona) proprio all'interno del Mercer hotel. Dunque abbiamo avuto il piacere di concordare con lui (provando prima il menù intero come suoi ospiti presso il suo bellissimo ristorante Kresios di Telese Terme in Italia) la carta del nostro cocktail in piedi di nozze. È stato un vero trionfo: abbiamo ricevuto e riceviamo ancora commenti entusiasti e complimenti dei nostri amici e parenti invitati per la qualità e la creatività espressa dalle cucine del Kresios e da Iannotti (oltre che per la precisione e puntualità del servizio). È bello sapere d'ora in poi che a Barcellona esista un altro ristorante di simile livello. Una nota a parte merita l'accordo per l'utilizzo dei locali bar e ristorante dell'hotel durante la serata: la correttezza e la disponibilità del management e di tutto lo staff è andata al di là di ogni contratto. Addirittura l'aperitivo di benvenuto è stato servito mettendo a disposizione l'intero salone lounge della hall dell'hotel. Alla fine della serata la felicità di noi sposi era massima. Tornando a casa abbiamo riflettuto che parte di essa era proprio merito del Mercer hotel. Che dire? Saremo stati fortunati, sarà stata una delle tante (poche) sinergie della casualità della vita, ma secondo noi c'è anche altro e questo altro ha un nome preciso: professionalità. Grazie di tutto Mercer hotel (nello specifico ci teniamo a nominare nei nostri ringraziamenti i due manager Gloria Anglora e Jordi Garcia, che ci hanno accompagnato con pazienza e precisone verso questo successo): siate fieri di voi perché il vostro lavoro è proprio rendere lieta e comoda la vita dei vostri clienti: e voi lo fate davvero nel modo migliore.",5,2016,01,31

15,Top-Hotel in perfekter Altstadt-Lage,"Absolutes Top-Hotel in perfekter Altstadt-Lage im Gotico. Das Hotel besticht durch eine sehr gelungene Symbiose eines sehr alten Stadthauses mit modernem Design. Sehr hilfsbereites und sehr freundliches Personal. Wir haben den Aufenthalt mit unserem kleinen Sohn (16 Monate) sehr genossen und es hat an nichts gemangelt. Das Hotel ist, obwohl man es nicht unbedingt erwarten würde, sehr kinderfreundlich und unserem Sohn wurde sehr viel Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt. Vielen Dank dem ganzen Mercer Team.
Wir hatten eine Junior-Suite mit Fenster und schöner Sicht auf den Innenhof und einer geschmackvollen und modernen Einrichtung. Das Bett ist super bequem! Einziger Kritikpunkt wäre das WC von Antonio Lupi, das beweist, dass nicht jedes Design auch bequem sein muss/kann! ;-) 
Schönes Frühstück mit guter Auswahl und einem sehr umsichtigen Service. Das Hotel hat ein gediegenes Restaurant, eine schöne (Tapas-)Bar und ein wundervolles Sonnendeck mit Pool auf dem Dach. 
Natürlich ist das Mercer kein günstiges Hotel aber der Preis für die 5 Sterne stimmt für das Gebotene. Wir werden wieder mal kommen.

ps. vielen Dank für das Upgrade in eine Suite für die zweite Hälfte unseres Aufenthalts. Die Reaktion auf den kleinen technischen Zwischenfall in unserem Bad war absolut professionell und lobenswert!",5,2015,01,11
15,Hotel elegante nel Barrio Gotico,"Hotel che rappresenta un'ottima opzione per visitare Barcellona. Situato nel cuore del Barrio Gotico, trasuda eleganza e un gran fascino. Il tapas bar incorporato è più che valido, ancorché i prezzi non siano certo popolari; il ristorante principale invece è un po' deludente, forse deve ancora trovare una sua dimensione dopo il recente cambio di guida in cucina. Staff cortese e preparato. Nel complesso comunque un'ottima esperienza.",4,2015,01,07

La bienvenida fue muy calida, nos recibieron con una copa de champaigne, el hotel esta esquisitamente bien decorado, la habitacion se encontraba perfecta, limpia, moderna, espaciosa. Tuvimos la fortuna de subir al roof garden a tomar una par de bebidas y lo que podamos contar de la bebida se queda corto, el barman amabilisimo.  De los mejores hoteles boutique que hemos estado. El consierge nos ayudo en todo lo que pedimos. El desayuno excelente. La ubicacion nos parecio perfecta ya que disfrutamos muchisimo caminar por tantos callejones hermosos y caracteristicos de Barcelona.",5,2014,09,20

15,Von A-Z ausgezeichnet!,"Ein absolut geniales Hotel im schönsten Viertel der Stadt. Gleich die Strasse hoch ist das Bliss, dort sollte man unbedingt mal das Morgenessen einnehmen! Frisch gepresster O-Saft, feine Croissants etc. aber auch das Abendessen ist empfehlenswert. Dort steht übrigens auch der älteste Brunnen der Stadt und gleich daneben ist ein hübscher Schmuckladen von lokalen Designern. Ansonsten, einfach mal durch die Gassen spazieren und geniessen..übrigens, der Barkeeper in der Bar auf dem Dach versteht sein Handwerk und erfüllt jeden Wunsch",5,2014,09,16
15,Traumhaftes Hotel,"Die Lage des Hotels geht nicht besser! Absolut top, mitten in der Stadt, trotzdem ruhig. Das Ambiente ist wundervoll, das Personal sehr bemüht. Perfekte Cocktails auf der hauseigenen Dachterasse mit atemberaubendem Blick und persönlichem , sowie wirklich kompetentem Barkeeper (Daniel) machen den Aufenthalt unvergesslich ! ",5,2014,09,15
15,Luxus und Altstadt in perfekter Symbiose,"Das Hotel besticht durch seine Lage mitten in der Altstadt. Der Hafen, die Ramblas und die Sehenswürdigkeiten der Altstadt sind perfekt fußläufig zu erreichen. Die nächste Metrostation ist nur 3 Minuten vom Hotel entfernt.
Der Tag beginnt mit einem perfektem Frühstück im Patio des Hotels wo Ihnen die aufmerksamen und freundlichen Damen des Services Ihre Sonderwünsche am Tisch (kein Frühstücksbuffet, wie schön) erfüllen und der Concierge immer die richtige Zeitung für Sie bereit hält.
Sehr schön ist die Dachterrasse um nach einem ausgiebigen Stadtbummel zu entspannen.
Das Essen und der Service im Restaurant sind auf hohem Niveau.
Hervorzuheben ist die freundliche und aufmerksame Betreuung durch das Hotelpersonal.
Die Zimmer sind modern und nicht immer ist alles praktisch, die Betten sind klasse.
Wir würden immer wieder gerne hier übernachten.",5,2014,09,11
15,Hotel Eccellente,"Abbiamo alloggiato presso il Mercer dal 17 agosto al 21, camere spaziose dal design molto curato, personale molto gentile e disponibile.L'hotel è ubicato nel cuore della città vecchia, a pochi minuti a piedi dalle principali attrazioni di Barcellona. Nonostante la posizione centralissima la qualità del sonno è garantita in quanto leggermente defilato rispetto le vie più trafficate. In conclusione uno dei migliori hotel in cui sia mai stato.",5,2014,09,04
15,Tiptop,"Sehr gutes Hotel in einer ruhigen schmalen Gasse gelegen, nicht ganz einfach zu finden, und auch nicht ganz einfach zu erreichen für die Taxis (da eben schmale Gasse). Zimmer sehr stylisch, mit allen Annehmlichkeiten, auch wenn das Design wohl etwas wichtiger ist als die Praktikabilität (Bad im Zimmer, Licht in der Badnische, Klobrille!). Sehr nettes und hilfsbereites Personal an der Reception, mit sehr guten Englischkenntnissen. Auch nette und ruhige Terrasse zuoberst mit kleinem Pool. Nicht wirklich zu empfehlen ist die Tapas-Bar, und unbedingt zu meiden ist das Club-Sandwich (pampige ""Rolle"")...
Alles in allem sehr angenehmes Hotel an sehr zentraler Lage mit sehr nettem Personal. Essen kann man anderswo besser.",4,2014,09,01
15,Davvero ben curato e si mangia bene,"Sono stato 3 volte negli anni in questo splendido Hotel, si trova nel quartiere gotico,ben arredato in un palazzo signorile, staff molto preparato, maitre gentile e premuroso, colazione Buona e cucina ottima, gradita la piscina ben curata e le camere, ero sempre nelle.migliori, sempre pulite ed ampie",5,2014,08,22

15,Tolles Boutiquehotel etwas schwer zu erreichen,"In allen Punkten grandioses Boutiquehotel - Lage, Restaurants ( Gourmet und Tapasrestaurant), Bar ( cool und Dachterasse), Zimmer, Personal.
Die Anreise sollte man aber planen und mit dem Hotel/Concierge vorher abstimmen, denn mit dem Auto ist das Hotel nicht zu erreichen und die Navigation führt nicht bis zum Hotel.
Das Hotel und der Concierge sind sehr hilfsbereit.
Nutzen Sie die Dachterasse und die verschiedenen Restaurants sowie Bars im Haus - es lohnt sich. Der Koch liebt Fisch und kann ihn toll verarbeiten.",5,2014,08,09
15,Segunda estancia,"Como dije en mi comentario anterior, hace más o menos un año, he vuelto a alojarme en el Mercer Hotel de Barcelona, y mi experiencia ha sido aún mejor que la vez anterior. Personalmente me encontraba en un mal momento de mi vida, y tras la estancia en el Mercer Hotel, me sentí muchísimo mejor. Señor Holgado, su hotel me ayudó a quedarme en paz conmigo mismo, y le prometo que siempre que viaje a Barcelona me alojaré en el Mercer Hotel. Se han ganado mi confianza absoluta. ¡Gracias!",5,2014,08,08
15,Wunderschönes Stadthotel perfekt gelegen,"Das kleine Hotel mit seinen 28 Zimmern liegt sehr zentral in einer versteckten Seitenstraße nahe dem gotischen Vierte, in einem uralten und wunderschön renovierten Gemäuer. Die Zimmer sind stilvoll und modern ausgestattet, die Dachterasse mit kleiner Bar und kleinem Pool bietet Platz für Entspannung von ausgiebigen Stadtexkursionen sowie einen schönen Blick. Massagen werden ebenso angeboten.
Essen und Frühstück waren hervorragend. Das W-LAN funktioniert reibungslos im gesamten Hotel, was auch in der heutigen Zeit nicht gerade selbstverständlich ist.
In der Nähe wimmelt es von Bars, Kneipen und Restaurants, die alle fußläufig erreichbar sind.",5,2014,07,28
15,Historico y acogedor,"Una hermosa experiencia es quedarse en este hotel en Barcelona.  Situado en la zona histórica de Barcelona, las sorpresas comienzan desde el momento del checkIN y mas tarde cuando se comienza a descubrir el edificio.   La excelente atención del staff es un poco muy importante de nombrar en esta review.   Existe una constante preocupacion por los huéspedes y se siente en todo momento las ganas de hacer que la estadía sea inolvidable.   Lamentablemente, en esta oportunidad el tiempo en la ciudad y las diversas actividad que tuvimos, no permitió disfrutar todo lo que el hotel brindaba.   Un lugar para volver, sin dudas!",5,2014,07,08
15,"eines der besten Stadthotels, das wir je hatten""","Wir waren im Mai 2014 für 1 Woche in Barcelona und hatten das Mercer Boria über Expedia gebucht. Das Hotel liegt in einer kleinen ruhigen Seitenstrasse ohne Verkehr direkt im historischen Viertel Bari Gothic ca. 50m von der Metrostation ""Jaume"" entfernt. Eine Toplage für eine Stadtbesichtigung. Das Hotel hat nur 11 Zimmer/Appartements. Wir hatten ein DZ mit 'Frühstück gebucht und ein Appartment mit Küche, 2 Fernseher, Sofa, extra Schlafzimmer, Bad und WC (getrennt) bekommen. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist klein aber fein und es war immer alles frisch. Eier werden auf Wunsch ohne Aufpreis zubereitet, der Kaffee kommt aus einer Nespressomaschine, man kann also Stärke / Aroma auswählen. Ein kleiner Haken: man muß früh beim Frühstück sein, da nicht alle der ""modernen Sitzgelegenheiten"" bequem sind. Das Personal ist außergewöhnlich freundlich und hilfsbereit. Wir bekamen am Abreisetag morgens um 4.00 Uhr sofort Kaffee angeboten. Am Vorabend hat man uns unsere online-Boardingpässe ausgedruckt. Alle Mitarbeiter, mit denen wir zu tun hatten haben ausreichend Englisch gesprochen. Ein Problem war, das Hotel zu finden, da es von außen nicht zu erkennen ist, kein Name, kein Hinweis auf ein Hotel. Wir haben im Laden nebenan gefragt, dort ist man das wohl schon gewöhnt, denn die Antwort kam fast vor meiner Frage. Das Mercer Boria BCN ist uneingeschränkt zu empfehlen!!",5,2014,07,07
15,Cinco Estrellas en TODO!,"El Hotel Mercer es la definición de calidad TOTAL! Sus instalaciones, la amabilidad del staff, la comodidad y buen gusto de sus habitaciones.

No dudaría en regresar.",5,2014,06,21
15,El mejor para disfrutar de Barcelona,"Bonito.limpio,detalles como la piscina o tener agua disponible 24h gratis hacen que sea ideal,nosotros somos matrimonio con niña y le pusieron su cama en una sala dentro de la habitación pero independiente de nosotros,con su tele y sofa propio. Poder relajarte con una copita en un sexto piso por la noche no tiene precio.Perfecto.",5,2014,06,20

Fui por trabajo y pienso volver por placer, lo tengo claro. 
Hasta pronto amigos!",5,2014,06,07
15,Mehr erwartet....,"Der Empfang und das freundliche Personal sind effektiv zu loben. Wenn man jedoch bei strömmenden Regen und kaltem Wind in Barcelona ankommt und für nur zwei Nächte dort ist und sein Zimmer erst um 15:00H beziehen kann, ist das kein guter Start. Wenn man dann ein dunkles, kleines Zimmer erhält, was eher einem einfachen Mittelklass-Hotel ähnelt, hat sich dann auch das warten nicht gelohnt. Wir durften ein grösseres Zimmer beziehen; aber die Zimmer haben auf uns einen sehr spartanisch eingerichteten Eindruck gemacht. Eher wie ein Aufenthaltsraum. Keine hübschen Deko-Objekte, Bilder oder sonstige Gegenstände, welche das Zimmer wohnlich hätten wirken lassen. Zum Frühstück gibt es zwei Karten. Eine Auswahl, welche im Frühstücks-Preis inbegriffen ist und eine andere...für Eier oder french toast, welche zusätzlich bezahlt werden müssen. Fanden wir auch nicht so positiv. Für ein Taxi muss man immer erst zur nächsten, grösseren Strasse laufen; da die Taxis nicht in die enge Gasse fahren können. Das nächste Mal würden wir das Hotel Gran Via wählen. Dieses Hotel wird als Mittelklass Hotel angeboten, verdient aber auf alle Fälle 4 Sterne.",3,2014,06,03
15,Ausgezeichnet,"Nur mit Superlativen lässt sich dieses Hotel bewerten. Ruhe mitten in der Altstadt, sehr gutes Frühstücksmenü, moderne Ausstattung der Zimmer.Das beste jedoch sind die Mitarbeiter dieses Hotels, diese Freundlichkeit ist außergewöhnlich, wir haben es genossen und ließen uns gerne verwöhnen.",5,2014,05,12

15,"Posto bellissimo, con qualche miglioramento possibile","L'hotel é bellissimo, comodo per posizione (nel barrio gotico), e con la piscina in terrazza. Servizio eccellente e premuroso. Da migliorare la colazione, che per un hotel di questo livello dovrebbe essere più curata, anche nella qualità. Fa parte dell'albergo un tapas bar per l'aperitivo, che è veramente piacevole.
",5,2014,04,21
15,Perfektes Stadthotel,"Mitten im gotischen Viertel gelegen besticht dieses Haus durch die gelungene Kombination historischer Substanz mit zeitgenössischen Elementen. Man wohnt mittendrin, aber dennoch ruhig und hat zu allen Sehenswürdigkeiten nur wenige Schritte zu Fuß. Der Service ist sehr aufmerksam; die Dachterrasse eine Oase mit kleinem Pool. Auf das Frühstück für € 32,00 kann man verzichten. Jederzeit gerne wieder!",5,2014,04,10
15,Ruhige Lage,"Ein ruhiges Hotel in zentraler Lage.: die Altstadt direkt vor der Tür,  zum Strand nur ein paar Hundert Meter.

Gracias a toda la arquitectura por la que está rodeado el Hotel ofrece una sensación realmente muy cálida y tranquila, nuestra habitación que era muy grande cumplió sin lugar a dudas con todas nuestras expectativas y más todavía con las de mi mujer que siempre tiene en cuenta hasta el más mínimo detalle. El personal del hotel es magnífico y siempre están muy atentos a cualquier petición que les puedas hacer, así como el servicio de limpieza de las habitaciones y la comida que es sin lugar a dudas extraordinaria.
Por lo que he podido comprobar en primera persona, este hotel es perfecto para viajar tanto en pareja, como en familia o de viaje de negocios, etc, ya que durante vuestra estancia podréis disfrutar de muchas cosas bonitas que ofrece la Ciudad.",5,2014,02,09

15,Una maravilla.,"Pasamos mi mujer y yo unos días en Barcelona y nada pudo ir mejor. Este hotel es una delicia, tanto arquitectónica como sensorial. La habitación no me pudo gustar más, y a pesar de estar en pleno barrio gótico, no escuchamos ningún ruido y dormimos plácidamente (la espléndida cama ayudó, por supuesto). Las amenities son de Molton Brown, mi mujer estaba encantada.
El personal, muy atento y receptivo a todas las demandas de los clientes, siempre reciben con una sonrisa (en especial quiero destacar al atento muchacho de barbita -perdón por no recordar su nombre- que nos aconsejó sobre restaurantes de la zona).
No es barato pero vale, como se dice, su precio en oro. El desayuno, otra delicia, y tomarlo en el patio de naranjos, impagable. Volveremos sin dudarlo.",5,2013,12,22
15,Excelente,"El edificio es arquitectónicamente perfecto, palacete con muralla antigua de la ciudad.

Wir können uns nur den vorhergehenden Bewertungen anschließen und würden es bei einer Reise nach Barcelona immer wieder auswählen.",5,2013,08,29
15,"Elegante, confortable y espectacular","He ido con mi marido a pasar un fin de semana y la verdad que no hemos podido estar mejor. El servicio es maravilloso, estuvieron atentos a todo lo que necesitábamos. Está en pleno corazón de Barcelona y es un hotel elegante y muy confortable. Cenamos en el restaurante Vermuth Mercerino y la verdad que fue espectacular, las habitaciones una maravilla y todo un lujazo. Desayunamos en el Patio de Los Naranjos y no hubo mejor despertar.

15,Oase der Ruhe,"Wir haben 4 Nächte in diesem paradiesischen Hotel verbracht. Das Hotel verbindet Altes und Neues, die alten römischen Stadtmauern verschmelzen mit dem modernen Design des Hotels. Die Zimmer zum Innenhof sind unglaublich ruhig und das mitten in einer Grossstadt. Die Lage im Gotischen Viertel ist einfach perfekt. Die Zimmerausstattung lässt keine Wünsche offen, die Betten sind einfach absolut toll und bequem, wie wir sie kaum je irgendwo angetroffen haben und wir reisen sehr sehr viel. Das Personal ist sehr zuvorkommend, das Frühstück im Innenhof mit Orangenbäumen schmeckt einfach himmlisch und die Bedienung - insbesondere Mariana - ist sehr herzlich. Einzig das Abendessen ist hoteleigenen Restaurant hat uns nicht geschmeckt und Preis/Leistung stimmen im Restaurant nicht. Das Hotel verfügt über einen Minipool auf dem Dach, es gibt einige Liegestühle und es ist herrlich, an der Bar etwas zu trinken und das über den Dächern von Barcelona. Wir werden bei unserem nächsten Besuch mit Sicherheit wieder in diesem tollen Hotel übernachten.",5,2013,06,27
15,Un hotelito pequeño donde no te falara nada,"Bonito hotel situado en el casco antiguo muy cerca de la catedral, construido respetando la antigua muralla de barcelona.
En la terraza hay una pequeña piscina y un bar.
En la planta baja al final junto al resaurante una bonita cocteleria.",4,2013,06,18
15,"""CONGRATULATIONS!!!""","Wir waren zu fünft für 2 Tage, Ende März, um Geburtstag zu feiern da.

Fünf verschiedene Zimmer in verschiedenen Kategorien-alle top (die Betten 
unvorstellbar himmlisch!).
Das Service so freundlich, zuvorkommend, kompetent und vor allem flexibel (bis  
spät in die Nacht hinein wurden wir mit Wein und Tapas versorgt) wie wir es noch nie erlebt haben.
Geburtstagsfrühstück  auf einer der Suite-Terrassen alle noch im Bademantel -Eleganz und
Luxus pur und trotzdem so herrlich gemütlich. 

Noch ein großes Plus waren die anderen Gäste: eine Mischung aus ""urban-international-
creative-intellectual-schick"".

Unbedingt die Boutique Doshaburi vis-a-vis besuchen.

Wir kommen wieder und werden im Pool am Dach schwimmen und einen Drink mit Blick
auf Barcelona schlürfen...

15,Glamour elegante storico,"Siamo appena rientrati da Barcellona,abbiamo pernottato in questo splendido hotel che ha arricchito la nostra vacanza.
Storia eleganza e tendenza in una posizione strategica per visitare la città .
Ottime colazioni e meravigliosa la cena ...
Spero di ritornare....",5,2013,06,10
15,"wunderschön, super Service","Wir reisten für 2 Tage nach Barcelona. Da wir nur 2 Tage frei hatten, wollten wir diese umso mehr geniessen. Nach all den guten Kommentaren, die ich über das Mercer Hotel gelesen habe, hatte ich etwas Angst, mit zu hohen Ansprüchen anzureisen. Aber im Gegenteil - so einen guten Service hab ich noch in keinem Stadthotel erlebt.
Eine Tasse Tee zur Begrüssung, einen kurze Hotelführung  - wir fühlten uns sofort sehr willkommen. Die Reception hat sich um unsere Restaurant-  Reservation für den Abend gekümmert, während wir die Stadt erkundeten. Jedesmal wenn wir das Hotel betraten, machte uns jemand die Türe auf und wir wurden freundlich begrüsst. 
Wir möchten uns beim ganzen Mercer- Team für den unvergesslichen Aufenthalt bedanken!",5,2013,04,02
15,Must per visitare Barcelona,"Hotel ubicato in luogo perfetto per visitare Barcellona. A 2 minuti dalla Cattedrale, a 5 dalla Rambla in pieno quartiere Gotico circondato di ristoranti e localini per tutti i gusti e tutte le tasche. e' stato aperto da meno di un anno, quindi la gestione e' in fase di perfezionamento ma e' sulla buona strada. Da migliorare il servizio alle camere. Bellissimo ed unico nel suo genere perché' e' realizzato in stile moderno all'interno delle mura antiche del quartiere Gotico. Pur essendo un 5 stelle, avendo solo 28 camere, e' impostato come un albergo a conduzione familiare con personale molto gentile ed affabile. Da segnalare Juan Manuel grande conoscitore dei ristoranti must di Barcelona. Forse un po' alti i prezzi visto che deve ancora farsi conoscere.",4,2013,04,01
15,Traumhaftes Hotel im gotischen Viertel,Das Hotel steht auf den Resten der römischen Stadtmauer von Barcelona. Die alten Mauern wurden freigelegt und harmonieren mit dem modernen Design. Das Hotel ist sowohl nach vorne (West) als auch nach hinten (Ost) nur durch fast autofreie Gassen (Ausnahme Taxi) erreichbar und somit völlig ruhig gelegen - trotz zentraler Lage im gotischen Viertel. Sehr freundliches Personal. Wir hatten einen schönen Aufenthalt zum Barcelona-Marathon. Es war der siebte Besuch in Barcelona. Das Hotel war mit Abstand das beste. Wir kommen wieder.,5,2013,03,18
15,"Lujo, charme y estilo","Sin duda uno de los mejores hoteles de lujo de la ciudad. Este boutique hotel, ubicado en un Palacete respira la historia de la antigua Barcelona, dado que se construyó en la misma muralla y en una de las torres de vigilancia datada en el siglo IV. Un auténtico monumento reformado y convertido en hotel por el arquitecto Rafael Moneo que ha realizado un trabajo excelente y respetuoso 100%. La decoración es sobria, elegante y de gran calidad en los materiales y mobiliario. El servicio exquisito, atento y cercano (llaman al huesped por su nombre). Un espacio imprescindible en Barcelona. Además el servicio de restauración es de altísima calidad. Las habitaciones son confortables y muy silenciosas. La cama es espectacular y muy cómoda vestida con sábanas de algodón egipcio de 300 hilos. Una experiencia del nuevo lujo a pocos metros de la Catedral de Barcelona y en pleno centro histórico. Un 12 sobre 10.",5,2013,03,05
15,Enclave ideal en un palacete precioso!,"Precioso hotel, diseño y comfort en el centro. Su restaurante cumple totalmente las espectativas del edificio, cocina sabrosa y bien ejecutada. Servicio atento, joven y amable. Se respira buen ambiente. Espero volver muy pronto, me ha encantado.",5,2013,01,29
15,"Singular, diseño, lujo y barrio gótico","Fui recien inaugurado y hace 2 dias de nuevo. Habitación de las sencillas en ambos casos que ya son espectaculares.
No hay absolutamente nada que objetar a las habitaciones. (Mi mujer pediría mas luz para maquillarse).
Acojedor, combinando moderno con las murallas milenarias del edificio, buenos materiales y tonos de colores muy acertados. Amenities de nivel y lenceria de calidad.
El acceso en coche no es facil (estamos en el barrio gótico), pero las conexiones son perfectas desde esta ubicación.
El desayuno se puede hacer en la terraza interior y esta a la altura (y punto). En los bajos hay un bar/tapas integrado en el hotel que sirve el room service. Muy buenas tapas y selección de vinos, podría ser mas rapido el servicio, y yo mas paciente.
La recepción merece especial mención por su amabilidad, diligencia y capacidad de ayuda (concierge). Recomendable si quieres vivir el barrio gótico, tanto a nivel de negocios o pareja.",5,2012,12,05
15,Piedras y silencio,"Un nuevo hotel-boutique que pretende diferenciarse de los demás, ahora en rodaje, si lo consigue pasará a ser uno de los referentes de Barcelona.
Ante todo la decoración. Minimalista al extremo, aquí el protagonismo es la piedra, el suelo de madera sin pulir, las paredes en bruto, los techos envigados altísimos, los elementos arquitectónicos antiguos mostrados tal cual, sin ningún elemento que disfrace el verdadero protagonista del hotel, esto es, el entorno: aquí se rinde tributo a la ciutat vella, al barrio gótico, a la Barcelona medieval.
Luego las instalaciones. La mejor cama de la ciudad y, quizás, una de la mejores de Europa (no exagero). Sábanas y toallas de primerísima calidad. Perfecta y completa  ausencia de ruidos, tanto exteriores –a las gruesas paredes se añade un excelente aislamiento acústico- como interiores –instalaciones de aire acondicionado y otras máquinas habituales (ascensores, extractores, etc.) extremadamente silenciosas.
Sigue el personal, muy atento y cortés, nos pareció voluntarioso y pendiente de cualquier necesidad de los huéspedes.
El bar de tapas nos pareció acertado en cuanto a la calidad de la comida y bebida, pero algo incómodo y con un ambiente frío. El desayuno se sirve en el restaurante y a la carta. Nos sorprendió la cuidadosa selección de los alimentos (pan y bollería muy sabrosos, confituras caseras, fruta en su punto, café excelente). No probamos el restaurante, pero un vistazo a la carta anuncia una cocina gastronómica en línea con el establecimiento.
Hemos realizado dos visitas consecutivas al hotel. En ambas ocasiones nos esperaba en la habitación una nota personalizada con la bienvenida y una invitación para el bar de tapas. En la primera estancia nos llamó mucho la atención que todos los impresos aparecían en nuestra lengua, el catalán. Aunque este idioma es uno de los oficiales en Catalunya, por extraño que parezca, en la mayoría de los hoteles de Barcelona queda relegado a las cartas del room-service o a los carteles de emergencia, y en algunos casos hasta es completamente ignorado.
Dedujimos que, con la finalidad de dar un trato personalizado a cada cliente, se preparaban estos impresos en función del idioma del huésped, lo que nos pareció una excelente idea. 
Sin embargo, y lamentablemente, en nuestra segunda visita, no fue así.
Como todos los hoteles nuevos, se necesita un rodaje. Este no es una excepción y hay algunos fallos que deberían corregirse. Entre ellos, el servicio de “turndown” propio de los hoteles de cinco estrellas, inexistente las dos primeras noches. En la tercera noche la camarera de pisos llamó a la puerta, le informamos que dejábamos la habitación en cinco minutos, pero ya no regresó. Sólo en la última noche nos prepararon la cama y nos cambiaron las toallas usadas, hasta este momento estábamos convencidos que no ofrecían este servicio. Con consecuencias más molestas, el minibar no fue repostado ni una sola vez. Y puestos a solicitar mejoras, no estaría de más poner una papelera en la habitación (no hay) y un caballete de esos plegables para las maletas.
Considerando la cuidadosa gestión del hotel y la firme voluntad de ofrecer un estilo exclusivo, elegante, personalizado y en cualquier caso diferente, estamos seguros que estos pequeños detalles serán solventados y que el Mercer se consolidará como uno de los mejores y más destacados hoteles de Barcelona.",4,2012,10,22
