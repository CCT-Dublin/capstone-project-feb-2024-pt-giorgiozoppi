118,"No notes, loved it!","Gorgeous building, beautiful interior. I particularly loved the headboard above the bed, and the general aesthetic of the hotel-which believe used to be a grammar school.
Clean, loved the shower! well located, lovely staff.
No notes- we will be back!... :)",5,2024,10,18
118,A welcoming piece of India in the centre of London,"Excellent and friendly service. Spacious, clean and tidy room. Ok, it‚Äôs what you would expect from a 5 star hotel, but LaLit has its own special way which I like.
I opted for the Indian breakfast on my last morning and had forgotten how good Doza‚Äôs taste üëç",5,2024,10,16
118,A Gem In The Heart of Tower Bridge,"Superior standards.  This is our second time staying at the Lalit. Both times we have arrived with high expectations and left impressed.  The area near the Tower Bridge is a nice reprieve from the touristy areas.  We can walk 2 minutes and be on the Thames with nature and great views.

Service at the Lalit feels like unreasonable hospitality...and their tradition.

Their first hotel opened in Delhi in 1988.    Extravagance is their specialty.  The interiors are classic but not without subtle flair.  This former 19th century private 
 school house has been filled with Indian style and elegance.  The classrooms have been transformed into 'never want to leave' rooms with sophisticated touches like motion-activated closet lighting, crisp bedding, designer bathroom brassware, heated toilet bidet, under floor heated porcelain bathroom floor tiles, wooden floors, and real art. Baluchi is their on-site restaurant which deserves 
their own reviews.  Try the Imli cocktail and charred salmon for 
 a quick trip into the unique experience of this gem.  I had the most incredible massage at their spa, Rejuve.  Everything we needed in one beautiful peaceful place.",5,2024,10,14
118,Excellent Stay,"Excellent stay, well appointed rooms, quiet yet convenient location. Very attentive staff, service was excellent. Rooms and communal areas all very impressive 
Downsides, bar closes at 11pm even at the weekend and there is room service available out of hours.",4,2024,10,14
118,Amazing Spa treatment,"Unbelievable spa Experience. 

I have tried different spa in Europe and London and it was my first time to go to this amazing place for spa treatments The lalit london . Hot oil ayurveda massage is so relaxing.

room is great. Can‚Äôt recommended this hotel enough. It‚Äôs quite literally stunning.",5,2024,10,11
118,Exceeded (almost!) all expectations.,"What a delightful and unexpectedly luxurious stay a few steps from centrally located London Bridge station. 
A feeling of spaciousness throughout the whole hotel. The history of the building and meticulous and sympathetic renovation remarkable and hugely interesting. 
A total plus ‚Ä¶ warm toilet seats! 
A minus (no different to most hotels though), even with the moveable magnifying mirror, the light wasn‚Äôt good enough to apply makeup.",5,2024,10,08
118,Disappointing,"Completely soulless experience. Check-in was awkward as information not conveyed effectively. Bar closed at 10.30pm and room service stopped at 10pm which made us think that the hotel is run for the convenience of the staff and not the guests

Staff scrolling their phones in reception and bar which isn‚Äôt a good look if you label your hotel 5 star. The cavernous restaurant invariably empty as it didn‚Äôt look particularly inviting and staff just chatting in the corner

I have been lucky to stay in other 5 star hotels and this simply isn‚Äôt one whatever they want to brand themselves

Needless to say we will not be using this hotel again",2,2024,10,08
118,Grandiose stay in the heart of the city,"The service was excellent. The room was clean, tidy, spacious (Senior Classroom), bright. The complimentary snacks and drinks were convenient and a nice touch. 

The beds were on the harder side, but very comfortable. There were two types of pillows available, so we had no issues. 

The building was gorgeous, with beautiful architecture, and matchingly decorated interior. The great hall had a grandiose atmosphere and an excellent backdrop for our breakfast.",5,2024,10,07
118,All the kit but no idea...,"The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are spacious and very comfortable. The bed and linen are perfect and the bathroom was also lovely. We wanted room service when we arrived at 10:00 and were met by a very grumpy man saying they don't have room service. Their website states they do and in the morning we saw trays that were room-service so not sure if he meant the kitchen was closed.
We decided to order deliveryroo and eat at the bar (which he said we could do) as the restaurant was also closed. The bar was small and intimate and by the time we finished our drink they were closing up. While we had our food they decided to leave a bag full of rubbish next to us for the entire time. Not sure if this is how they treat their guest but sadly not sure I will come back. The Location is perfect and hotel itself is lovely but service was shocking. Not what you would expect from the standard of hotel they are trying to portray.
Its a shame as we don't come to London often so that was a big damper for the evening.  For the facilities I give it Very good but for Service I give it a thumbs down...",4,2024,10,01

The rooms, while somewhat small, are very comfortable. The restaurant specializes in Indian cuisine, easily the best I have had anywhere.

What stood out for me and my travel companions was the level of service; as a boutique hotel, you tend to get to know staff quickly, and the staff there was excellent.

Our friends who we were traveling with chose the hotel and they made an excellent choice. When traveling, location is perhaps one of the most important factors when choosing a place to stay. 

We could walk everywhere and local train stations were close by. We were literally a couple of minutes to the Tower Bridge and the sensational Borough Markets. 

After a long day enjoying the city a beautiful shower and comfortable bed is what you need - and LaLit did not disappoint.

118,Stay away !,"If you are looking to book this place then please be aware that this place might look very fancy in first glance but you will be disappointed. They will charge the security deposit & then once you never get credit in your account, you will be told to follow up with your bank. Just to let you know we stayed at other hotel in London & our deposit was refund in the same bank within few hours of our check out. & it was not even that big chain like This one. 

Secondly, we booked our drop to airport via hotel during night shift ( Abdul) he assured us that its booked. At the time of check out we kept asking for our cab & Tarun at reception was not at all helpful as he was just trying out to find the booking which was never made by them. 

Imagine we were at the corner to miss our flight inspite of booking a cab .It was a night mare that we never thought we will be facing at such big hotel. So sad! 

We were told the amount as 90 Pounds & end up paying 138 pounds because of there miss out. Its been more than 20 days that i have checked out & still never received my security deposit back. And at the time of check out i was informed, please be careful - because everything you see in the room is very expensive. Just imagine. 

Extremely dissatisfy & never booking this entire chain of hotel. Every again. Thank you Abdul, Tarun & Thank you entire team of Lalit London",1,2024,08,25

Bedrooms are quirky and spacious with no expense spared on any of the furnishings. Plenty of tea, coffee and complimentary drinks and snacks and quality toiletries. Ate in the restaurant one night and this is possibly some of the best Indian food we have ever had. I‚Äôm not sure we would want to stay anywhere else on future visits to London.

The rooms were clean and nicely decorated. There were lots of snacks and drinks for free if needed. That was definitely nice to have when mid afternoon hunger struck. We had a king sized bed which was comfortable. The pillows were good. They were marked as firm but really were just regular. That was fine because they were nice and fluffy. The bathroom had good towels and washcloths but no hand towels. Not a deal breaker but it would have been an added benefit. Water pressure in the shower was very good. There was a bidet which was very nice to have. The first night we received a call from the front desk just to make sure everything was ok. That was a nice touch. The hotel is very close to Tower Bridge and lots of little restaurants. At night we walked to the bridge and had a great time just strolling along the waterfront.

118,Extraordinary service,"Shivali gave us great service , she made us feel special . Good and elegant hotel with great food and service . I would visit again and recommend to others.  Good and elegant hotel with great food and service . I would visit again and recommend to others.",5,2024,08,21
118,Ultimate Experience,Exceptional.. Shivali has delivered a professional service. Overall experience exceeded  our expectations. Will return. Food was delicious and presentation was  superb. The ambience was great and the chandeliers were the centre of attraction within Baluchi,5,2024,08,21
118,NOT 5 STAR,"The truth is this is NOT a five star hotel by any means. I could write a book about it, but I will just give a few points:

1) the bed is very hard
2)the pillows are flat
3)the reception staff members are complete liars
4) the rooms are in need of refreshing

The people working here are so busy trying to avoid responsibility for anything that they will just lie right to your face. Unless you just want to throw money way for a miserable stay, I suggest finding another hotel.",1,2024,08,21
118,Truly amazing,"I had chose this hotel by someone‚Äôs review that they found Jewel in heart of London ( The LaLit) and I would say that it‚Äôs completely true. Amazing Boutique Hotel . Spacious Rooms, Wonderful Breakfast and much more . Location is also very easily accessible by underground and Borough Market is few minutes by walk",5,2024,08,18
118,Individual Feel,"A unique hotel which uses the features of the old school to create an interesting and comfortable environment. We stayed in room 7 which had a wet room rather than a conventional shower. This did cause some issues and required us to create our own ‚Äúdan‚Äù system out of towels to stop the room flooding. Other than this rather frustrating feature we really enjoyed the hotel & would re visit, just avoid room seven!",4,2024,08,18
118,Beautiful London Stay,"The LaLit didn‚Äôt disappoint excellent service wonderful staff the highest quality. The building is outstanding a real treasure to be found , The proximity is great bus service two minutes away and underground 10mins slow walk also for train links 5minutes walk to tower  Bridge at the rear off the hotel through a quiet little park area , would throughly recommend will be returning next year Thank you all the Staff at the LaLit for a lovely stay well done",5,2024,08,18
118,disappointing,"Unfortunately, our experience was quite disappointing. While the room itself was spacious. The hairdryer was broken. When we called the reception, they said they would send someone to fix it, but no one ever came. As a result, I had to ask a member of the cleaning staff, who then replaced the hairdryer with one from another room.

Additionally, the staff left much to be desired. The cleaning lady seemed annoyed when we kindly asked her to wait a moment as we were about to leave the room. On the third day, no one came to clean our room or restock water and toilet paper. When we went out for dinner in the evening, we requested these items be replenished and the room cleaned, which they did without any issues.

However, on the day of check-out, we noticed that all our personal items from the shower were missing, including our medicated shampoo, razor, and conditioner. When we brought this up at check-out, the receptionist simply responded by saying, ‚ÄúMy cleaning staff doesn‚Äôt touch personal belongings of guests.‚Äù Since we obviously didn‚Äôt throw them away ourselves, this situation was quite mysterious. The only thing they offered was to speak with the cleaning staff and send us an apology email, which we never received.

Overall, this left us with a very unsatisfactory impression.",1,2024,08,17
118,Lalit Review - Senior Classroom Room,"Senior rooms are well sized. Great location...close to Tower Bridge, river area, Borough Market, London Bridge Station. Rooms are clean. Hotel is slightly dated as this was previously a school. Rooms have been refurbished to a modern style.",4,2024,08,17
118,A fantastic hotel with amazing staff,"Absolutely stunning hotel, fantastic service and excellent location! Amazing rooms with gorgeous bedding and pillows. We will define staying again. Thank you for looking after us so well. The complimentary treats in the room were a great touch.",5,2024,08,17
118,Great time,"The Staff were really helpful and the room and location were superb - we would definitely visit again. 
No iron in the room is a small gripe borne mainly out of the need to complete 200 characters to be able to leave a review. 
To conclude a really clean and good sized room.",4,2024,08,16
118,Superb deal!  Pleasant stay!,"Excellent location, staff, and room size!  Had a separate seating/work area.  Super convenient, 5 min walk to subway/trains. 5 min to London bridge and 10 min walk to London tower.

Room had a weight scale that saved us on overpacking weight fees at the airport!

Excellent amenity options inside. Restaurant and bar and gym.",5,2024,08,16
118,Luxury in London,Beautifully appointed rooms and luxury hotel rooms experience. Excellent customer service and everything you need from fine food to lovely bar and sitting rooms. Some original pieces from the grammar school are still present and preserved history. I will definitely come again and next time enjoy the spa and other services!,5,2024,08,15
118,Not a five star hotel.  The worst hotel of our trip.,"We were so excited about this hotel, it was the last place we were staying on our trip across 2 countries and various hotels in five different cities.

Bottom-line, you would  have a more comfortable night's sleep, a more consistent experience, and save a lot of money by following these steps.  1) Purchase a cheap mass produced embroidery of a peacock.  2) Reserve a room a Hampton Inn.  3) Hang the embroidery on the wall in the room of the Hampton Inn.

Our bad experience started almost immediately at check-in.  First, the check-in experience is not typical.  There is no lobby, or front desk, instead two desks sit empty, a person will emerge randomly from a back room and ask you to sit through a check-in process that reminded me of the financing portion of a car purchase.  We arrived after a long and unpleasant travel day.  Our flight from Malta was delayed with several hours sitting in the plane on the tarmac, and then a train ride into London.  We were in good spirts, but were travel worn and not looking our best, I believe the person who checked us in evaluated our ""worthiness"" for the room we would be assigned based on this.  He had our check-in sheet in front of him, we sat down, I saw our room number written on the paper, he struck through it with his pen and assigned us to room 220.  Which just has to be the worst Senior Classroom in the hotel.  It's dark, there is one widow that immediately faces an alley and a service stair of an adjoining building.  We were exhausted and only staying for 2 nights, so I didn't have the energy to waste our remaining vacation time being bitter and complaining to someone who clearly thought we weren't worth impressing. Also, be prepared for a rather ridiculous credit-card hold for $50 per-night for every night of your stay.

The person checking us in enthusiastically told us about an in room buffet, with cookies, and snack and drinks--that were all complementary.  I was envisioning something similar to what you might find in a basic airport lounge.  Wrong, there were two small bags of chips, two packs containing a single cookie, and 2 sodas, 2 waters.  The basic airport lounge experience--is what this place calls their buffet breakfast--at which we just got coffee and went somewhere else.  So glad we did not prepay for included breakfasts.

Everything in this hotel just screams ""chain hotel"". The under-scaled, mass produced, repetitive artwork, the boring decor, cheap shabby furnishings and linens.  The uncomfortable mattress.  Dingy walls.

Every time we found an amenity that might be useful, it was either broken, or only partially worked.  When we were packing up to leave, I noticed a scale in the bathroom we thought might be helpful in checking our baggage weight--no battery.  Everything was like this.  The Toto bidet washlet, that mostly functioned, but the soft close feature was broken, so the lid would just slam unexpectedly.  

When we were walking into the hotel for the first time we noticed all of the boxwoods out front were brown and dead--even they hated being here.  

Just pick any other hotel of this class and price range--it has to better.   We loved Page8!",1,2024,08,11
118,The best boutique hotel in London,From the moment we arrived at this beautiful hotel the service at this hotel was everything you would expect from a five star hotel.We arrived very early to check in as we had an early flight from Belfast but it was no problem for us to check in an they stored our bags for us until our room was ready so we could go on and explore London.Our room was on the top floor and we had a great view of the shard from it.The heating toilet seat was a hit.An exceptional breakfast was had each morning with a choice of an Indian one too.The location is great with just a short 5 min walk to London Bridge Station and just behind London Bridge.We will definitely be back at this wonderful little gem of a hotel than you The la lit Noreen ,5,2024,08,02

118,Fabulous small hotel,"We have just returned from one night stay at this incredible hotel. 
From the moment we walked through the door on arrival to the moment we left the staff were attentive and couldn‚Äôt do enough for you,
We stayed in The Tower Suite, a beautiful room, with views of The Shard. The bed extremely comfortable, great bathroom with a powerful shower and unique toilet. 
We had everything we could have required in the room with a mass of wardrobe space. 
The building itself has an interesting history and the decor is simply exquisite, in particular the restaurant, where we had a full English breakfast with choice of anything from the buffet. 
Such an amazing find, we wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend to friends and look forward to a return stay.",5,2024,07,17
118,Friendly and welcoming,"We had a wonderful overnight stay at the LaLiT - the building is beautiful and has been thoughtfully fitted out. The staff were friendly and helpful, providing attentive service to give us a real 5* experience. Our room was really spacious, with all the amenities we needed (including a few little complimentary treats) and bathroom was lovely. We enjoyed a full indian breakfast in the morning (continental buffet and full english were also available). We didn‚Äôt use the bar but spent a little time relaxing in the Headmaster‚Äôs room next door. Hotel was well-located with plenty to see and do (and eat and drink) close by. Would happily return.",5,2024,07,16
118,Excellent,"Excellent service, friendly staff, a pleasant stay overall. Rooms were big and an extra bed was accommodated for us. Bathrooms were spacious and clean.

118,Lovely LaLit,"The hotel was really lovely and welcoming and the staff all very friendly. We didn‚Äôt get a chance to use all of the amenities, but what we did use was all excellent. Lovely touch with the complementary mini bar. Comfy beds and our senior classroom bedroom was huge (esp by London standards)‚Ä¶room was well equipped but could have been bolder on the scale of the furniture and furnishings given the size of the room.",4,2024,07,10
118,Small charming hotel,"Great location close to tower bridge & the Shard & for foodies walking distance from Borough market
A small boutique hotel with a beautiful decor especially the dining room with blue & crystal chandeliers.

Worth a stay for the location alone& the staff were excellent throughout",4,2024,07,09
118,Perfect location and best place to stay in London,"I recently stayed at The Lalit London and had an exceptional experience.

The Lalit will definitely be my priority for future visits to London. Highly recommended!",5,2024,07,09

The building is beautiful and the position is excellent. Do yourself a favour and have dinner in-house the food is exceptional.",5,2024,07,08

118,Will be back soon,"Capital hotel, very nice structured and located, incredible atmosphere (always peaceful and relaxing) and most of all excellent staff. Big thanks to Abdul for the exceptional service and understanding. This place is totally a hidden gem in London, mostly because of the people they have here.",5,2024,07,06

118,LaLiT is one of London's best hotels,"An exceptional hotel in every way.
We were warmly greeted on arrival and throughout our stay and the service was excellent.
Our room was beautifully furnished, spacious and the bed was so comfortable.
The coffee capsule machine, complementary drinks, biscuits & crisps were a nice touch.
The hotel as a whole is incredible.
A wonderful mix of British and Indian decor.
We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,07,01
118,Wonderful,"Wonderful location
Wonderful staff 
Wonderful building
Wonderful heated toilet seats !!!
As soon as we arrived were made to feel very welcome perfectly clean and the internal decor was contemporary modern but still hailed to its Indian Origin. Will definitely be back thank you",5,2024,06,30
118,Fantastic,"Fantastic small luxury hotel. Staff very friendly and helpful. Room was spacious, clean and fully stocked with snacks .  The Dining room and  bar were lovely. Almost felt like something from Harry Potter!!!  I loved the quaintness of this place and wonderful location near tower bridge.  Will be back",5,2024,06,30

118,Definitely recommend for a relaxed and comfortable place near Tower Bridge ,"Wonderful and spacious room, great soundproofing on the room which is important for Central London and the staff are all very polite and efficient. 

Also contrary to what others said, there was absolutely someone to help us with our bags as we got out of the cab. 

They also left us a cake as they knew we had just got married. Great touch. ",5,2024,06,29
118,"Kind staff, clean rooms, great service!","Excellent stay, kind staff and great location. Walking distance to Underground with a station serving many areas of London. Attentive staff, quick to respond and made us feel welcomed. We  will be back in the future and would definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2024,06,29
118,"Beautiful hotel , great area","I have stayed here a number of times and highly recommend it. It is a beautiful hotel in an excellent part of London that gives you access to major attractions but also neighbourhood gems. Tower bridge is within a short walk as is London bridge and the Tower of London. Borough market is very close with a number of great restaurants like Wright Bros that I highly recommend. Also within a short walk is Bermondsey with great shops and restaurants like Jose for tapas and the Garrison Gastropub for high end pub fare.
The hotel has hardwood floors, beautiful furnishings and serves excellent food in a lovely space both indoors and out. The service is not spot on but after a few stays it becomes part of its charm. It‚Äôs a unique property in a world of cookie cutter hotels.",5,2024,06,28
118,"Great location, otherwise a 4 star from us.","This is a pleasant hotel in a very good location. However it fell short of our expectations of a 5 star hotel in terms of the comfort and quality of the service. The hotel has a few steps to enter with no luggage ramp and no one to assist with our bags. No one offered to take our bags to our rooms. We found the furniture including the bed and pillows quite uncomfortable. The advertised spa is indefinitely closed. There was no iron or ironing board in our room, and the supplied amenities were basic. The price of the room and the restaurant was surprisingly high. All minor things but overall did not give the impression of a 5 star facility. Perfectly fine for a 4 star!",4,2024,06,28
118,Hidden Indian Gem in London,"Staff extremely helpful 
Amazing restaurant staff esp Siddarth exceptional service
Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable beds
Shower/bathroom amazing
Opposite Shard  beautiful 
Reminds me of a boutique hotel in Jaipur facilities 
Will visit again",5,2024,06,28
118,Best Hotel in London,"Best hotel in London and curry. Friendly and competent staff! Comfortable beds and airconditioning. Ultimately the best bathroom experience. Room service and gym with spa and good variety in room dining.
Well situated and walking distance to major attractions!",5,2024,06,24
118,Excellent stay at Lalit,"First class experience from arrival to check out. Staff were friendly, helpful and courteous at all times . Room was wonderful , bed very comfortable.

118,Simply wonderful,"We stayed in the LaLit Suite, the room was spacious and very comfortable. From the moment we arrived the staff was very attentive and helpful. From checking us in, taking care of our luggage, showing us the amenities of the room, checking us out and holding our luggage while we explore the city. Five stars from top to bottom here, would absolutely recommend!",5,2024,06,23
118,Wedding Anniversary Visit,"Absolutely fantastic hotel, excellent service and a great breakfast experience. The building has been sympathetically restored and the hotel gives a very personal service. Lovely touch with an anniversary cake!! Thoroughly recommend this hotel for a London stay.",5,2024,06,22
118,Luxurious stay,"Stay, food everything was top notch.
Would recommend to try Indian breakfast.
Rooms were very comfortable and the property is beautiful.
Twin tower is just walking and offers a breathtaking view. 
Loctation is awesome
Ahmad assisted us really well",5,2024,06,22
118,Quiet location perfectly positioned,"The location was perfect, 8 minutes from London Bridge stations. A couple of minutes to Tower Bridge and the Southbank, lovely for an evening stroll. We had a senior classroom a large room and very clean. Nice powerful shower. 
Indian restaurant attached to the hotel was excellent. Staff helpful and pleasant. Would certainly book again.",5,2024,06,21
118,Sweet Hotel with history,"We went to London for my birthday and chose The Lalit this time. We absolutely love London and always want to have a nice time in a very special hotel. We can definitely say The Lalit is a very special hotel. Its history that it was a school until the late 60s and was carefully rebuild as a hotel catcher us immediately. Very special and sweet rooms with high ceiling, nice bathrooms (a Japanese toilet) and a minibar for free which you can refill at any time, made our stay at The Lalit absolutely comfortable. The staff was so warming as well as always obliging. A few things made us wonder as we were not used to this for a 5 star hotel. We had to ask for smaller towels for like hand drying as well as for skincare usage. They said it was due to environmental care to generally not have them on the room, but for a 5 start hotel this should be standard in our  opinion ( despite the fact that the amenities in the shower are filled up though. Doesn‚Äôt make sense, does is?).
But all in all we absolutely loved it in The Lalit and would definitely come back again.",4,2024,06,19
118,Not a 5 star hotel,"Not sure how they got a 5-star hotel rating. No one to help you carry your bags up stairs at the entrance. The team is nice but not knowledgeable about the services (someone came to my room to check why my phone couldn‚Äôt connect to the TV only to find out the next day from a manager it isn‚Äôt possible).  Digital Do not disturb doesn‚Äôt connect to the phone.  Temperature doesn‚Äôt go below 19 degrees Celsius. Noisy room. Incorrect room service order.  Zero follow up from the hotel manager after speaking about my issues and sending an email to the general manager. Bed and pillows were fine, but not 5 star comfort. Only saving grace was the breakfast.",3,2024,06,17
118,Peaceful stay in great location,"Great hotel near the Tower Bridge. Room was spacious, staff was friendly. The hotel was a former school which makes for a really unique (in a good way) space. Hotel is convenient to dining, tube and businesses at Moore London Place. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2024,06,14
118,The best London hotel I‚Äôve stayed in!,"The hotel is beautiful, my room was spacious and bright. Everything was spotless, bed was comfortable - couldn‚Äôt ask for more really! Staff were all incredibly polite and welcoming. Would definitely stay here again. Breakfast made a lovely change to the usual, I had the masala omelette which was great.",5,2024,06,14
118,Absolutely wonderful hotel,"The hotel was lovely, the staff courteous and attentive. I really liked the electronic ""do not disturb"" and ""service room"". We didn't spend much time in our room as there was so much to see and do within walking distance of the hotel. And even though it is a main thoroughfare it wasn't at all noisy or disruptive.",5,2024,06,12
118,Lovely stay at LaLit London,"Fantastic hotel that exceeded expectations. From check-in till checkout, the restaurant, & all the staff were helpful and attentive. The location is top notch, close to a major rail station if you need to get anywhere and in the midst of a active and safe neighborhood. The rooms were lush and well appointed. Probably the best bathroom I ever experienced. Would definitely stay again, and I highly recommend. The restaurant served a fantastic meal as well.",5,2024,06,11
118,Amazing Stay,"It was a great experience! The rooms were really nice and pleasant. The Staff was excellent and very helpful! You truly get the Indian feel throughout the hotel which is incredible. Top that up with the Indian breakfast in the morning along with the heavy English breakfast. It‚Äôs indeed one of the best boutique hotels in London. 
Thank you!",5,2024,06,10
118,A pleasant and wonderful stay,"Great location, good service and beautiful hotel. Loved the stay. Very helpful staff and a it was nice with the minibar that was free and refillable. The bed was soft and amenities was good as well. I will recommend this hotel for friends and family. Walking distance to Tower Bridge and a variety of restaurants",5,2024,06,10
118,Great little hotel in the heart of London,"A lovely hotel with great history. Found the pillows a little too easily flattened but a minor thing.
The Indian breakfast was lovely and different experience.
It is well positioned with great bars and restaurants near by. Summer in the capital is always exciting with lots of free festivals locally.",5,2024,06,09
118,Fantastic,"Myself and my wife stayed here for a weekend and absolutely loved the hotel. We stayed in a senior classroom which was absolutely perfect, lovely sized and came with many complimentary additions (the toilet seat is amazing). The hotel was spotless and hospitality superb. Each member of staff were very accommodating and welcoming, and you had the sense they would do anything for their guests. The hotel building is beautiful and although we didn‚Äôt try the food on this occasion, it smelt delightful. The hotel is near to Tower Bridge, London Bridge and location is perfect for accessing nearby tube stations. I was very surprised at the cost of this hotel, sensational value for money is a perfect location. We will visit again.",5,2024,06,04
118,Our Anniversary away,"Great hotel with Indian theme, restaurant serves some of the best Indian dishes ever tasted . Rooms very comfortable with hi-tech loos will leave your bottom fresh and clean. All room drinks and snacks are complimentary and will be replenished whenever needed. The location is perfect for local attractions and fine dining, the Ivy Tower Bridge is only 5mins away and many other cocktail bars and restaurants also nearby with views of the Thames. Only minor recommendation is the very nice bar needs to serve bar snacks with the drinks (but you could bring the free crisps down from your room). Overall 5stars",5,2024,06,02
118,Excellent!,"Excellent hotel! Extremely friendly staff and beautiful decor. The hotel lounge was very quiet and cozy, the hotel food was varied and has great flavor.  The rooms were very nice and clean. Close to the center of many popular spots for tourists and just casual visits. Very recommended!",5,2024,06,01
118,A calm and unusual hotel in central London ,"We stayed for a long weekend in late May. We had the junior suite on the 3rd floor. Great size and view of the shard. A small gripe that the room was quite hot when the weather was warm and the Aircon was weak. The bathroom was a good size, no hand towels for some reason, but everything else provided - even a heated toilet seat! I liked the complimentary mini bar.
The breakfast was good, we ate a la carte and it was refreshing to have something different in the Indian breakfast menu in a beautiful setting.
Well located for restaurants on Bermondsey st, tower bridge, and London bridge station.
Staff were all lovely too.",5,2024,06,01
118,Highly recommended,We enjoyed a fabulous stay at this beautiful hotel. All the staff were welcoming and friendly and we received excellent service. Our room was beautiful and spotlessly clean. The building - a converted grammar school - was architecturally fascinating. We would happily return here to stay.,5,2024,05,29
118,Excellent hotel,"Excellent.  Clean and comfortable room. We were in the Tower suite, which was spacious. Delicious food and good bar. Good service and close to major areas of London. Building was historic and interesting as well.
Overall a 10/10 stay for all of the family !",5,2024,05,29
118,Thank you for looking after us,"For the 2nd year in succession we stayed at LaLit for the weekend of Ride London.  It's location is great, being on the finish line and the hotel were very accommodating throughout our stay of two nights.  We had a Senior Classroom in this lovely hotel and were able to park right outside the front door and store my bike safely over the two nights.  We've stayed here now on a number of occasions as the hotel is very well situated being directly on Tower Bridge.  Thank you for looking after us so well, it's really appreciated.  See you next year!",5,2024,05,27
118,Very disappointing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,"Very disappointing for a 5 star hotel. Lovely location next to Tower Bridge. 2 night stay over the bank holiday weekend. 
On arrival the room was hot - sunny day and no windows to open. The air conditioning was set at 19 but not working. Maintenance had to reset this and it took a long time for the room to cool down. The television didn‚Äôt work and this was the case until the morning we left in spite of 2 maintenance interventions. There was no decaf coffee available with breakfast nor in the room. Apparently if you want hand towels you have to request these!!!!!
There is no turn down service in the evening not offer to refresh towels that might have been used - haven‚Äôt stayed in a 5 star hotel that didn‚Äôt provide these services before!!!!!

The gym was OK but needs more free weights (max 10kg). Breakfast was good (except the decaf coffee). Staff were friendly and the lunch we had with friends was good. Some of the staff spoke poor English so hard to communicate with them about your requirements.

Although the room was lovely and the location good these details let the hotel down hugely and it would be very hard to recommend them on this basis. 

All of this was reported during the stay and on departure and nothing was done.",2,2024,05,27
118,Staff were a delight!,"Excellent staff, nothing to much trouble. Went way out of their way for us at every opportunity. Give them a pay rise! Rooms very comfortable. Heated toilet seat was a superb addition. 
Location perfect for the ride 100 race. 
Highly recommend the place",5,2024,05,27

118,The perfect safe haven for a business trip,"When I'm on business travels I need a place to feel comfortable and where I can relax. This is the place in London for me!

The hotel is small, very luxurious, super attentive staff and management, delicious Indian food, elegant and spacy rooms. I will be back!",5,2024,05,20
118,Perfectly located cosy hotel,"Very nice and cosy hotel. The staff is really helpful in acommodating all your needs anf giving you tipps for your stay.

118,Literally a failed small luxury hotel,"A beautiful property run was untrained professionals, first things first the location is a plus since its proximity to the tower bridge, the rooms sizes are good, now lets comes to the minus which is a long list
1. No bellman at the gate of a 5 star hotel had to carry my own bags to the reception
2. The reception staff is untrained, lost staff who hardly open their mouth or greet guest 
3. The WiFi in the room for a luxury hotel does not work at the bed or living area, when complained to the staff was asked to move to a smaller room which I refused, bought my own data plan to survive 4 nights in the hotel 
4. Tv is just basic no internet connectivity & movies available can be viewed upon payment 
5 the last & the worst part of the hotel is the breakfast staff, shabby looking no greetings, mixing upon orders & food options are limited 
Honestly have stayed in better hotels with excellent services rated 4 star
I hope the management takes some time to train their staff about basic manners 
Also don‚Äôt expect to the treated well if you are an INDIAN",2,2024,05,18
118,Short break to London,"Excellent hotel. Staff very friendly throughout. Indian food at breakfast and evening was always superb

Also the location was perfect for us.",5,2024,05,14

118,Mixed experience for us unfortunately,"Gorgeous entrance, smells amazing, lovely welcome, staff helpful, decor stunning. Great location. Room large for London. Bathroom & bedroom nice & clean. Restaurant decor stunning. 
Things that need to be improved to give the best experience. 
We didn‚Äôt have aircon working in our room so slept in 25deg in May.  Tried everything so it either didn‚Äôt work or was overly complicated. 
What is it with the heated toilet seat! Yuck & couldn‚Äôt turn it off.
Came back to hotel about 10.40pm for a night cap to experience the lovely bar. It had shut - Saturday night in a capital city!  We were told we had a mini bar in our room. Mini bar had coke, sprite, Fanta & water. Not quite what we had in mind!  This was my husband‚Äôs birthday weekend. 
Went out for breakfast the next day at Hays Galleriea for Thames views. Came back to find we had been locked out of our corridor & room with all our belongings in there, even though we were no where near check out time. 
Just a catalogue of things that put us off. Shame really as everything else make it a gem.",3,2024,05,06
118,Posh And Peaceful,"When I was in London last month, I stayed at The LaLiT London hotel and I can say it is the poshest place I have ever stayed at. The room that I had booked was so well designed with comfy beds, world class amenities, a fancy bathroom with all the bells and whistles, and even a lovely view of Big Ben. Plus, it was super clean, which is always a win in my book. Talking about the food, it was really good. I didn't have a bad meal the entire time I was there. The breakfast buffet was really great - everything from pastries to full English fry-up.¬† The Indian restaurant Baluchi was good too and enjoyed having delicious curries there. The best thing is that it is located close to Tower Bridge and all the cool sights. But somehow, it still felt peaceful, which was nice after a long day of sightseeing. The staff was very helpful. They even helped me get reservations at a restaurant that was totally booked solid. In my opinion, it is the best 5-star hotel in London, where one can enjoy a super comfortable and luxurious stay.",5,2024,05,06
118,It is LiT,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at The LaLiT in London, and it exceeded all my expectations. From the moment I stepped into the elegant lobby, I knew I was in for a treat. The check-in check-out process were seamless, thanks to the attentive and friendly staff.

118,DISAPPOINTED!!,"What a letdown! This place claims to be a 5-star establishment, but it certainly doesn't live up to that standard. The water in the drawer was appalling, there was scum in the bathroom sink, and the iron was broken. It's baffling how these companies can get away with offering such low-quality amenities. The staff appeared indifferent, though they put on a fa√ßade of caring.",1,2024,04,28

The staff are really friendly, the architecture of the listed old school building is amazing and the food in the restaurant ‚ÄúBaluchi‚Äù had the most amazing taste.  We all really loved our stay.  The rooms are well decorated, clean and nicely equipped.  It‚Äôs a nice touch that everything in the bedroom is complimentary (no hidden mini bar charges!).  We had drinks after dinner in the bar and in the old headmasters room, which I highly recommend.  The ornate plasterwork ceiling is something to behold!",5,2024,04,19
118,Beautiful building great staff and delightful touches,Superb ambiance and accommodation - staff were beyond helpful and the location was superb.

If you are planning your own celebration or want to surprise someone else, you won‚Äôt do better than The Lalit London.

We would like to say a special thank you to Baaz and Binh, along with the concierge as they did such a wonderful job in treating us during our stay and even arranged a surprise for the anniversary.",5,2024,04,14

The Duty Manager Chi helped us with anything we needed.,5,2024,04,12
118,Afternoon Tea Indian Style!,"We booked afternoon tea for 4 of us for a leaving lunch for a team member.  The experience was very enjoyable as the venue is very classy (it is an old school!) - the tea was in the old school hall which has been beautifully renovated with the original parquet flooring and some indian style additions such as the huge blue chandeliers which tastefully complement the original features.
The service was exceptional and we were given an insight into the building and the menu.  The drinks that came with the tea were really different and delicious - Masala Chai which was milky sweet but with a spicy punch, and Gulabi Lassi which had a rose petal flavour - these were topped up frequently.
The food was a twist on an English afternoon tea with a samosa, a mini burger which was actually bright green with paneer cheese, a spicy rice dish and some traditional indian treats - I was actually quite full from the first of three layers of goodies.  The top layer was a selection of mini indian deserts.  As with any afternoon tea, the food was quite carbohydrate heavy and none of us managed to finish everything but we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.
Oh and the pi√®ce de r√©sistance was discovering the heated toilet seat when I visited the loo!",5,2024,04,12
118,Our second visit: lovely hotel!,"Lovely hotel in a great part of London for sightseeing. The building is a former school beautifully restored. This was our second visit to the Lalit and just as good as the first time.  Bedrooms are large and comfortable and we were delighted that we could see the Shard from our room. 
The hotel has excellent access to Tower Bridge and the Thames riverside, literally just minutes away.
My favourite parts of the hotel were the headmaster's study, now a comfortable  bar and the magnificent dining room- in former times the Assembly Hall.",5,2024,04,12
118,"If you need anything, just ask reception","We had an excellent stay at a converted Indian Hotel which was a grammar school. The building was lovely and historic.

118,Excellent experience at The La Lit London,"I‚Äôm lucky enough to have stayed in a number of 5 star hotels both in London and other countries and have had one of the most impressive experiences here at La Lit London. 

The welcome from the staff at check in was superb - very professional balanced with warmth and genuine friendliness. 

This continued throughout where nothing was too much trouble and delivered with a smile and sense of humour. 

Hotel is set in a converted old school so has character - and style - and the room was contemporary, stylish, a good size and well furnished. It felt truly luxurious even with a heated toilet seat and jet wash facility. 

Ability to open the windows was a welcome bonus to get real fresh air. Complimentary mini bar was great as was the coffee!

The restaurant was in the old chapel and was spectacular space. The bar is also interesting, set I the old library. 

Location superb - 5 mins walk from tower bridge and 10 mins walk from London Bridge station & tube. 10-15 mins to some great Bermondsey pubs & restaurants. 
Despite the very handy & central location, the road and rooms were quiet at all times. 

Fantastic experience.",5,2024,04,10
118,5 star stay,Excellent room and service. Wonderful hotel with great services and staff very helpful. Excellent location for London bridge station and tower bridge attractions and local amenities. A visit to the Shard is recommended and only a short walk away.,5,2024,04,10

Great to stay somewhere a bit different with each room being part of a converted classroom and so all unique. 
It is owned and managed by the Indian Lalit hotels and provides high quality Indian cuisine in the restaurant. 
They will provide both English or Indian dishes for breakfast which is again good quality and a good way to try some excellent Indian dishes.

It will certainly be somewhere we will go back to when next in London",5,2024,04,09
118,Amazing stay in London,"The Lalit surpassed all our expectations. The staff were very pleasant at check-in and very helpful. 
The rooms were beautiful. All of them are equipped with Toto toilets. The towels were thick and luscious. There was tea and coffee in the room with complimentary snacks. We had a birthday we were celebrating and they surprised us with a beautiful chocolate cake in the room. 
The breakfast was beyond all expectations we felt like we were in India having a full south Indian breakfast. All the staff were super friendly. Multiple people came up to our table and asked us if we were doing okay. The sales manager made a special effort to come and say hi to us, and then showed us around the facility. All in all very pleasant experience and totally made our stay in London that much more  special",5,2024,04,08

We had a large, luxurious room, extremely comfortable bed, great facilities.

Staff were all very pleasant and helpful.
We had delicious cocktails in the headmasters room.

We didn‚Äôt eat in the restaurant as we already had our meals planned - however it looked amazing and I don‚Äôt doubt the food and service would have been excellent.

We hope to stay again - if only to experience a meal in the restaurant!",5,2024,04,08

On the negative side, the room had a slight smell though nothing too unpleasant and the aircon was slightly noisy in the night.",4,2024,04,03
118,Great experience,"Everything was great from customer service, cleanliness and the quality of everything üëç

Easy walking distance from London Bridge underground and train station.  Would book here again.",5,2024,03,31
118,"Wouldn't stay anywhere else, perfect","What can I say, what an amazing hotel, the best I've stayed in!
The bed was just so comfortable, I always toss and turn but for 2 nights I've slept all the way through and not moved once!

The shower was beautiful, lots of water settings, big fluffy towels, flannels provided, bathrobes, bigger than usual toiletries, and a proper fancy toilet!! 
Heated seat, 2 wash features, I want one!!

Stocked fridge of water and fizzy pop, all free.

We didn't eat at the hotel but the staff were so nice, when we went out we asked if we could have some more bottles of water in our room, we only asked for water, but when we came back to our room, they had restocked the whole fridge, gave us fresh towels (we had only used ours once) turned over our bed cover for night time, turned on our bedside lights, closed the curtains and folded our nightwear, folded neatly and placed on our pillows. 

There's no cards for do not disturb or clean my room, , its all electronic, press the button inside the room and it displays outside. 

The location was spot on, right near everything.

If I could pick a slight disappointment and i mean slight, it would be the view from our room, we were overlooked from a restaurant opposite and balconies from next door, BUT, this wouldn't stop me staying in this room again, we were only there to sleep so the view wasn't important.

 Thank you to the people who cleaned our room and provided the extra touches and thank you to the staff on reception, very polite, attentive and happy in their work, made a huge difference to us as customers having people smile and make us feel welcome.

I wouldn't stop anywhere else now in London, 100% perfect üëå",5,2024,03,30
118,Thoroughly recommend!,"Beautiful old building in a great location near Borough Market and Tower Bridge. All the staff were friendly and efficient.

Thoroughly recommend!",5,2024,03,29
118,Gem of a hotel,"A gem of a hotel. The staff is incredibly helpful: whatever you wish, they try to fulfill. The room is huge and the beds are very comfortable. Air-conditioning is working great. London Bridge Station is nearby, so you can reach every destination quite quickly.",5,2024,03,29
118,comfort and luxury stay at Lalit,"On our trip to London we booked our stay at The LaLiT and it was a right treat. Though London has many good hotels, this one was different. It is fancy for sure, but also ensures comfort and luxury ‚Äì perfect for tourists. Its location is also just perfect for the travellers, since it is located in the heart of the city and sightseeing the top tourist attractions becomes easy. Another thing I liked about the hotel was their Spa facility. It is the best spa I've ever experienced.  It's called Rejuve and let me tell you, it lives up to the name. Their massages will melt away your jet lag (or all that afternoon tea), Ayurvedic treatments will leave you feeling refreshed and they have a whole menu of pampering options. I would say that it is the best spa hotel in London if you're a spa fanatic or just need a little pampering on your trip to the city.",5,2024,03,28
118,Would definitely come again!,"Excellent service, cleanliness, look and feel. The staff were very professional and attentive. Can‚Äôt beat the views and location! Minor improvements that would‚Äôve made our stay even better: easier to operate thermostat and a more comfortable bed. It felt a bit like a spring mattress.",4,2024,03,28
118,A rare treat,"We chose this boutique styled hotel for its ideal location close to the Bridge Theatre, where we went to see Guys and Dolls -  a beautifully converted former grammar school, very comfortable Junior Classroom bedroom and a warm welcome from all in the team. They delivered a delicious chocolate birthday cake - and also rang the room to check that all was well and to offer umbrellas as it was pouring with rain outside. It is recognised as a small luxury hotel of the world - which is reflected in the price but earned through the comfort, level of service and attention to detail.",5,2024,03,27
118,Short but impressed,"Only short stay for business. The service here is exceptional. A female receptionist assisted me with checkout this morning, giving me genuine warmth from her friendly morning greeting to the quick handling of the process. She also offered me assistance with my luggage even though she looks so tiny. I can‚Äôt let her do that but highly appreciated.",5,2024,03,27
118,Fantastic hotel,"Amazing hotel. We made a weekend of London after coming down to see Peter Kay at the O2 (he was fantastic). The hotel is absolutely gorgeous (the great hall especially) and the staff are so friendly and helpful. The rooms were beautifully decorated and comfortable. Lovely to have complimentary soft drinks/water in the fridge. A special mention to Ishwar who took care of us at breakfast who was really helpful, especially in helping my partner decide what to choose from the Indian breakfast selection. Overall a brilliant hotel and well worth the stay.",5,2024,03,25
118,Very good south of river London hptel,"Have been before and returned cause we like it. Fantastic big firm comfortable bed, very nice attentive customer service.

118,Decadent and Sumptuous,"I have stayed here 3 times now, when working nearby. I am usually exhausted when I arrive but booking in is so easy and friendly that I instantly feel revived. When the concierge is around he helps with my case, whisking it up to my room, and when he wasn‚Äôt, the staff took me up personally to my room. The lovely old fashioned looking rooms generally feel decadent and sumptuous with so many free nibbles and toiletries. And as for the heated toilet seat: need I say more‚Ä¶.!",5,2024,03,22

118,Outstanding service and food !,I revisited Baluchi again with my friends this time just after Christmas 2023 and it was an amazing experience ! I had talked to my friends about the food at the Baluchi and Chef Jomon‚Äôs amazing service. It was an experience in itself. The food was lovely .. the starters were masterpieces. All of us loved the food. But the icing on the cake was the experience that was personally provided to us by Chef Jomon..  the passionate stories behind every dish .. It was classic! Would go back again !,5,2024,03,19

118,Unforgettable late anniversary,"We stayed here for one night and felt more welcomed than any previous experience. 

Abdul and Minh greeted us on check in and asked about our stay. We mentioned we had a concert and this was a late anniversary trip. Later, a cake was delivered to our room with a hand written card that congratulated us on our late anniversary! This was so thoughtful of the team, it made our stay unforgettable.

Then when checking out, Abdul, Minh, and Chi were extremely attentive and a pleasure to deal with in the morning.

118,Quiet luxury at LaLit,"The LaLit has been incredible! Our friend made reservations in the shard, so we wanted to be closeby and also not spend an arm and a leg.

Your hands are truly blessed. 
Thank you to the whole team, all the staff were so welcoming and excellent,  special thanks to Athul for your hospitality.",5,2024,02,27
118,Difficult to get a good nights sleep,"The hotel is beautiful, dinner was amazing however our stay was ruined by being woken at 3am by people in the floor above partying. The noise, including music, footsteps and seemingly furniture moving carried on until 6.30am. We complained to reception staff in the morning. One said they had been to the offending room 3 times but the music kept being turned back up. If I had been running the hotel these people  would have been thrown out so one wonders who these guests were? Awaiting response from the manager to our email complaint but just wanted to advise anyone wanting a good nights sleep that this may not be forthcoming.",2,2024,02,27
118,Lovely stay,"Lovely hotel, beautifully converted Victorian building. Staff were absolutely lovely. Indian breakfast was tasty and a first for me. Complimentary mini bar (soft drinks) a nice touch. 
I would have preferred to try a larger room,, but the hotel was full, so booked the largest available. Steps away from Tower Bridge, which is stunning at night",5,2024,02,25
118,Not great wouldn't come again.,"My wife got me the jr suite for my birthday weekend.

First of all my wife sent an email three weeks in advance to the hotel to say please can you do some kind of decco to the room as it's my husbands bday. The email was not acknowledged. 

Check in didn't really feel like a grand welcome. Just mundane.

Walked in the room although very clean was small.

The tv remote didn't work.

When our room was cleaned no water bottles were replaced so I called to ask for two water bottles half an hour later no one turned up so had to call again. Then two people turned up. Lack of communication.

Someone randomly just knocking on our door.

The sink in the bathroom is tiny and uncomfortable.I just didn't find this a great hotel well, especially not 5*. I would not reccomend or will not be coming back.

",2,2024,02,19
118,Dining experience,We arranged a tasting menu for a newly married couple yesterday. I left everything with the chef. He coordinated it really well and it was one of the finest dining experience they ever had. The hospitality was out of the blue. Chef Jomon - you are truly an amazing person and a really nice human being. The way you treat each customer is very special. Wishing you all the very best.,5,2024,02,18
118,A luxurious mini break.,"The hotel was quietly elegant. Although right in the heart of bustling London it was quiet and peaceful once you walked through the entrance. They have managed to retain so many original features of the building and there are little nods to this throughout from the ‚Äòheadmasters‚Äô room to the bedrooms or ‚Äòclassrooms‚Äô. As it is not a square built building all the rooms are characterful with odd shaped rooms and high vaulted ceilings in the bedrooms.
Once you step outside you are right on the doorstep of Tower Bridge one side and The Shard on the other. 
The staff were all attentive and nothing feels like too much trouble for them.",5,2024,02,18
118,Chef Jomon - the king of creativity and hospitality,"We went to the Baluchi restaurant. It was  an unparalleled experience. Incredibly attentive staff. Chef Jomon is actually a masterchef. The food was excellent and nostalgic. Incredible flavours, lovely cosy atmosphere and loved the passion with which the chef explained all the meals. He is so innovative with the dishes yet makes sure to never lose the authencity. Karahi scallops, allepy chicken curry, garlic nan, coconut rice are the few of the must try dishes. Sandlewood chicken is another gem. The presentation was impeccable. Will definitely go back.",5,2024,02,18
118,Pleasant stay,"Very nice place. Very nice food, lots of options. I enjoyed my stay here. If you like Indian food, this is a place to stay.
The location is also good for travellers as it is a 5 min walk to London bridge station which connects to all the best places of London.

118,An Indian twist on a classic üç∏üç∏,"I can't believe we hadn't stayed here before. What ambience! What style!  We stayed two nights, although we'd only planned to stay for one. We had both a Junior Classroom (huge room) and a Cosy Classroom (still spacious). The breakfast caters to all tastes: we had the Indian option, which was a nice change. Everything we ate and drank was superb. Cocktails also great.",5,2024,02,17
118,Great for a romantic getaway.,The Hotel has a fantastic location with a great view of the shard and only just down from London Bridge station. The staff were beyond helpful and the building itself was gorgeous. Myself and my Girlfriend stayed in one of the suites and the room was fantastic with a high ceiling and beautiful bathroom. I can't think of a single thing I would change and I hope to stay here again soon.,5,2024,02,16
118,Fantastic,"Fantastic stay at LaLit, highly recommended. Service was first class and my room was excellent - bed nice and firm, shower lovely and the room was immaculate. Dinner at Baluchi was excellent also, as was the Indian breakfast in the morning!",5,2024,02,11
118,Fabulous Fabrice !,"The uber fab bits:

Fabrice the concierge. He‚Äôs a real credit. He really is. So happy to please / went above and beyond for us. He‚Äôs a real draw to the hotel. 

The good bits:

Cosy room for one is great value. 
Free mini bar and snacks. 
Pillow options. 
Heated loo. 
Check in was friendly and seamless. 
Nice cosy bar area (often lacks in other hotels)
Good quality breakfast with decent options. 
Chilled / quiet dining / breakfast room. 
Proximity to tube. 
Decent restaurants nearby including the Shard. 

Average bits:

Bar understaffed and had to wait too long for a bottle of fizz. Lone barman serving those in bar but also who were dining in the restaurant. Not his fault but a tad frustrating. 

Lots / too many breakfast staff who were not clearing plates from tables / they were chatting amongst themselves a lot of the time. We were in no rush but again a tad frustrating. 

Full english was lukewarm but tasty nonetheless. 

Shower room was so small there was standing room only for 1 person. Not even enough room to bend over and the shower cubicle leaked and flooded bathroom floor. Probably needs seeing to.

Would I stay again ? 

Certainly. In fact going to rebook for September.",4,2024,02,11
118,A great stay,The price was very reasonable. The staff were friendly and attentive. There is plenty of parking outside. The room was impeccably clean and the mini bar and coffee machine was a lovely touch. Would stay again and recommend to a friend who wanted to visit London.,5,2024,02,11
118,Excellent service,"The hotel is beautifully decorated and Fabrice the concierge is an absolute LEGEND- he went absolutely above and beyond to get us a reservation at a restaurant nearby.
The cosy room was lovely with a complimentary minibar with snacks etc and the bathroom was also great with robes etc 
There is also a heated toilet seat which was flipping marvellous!
We had drinks in the bar which were good and breakfast which was also good.
Would def stay again- mainly for the fabulous Fabrice :-)",5,2024,02,10
118,Luxury all round- on site parking and beautiful decor and service,"Beautiful hotel. Lovely rooms with nice features like snacks in the room.

AMAZING bathroom- very luxury and the shower is so huge.

Ideal location 10 minute walk from borough market and on site parking was great. You do pay extra but worth it for the convenance of parking right outside the door of the hotel",5,2024,02,07
118,Review for the restaurant,"Gayatri at the restaurant was amazing. She was very helpful and helped us clarify questions related to bill and served with a beautiful smile. Thank you gayathri. 
The restaurant food was good. We ordered Indian food - daal and roti. The flavors were good.",5,2024,02,06
118,Perfect getaway in a boutique hotel,"This was our first visit to The LaLit London and we were blown away. The service from the moment we approached outside until the minute we left was outstanding. The staff were fantastic- very welcoming, cheerful and helpful. We received a free room upgrade to a suite which was amazing!! All the mod cons you could want, free mini bar and stacks of space (which for a London hotel is rare!!) Breakfast was also really good with a choice between full English, Indian breakfast and then buffet continental with the usual pastries, meats, cheese, fruit, cereal etc. 
I honestly could not find a single fault with anything at all and will 100% be returning in the future. Perfect little getaway!",5,2024,02,04
118,Expensive disappointment,"Booked a 'suite' in fact it was just a large room.  Expected a sofa or easy chairs, instead got an upholstered 'bench' at the end of the bed about 5 feet from the large wall TV Very high ceiling had roof lights (windows) with no way of covering, so as it was a bright moonlit night the room could not be made dark Worst of all I put a request for car parking and was pleased to receive an email from the hotel confirming there would be no charge. On check in we were told there would be a ¬£40 charge! After some discussion I was told that the 'no charge' referred to our advice as requested on Booking.com for our anticipated time of arrival! The only 'special request' made was parking and the 'no charge' was on the email with subject Special Request"" They insisted on the payment which of course we had no way of refusing to pay as they automatically charge it to my card. The dinner food in the almost empty (4/5 other diners) very large dining hall was both expensive and of low quality. All in all an unhappy and expensive disappointment.

I posted this on Booking.com and the hotel responded purely to say that the car parking charge was stated on the Booking.com website!  This maybe true but the email advising the Hotel was 'pleased to say there would be no charge' was under the heading 'special request"" and the only request made was for 'parking'

Apparently the hotel is 'pleased today there is no charge' for advising expected time of arrival within the normal times advertised!   Make of that what you will.

The point being that I would neither recommend this hotel or ever stay there again.",1,2024,02,04
118,First choice in the Tower Bridge / London Bridge Area,"This is a wonderfully refurbished hotel where the service is outstanding and everywhere beautifully decorated and clean, including the Tower Suite where we stayed for one night.

118,"The Lalit, London - an Amazing Hotel in London a Stones Thow from the Square Mile","I found this hidden gem of a hotel quite by accident. I was looking to stay close to The Square Mile in the city of London. The price was very rasonable so I booked as it was a short stroll from London Bridge Station. The hotel was fantastic, with the staff so professional, attentive and friendly. But I was really blown away by the architecture of the restaurant and the quality of the rooms and hotel facilities. The food in the Indian restaurant was spectacular and breakfast carried Indian, British and Continental options and was delicious. 

I will definitely visit again the next time I am in London and look forward to meeting Sandeep, the Sales Manager, who was so charming and friendly.

Ronny",5,2024,01,30
118,Special Thanks to Devanshu,"It was a pleasant experience, we ordered Kadhi Pakora, Mango Mojito and Achari Paneer Tikka, taste was good. The staff was friendly and neat. Devanshu, one of the staff members, helped us throughout and he was generous and kind. He had a smile on his face all the time which was really welcoming. We could figure out, he was friendly with others as well, which we really liked.
All in all, he made this experience memorable for us.",4,2024,01,29
118,Wonderful Baluchi Experience,"The setting is tranquil and feels beautifully Indian. The service was impeccable and the food incredible!

118,Charming property - True boutique luxury hotel!,Fantastic service from KD and her team. We went for our marriage anniversary and KD effortlessly took care of flowers and room decorations and hand wrote a letter out for me onto a greeting card and even threw in complimentary cake and balloons and upgraded our room. The property is very charming and unique - it used to be a grammar school before and reminded me so much of the grammar school which I attended. The refurbishment of the property into a boutique luxury hotel has been meticulously carried out - especially the exquisite reception area. It was a special stay and we can't wait to go back again! Special mention to Fabrice the charming Concierge Manager who made the stay even more special with his French sophistication and humour.,5,2024,01,29

118,India's actual authentic food in London,I went to the Baluchi's for my birthday lunch and the food couldn't be any more perfect! Gaurav helped us to select the best Bhindi we've ever had! The service was amazing and warm and kudos to Gaurav for making us feel at home in London! The Palak paneer was out of this world! Definitely recommend both the dishes especially if you're a vegetarian.,5,2024,01,28

They made our evening so enjoyable and comfortable. The Indian cuisines were excellent and the service extremely efficient. I like the style of cooking and marvelous presentation.,5,2024,01,24
118,Chef‚Äôs special Sandalwood Chicken and a dokla-baaji starter,"Visiting Lalit for Chef‚Äôs special dishes at Baluchi has become our must do thing while visiting London. This time it was the Chef‚Äôs special Sandalwood Chicken starter that has dispersed our tastebuds with the aroma and finely crafted spices. The presentation and ambience is always exceptional at Baluchi, whether it be the coconut rice that combos with the Chef‚Äôs special Alleppey Chicken Curry or the Lamb Biriyani, the way the platter gets presented for you itself takes your appetite off to a satisfying spectrum. 

Chef Jomon surprised us with a complimentary starter which was not named in the menu, however the dish is remembered for its aftertaste and flavour over the name. After a round of wild guessing from us around the table the Chef revealed its ingredients which was quite astonishing, it was dokla crumbs with  chilly baaji in a sauce mixed with crunches of pomegranate. A truly lip-smacking retreat before a course meal, wish to see this in the menu sometime.",5,2024,01,23
118,Great stay with delicious breakfast,"This is a great place to spend a few nights. I will definitely be staying here again when I come back to London. I had just stayed in one of the Hilton‚Äôs a night before and what a difference there is. The Lalit is miles ahead in customer service. The reception staff were polite and welcoming, a far cry from the rudeness experienced a day before. The waiter staff at breakfast were courteous and checked in frequently. One staff member, Rehan, really went out of his way make breakfast special. I cannot recommend a stay here enough, and really wished I had just stayed here for three nights as opposed to splitting them between the Hilton and Lalit.",5,2024,01,23
118,An excellent place to visit to meet the taste,The only reason behind our visits has been to meet Chef Jomon and experience his menu‚Äôs. Such a joy to visit at any time and to host any family/ friends dine out. We will certainly visit back again üòç,5,2024,01,23
118,Stay at the Lalit London,"I absolutely loved my stay here. As a solo Indian traveller, the hotel made me feel

Ishwar is particular was extremely courteous and went out of his way to help in any way he could.",5,2024,01,22
118,Great hotel in a great place,Amazing hotel. Friendly and helpful staff and great breakfast. Rooms are gorgeous and the dinning hall is beyond words.

118,Great hotel,"The hotel was wonderful, staff were very helpful. The room was very nice. We had dinner here during our stay and Giayathri was great.would totally recommend this hotel , it has the personal touch which lacks in a lot of places.

What an amazing transformation from a old school to a beautifully decored hotel, 
We will return!!!",5,2024,01,17
118,Review,The food  was amazing and the drinks were great. We had Alappey Kozhi Curry and it did every justice to the authentic Indian taste. Great atmosphere and the staff were brilliant especially Gayathri who was quick and polite with her Service. Will always be coming back for more.,5,2024,01,16
118,5 star with unique character,Absolutely amazing and top notch service throughout. The room was super comfortable in all aspects. Would go again anytime.

We appreciate staying in a building with such history and unique design.,5,2024,01,16
118,Excellent hotel with exceptional service.,Excellent hotel.  We stayed in the Tower Suite which was lovely and spacious with extra large double bed and a heated toilet seat!  Breakfast was good.

We will definitely be returning.,5,2024,01,15
118,Brilliant Hotel,"Stayed at the LaLIT for a night the week before Christmas with my son.

Would definitely recommend a stay at the LaLIT.
We are looking to stay again soon.",5,2024,01,15
118,Amazing place,The service and food was excellent the accommodations were also good the room which was allocated was superb as it had a direct of view of central London and one of the most iconic signs of London which is the shard was clearly visible from my room this spectacle in itself was amazing,5,2024,01,14
118,"Not a 5*, but still a very competitive option!","Whilst not a 5* - still a decent option!

Thank-you to the attentive staff during my stay for 1 night in early Jan 2024.

The room was very spacious and generally very clean (I had noticed some complaints in other reviews, but I found it to be okay). Also appreciated the upgrade from Junior to Senior room which had some snacks and free drinks in the mini-frudge.
Some of the room decor is in need of updating as it is showing signs of ageing. I didn't mind the hardwood floor in the rooms. 

I didn't have breakfast or any food during my stay, so can't comment on this. 

This hotel reminded me of previous Marriott stays but of a slightly higher class. In the London Bridge area, you can't complain for less than ¬£200 a night at business rate. ",4,2024,01,13
118,Favourite afternoon tea in London,"One of my favourite hidden gems in london. Incredible beautiful building and fantastic central location. Afternoon tea is absolutely incredible  and great service from Ishwar, friendly fast and professional. Will be back again soon!!!",5,2024,01,13
118,Excellent food and service,"Ishwar was our server in the restaurant, and he was absolutely incredible! Not only did he have a great understanding of the menu but also of the hotels history.

118,Baluchi,"Our restaurant experience was incredible. We have been in London for 5 days now and this was the best food we have had thus far. We had reservations at 7:15 and arrived at 6:55, to which they sat us efficiently without a wait.  The staff were exceptional and were attentive to all of our needs.",5,2024,01,11
118,Beautiful hotel.,"Wow what a find. Such a beautiful hotel. 
The owners have done a fantastic job. When it used to be a grammar  school for boys for 70 yrs.
We had the senior classroom lovely room. Very comfortable bed great night sleep.
We had breakfast lots of choice and the Indian breakfast was very popular. 
Our view was of the  shard from our window.
Great location. 

We will definitely be back.

",5,2024,01,07
118,Worst customer service ever. Avoid,"Hotel itself is fine but the customer service is terrible. We had a number of issues, but the main thing is the staff are inept, do not communicate with each other, promise things and then say that they did not and then the management get into a ping-pong about this all when you raise. ",1,2024,01,03
118,A little oasis‚Ä¶..love it ‚ù§Ô∏è,"This is a little oasis within easy reach of the hustle and bustle of Central London.  From the moment we arrived we were treated like family, welcomed with open arms. The hotel is well located, just 15 mins walk from London Bridge tube, with easy access to the sights of London; and Tower Bridge is so close. I loved the room - the vibe was one of calm and relaxation; the bed was super comfortable and there was no street noise = a brilliant night‚Äôs sleep üò¥üëç.  The free mini bar (bottled soft drinks) and snacks was a nice touch & much welcomed.  Too many hotels like to charge extortionate prices for using the mini bar!.  My only disappointment is I didn‚Äôt experience the restaurant - the feedback and reviews from others were so positive (& I love Indian food) - we simply ran out of time as we spent most of the day/ night elsewhere like Covent Garden, Theatreland etc.  I would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to friends & will hopefully return again in future. Well done to all, you have a winning formula üëèüëèüëèüëçüëç",5,2023,12,30
118,Great High Chai,"I took my family for the High Chai as a Christmas gift and it was one of the best presents I could get for them. The food is amazing, the room is gorgeous and the service was fantastic. Rehan, in particular, was very attentive and ensured that our plates were never empty! 

Highly recommend this High Chai as an alternative to to the traditional afternoon tea! :) ",5,2023,12,30
118,Beautiful Hotel and Welcoming Staff,"As soon as I walked into the hotel I was really impressed, it oozes class. There was a staff member who opened the door for me on my arrival and the reception staff were very welcoming. I arrived too early for my room so I was able to leave my baggage and on my return the bags had already been placed safely in my room - a real nice touch.

The quality of the finishings in the hotel seem to be of a high standard and the rooms around the hotel are linked back to the history of the building when it used to be a boarding school. 

After an hour of settling in my room, I received a call from the front desk to check if everything was ok with my room and if I had any questions. For me, this makes me feel very cared for and it‚Äôs the personal touch many hotels lose as they become more popular. I was surprised that the mini bar was included in my stay which contained 4 bottles of different types of soda and two bottles of water.

The attention to detail in the room was incredible too. For instance, the bathroom mirror was heated, the toilet was heated alongside a smart bidet built in, kettle and coffee maker with a huge selection of drinks and even honey built into a disposable spoon. The views from my room included the shard.

The location of the hotel is a small walk to London Bridge and local tube stations and plenty of things around to see.

Even though I didn‚Äôt have chance to try out their traditional Indian food, I will certainly do this on my next visit.

Thank you for making me feel welcome.",5,2023,12,28

She was very pleasant and made our day a memorable one with all pur adhoc requests. Overall a good experience. Just our two cent is the time when we entered and asked for a bigger table the manager was little rude as saying no - just could have avoided and could have told in a better way as we were celebrating two of our bdays. But could really say that it was gayathri who served us with a dazzling smile and lovely food,4,2023,12,06
118,Excellent hospitality,"Came back from my one week trip to London which became all the more memorable because of the accommodation I chose for my stay. I booked my stay at The Lalit London. Since the hotel is in the heart of the city, we planned to make our booking at this hotel. The classy interiors, elegantly designed rooms and the excellent hospitality here was impressive. The world class amenities in the room like the comfortable beds, wardrobe space, slippers, robes, spacious bathroom and filtered water made our stay really comfortable. The food was yum and the spa experience at Rejuve was commendable. In my opinion, The Lalit London is one of the best boutique hotels in London. ",5,2023,12,05

118,"Hotel beautiful, however staff lack warmth","The hotel itself is beautiful, however service wasn't great.  Didn't find the staff at reception friendly.  We stood in the reception area trying to work out taxis and the doorman was stood right next to us, but at no time did he offer any help.

Hotel is supposed to be five star, but certainly didn't have those qualities - dressing gowns available, but no slippers.  No handtowels (these are only available on request, which is odd).  Nowhere to hang your handtowels, shower gel not replenished, telephone didn't work.  It definitely lacked the little touches.  

On a positive, the bed was very comfortable.",3,2023,11,27
118,Lovely ‚ÄòHigh Chai‚Äô,"Really lovely High Chai here. Unlimited refills and a nice varied menu with lots of treats.

118,Loud: Poor sleep guaranteed,"Nice building and room but all this is EXTREMELY LOUD. We were unfortunate or the architect was drunk, but basically the bathroom of the neighbouring room seemed to be  located at the head of our our Bed .... So we could hear the shower doors opening and closing, the water and all ""other unpleasant"" sounds ablutions do carry ... Further the rooms was giving on an inner yard where trucks came for delivery early on in the morning and people talking in the yard could be heard up to the second floor. .   Never again. The staff esp. the ladies at the breakfast buffet were very kind and the concierge very helpful. The gym is located in the basement with not too much fresh air, and the treadmill was broken. Not so good. The Breakfast is worthless as you probably get better quality food, pastry as so in the next best cheap Novotel ... Anyhow ideally located, to find a better breakfast easily, nice staff but very poor return on investment if you pay for quality sleep. So in two words: Never again.",2,2023,11,12
118,Beautiful hotel great location,"Great hotel , lovely old building . The bathroom was equipped with amazing toilet hot flush and heated seat ! Comfy bed , no view , rather small room but was the cheapest. Great wardrobe and storage.

I would highly recommend this fabulous hotel and look forward to another stay at some point . 
Well done LaLit üëè",5,2023,11,06
118,Noisy. Simply not 5 star.,"The rooms in this hotel are subject to a lot of noise, so unless you are a deep sleeper, I would not consider staying here. The hotel is clean, the bathrooms are spacious (with amazing water pressure) and the staff are courteous and efficient. However, the rooms front directly on to pavements and delivery areas. We had to move rooms after the first night because an electric blind did not work and let in light from a nearby street light - no problem, this can happen (although in most hotels we‚Äôve stayed in this would have been mitigated with a gesture of goodwill or an apology). The maintenance person offered to swap us to a better room but we ended up in a smaller one, which was fine but not as promised. We were woken during the night in both rooms, the first by people directly outside of our street level window and the the second by multiple delivery vans unloading through the night in a courtyard. Terrible quality sleep. Also, when you close your hotel room door you at least expect corridor noise to be reduced to a bare minimum, whereas at this hotel you could hear everything - conversations, doors shutting, people walking by. There is a reason this hotel is reasonably priced for a so-called 5 star offering. We took a chance and got it wrong.",2,2023,11,06
118,We enjoyed the food which served by you and it's value for money. Thank you all for making us üòä happy.,"The product quality is consistently outstanding , I was completely impressed with your customer service üëè

I recommend the lalit restaurant to you all with my personal experience. ",5,2023,11,04

118,The Magical Millet Festival,"If you're looking for a unique and scrumptious place to enjoy the taste of India, the Lalit is a great choice. We came to the Millet Festival (running November 2023) and enjoyed a full 4-course millet meal - which comprises solely of an ancient grain family eaten widely across India known for its various health benefits. We loved the service of the staff, especially Meera who ensured we enjoyed a smooth experience for lunch. I also thank Chef Jomon for the delicious meals. Would definitely recommend dining during this month at the Lalit - please view the pictures.",5,2023,11,04

We will be back.",5,2023,11,04

It‚Äôs an easy walk along the Thames to lots of lovely eating houses, food markets, the globe, the Everyman cinema. The tube is close for high street shopping. Food here was lovely too. A special place to stay.",5,2023,11,02
118,Welcoming and attentive. Stunning place,"Very welcoming from Mustafa! Such a nice man.  I visited as this was my late Fathers School in the 1950‚Äôs and was an amazing experience to see so many original features such as floors, panelling, marble etc etc all remain.  After our (delicious) meal we sat in the ‚Äòheadmaster‚Äôs office‚Äô for a quiet drink.  Staff all very friendly and accommodating.  Thanks to all.",5,2023,10,31
118,Beautiful hotel near Tower Bridge,"Not only was this hotel stunning, in a great location, incredibly comfortable, but the staff was very helpful, especially when we were having problems with our key. We were upgraded from a junior classroom to one of the suites, and it did not disappoint. The bathroom was large, with a bidet, bath, shower, and robes. There was a desk and a table in an alcove. And I loved all the windows. Walking distance to Tower Bridge, highly recommend it. Wish we could have stayed longer. ",5,2023,10,30
118,Beautiful Hotel,"Lovely hotel with lovely staff, stayed for 1 night for husband birthday and had an early check in and a lovely birthday cake when I arrived which was a lovely surprise.  Rooms and Decor was beautiful, hotel was spotless, beds really comfy and room very spacious.  Do not hesitate to book this hotel in a great location about 10 mins walk from station and 5 mins from HMS Belfast which we visited whilst there.  

The breakfast was fabulous one of the best breakfasts I have had in a hotel.  I had a gluten free breakfast and they also gave me a GF muffin which was lovely.  The dining room is just amazing so beautiful with its high ceilings and chandeliers.

My only complaint is that they add a surcharge on your bar bill 12.5% drinks are very expensive ¬£15 a cocktail but it is London and they didn‚Äôt have the ingredients for my chosen cocktail so opted for another one which I wasn‚Äôt too fused on so was a bit gutted anyway ordered 2 cocktails and 2 beers which was ¬£47 which included ¬£5.60 tip annoyed with myself really as should have told the bar attender to remove it but paid it.  So just bear that in mind, I always tip but think since we went up the bar and all he did was bring our drinks to us it‚Äôs a bit cheeky.

However all in all we had a lovely stay and I would highly recommend this hotel, just maybe go over the road to the pub instead.",5,2023,10,29
118,elegant and customer focused,"An elegant , historic hotel 5 minutes away from Tower Bridge.
I had stayed in Lalit hotels in India and they were excellent and this is no different. A historic , majestic building with Indian touches, stylish large rooms and staff who are focused on customer care. I was impressed with the dining room, an excellent breakfast and my room was far bigger than everywhere i had stayed before for the price. I was particularly impressed that staff found my key that I had lost after cleaning the room. Thank you.",5,2023,10,28

118,Wonderful staff. Average food,"Excellent customer service. Staff were friendly and very attentive. Lovely ambience in the restaurant. Very clean. Nice touch by giving a free celebration dessert. 
Food was average. I was expecting it to be better (to be honest). It was over priced too. ",5,2023,10,27
118,Sexually harassed by receptionist. Do not visit,"Any positive comments about this hotel are completely void due to the experience I had at the lalit. Within 30 mins of entering my room the receptionist of front desk starting sending me sexual messages both breaking data protection and sexually harassing me. I told them to stop and warned them but as a result had to disappear out of the back door of the hotel to avoid any interaction. Never felt more uncomfortable in my life. Traumatic experience badly handled by the hotel which took weeks to even get back to me on. 

Book somewhere else if you value your own safety.",1,2023,10,27

Thank you again, Moses, for the effort you put in serving us.",5,2023,09,28
118,Not a five star experience!,"First of all the rooms are not very big. The bed is comfortable and everything was clean. However the amenities are few and it was not what we expected for a 5* hotel in London. The rooms are NOT soundproof. There was a wedding reception/party across the hall. The music was so loud in our room that we could not sleep until it ended. After multiple calls to front desk, we were told there was nothing they could do and they offered me ear plugs. Seriously?! Then in the morning they didn‚Äôt offer to make this right other than sayjng the party was booked a long time ago. Well we booked a month prior to our arrival too and we‚Äôre not treated with the same respect. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt feel it was a 5* experience nor was the room as nice as our expectations.",2,2023,09,24
118,Exceptional luxury in the heart of London,Exceptional comfort and service at the hotel. All snacks and amenities in the room were complimentary. The bar and dining experience was fab.

118,Wonderful staff-unique property,"Hands down, without a doubt, the kindest, most helpful hotel staff we have ever experienced at any hotel - home or abroad. If we ever get back to London we would definitely stay with them again. 
From our early check-in to our even earlier departure to the airport, everyone went out of their way to make sure we had what we needed and helped us whenever possible. 
The concierge assisted us when a half marathon disrupted transportation routes.  On more than one occasion the car service couldn‚Äôt find the entrance when coming to pick us up and one of the staff actually ran around the corner to get them. A couple minutes later the car shows up with the staff member in the passenger seat. He helped direct the driver. 
Late nights seeing the sights prevented us from sampling the dinner menu at the restaurant, but the breakfast (included) was delicious. 
Keep in mind this is a converted centuries old school. So if you‚Äôre looking for the whole modern style Hilton or other chain experience, this isn‚Äôt for you. I like looking for unique properties. And this fit the bill.",5,2023,09,05
118,Small and charming,"Great space fabulous, well managed and clean rooms. Common space we kept and the dining room is just gorgeous.

118,A memorable stay ,"The Lalit was recommended by family who have stayed a couple of times. I am pleased to say that their reputation as travel advisers remains untarnished! 

Although we have visited London many times over the years, this was the first time we had stayed south of the river. We had a lot planned and the hotel's proximity to London Bridge station made it an excellent base. 

Given it is situated in a busy part of the city, the hotel was quiet. The dining room is little short of spectacular with food and service to match at both breakfast and dinner. 

More often than not, what distinguishes the excellent from the good or mediocre in the hospitality sector, is the staff. We were very well looked after by everyone. However, a special mention must go to the god humoured and helpful Fabrice. ",5,2023,08,07
118,An elegant Gem - well worth a try! ,"A lovely hotel in a great location with friendly staff and great food. A beautiful fusion of old charm and modern comforts. 

Location -  Deceivingly tucked away in a quietish corner, you'd be surprised to find Tower Bridge just next to the hotel with an enjoyable 10-15 min. walkway along River Thames up to London Bridge & the Shard. Fantastic selection of restaurants all around - Thai, Indian, Greek, English, Italian - take your pick. The tube station just 10 min. walk away. Grocery stores down the road, if needed. 

Hotel decor & amenities - The LaLit has cleverly brought together the quintessential English charm of a century old Grammar school building with some modern luxuries and very smart decor. I loved the ethnic touches of wooden framed silken weaves, the traditional tall brass lamps, the broad stairwell with bright coloured carpet runners, the dark wooden panelling all around. Didn't get to enjoy the gorgeous Headmaster's and Teacher's Rooms - may be next time. The ethnic look is beautifully complimented by an Art Deco feel throughout this chic hotel. 

Food - We had dinner and breakfast at LaLit. Dinner was not only delicious but classily presented. A huge 'Well done' to the Executive Chef Jomon. It was great to see him chatting with the guests and hear about his passion for cooking. Breakfast, however could have been better. The South Indian dishes as well as European items that we tried did not match previous night's dinner standards. 

Staff - Friendly and professional. Some deserve a special shout out: 

= Fabrice (Concierge) - every hotel needs a Fabrice! He was cheerful, very professional, extremely polite and sophisticated, always on the go - helping guests with one thing or another. 
- Jomon (Head Chef) - smart, friendly and a brilliant cook (loved his dinner)
- Vignesh (Reception) - it was good to have a courteous, friendly and approachable contact at Reception, receptive to requests
- Meera (Dining hall) - extremely charming, warm and professionally obliging
- Jayathi (Reception) - was a good presence at the Reception with her cordial and pleasing approach 
- Hassan (Dining hall) - made sure our little toddler's needs were met and we were comfortable

Rooms - our room was very comfortable with a lovely pleasing decor. It was good to have a coffee machine, refreshing drinks in the fridge, snacks and decent toiletries. Being in a busy part of London, it's not reasonable to expect great views through the windows but we had the luxury of the lit-up Shard at night-time. We were pleasantly surprised to see a Birthday cake waiting in our room on check-in - thank you LaLit team! 

All in all, a great stay, will definitely recommend to the London visitors. ",4,2023,07,31
118,A beautiful gem,"This hotel is visually beautiful both inside and outside. Rooms very comfortable with excellent amenities. Bathroom essentials renewed daily. The only downside to our room was the window was very close to residential balconies so we had to keep curtains closed much of the time. There is a fridge and tea/ coffee snacks available in room and replenished if you ask at reception, these are free of charge. Rooms are cleaned when indicated to do so via a light at the door.  
Staff are very polite and helpful. The restaurant food is fantastic and the restaurant itself is visually beautiful. 
Loved this hotel. Also it is very close to visitor attractions such as Tower of London, tower bridge etc. There Is a lovely walk along the river and a boat taxi service as well as any of the bridges to take you over to the other side. ",5,2023,07,25
118,Not a 5 star experience ,The grounds and history of the facility are beautiful and amazing. The staff complained to us about being overworked and the vent literally above the head of our bed looked like it had never been cleaned. ,3,2023,07,20
118,Love the Lalit Hotel!!,One of the best hotels ever. The hotel is small and so beautiful. the service was unmatched and Shabba was  accommodating. Ishwar was also a great bar tender and very kind. My stay has been so perfect! ,5,2023,07,19
118,Anniversary Party at the LaLit,"We held an anniversary party at the Lalit London recently and had an exceptional experience. My interactions with the team from start to finish was outstanding - professional, pleasant and simply perfect. The team were always attentive, warm, friendly and accommodating.

My heart felt thanks on the day to Harshit, Mustafa and Moses. My sincerest gratitude to Sandeep and Chef Jomon who I worked with throughout to create our perfect family occasion.

I can‚Äôt recommend this venue highly enough. Our guests were full of compliments for the venue and most of all for the food. One guest even said it was the best good he‚Äôd had in the last 20 years!

Thank you again,
Supti & Family",5,2023,07,19

118,Excellent luxurious stay,"The Lalit london was a wonderful experience all together. I recently stayed at the property with my family and it just felt like home. Mr Harshad made excellent arrangements for our stay and we were super comfortable. Location wise it couldn‚Äôt have been better. Right next to the london bridge and Thames river with easy access to fabulous restaurants, kids park, tube station and the wonderful borough market. 
The food at Baluchi was perfect to satiate our Indian cravings. The bar was serving a good variety of alcohol and the room was perfect with a lovely toto installed in each bathroom which is a rare find in london. The property is also quite well made and maintained. Overall it was a luxurious stay for me and my family. Would surely visit again",5,2023,06,30
118,Dreams hotel.,"Since having our little ones it has been years since me and hubby have got some time alone. We were heading into London for some social commitments. We thought we make it into a little staycation in London.
I booked ourselves a stay at Lalit london.

The service was unmatched to any of my previous stays in London. You name it right from check in to room service to check out was such a smooth stay. 

We received complimentary cake as we were celebrating our marriage anniversary too. 

Thank you to all at Lalit London for making our stay memorable. ",5,2023,06,18
118,Great hospitality & awesome location,The staff was very helpful with in-house hospitality as well as with our outdoor trips. The food at the Baluchi restaurant was as good or maybe better than our restaurants in India.Dal Bukhari was awesome. Locational advantage made our stay more happening ,5,2023,06,13
118,Excellent food in a stunning setting ,"This restaurant is hosted in a beautiful hall, formerly part of a heritage listed school building.
Highly atmospheric, and the food was excellent. Indian flavours with a difference.
Friendly and attentive service, and the cost reasonable in view of the excellent quality of the experience.",5,2023,06,13
118,Experienced Home away Home experience at Lalit London,"We were 3 couples and were visiting London for the first time and were keen to stay near London Bridge and with Indian food in mind,we choose Lalit,London.The Choice of picking up Lalit London for 4 nights turned out to be a great experience.Let me start with the Check in experience which was seamless and were lucky to get early check in.The entire hotel  staff was very friendly and extended best hospitality standards.The Indian Restaurant served us with the Indian dishes and at one stage we felt it was Home away Home experience and Dal Bukhara was just out of the world.Breakfast too was complete and loved their Indian option with crispy Aaloo Parathas.The entire stay was very comfortable and must stay place for the Hotels location,hospitality and great Indian food.",5,2023,06,12

118,Hit and Miss,"Pros:
Beautiful facility
Nice location central to lots of food, shops, and tourist attractions

Cons:
Not that convenient to get into central London if transit is delayed, e.g. late busses, etc.
Need to work on customer service and knowing when to speak with guests, i.e. not at 12am when there is a confusion about the booking that can wait until morning, thus ruining a night's sleep.
",3,2023,06,04
118,Excellent,Excellent hotel for quick business trip to London. Room was great. Toilet ring was heated which was a funny/nice addon. Tried the food one evening and although only had time for the main course it was excellent. Good area to walk around although a bit off when you are heading for Heathrow. Will definitely come back! ,5,2023,06,04
118,Fabulous,The staff was incredibly accommodating!! The hotel was clean and eclectic in decor. Lovely stay for such a short visit. My mum & I were only here for one evening. It was a great location also; we were able to walk all the way down to Big Ben and then take a taxi back!,5,2023,06,03
118,Amazing Hotel near Tower Bridge,"The hotel was so beautiful. The rooms were spacious, neat, clean and welcoming. There were complimentary snacks and drinks provided in the room.

The staff were polite and guest centric. We were held up in the London traffic and arrived late for check out. The staff were warm and did not impose any late check out fee.

There are shops nearby and it is just a few minutes walk to the Tower Bridge.

The indian food at the restaurant was superb and service by the restaurant staff was amazing.

It's really a 5 star hotel with amazing room.",5,2023,06,02
118,A charming and delightful stay,"We stayed two nights to celebrate my wife's birthday with our sons and their partners. From the word go, arriving early, we were made to feel very welcome. The receptionist was a polite and charming young man who was bothe efficient at booking us in as well as being interested in us as people.. 

About half an hour after we had arrived in our room, a member of staff brought a delicious chocolate cake for my wife with a special birthday card from the staff. My son, who was also celebrating his birthday, received a similar cake.

We had arranged for nine of us to meet in the early evening before going on to a restaurant. The staff were very accommodating in allowing us full use of part of the terrace and, later, the Headmaster's room alongside the bar. At all times the service was attentive.

The room itself, the Lalit Suite, was spacious, light and well furnished, and the bed was very comfortable with high-class linen. The shower room was also well arranged and stocked.

My sole criticism of the hotel is that the breakfast buffet was slightly basic. We have had more interesting and superior selections of food in other hotels in the UK and overseas, including many in India.

I am no expert in five star hotels, as obviously are some of those who have criticised the hotel, but our experience was certainly excellent. Luxury on its own does not make a good hotel and we both felt that our experience was a most enjoyable one, accompanied as it was by the helpful, smiling and charming service from all the staff we met.",5,2023,05,29
118,"An excellent hotel and outstanding staff, left us with fond memories of our stay here.","Really enjoyable stay.  Most impressive were the staff - constantly smiling and making you feel welcome.  The ambience in the main dining hall for our evening meal and breakfasts was excellent.  We left with fond memories of our stay here and when we're next in London, we'll highly likely to choose here again.",5,2023,05,27
118,An Amazing Stay at The LaLiT London,"This is an amazing place to stay.   Customer Service was 5 star.  The history of this hotel is fascinating. Use to be an all boys boarding school.  Room accommodations simply lovely, bathrooms with large soft bath towels.   Fabrice the Concierge, professional, always helpful. Really made our stay special.  Location was great.  The restaurant (Indian fare) its menu selection was very good.  The food and presentation was quite delicious.    Would recommend this hotel.  ",5,2023,05,21
118,The LaLiT London,Was a school and converted. Check In was fast & friendly! Joyti was great to help me with something prior to my stay! Really helped me! So thankful for her help! Fabrice the concierge was great in helping us with Taxi's & Luggages! Booked the Seniors Room. Room & bathroom a great size! Love the showers! Food in the Great Hall was amazing! Had the Indian Breakfast! WOW! And my favourite Masala Chai! Overall a great hotel with a great team! ,5,2023,05,21
118,A serious issue,"As I was going to the theatre in the evening with friends, it was a spur of the moment decision to treat myself to a central London hotel. Having previously eaten at the Lalit's fabulous Indian restaurant  I found a room deal  online and the pleasant receptionists matched it.  ¬£250 not including breakfast.  Expensive but a little less than average for a central London hotel.  The first room I was shown wasn't made up properly (pillows not on the bed etc) and was totally overlooked so the curtains would have had to remain closed at all times. I asked to see another room and was shown 007, an accessibility room (I'm not disabled) but it looked pleasant enough so I settled there).  Bathroom had more than enough extras: bathrobes, toothbrush/paste, shaving kit etc.  The sink was tiny and water splashed everywhere but the showers (one rain forest, one handheld) were strong and efficient.  The bedroom was large with high windows and hard wooden floors (no slippers provided), tea/coffee making facilities and a nice touch, complimentary soft drinks in the mini bar. So those are the positives.  Now for the negatives:  following our theatre trip, we returned to the hotel for a quick drink to discover that this 5* hotel's bar was closed (1020 on a Friday night, highly unusual).  The only member of staff to be seen was the hotel receptionist who offered us the opportunity to purchase the equivalent of mini bottles of wine however it didn't seem terribly enticing so we turned it down and said our goodbyes. My bedroom was very quiet and the bed, exceptionally comfortable with decent linen.  However at 1.15 in the morning, my bedroom door was opened and someone walked in.  As I was in a deep slumber, it was a very frightening experience, especially for a woman on her own. The next morning at 8.15, the cleaner walked in, waking me up after a rather nervous night's sleep. To cap it all, the handle fell off the shower. The receptionist was very apologetic and said there'd been a glitch on the computerised system. I was offered a complimentary breakfast but no compensation.  I've stayed at many 5 star hotels in my time but quite honestly, this barely made a 4*.  Would I return? No.  However for tourists wanting a decent Central London hotel then it's perfect for them, being right by Tower Bridge and set back from the road so very quiet. An unfortunate experience for me but maybe others will be luckier.",3,2023,05,20
118,The Lalit in London.,The Lalit was beautifully appointed and finished in both the common areas and rooms. Service was enthusiastic and professional. Restaurant offered inventive dishes and everything was perfectly prepared. ,5,2023,05,19
118,Everything thing has been perfect.   The service has been impeccable Mosses has been there for any that you need.,The rooms are very comfortable with all the amenities you would need .  The service is second to none they are there for any request you have.   The ambiance is very elegant. I would strongly recommend this hotel.,5,2023,05,18
118,Lovely Hotel,"Great service everywhere, from reception to to the dining room. Moses and his team are true professionals.  The great hall is beautiful.  The setting near the walk on the Thames at Tower Bridge is ideal.  Very nice to stroll during the day or at night.",5,2023,05,18
118,Very good. Must visit,"We visited Baluchi restaurant for Indian food, excellent experience, good staff, very tasty authentic Indian food and great hospitality. Staff accommodated our request at the closing hours, we are grateful to them as it was cold outside and we were tired and reached quite. Thanks",5,2023,05,17
118,World class hospitality,"We have stayed in a lot of hotels around the world - this has to be on the top of the list of best stays/experiences so far. 

Other than the obvious such as the gorgeous building, and the high quality rooms - the Staff were more like family and were extremely hospitable - each and every need of ours was taken care of seamlessly. 

Especial thanks to Shahab, Jayati, Harshit and the whole Team that took so much care and put in the extra effort to make sure our 10 days were truly a phenomenal experience of the Indian hospitality my country prides itself on - could not have asked for more - we all (20 of us!!) will see you soon :)

Thank you so much. 

S.P.",5,2023,05,15
118,Great food in a great ambiance,"After experimenting with a number of Indian restaurants across the UK, this was really the most authentic I tasted. Every dish was bursting with flavour and perfectly spiced. 

But the true highlight was the staff. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warm and friendly service. 

Thank you for a great experience. ",5,2023,05,14
118,Excellent 3 night stay,"The LaLit is an excellent hotel. we are so glad we chose it for the Coronation Weekend, everything about it is fabulous from the concierge greeting us to check in staff and breakfast staff. The room was extremely spacious with complimentary snacks, coffee machine and cold drinks replenished daily in the fridge. The bathroom is excellent and a nice surprise was the heated toilet seat. There are plenty of restaurants close by along with the Bridge Theatre which is only a short distance away. London Bridge stations are about a 10-15 minute walk away.    ",5,2023,05,09
118,Absolutely perfect hotel for my first visit to London.,"Exceptional service and hotel design. The Lalit London is a gorgeous hotel with fine embellishments in all the right places. They have wonderfully blended the aesthetics of one culture into a historical building of another. The bidet- I cannot tell you how much I want one in my own home as soon as I get back. 

Very LGBTQIA+ friendly hotel to book- they have a pride flag flying outside and they produced a video they proudly showcase on your room‚Äôs television which features Violet Chachki, a prominent American RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race winner. 

The dining hall is one of the most beautiful places I‚Äôve dined at in London and the food is phenomenal- I will be reminiscing about the Mango Coconut Naan for years to come. If you like your Indian cuisine to be spicy and you have less melanin than others, ask for it to be spiced appropriately ;P

If you‚Äôre from the USA, the only negative aspect is the air conditioning in our room wasn‚Äôt fantastic, but that has seemed to be a repetitive theme in every 4, or 5 star European hotel we‚Äôve stayed in over the last 3 weeks.",5,2023,05,08
118,Exceeded our expectations,"We have just returned from a weekend staying at The Lalit to celebrate our daughter‚Äôs 18th birthday. The staff are amazingly attentive, welcoming and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. The hotel is stunningly beautiful, in an amazing location, great facilities. Unique hotel, lovely restored old school and the bedrooms have been well thought out with the guests in mind. We had two suite rooms with views of The Shard. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious. We didn‚Äôt want to leave. ",5,2023,05,07
118,Excellent Breakfast ,"The staff here is very helpful especially Mr Moses, he made us feel comfortable, he is very responsive. Every hotel should have a staff like him. Thank you so much Mr Moses. Thank you The Lalit. Looking forward to stay at the hotel. ",5,2023,05,02
118,Very inconsistent,"This was our first stay at the Lalit in London, a five-day break in the UK capital. 

The building is great ‚Äì a converted school, which has been very well preserved, and we both loved it. Its location near London Bridge is also really nice. 

Check-in was pleasant and efficient, and the room (a senior classroom) was large and had plenty of room for all our bags. There were three cupboards, each of which had a hat shelf, a hanging rack and another shelf at the bottom. However, whoever designed this is obviously someone who likes to hang everything up ‚Äì there was no shelving at a decent height. Not everyone can reach up to the hat shelf or wants to get down on their hands and knees to put stuff into the bottom shelf. I also found the room a bit short on character. It had some Indian touches but it was all a bit clinical and the view was non-existent (the brick wall of a neighbouring building). The hard flooring also gave it more of a Travel Lodge feel than luxury five-star. The television was also incredibly small by today‚Äôs hotel standards and bolted onto the wall as an afterthought. 

Things that I did like about the room were the very large and comfortable bed, the excellent lighting and the fact that you could turn all the lights off using a switch by the bed. There were also plug sockets above the height of the bedside tables, so plugging in devices to charge was easy. 

The mini-bar, full of complimentary soft drinks and water was very good and much appreciated. 

The turndown service was great when done correctly but was very variable. For example, some nights we got water by the bed, and some nights not. This rather smacks of training being given but not being followed up by further training and support. At one point in the late afternoon, someone did come to check on our room and barged straight in without ringing the bell. Luckily, we were both lying on the bed reading.  

The large bathroom was excellent, with a plentiful supply of thoughtful amenities. The shower was particularly good, although a bit of extra attention to the shower head with some Viakal wouldn‚Äôt go amiss. 

We really liked the bar and the Headmaster‚Äôs Office next to it, and the very proactive and attentive bar staff who made great cocktails. Ask for a Vesper Martini ‚Äì we had a lot of fun with a member of staff one night, finding all the ingredients for this (which they did have) and constructing it as we like. 

The dining room is wonderful apart from the ‚Äòbackground music‚Äô, which was often not in the background. In fact, I would be hard-pressed to say whether either word in that term was strictly accurate for the noise that filled the space. I don‚Äôt really like background music anyway, but Richard Clayderman plays Brian Adams is enough to have me running for the hills. It‚Äôs really not how I want to be ‚Äòentertained‚Äô during a relaxing breakfast. To be fair, we did have Beethoven one morning but the following day the assault on Brian Adams‚Äô oeuvre and my ear drums was resumed. (And I had to ask on two separate occasions for it to be turned down.)

However, Ishwar was delightful and efficient, and were we very happy to see him in the mornings, ready and eager to help us. A real credit to the hotel.

Yes, I would probably stay here again. I hope, though, that the management read this and takes it in the spirit it is meant ‚Äì constructive criticism ‚Äì and makes efforts to offer a more consistently excellent experience.",4,2023,05,01
118,Birthday Celebrations ,"We were celebrating my mum‚Äôs 70th birthday. 
Had a really nice time. Food was amazing, all freshly made and piping hot. Nothing was too much trouble. The endless refills of masala chai was very welcomed. On the whole a great day out and celebration for all. Special mention to Kranti, Suri and Moses.",5,2023,05,01
118,Lalit: A hidden pearl of London,"The Lalit London always claims to provide the Lalit experience and I have received it on numerous occasions. Maybe it's just royalty, like the heritage property which has been magnificently refurbished as a boutique hotel to provide quite a soothing, blended with the refreshing Indian hospitality experience or maybe just the charm of the people hosting you here, but Lalit makes you feel the comfort of home. 
I visit London almost every other month for business and now Lalit is my second home. After a day of work, I look forward to the dinner at the wonderful Baluchi - dining room, and more probably for a reason - the smiling and welcoming staff always up for a chat - Mr. Khan, Mr. Moses all try to make you feel relaxed providing a personal touch while along with Mr. Jomon Kuriakose, the executive chef, they serve the finest Indian dishes to give a satisfying closure to the day which cheers one up. Sometimes, colleagues hop on to just have an insight into the Lalit experience and the samosas with Mango Lassi, never fails to amaze them - a reason for high attendance on Fridays because it is almost a routine to end the week.

The modesty and courteous nature and service of the staff is worth applauding right from the GM Mr. Harshit to the concierge Mr.Fabrice, everyone is just ensuring a best time for you. Needless to say London has become more preferable to me as a business destination because Lalit exists and I know I can just work and enjoy the Lalit experience while everything else takes a routine course just like home",5,2023,04,26
118,amazing,Awesome food and splendid experience. I would definitely recommend to my other friends.  Good customer service by the staffs and great ambience. The aloo kulcha and the pan kulfi were my favourites. Glad to have spent time here,5,2023,04,26
118,Hotel fine. Restaurant service terrible!,Checked in and the room is fine. Went to the restaurant for dinner. Shown to a table and he ambience was great but no one came to take my order despite attempts to get the attention of the staff. No one even seemed to care when I gave up and walked out.  Restaurant wasn‚Äôt busy and they seemed to have enough staff. Not what you want for a business trip. Disaster.,1,2023,04,25
118,Beautiful Indian styled hotel in a great location,"This hotel is a real find and definitely the most enjoyable London hotel experience I have had. The transformation from an old schoolhouse has been beautifully done, there is a luxurious and calm feel from the minute you enter and the staff are lovely. The concierge, in particular, is very friendly. The restaurant is beautiful, especially at night and food is great - we especially enjoyed the Indian breakfasts. Walking distance to everything on the South Bank, Southwark Cathedral and Tower Bridge is just around the corner.",5,2023,04,25
118,Lovely,"Went with my mum for a midweek birthday celebration. Had a great time, great food and service from Moses and the team! Even got a tour around the hotel as it wasn't too busy. Really loved how they've kept the essence of the school ",5,2023,04,25
118,Wonderful experience ,"Wonderful Indian afternoon tea.
I would recommend they have some background music too as it was too quite in a big hall which was echoing noise, otherwise the ambience is beautiful set in a old school hall with original features. ",5,2023,04,22
118,Odd..,"Great location, and we were really looking forward to our stay, but:

Cons
Personality-less automaton booked us in.
Room large and clean, but fixtures and fittings worn.
Provide dressing gowns, but no slippers for hard floors.
No menu or hotel information in the room.
Soul-less restaurant.
No bar after 10:30.

Pros
Great concierge gentleman.
Good shower and bed.
Location.

Unfortunately, won't be going back, as there's better service and value for the price.",3,2023,04,22
118,Highly Recommend,"Excellent Hotel! We had a lovely time while in London! The room was lovely, the hotel is clean and beautifully decorated. The staff was helpful whenever we needed anything, and the restaurant was great. We will be staying here the next time we are in London. ",5,2023,04,17
118,"Wonderful hotel, best location!","Beautiful and charming hotel. You cannot have a better location to do the standard tourist stuff in London. üòâ
The room was nice and quiet, however it was a little small and I've been missing something to sit on.
Minibar was inculded and refilled daily, very nice.
Small bathroom, but well equipped and totally sufficient for me.
Breakfast also was included. Large and delicious buffet, opportunity to order several hot items, very nice. My only but rather big disappointment here: The hot chocolate! It was just coloured water, it tasted aweful and it is completely scrupulous for a hotel of THIS reputation!!!

Hotel staff was always friendly and helpful. I felt welcome and shepherded at all times.

I really enjoyed my stay here and I'm sure I will return sometime in the future.
Thanks to all of you guy for a wonderful London trip! üòÄ",5,2023,04,17
118,Scrumptious brekkie!,"We love everything about the Lalit. It‚Äôs fabulous location so close to tower bridge, the ambiance and decor, the friendly staff and excellent service. This time we went for my hubby‚Äôs bday for breakfast. Oh my god, the food was just unbelievable. We had a veg Indian breakfast thali! And being a South Indian I can assure you that the sambar, chutneys, dosa, idli, vada everything was absolutely authentic and scrumptious. The masala tea with the food was divine. The staff were so lovely and surprised my husband with a lovely dates and nuts cake. All I can say is, this place is a must visit..!",5,2023,04,17
118,Beautiful hotel with great views,Perfect ! Hotel was beautiful and clean and the room was spacious with big comfy bed ‚Ä¶. Food was delicious and the staff were extremely helpful definitely will return many thanks!  Great views of the shard and close to tower bridge ,5,2023,04,09
118,Home Away from Home,Lovely to be back at our favourite hotel in London.  This is our home away from home. Its so good to be recognised by the team. They even remembered what we eat for breakfast. Chef made a love egg while masala omelette and chicken sausage. Room was great as always. All the best and see you all after 6 months. We miss the heated toilet seats in India üòÉ,5,2023,04,08
118,Boutique Stay,Visited on a recommendation from a colleague in india. Must say that the hotel needs a big shout out! I never knew that this hotel existed just across the river where i work. This is far better than the usual hotels which ate known generally. Staff are  the asset in this place. I stayed only one night which was a last minute plan but the breakfast in the morning- the Indian Selection was amazing. Definitely coming back with Mrs soon for the weekend stay.,5,2023,04,08
118,Wonderful Stay,My wife and I decided to treat ourselves and stay the night at Lalit when we were in London to see a musical. We were delighted with the ambiance and service. Everyone was so friendly and helpful; the room was gorgeous; the food excellent; and the history of the hotel was unique. We will definitely be back!,5,2023,04,05
118,Night away with my daughter,"Beautiful hotel with very attentive staff , comfortable beds & stunning bedrooms
With a delicious breakfast
It was my daughters birthday & they‚Äôd left a chocolate cake in the bedroom for her . S cute touch.
Good location for London Bridge & Borough market",5,2023,04,02
118,"A 3.5 star at most, 5 star is much inflated.","This hotel is a 3.5 star max, not a 5 star by any means.  The furniture was in the cheap side, the deli meat tray cover in the breakfast buffet was broken and kept falling off. The room was not spotless in the washroom or behind the desk in the room. Walls very bare. Cheap toiletries from China and India.  I don't understand the inflated 5 star rating.",3,2023,03,31
118,Superb ,"What a fantastic weekend stay we had. The hotel and the hospitality was top notch. The staff went over and beyond to cater to our needs. The food at Baluchi is amazing. Will definitely be coming back soon.
Thank you to the staff & Management for making our stay memorable.",5,2023,03,30
118,Mice in the room and hotel doesn‚Äôt care!,"I spent one night at this supposed 5 star hotel, and was horrified to discover mouse droppings in the bed! Having switched off the light and  rolled straight into bed after a late night, unfortunately we didn‚Äôt see the droppings till the next morning. Some droppings were mashed into the bed as we‚Äôd obviously lain on them in the night, and some were still ‚Äòwhole‚Äô which is how we identified them. It was a revolting discovery and really ruined the morning and the remainder of our visit. 

If that‚Äôs not bad enough, when we complained to reception about this situation, they didn‚Äôt care at all and it felt like we weren‚Äôt believed despite the actual evidence! We were told that the matter would be ‚Äòinvestigated‚Äô and we‚Äôd receive a phone call the next day‚Ä¶ however 3 days later with no attempt to contact us (and after multiple phone calls made TO the hotel) there was still no acknowledgment/ apology. We reported the issue to Booking.com, who made their own enquiries to the hotel, and only then did we find out (via booking.com) that the hotel ‚Äúrejected the claim‚Äù!

So the takeaway here is that the hotel don‚Äôt care that there are mice in the hotel (defecating in the beds and god knows where else) and apparently will not be doing anything about it! Mice in a hotel is a pretty big no-no in most people‚Äôs opinions, but for a hotel to ignore/dismiss the problem when the evidence is clear is a pretty big issue. We will be reporting this further to the relevant authorities. If you like sharing your room with rodents then this is the hotel for you!",1,2023,03,30
118,"Exceptional experience,Great Location,Friendly staff,I will be coming back here again and again","If you are doing anything near Tower Bridge stay here ! Easy access to tube station London Bridge .

The staff here are excellent. I extended my stay for an additional 4 nights and Breakfast was Great .
Dinner at Baluchi was amazing our friends joined us for dinner and they also enjoyed will be back soon to try other dishes,Exceptional 5 star service .",5,2023,03,29
118,Mouse droppings on the bed,"I stayed at this hotel hoping to enjoy a night in central London with my wife. I instead woke up to discover I had slept in mouse droppings that had been underneath the bed sheets and had come into direct contact with my skin. I immediately reported this to reception who sent up a staff member to inspect the bed, they took photos and I was told the matter would be followed up immediately, as you would expect. I stayed there on Saturday and so far I have had absolutely no direct contact from the hotel. I have now called them three times and I‚Äôm told either senior staff are in a meeting or they will call the next day. So far I still haven‚Äôt been contacted. I am absolutely disgusted by this hotel and have been generous enough not to post the photos until today, assuming they would contact me with some kind of resolution. Avoid this hotel at all costs, it‚Äôs nowhere near the 5 star hotel classification it has been awarded.",1,2023,03,29
118,Exquisite stay at the Lalit,"We had a wonderful stay at the Lalit. The staff are charming, helpful and professional and the room (a 'junior classroom') was very well-equipped and comfortable.  We enjoyed the generous breakfasts and delicious dinners in the Baluchi restaurant.  the d√©cor cleverly combines original features of the former grammar school (wood panelling and flooring, fireplaces and grand staircase) with contemporary luxury.  Southwark cathedral is a 10 minute walk away, as is the Tower of London and the Bridge Theatre is just round the corner. We will definitely be returning.
",5,2023,03,29
118,An Indian oasis in the middle of ‚Äòme too‚Äô Central London hotels‚Ä¶..,"I stayed at The Lalit London during the period of March 21 to 23rd. 

To give an idea about the property - it is an old school that has been converted into a hotel and have named rooms like junior classroom, senior classroom etc. The place has a lot of character. Having said that it is very modern with all the amenities that one requires for a comfortable stay. 

It is located metres away from London Bridge station and has easy access to everything including walking distance to the Shard and The Tower Bridge. 

The breakfast was phenomenal- one could choose hot Indian breakfast or the traditional English breakfast and both were very good. They have an Indian restaurant which I did not use. 

It has got value for money pricing especially when one compares it to hotels like Novotel or Double Tree by Hilton which are quite ordinary.

Last but not the least very warm hospitality and service. 

I would like to commend their management and staff. 

Well done and keep it up",5,2023,03,29
118,What a find,"Stayed last weekend. The hotel is lovely, as are the staff. From the door being opened on arrival through to the friendliness oat Reception and the team in the restaurant. Stayed in The Tower Suite which was wonderful.
The location is spot on, a short meander to Tower Bridge and over to The Tower or St Catherines Dock. Cannot compliment this place enough.",5,2023,03,24
118,Great Indian,"Incredible food,  nice atmosphere. Very nice decor and super nice service.  The food is as authentic as I‚Äôve had outside of India.  This is a definite must. We will come back for sure. Worth the trip even if you are far away.  Awesome place to eat and drink.",5,2023,03,22
118,Indian Luxury in London!,"A very grand hotel set in what was once a school. All the staff were superlative in their attention to detail and their welcome. We have been to the LaLit before and love the Indian vibe to the place (it is an Indian owned franchise). The rooms were spotless. The beds were lovely and firm and -bliss of bliss -we had a selection of both hard and really soft pillows. I don‚Äôt know why but as you get older your pillows become critical to your sleep quality.

Also intriguing were the Oriental style jet-wash toilets! Hours of innocent fun to be had testing the settings.

As a London tour guide with a wide experience of the capital‚Äôs hotels I recommend LaLit for its staff, location and welcoming ambience.

Also -try the Indian breakfast ! Delicious !",5,2023,03,21

The cooked breakfast was super delicious and all the other pastries, fruit, cold meats and cheeses were was pure indulgence.

We decided to go anyway, and are so glad we did. We were warmly welcomed by Shaba, who very generously upgraded our room to the beautiful Mountford Suite. The room was stylish and spotless, and very comfortable. Every time we came and went either Shaba or another staff member, greeted us and asked after our day. Breakfast the next morning was plentiful and tasty, and the staff again very welcoming. On checkout we were still treated attentively, and they hoped that we would return. The Lalit is a gem.",5,2023,03,15

118,"Lovely Hotel, Quality Indian Food, Great Location for Tower Bridge and nearby attractions.","We have stayed at the LaLit three times and have always has a nice stay. 
The staff are very welcoming and the rooms are a good size and very clean (we stayed in a Senior Classroom). The beds are very comfy and the room is stocked with Tea, Coffee, Hot Chocolate, Water, Biscuits, Crisps, Coke and a couple of other items.  The bathroom is a good size and has a toilet seat thats heated (nice in the middle of the night) .
The Breakfast/Dining Hall is beautifully decorated and the food is of a high standard and plentiful. You can have English Breakfast  (ours was all nice and hot and fresh) or Indian Breakfast as well as all the extras like fruit, yoghurt, pastries fruit juices etc.  We have dined there on a few occasions with family and the food is very tasty, authentic and full of delicate flavours.  We consider the restaurant  to be reasonably priced considering how nice it is and the location. We have yet to meet the Great Chef here, but apparently he does come out to meet diners now and then which is nice. You can have an Indian Afternoon Tea at the hotel which looks delicious and there is a nice bar area outside for drinks.
There are other facilities at the hotel i.e Spa etc. but we have not tried any of these services yet.
The hotel is located very close to Tower Bridge, you can literally walk round the corner  and your standing on Tower Bridge. Also London Bridge Station is only a 5 min walk straight along Tooley Street (flat walk all the way). The concierge are very quick to help with bags etc when you arrive and also very helpful and friendly.
We use to stay in another hotel along the road but much prefer the LaLit for its charm and service and food.",5,2023,03,02

118,Excellent Sensory Experience,"The Lalit London is a fantastic choice for those looking to try something new and unique in their dining experience. Chef Jomon's take on Kerala cuisine is truly amazing - each dish is bursting with flavor and beautifully presented. The modern twist added to traditional dishes was truly enjoyable and I highly recommend giving it a try. The service at The Lalit is top-notch and the atmosphere is elegant and sophisticated. Overall, I had an incredible dining experience at The Lalit and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a culinary adventure.",5,2023,02,04
118,A tale in plates,"Chef Jomon blew our socks off with the taste, consistency and depth of his food. Undoubtedly an excellent place to bring family for a lovely intimate dinner. He is passionate about his food and works hard on every dish; what every foodie dreams of having their chef care for.",5,2023,02,04

I also had the honour of meeting Chef Jumon.  The food he creates is nothing short of pure artistry and delight - what a treat!  The Lalit is perfectly located near Tower Bridge to enjoy the intricacies of fine dining and London at its best.  ,5,2023,02,04
118,The LaLit,"Lovely hotel, very friendly staff and enjoyed our visit. Not the greatest night sleep though as a room either below or to the side of ours must of had the windows open so they was a constant banging. Messaged the hotel about this but they failed to reply.",4,2023,01,30

Very, very pleasant and spectacular customer service. Oh ad the Sauvignon they have is a new fav !!",5,2023,01,26
118,My daughters 17th bday!!,"I am always overwhelmed when it comes to Chef Jomon in Balluchi Testaurant as he always goes above and beyond in giving his customers not only a great culinary experience but also ensures that he personally delivers excellent service n hospitality in making the customer feel comfortable and special. 
  The food is above par and the service hosted by Chef Jomon is one to experience.  Not every 5 star experience can be fulfilled just by the ambience and I believe every fine dining restaurant should have a Chef like Chef Jomon! 
 Thankyou for a continued amazing experience Jomon!!",5,2023,01,24
118,Mixed reviews,"This is a pleasant hotel, great location and extremely clean but not sure it is a 5 star hotel. Whilst there is tolieteries in the bathroom and all inclusive soft drinks in the mini bar, not sure what else matches or equates to a 5 star rating. The check in was personal but the reception desk is not maned 24/7. It was so refreshing to have your breakfast cooked to order but our order was wrong, and instead of the manager taking my plate away and rectifying it, I got a plate of eggs separately given to me!!! I was also upset to see that the manager served someone before me because he knew him!!! Instead of in order of customers. And the manager and staff were confused as to what table ordered what food and argued about this in front off or in ear shot of guests which was unprofessional ",4,2023,01,24
118,Possibly the worst night‚Äôs sleep ever :(,"Let‚Äôs start with the positives - the location is absolutely perfect. Near to the station, plenty of places to eat and drink, tower bridge down the road and The Circle car park is excellent value for central London. The hotel itself is also very beautiful and I wish we had more time to explore it but we had a jam packed itinerary. We were also allowed to check in early which was great and the complimentary tea, coffee, crisps, cookies and soft drinks were much appreciated. 

Now unfortunately our room heating system was 26 degrees and made the room a sauna, despite us turning the air con on. This made the room incredibly uncomfortable. Speaking of uncomfortable, the bed was the worst bed I have ever slept on I am sorry to say. The pillow was also very hard. I didn‚Äôt get any sleep and have now got a stiff back. I decided to have a long bath to soak my tired muscles - slight problem there is no bath. I thought that this was a 5 star hotel? 

Breakfast I cannot comment on as we did not bother, nor did we eat at the restaurant. We did however eat at Restaurant Story which is 2 minutes away - absolutely superb. 

We checked out quite early and were able to leave our bags. We weren‚Äôt asked how our stay was at any point which was a shame. I don‚Äôt feel that the price for this hotel was reflected in our experience.",3,2023,01,23
118,The perfect hotel!,"I recently returned from an incredible week in London which was in large part due to my stay at this very lovely hotel. I really can't say enough good things about LaLit London: the location is very central (one block from the Thames, between the London and Tower bridges, and 10 min walk to London Bridge rail and tube stations), the building is interesting and beautiful (historic boys school adaptively reused to a hotel), the interiors are gorgeous (rich colors, fabrics , many restored architectural details and perfect lighting), and the staff are friendly and helpful (very professional, polite and responsive)!   My room was very clean and comfortable and well-outfitted with amenities including snacks, filtered water, a very comfortable bed, robes, slippers, wardrobe space, safe, spacious bathroom with bidet/washlet and plenty of towels. The hotel and surrounding area felt very safe and the hotel rooms are accessed from secured hallways. All floors can be accessed by elevators.

Upon checkout, I learned that my flight had been canceled and some other hotel guests had accidentally charged a large meal to my room.The front desk manager and hotel manager were both very gracious in helping to make possible extending my stay another nigh, as well as investigating and resolving the erroneous charge.

My only regret is not having experienced dinner at the hotel restaurant, whose menu, service and reviews looked great. However, I will definitely return (hopefully soon!) and will without reservation always recommend LaLit to friends and family visiting London!",5,2023,01,22
118,An amazing Family Dinner,"We went to Latit for a quick dinner since we were around. Had to say that the dinner was so delightful and was fulfilling. We were so full from starters and mains that we decided to skip the desert but chef made a special and sweet effort, giving us an unique desert which was just cherry on top. We enjoyed our visit thoroughly. Highly recommend this place.",5,2023,01,19
118,An evening delight,A very elegant set up with mouth watering food. The staffs are very courteous and the hospitality is par excellence. A must visit for all foodies.Highly recommended you must will enjoy and remember the experience.,5,2023,01,19
118,Not worth it,"Don't worth it,The quality of the service at this hotel is not that of ‚Äòfive star hotel.‚Äô What I experienced was over flow of water from shower room immediately after check in, which we informed the front desk and which nobody took care until I visit the front desk in person ...",1,2023,01,10
118,Fantastic Hotel,"The hotel is close to the tower bridge (less than 2 minute's walk) and close to London Bridge Station (9 minute's walk).

The atmosphere in the hotel was very welcoming, the hospitality at its best. During check-in, the receptionist is very friendly and professional.

The concierge guy Mr. Fabrice go and above his call of duty.

The room design is more classic and modern. When we are out during the late afternoon, the housekeeper will close the curtain and place additional amenities on the bed‚Äîsuch a nice gesture.

However, the breakfast is not quite up to the standard, especially the service. We waited for more than 15 minutes for someone to take the order, and it's less than five tables that are occupied. In this area, they need additional hospitality training to be more attentive.

Overall, the hotel is fantastic, and I will return without the breakfast unless they fix it. kudos to the team.",5,2023,01,05
118,Outstanding ! Chef Jomon is a star!,"We visited the Baluchi today for lunch with two other families . Very rarely do I walk out of a restaurant with a full stomach and a happy heart ‚Ä¶ But Baluchi was truly above and beyond my expectations. ..  

The culinary experience at the Baluchi was perhaps the best experience I have ever had in my life .. A huge shoutout to Chef Jomon for the amazing amazing food. The quality and freshness of every item is unbeatable! Amongst the starters, my favourite was the scallops ‚Ä¶ it literally melted in my mouth and eventually melted my heart. Every starter was top notch and outstanding! The best part about this gourmet experience  was the Chefs personal touch to everything . He was so warm and friendly and he had lovely and inspiring stories behind every dish.. We spend a good 5 hours there and it was the best experience ever. Chef Jomon‚Äôs passion is so evident and he‚Äôs truly a professional. I have never had such a wonderful culinary experience ever and I truly recommend the place for its superb food and the warm and humble Chef Jomon‚Äôs service .. Can‚Äôt wait to go back again !

118,A mesmerising gourmet food experience with a celebrated chef!!,"A Gourmet food experience with a young celebrated ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù chefjomon at Baluchi, thelalitlondon today. 

What made the visit special  to me was that, I could relate the chef to how Steve Jobs presented apple products at launch. Lot of passion and pride in what he does, demonstrated by telling us a story behind each of those dishes served to us and how to enjoy the flavours!! 

Last but not the least, his feet firm on the ground, truly remembering the path he travelled to where he is today, acknowledging those who made a difference in his life, and is so motivated to influence and lead the future generations to the success he had... 

Hats off to chefjomon, you are different and different people make a difference in this world‚Ä¶ long way to go and many more success to come your way!! Thank you for your wonderful hospitality today.",5,2023,01,02
118,Excellent location and comfort ,"Had stayed from 19 th Dec for 4 nights. Central location is a big plus. Underground and bus stations close by. Tower of London practically next door. Those Indians who can't do without their idli dosas for breakfast and dal and butter chicken will be delighted.
Their dining area is superb. You won't be disappointed with your stay. Yes rooms are as expected for this class of Hotel.

118,A beautiful culinary experience ,"I have been to quite few Indian restaurants in London, however Baluchi was a special experience. Chef Joemon is the epitome of brilliant customer service, his passion for food translates beautifully to the menu. There is a story behind each dish and he took us through that journey and we throughly enjoyed the experience. 

Thank you team Baluchi especially Chef Joemon for one of the best culinary experiences. ",5,2022,12,29
118,Amazing Restaurant!! A must visit,"This place is really fantastic! The atmosphere is chill and cool but the staff are also really friendly. They know what they‚Äôre doing and what they‚Äôre talking about, and you can tell that making customers happy is their main priority. Food is pretty tasty. They serve some classic Indian food with some unique twists and for their prices it‚Äôs 100% worth it. My recommendations are Kathal ke Kofte and Alleppey Kozhi Curry with chilli garlic naan bread and Pan ki Kulfi for dessert.",5,2022,12,25
118,Beautiful hotel and Staff,"Such a beautiful hotel with amazing staff that were super accommodating!

It boasts stylish rooms with an Indian flavour whilst being set in an old school building in the heart of London close to Tower Bridge and the Bridge Theatre.

118,Live a little at LaLit,"This is a beautiful building in a convenient location with excellent staff. We booked a small suite for a two night stay to celebrate a birthday and were really happy with our visit. Reception was welcoming and proficient, Fabrice, the Concierge was helpful and engaging and the restaurant staff where we had breakfast on both mornings were also helpful and efficient. The food in the restaurant for breakfast was lovely and made us regret having dinner reservations at Oblix East (very expensive, noisy and only ok food) and Cecconi's at the Ned, (also quite expensive and a band who thought they were in Wembley stadium, unbelievably loud for a restaurant). Next time , I will eat at LaLit !",5,2022,11,28
118,A great hotel near Tower Bridge,We were delighted with the LaLit. It was a last minute decision to book it and we were so pleased we had.

I'd like to specially thank Aaquib for putting in extra efforts in helping me extend my stay for another 4 days and making it a peaceful one. Shaun who took care of the breakfast requirements and made me feel at home. Lastly, Thanks to Fabrice too who ensured that I reach airport on time and don't miss my flight. I stayed there for almost a week and got to have amazing breakfast in the morning. They had variety of options available but anyone who craves for Indian food after going away from home they had options available like Dosa, Parantha. On one of the nights I had Dal Makhni and I must say that I have never had such creamy taste in India too so that's a must try :)",5,2022,11,16

The location is great - on the Thames, next to Tower Bridge",5,2022,11,11
118,Can improve guest experiences!,"We had requested an early check-in , however we were asked to wait for couple of hours and when we returned to the hotel the room was not ready. The receptionist gave us the same talk. 
I know early check in is not guranteed, but there are qualities called hospitality, tact, and courtesy which were completely absent. 
During our travels this was the most unprofessional reception staff that we encountered! The staff is not even present behind their desk most of the time ! They hide in a small closet like room and are invisible for the guests!!
Having said that the food at the restaurant was good!
Overall, the staff needs a crash course in dealing with clients looking for a boutique hotel experience !!! On a vacation people search for experience and pampering especially after spending top dollars. Sadly completely lacking here.",2,2022,11,04
118,Great place,"From check in to check out the staff were so friendly and helpful! the room was so spacious and luxurious and the attention to detail was evident , would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone!",5,2022,11,01
118,Absolutely first class!,"This hotel once was a school and it has been sympathetically refurbished into a beautiful hotel.
The staff are lovely and can‚Äôt do enough for you.
Luxury at an affordable price.  Excellent breakfast, amazing cocktails! We will definitely be back!",5,2022,10,31
118,Lovely stay,"We found the staff very welcoming at the Lalit and also we had a lovely comfortable room with some extra touches such as a cake for our anniversary. 
The hotel was really well maintained and clean. 
I would say that overall this hotel is exceptional for the price. 
My fianc√© had the Indian breakfast which she thoroughly enjoyed whilst I had the full English which was good but not exceptional, other than this then I cannot fault anything.",5,2022,10,31
118,Breakfast staff,"The staff is great at the lalit and the food is decent mr shaan helped for breakfast.the options are limited but the food quality is good and the staff are very friendly as well, always ready to help ",4,2022,10,31
118,Lacking in every sense of the word,"Disgusting 2 star bathroom, the bathroom sink is literally the same diameter as the bathroom bin. The queen bed is supposedly fit for accommodating two adults but barely one of us fits. Being pregnant I was looking forward to a relaxing stay with my husband but this has ruined our weekend and we will absolutely not be back- they couldn‚Äôt pay me to return here. Being a travel agent this is one hotel I‚Äôll be sure never to book for my customers. Basics such as slippers missing. Beyond abysmal. Looking forward to checking out tomorrow.",1,2022,10,29
118,Unique and enjoyable,"Fabrice, the Concierge was amazing! He anticipated your needs before you even asked and went above and beyond. 
The rooms were lovely - very different to a usual five star hotel, but very homely and warm.
The Indian breakfast was great and a nice change from the usual English array (which was also available).
The hotel was convenient and well maintained.",5,2022,10,28
118,Amazing experience and for a 5 star experience very reasonably priced.,"This hotel is beyond elegant. The staff is for sure 5 star. The restaurant has probably some of the best Indian food we have ever had. Better than restaurants on brick lane in London which is hard to beat.  It was also extremely clean. We had Sudeep as a waiter, he provided wonderful service. The whole team was fantastic.",5,2022,10,28
118,Wonderful stay,What a fabulous Indian breakfast. Amazing food and great service from Shaon. Brilliant! Definitely will come here again. The rooms are beautiful and the heated loo is a real treat! We had cocktails in the bar which were exquisite. So delicate and individual.,5,2022,10,28
118,Fantastic Indian breakfast,"Absolutely beautiful. The breakfast especially was fantastic. Shaon was a wonderful waiter, he helped us to make our breakfast perfect by making sure we tried all the best Indian food. It really is a huge treat to eat at this wonderful place!",5,2022,10,28
118,Underwhelming,"Really not a great experience. 
Stayed in lalit suite and pictures online are NOT the same as the room 
Huge steel beam in the room making really unattractive .
Arrived and staff seem very inexperienced 

A few things to mark down in room
I do not expect this in a 5 star 
Kettle was damaged and dented making it look tatty 
Broken tiles in shower 
The ceiling in bathroom was damaged 
No slippers 
REALLY dusty light shades 

When checking out the manager or staff member was having a very obvious heated discussion with a customer about charging for breakfast 
Was actually really awkward and went on for about 10 minutes why we waited to check out 

Words of advice 
there were plenty of public rooms on the floor , you Should have taken the customer somewhere private to discuss this matter 
Not in public for us all to hear 
Very embarrassing

Building is beautiful and the cooked breakfast was nice 
However the very minimal selection of cold breakfast options was really disappointing. 
Clearly hardly any guests as was deserted for a Friday night and hardly anyone for breakfast 
Which might explain why the breakfast selection was minimal and underwhelming 

Paid 380 for one night and I was expecting so much more 
Wouldn‚Äôt return as it needs more love and attention to detail 
Plus the staff need training 
Approach with caution",3,2022,10,23
118,"Absolute Shambles, a mess of a Hotel","Absolutely horrific levels of service, this places operates like an offshoot of a Kafkaesque govt Department. Shivani the front office manager is a complete nightmare to deal with as she picks one line and repeats it incessantly. The incident is too long to narrate here but this hotel should not operate, and irs clearly struggling as the restaurant was empty for Sunday. The staff seem to be roaming around with zero training and no uniforms. The hilariously titled instant service button on the room telephones goes unanswered for hours 

I asked Shivani to ask the general manager to get in touch with me, a week later no response, hence a public review .

I also saw Shivani treat around 10 guests with complete disdain and refuse to entertain a very reasonable request.

Fabrice and tge food are the only positives.",1,2022,10,21
118,Excellent all around,"Excellent hotel, well located and easily accessible.  Staff attentive and hospitable. 
Certainly will be staying again if staying in London. 
Very good service in the restaurant from Achutta ( sorry if not the correct name)",5,2022,10,21
118,"Fantastic hotel, excellent service!","My husband and I stayed at the hotel whilst visiting London.  The hotel is in an excellent location, rooms are spacious and very comfortable.  The most important part is the staff are excellent! We dined in the restaurant and its a must, food quality and service were fantastic!",5,2022,10,21
118,Great Stay Our Cozy Hotel in London,"We had a overnight stay here, on arrival we where meet by Frabrice and promptly assisted us parking and helped with our luggage only then to show us to reception, 6stars for Fabrice

Reception sadly for us was less welcoming, it felt solely like a transaction no smile no interest in where we came from, or asking if  we had a lovely journey to the hotel nor did you find us easy and in fact welcome back Mr Fortune thank you for choosing The LaLit as your London destination for the sixth time . On check out no ‚Äúdid you enjoy your stay ‚Äú hope you have a good onward journey all the things a five star hotel guest expect. Can I saw it may just have been a confidence thing with our reception lady she may benefit from some training . Sadly if your Reception is negative that sets the mood as you continue your stay so please take this a valued criticism. Our last visits have been so much better.

Rooms are lovely as usual we prefer Senior Rooms as more room to move around. Rooms spotless and well presented so thank u to housekeeping 

Teachers Bar the staff where attentive and helpful in choosing my aperitif for my evening and choice was excellent, on returning that evening we where welcomed back by these gentlemen and recognition of your self in the room makes a guest feel valued. So thanks to them. 

We had comfortable beds and bedding 
Such a cozy room. Showers only but they are one of the best I‚Äôve used and towels luxury .

Breakfast I suggest you definitely have full English as was so tasty with great selection of continental also . I truly enjoyed the breakfast we all did and made sure our waitress informed the Chef.  Natalia our morning waitress was not only on the ball with a great smile to brighten up your morning , so friendly and I had to tell Natalia ( I hope I have spelt her name correct)  because it‚Äôs always a pleasure to be served by someone as friendly as her, if she was not the restaurant manager she certainly would make a superb head of department in my opinion so thank u chef and Natalia for a tremendous experience. 

On departure Fabrice on the ball and truly in charge of his job role swiftly collected our cases took us to our car and waved us good bye. 

Do not hesitate to try this superb hotel. I‚Äôm sure my experience with Reception will be addressed which is why I critic all hotels I visit as managers can address and train individuals better

Hotel have ground rooms for those with difficulty walking and prompt lifts to all floors but corridors are quite lond so if you have walking difficulty please just ask receptionist when you book for a room near lifts or on ground floor . 

Many Thanks Lalit we won‚Äôt hesitate to return 

Mr V Fortune",4,2022,10,17
118,Amazing!,"Fantastic food and service especially from our amazing waiter Sudeep who looked after us so well. 

It was a birthday celebration and I even had a birthday cake surprise! 

This is an amazing place and make sure you have the benefit of Sudeep‚Äôs excellent service. My Big thank you!",5,2022,10,16
118,Superb,"I stayed here last week for three nights in the Lalit suite and absolutely loved it. The staff were helpful, courteous, charming, and extremely attentive, arranging an early check-in for me and drying my suitcase and shawl out while I was at the office, due to a good rain soaking on the walk over from London Bridge station. 

The room was spotless, with all mod cons, good sized bed, and was huge, light, and airy, with excellent climate control if needed. Such a welcome change to the usual hotel aircon with windows sealed shut so commonly on offer these days. I loved the room so much, I spent one of the days working from there as my meeting in my office was canceled. I loved the bathroom and it was stocked full of all the amenities one would require. The shower was enormous which in fact led me to question why there was no bath as well - there certainly would have been room in there for a large tub and it would add an extra draw to be able to have a long soak after a busy day at work.

The breakfast was delicious although I would have liked to see more on offer in the way of hot food such as porridge or gluten-free toast and plant-based butter, milk, yoghurt, etc. For such a high-end hotel, it felt like a little more variation to the menu would be expected. I only ordered room service for one night as the offer was only Indian food. I love curry as much as the next person but it's a little bit overkill for me when staying somewhere for 4 days / 3 nights. I'd suggest a little variation on the room service menu too as I ended up calling Deliveroo one night when I injured my foot walking to work that morning. I felt disloyal doing that as the staff were yet again incredible about how they assisted me when I came hobbling back to the hotel! At my request, they went out and bought me a Tubigrip, and paracetamol up to my room, and brought me my breakfast both mornings to my room which is included in the booking and usually served in their stunning dining room downstairs.

The proximity of the hotel to Tower Bridge, Butlers Wharf, and London Bridge with the many restaurants, bars, and fantastic sights make it a wonderful location that is vibrant yet spacious so not too manic and bustling if one wants to pop out for a bite to eat at the end of the day, or if taking a stroll for lunch.

I am only sad the spa is currently closed as that would have been another facility I would have made use of along with a more varied room service menu and breakfast selection. Overall though, would highly recommend and I will definitely return. It's the kind of place one wants to go back to as the building is stunning and I feel sure they are constantly evolving and developing their customer offering.",5,2022,10,16
118,High Chai ,"Excellent!!! Ambience, Food and service was amazing. I went with my family as a belated Mother‚Äôs Day treat, we had a vegetarian high chia which as well as the tea, the food was also refillable. Good value for money. The chef jomon personally came to the tables was very pleasant and really added that extra attentiveness and you could see that he was passionate about the food and that customers were happy. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience and pleasantly surprised with the special treat at the end from Lalit. A big big thank you .",5,2022,10,15
118,First Time at LaLit London,"Staying at the LaLit for the first time . After an initial hiccup regarding SLH benefits they came through  with a great upgrade .  Property is truly amazing , rooms well sized and decorated .  

Breakfast room / restaurant is absolutely stunning. Even if you don‚Äôt stay , stop by for breakfast / dinner. 

My lovely young waiter Shaon suggested the Indian breakfast pancake .  It was excellent . Extremely friendly and well spoken young man. Thanks again for convincing me to try the pancake .  

Happy to have finally added the LaLit to our London hotel stays. ",5,2022,10,14
118,Great Indian food with attentive service,The great ambience and delicious food. I had a great time while visiting Lalit hotel.I was meeting my close friend after many years and it was perfect place to catch up. Service staff was very attentive and extended warm hospitality.,5,2022,10,13
118,Awesome,"Loved the hospitality and service. 
Excellent food and the person who served us Atchyu was brilliant. Just loved every bit of it.The ambience of restaurant is amazing and the food right from the drinks to main course and desert was awesome!!

118,VERY POOR 5 STAR EXPERIENCE,"I would not rate this resort as a five star accommodation other than for the historical building and city location( Tower bridge and Tooley street are the place to be when in London].No room service (dinner)at midnight was available,the Tower suite was booked for three and towels provided just for two.At 5pm a member of staff was pushing to enter the room and tidy it up even when guests were inside and having a rest.
Cleaning products were just basic and the third bed provided for an adult was literally a rolling single bed, not what you expect from a luxury accommodation.
Breakfast was not the full English one, croissants were not fresh, juices were blended with water,a very limited choice  of products on a small table was offered.
Cleaning was good and personnel very kind and polite, special mention to concierge Mr Fabrice, always on the run to fulfill requests and needs.Also Udele at reception is  worth to be mentioned!.",2,2022,10,09
118,"An amazing stay at Lalit London, must compliment the amazing team they have put together.","My stay at the St Olave Suite at Lalit, London earlier this month was every bit comfortable with always eager to serve staff. In case you have a weakness towards Indian cuisine then their hot breakfast option along with a pot of cardamom infused Lalit tea is something you will look forward to. Baluchi was a wonderful experience with cooked to perfection my favourite Indian dishes. Chicken tikka and tandoored prawns were lip smacking and the Lucknowi Biriyani was absolutely divine. If you are looking at a side to Indian breads then try dal Baluchi. The property carries the mark of old times in a beautiful way and a well stocked bar is a perfect to enjoy a drink or two in the Teachers room before calling it a night. And if that wasn't enough the luxury boutique hotel boasts of an impressive location just a few minutes walk from the tower bridge .",5,2022,10,08
118,Simply the best.,"The Lalit is a fabulous hotel. The location is excellent so it is very easy to see the sights of London.  The staff are brilliant. They are very helpful and nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are beautifully appointed and spotlessly clean, with a fabulous ensuite shower room.  The breakfast in the morning is excellent with lots of different choices, especially the full Indian. The whole ambience of the hotel is calm, quiet and serene. We absolutely loved the whole experience and will definitely stay again. ",5,2022,10,06
118,Lunch time birthday treat,"We visited the LA Lit Hotel to have lunch in Baluchi pan Asian restaurant and were not disappointed.
Situated in the old St Olaves school on Tooley Street the decor did not disappoint, beautiful dark blue chandeliers hung from the ceiling and dark wood panel mixed well with the Asian theme.
Our waitress Sujeethra  was attentive and  happy to explain  the different lunch time  choices, all staff looked very smart in their uniforms and were friendly.
Food was delicious and drinks choices especially good.
Fairly pricey for a lunch time but this was a birthday treat after all.
We had a peek around the hotel before leaving and were impressed with what we saw of this boutique hotel.
Even the toilets were impressive with the heated loo seats and array of personal hygiene gadgets in each cubicle.
We would recommend eating here it was a lovely experience with good atmosphere.
",5,2022,10,04
118,Amazingly tasty and well balanced Indian Afternoon Tea. Impeccable service.,"What a venue, menu, impeccable front of house service and delicious and perfectly balanced Indian afternoon. 

Sujeethra made the three of us like the only ones in the room, making sure we had everything we needed before we did. And what a smile.

The venue luxurious and magical.",5,2022,10,04
118,Afternoon tea to die for,"Came for an Indian themed afternoon tea as a birthday celebration and it was spectacular. Our server - Sujeethra - was fabulous, too. Yes it's expensive, but it was so worth it. Immaculate service and superb quality food.",5,2022,10,04
118,A very comfortable Stay,"This is such a great hotel. It's close to the train station and tower bridge, this is a historic building, the architecture is stunning. I love that they leaned into the history of the building for inspiration for the decor because it was previously a school, you have rooms that are called classrooms, there's a teacher's room ( the bar), the headmaster's room, the great hall etc which is really cool. Despite the school theme, the decor also has a very spa-like quality, the entrance even smells like one which I found very relaxing.  The rooms are clean, comfortable and had great amenities. The staff are friendly and attentive, particularly Fabrice from Concierge.",5,2022,10,03
118,Afternoon tea,"We booked afternoon tea for my husband's birthday. The staff were ever so welcoming from the moment we walked in. The Chef made an effort to come and speak to us too as my 9 year old very particular about the food she eats. 
The food was delicious. I'd definitely come back. Ranjna",5,2022,10,02
118,Not a 5 star Hotel!,"Whilst we were impressed with the history and the building itself, as well as the size of the room, there were some things that fell short of our expectations for a 5 star hotel given the rate.

1. The hotel lacked the atmosphere for a 5 star hotel, things like the entrance were poorly sign-posted and no real sense of being welcomed into a 5 star hotel.
2. We were never informed of the check out or breakfast time and location, having to call reception twice to check these.
3. We had some room service and contacted the reception to ask the plates left outside our room to be removed, they were still there the next day even upon checking out.
4. The room had noticeable chunks of peeling paint in the corners, something we also noticed in other areas like the dining hall
5. The toiletries in the bathroom were made up of different brands, making us question whether they were products left by previous guests.
6. The continental breakfast was pretty basic for a 5 star hotel and the Indian hot breakfast was greasy.

Overall our stay lacked the 5 star experience given how much we paid for the stay and we were left a little disappointed. Before  posting this review on TripAdvisor as was requested by staff on checking out I did inform the Hotel Manager - Harshit Vyas via email of our feedback but have not heard anything back unfortunatley.

Thanks

118,Exceptional service,"From the moment you enter this luxury boutique hotel near Tower Bridge you are made to feel very welcome and very special. Attentive staff led by the manager Harshit, are very positive and helpful. The rooms are very comfortable and well equipped. Then, to cap it all, the restaurant serving delicious Indian food, overseen by the head chef Joman, provides a splendid culinary experience. Breakfast is delightful, the Indian option of chilli omelette and potato dhosa proving to be the best choice! All restaurant staff were brilliant.
Overall, an excellent stay and we will definitely return.",5,2022,09,30

118,The Top Notch,I regret not staying at The Lalit as I was not aware that there is an Indian brand in London. I was strolling with my family and came across this beautiful hotel. Instantly I knew what to do. I made myself comfortable at The Balouchi restaurant & ordered High Chai & Indian food. Service was fantastic. I left happy and came back after two days for dinner and was told that walk-ins are not allowed at the restaurant. I mentioned to F & B Manager about me having lunch two days ago as a walk-in guest &  after a short stay at the bar we were allowed to have dinner. Food is delicious & to us it tasted best out of all the Indian restaurants we dined in London & Southampton. Chef Jomon checked on our food which was cool. I am staying at Lalit next time I visit London & will highly recommend it to fellow travelers.,5,2022,09,27

118,Outstanding service and the quality of food is amazing.,"I had organised my brothers birthday lunch at Lalit. I had arranged everything with the restaurant beforehand and when we had arrived at the restaurant even though it was busy, Chef Jomon personally came and greated us and took time out of his busy schedule to make us feel welcomed and informed us about the history of the building which made our experience very special. We were a group of 5 some pure veg and some of us pure non veg eaters. We were catered to an epitome of customer service but he entire team. The food very delicious, moreover the plating of the food and the decor of the place gives you a complete premium feel. The people that were providing the service were doing it with passion, may that be geeting the customers, preparing the food or serving it. It was an amazing experience overall. ",5,2022,09,24

Chef Joemon is a gem who made special lamb chop dish for us which was amazingly delicious , well done and very juicy . When the food on your table is served by someone with lot of love and passion as the secret sauce the taste would automatically be out of the world .. and I am not surprised since this dish came as a signature dish from the most humble executive chef joemon :) ‚Ä¶when it is gelled with this rich ambience it just made our day‚Ä¶ thank you chef joemon and Lalit for the warm welcome and hospitality ‚ù§Ô∏è.. we would Definitely come back  ‚Ä¶ and I do recommend this to everyone who want to experience an exceptional hospitality üëçüèª",5,2022,09,24

Recommend 100% for anybody visiting with family/ friends. The tower bridge is less than a minute walk for a beautiful morning/ evening walks.

118,Amazing experience at Lalit,"Home food away from home. I guess that sums up the amazing dinner experience at Lalit, London. What was the icing on cake was pleasing and absolutely wonderful service by Natalia and her team. Must visit if u are missing home food.",5,2022,09,21

118,Very disappointed,"This hotel has been a bad experience from when we checked in.
I called on our way to the hotel & was promised a call back to answer the question I asked, but did not receive this call back.
Once we got to our room it was on the top floor and really noisy with extraction dans, so we decided to go to the bar for a drink where the staff was more interested in watching a film / TV on their phone, so we took our drinks back to the room, before asking to change where we was offered a disabled bedroom & told they was no other rooms even though I could book another room online & when I questioned this I was told I could pay extra to change rooms which I was not going to do!

Thus is not a 5 star hotel, very disappointing.",1,2022,09,18
118,Anniversary visit,"We had dinner at the Lalit restaurant and it was awesome, absolutely beautiful food. Top quality. The staff were so great and made us feel so welcome. Best food ever. Would recommend for everyone to come.",5,2022,09,17

Highly recommended!! The food was delicious and one of the best Indian food I‚Äôve had!! Will definitely be returning in the near future!!",5,2022,09,15
118,Terrible check in/out service and no empathy,"The check in and check out process was extremely poor and ended up with the hotel charging my business card for 2 rooms that should have been paid for personally when I specified exactly which rooms were which. I lleft a pair of diamond earrings in the room and despite the fact no one had checked into the room these have not been found. Most disappointing though is the way I was spoken to when I rang to discuss this. It was an immediate ""no they haven't been found"" without even asking what room etc. There was no empathy for me at all. I had to insist that they re-checked the room as they didn't want to help. I have emailed the manager, sales team etc since and they haven't had the courtesy to reply. I expected better for a supposedly 5 star hotel. I will never stay again.",1,2022,09,13
118,Good not great,"The staff are very friendly and the rooms are nice but we had a couple of frustrations. 1. The shower did not drain which meant I couldn‚Äôt have a morning shower. 2. Breakfast took far too long in the morning, took time to take my order then another 30+ minutes to receive. It was great once it arrived. The bar also very quiet and lacks atmosphere. I liked the stay but would I stay again for the price  probably not.",4,2022,09,10
118,Disappointing for a supposedly quality boutique hotel.,Stayed for one night in a senior room. Public spaces and rooms lol lol nice however there is no way of locking the room from the inside which isn‚Äôt great as a lone female guest.  Someone tried to access my right room  (allegedly housekeeping) while I was in it and the do not disturb light was on which was unsettling. When I tried to phone to complain I discovered the phone in the room didn‚Äôt work and had to resort to calling from my mobile. Not impressed,2,2022,09,06
118,Outstanding !!,"Visited with my family for a birthday and found the hotel absolutely outstanding. The staff was professional, courteous and very accommodating. Had a lovely dinner, with some great cocktails. Special mention to Abdul, Natalia and the team as they were great. Chef Jomon‚Äôs food was amazing so kudos to whole team that made our experience and evening special. Thank you to the team at Lalit London.",5,2022,09,03
118,Just amazing,Came back to the Lalit London after 2 years. Except for the tall manager all the staff was almost new but the new team was the best I have ever experienced in any hotel in London. We ate in the Baluchi and met our favorite chef Jomon who informed us that he is now the executive chef. The food was as always the best also won't shy away from mentioning world's best toto toilets with the heated toilet seats. The staff at the reception were extremely helpful and friendly. See you in December.,5,2022,08,31
118,"Amazing experience great food, beautiful building and great atmosphere....",We visited the restaurant The Baluchi and it was the best experience ever. Coming from Birmingham we are always looking for Indian food which tastes like back home and the Baluchi just nailed that accompanied with an excellent service from Abdul and Natalia. All the staff at Lalit was friendly and welcoming with good knowledge of whereabouts. Since my daughter suffers from nut allergy the head chef Jomon made sure he coated our table to assure all the food we ordered was nut free. I had a lovely evening at The Lalit and would greatly recommend this place.,5,2022,08,31
118,Beautiful place but ...,"A beautiiful hotel, very polite and efficient staff but facilities rather disappointing. A 5 star hotel in central London with no room service or restaurant open after 10.30pm.. Quality of breakfast also less than 100% - bacon had appearance and texture of having been sitting around already cooked for some time. Gorgeous bathroom but the complimentary small tubes of shampoo etc. had clearly been used by previous guest and were half empty. So, all iin all, not quite up to what one expects from a 5 star hotel.",3,2022,08,28
118,A little less ordinary,A fabulous hotel where the staff could not be any more pleasant and friendly. The hotel itself is an old grammar school. The building is beautiful.the breakfast were extremely delicious and we waited no time to be served. ,5,2022,08,15
118,Awful experience,"This hotel charged me twice for my stay and did not refund for 10 days. I doubt if they would have refunded at all if I had not made a fuss. Harshit was full of smarm on the phone but their actual customer service is awful. A number of things did not work in our room and the bar closed at 11pm, something they did not mention when we checked in at 10.30 pm after a really long journey. The spa was not operating and neither was the restaurant at that time.  I would not recommend this hotel. They will probably reply with the standard Namaste etc... All for show and insincere",1,2022,08,13
118,Seriously? This is considered a 5-star hotel??,"We came here a day early from our booked date. After an exhausting and miserable trip coming from Paris with 1 cancelled train ride and 2 delayed rides, we were treated the same way as our trip‚Ä¶ poor and terrible. We were told when we came in that there was no regular rooms available other than suites which was priced at 420 pounds for the night. But then, after looking through booking.com and going through chase travel/expedia, we found a regular classroom for 200 pounds. Booked it and showed to the front desk, then Shivani changed demeanor and said, oh yes we do have an available regular room but it‚Äôs for the ‚Äúphysically challenged‚Äù. Asked her, ‚Äúso now a room‚Äôs suddenly available??‚Äù What a joke. I guess that‚Äôs the business of upselling, huh? Can‚Äôt believe it. First time in London and initially treated as such. She made us feel incompetent, totally unacceptable. Look elsewhere for other hotels. Not a 5-star, definitely customer service is not.",1,2022,08,10
118,Extremely disappointing,"This has to be the worst experience we have ever had at a hotel.  Having booked to stay in the Lalit legacy suite we arrived and were checked in given our key and headed up to our room.  As we opened the door someone shouted go away I'm sleeping!!  We left the room and found a member of staff coming towards us saying she was sorry we had been given the wrong room.  She then took us to the room next door, A Lalit suite -  not the room we had booked and paid for.  We said that the room was not acceptable and she said that they had 2 legacy suites and this was the other one.  This was so obviously not true as to be laughable.  The room we were shown to could hardly be called a suite ( putting a sofa at the end of a bed does not make a suite).  I would say this room was an executive double at best.  If you sat on the sofa you could not watch the TV as you were so close to it.  We said the room was not acceptable to us and she offered us ¬£50 of for the night and we could move the next day. Frankly insulting so we asked to see her manager. She said her manager was in a meeting and so my husband suggested she knock on the door and get her out.  When she arrived she came with somewhat of an attitude.  She also said the second room was also a legacy suite.  We pointed out that that was not what it said on their website or indeed on the sign outside the rooms.  She said the website was wrong.  Really??  Eventually she said I shouldn't really tell you but the person in the first room is paying ¬£600 for the night.  Not really sure what difference that made other than to make us more upset as the man sleeping in the bed we had booked was paying less than we were!! Eventually we were offered ¬£150 reduction and dinner in the restaurant and we could move the next day.  At this point we were tired and hungry so reluctantly agreed.  When we went to the room to freshen up before dinner we noticed there were no hand towels in the bathroom.  When we went down to eat I asked for some hand towels to be put in the room and was told that hand towels were only put in the rooms upon request!  All we had were 2 bath towels and 4 face cloths!  After dinner no towels had arrived so the next morning we had to ask for some to be sent to the room.  Just getting someone to answer the phone was a mission in itself.  When we went out the next day we were told our bags would be moved to the other room once it had been serviced.  I asked for hand towels and they arrived.  The continental breakfast was not value for money and we only had it the once.  On out third day when we went our at 1:15 the room still had not been serviced.  I asked that hand towels were put in the room as this was obviously a problem.  You guessed it no hand towels upon our return.  Surely if a guest askes for something on day one then a note should be made for the rest of their stay.  To add insult to injury when we were ready to leave my husband called for help with our luggage to be told that it was self service for luggage.  5 star I don't think so.  I am so angry about this stay that I am writing to SLH as we have stayed at many of their hotels before.  I will suggest that they return to the hotel unannounced and reevaluate it.",1,2022,07,18
118,Disappointment. Not 5 star experience,"This stay was a disappointment.

Each time we decide to go for a 5 star hotel, we expect flawless, stressless, no struggle experience. 
Well, that was not at the Lalit. 
Our room was right next to a hallway door which bangs every 5 minutes with people opening and closing, sending shockwaves in our room and the noise was constant. 
Also, try calling the front desk is also a pain. No one ever picks up the phone. 
If you wanted to relax during your stay because the hotel has a spa, well sorry, it is simply closed.",1,2022,07,12
118,Spent my 10 year anniversary at The Lalit London,"My wife and I decided to spend our 10 year anniversary in London and chose to stay at The Lalit London. From the moment we walked we were treated like royalty. I‚Äôve staying in many hotels but the attention to detail at The Lalit London was absolutely  amazing. Our bags were taken to our suite by a very friendly member of staff which gave us the opportunity to explore the facilities which were vast and of course the restaurant and bar which was my favourite. A fantastic selection of drinks and exquisite selection of food to please anyone. We stayed for the night and the room was spacious and extremely comfortable. We had a traditional  Indian breakfast in the morning (although the full English looked amazing as well) washed down with traditional Indian tea‚Ä¶ Perfect!

I would like to say a personal thank you to the General Manager Harshit Vyas who was extremely welcoming, courteous and a true professional.

I look forward to my next visit!",5,2022,07,06
118,"Wedding ceremony at the Great Hall, Lalit, London","A resplendent hotel and exquisitely maintained. The arrangements were perfect, staff  well informed, alive to all the needs of the guests. Service was faultless. The GM took personal responsibility for the arrangements and his team were well organised, and above all, managed the whole event with aplomb and  
Rooms well appointed, great view and well lit. The bathrooms were quite superb - great shower, the Japanese heated toilets for all round comfort
Food: Breakfast was delicious and catered specifically for the taste of the guests. No request was deemed impossible and the service impeccable

Overall: Outstanding in all respects",5,2022,06,28
118,Restaurant,"I dined here with friends  for the first time recently and had a fabulous evening. Stunning venue, excellent food and impeccable service from the moment we arrived for drinks at the bar. A fantastic experience and a magical escape away from the hustle and bustle of central London. Elegant, classy,  old school charm with a modern, majestic twist.",5,2022,06,19
118,Great Stay and Excellent Service,"Beautiful hotel in a former grammar school. Our rooms had high ceilings and great natural light from huge windows. There are black-out shades but they did not darken the room completely. This might be an issue for some. Great bathrooms and very comfortable beds.
Staff was excellent especially concierge Frabrice. We had a slight hiccup at check and he went above and beyond to try to rectify it. You rarely see people that committed to customer service. Bravo.
This was my first time staying on the South Bank of the Thames and I was worried it might feel a little removed from the areas we wanted to visit. I needn't have worried because the London Bridge Station was just a 5 minute jaunt away that made accessing the rest of the city a breeze.
The only negative for me was the included breakfast. It was not good. Stick to the coffee and pastries and you should be fine. I went once during my stay and did not return.
Many amenities nearby - coffee shops, restaurants, Tescos.
Great value for money.",4,2022,06,19
118,GREAT HIDDEN GEM,"We had a wonderful one night at Lalit!  Check in was personal and swift.  The staff is attentive, and very friendly.  The room was quiet and well suite for 2 people.  The shower was very strong.  We stayed one night and our room came with breakfast which was delicious.  The location in Tower Bridge was close to so many pubs etc and on the River Thames.  Highly recommend the hotel.",5,2022,06,18
118,Hidden Regal 'Gem' in the heart of London Bridge,"I am blown away with the exceptional service at this beautiful hotel. I went there for a special celebration for dinner recently - the hospitality, food and service was incredible. The hotel has a relaxing atmosphere and the staff make you feel welcomed and special. 

The manager Harshit Vyas is a great host, he made sure that my guests were comfortable and ensured that we had a memorable evening. The waitress who was looking after us, Natalia was very attentive and friendly. If you want pure authentic Indian home-made food, this is the place to go!  As it was a special celebration, the chef created a special bespoke dessert which was delicious. The food was divine and has a selection of dishes which cater for vegetarians and vegans. 

The service  is amazing! I have visited many times with friends  - I recommend the Indian afternoon tea which is very creative and delicious. The restaurant is stunning and glamorous with beautiful sapphire chandeliers, which helps you escape from the outside world. 

The building has so much history, do visit the 'Headmaster's Room' which is a peaceful haven for drinks with friends and family. The hotel is not over-crowded either, it s a boutique hotel in the heart of London Bridge, over-looking Tower Bridge and the river. It is a great location for visitors and tourists. 

Do visit this wonderful Hotel, whether it is for an after work drinks, dinner or a relaxing tea, you will be impressed by the beautiful ambiance and immaculate service! This is all due to the great management and customer service.  A huge thanks to Harsht Vyas for making his guests feel like royalty!",5,2022,06,07
118,Lovely experience at LaLit,"Had drinks and dinner at LaLit on 2nd June for a special celebration. Everything was perfect from start to finish. Delicious food and excellent, friendly service. What made it extra special was the ambience - it's rare to find a place that allows for conversation and LaLit thankfully did not have 'music' blaring from loudspeakers. I have no hesitation in recommending it and will definitely visit again when I can.

Thank you to everybody for a memorable evening.",5,2022,06,04
118,"Lovely hotel, will stay again","Hotel was very peaceful and the room was very nice. The Hotel was very clean and staff were extremely helpful even rushing to open doors for us. Breakfast was delicious. All facilities were open except the spa. Great location for Tower of London, the Shard etc",5,2022,06,03
118,Stunning Boutique Hotel,"The building is a stunning conversion of an historic school with wonderful British Architecture surrounded by beautifully planted gardens.
The service was great, with lovely Indian food. The manager Harshit was the perfect host. I highly recommend Lallit  it‚Äôs a unique place!",5,2022,06,02
118,Unique & delicious  high tea,"I had high tea and it was fantastic. The service is amazing and the food was delicious. The approachable chef, Jomon, shared his inspiration for the menu which was to take the guest on a tour of India with all the different flavors and bites. Also, the atmosphere was lovely. I highly recommend!",5,2022,05,31
118,Enjoyable Stay - will be back!,"We stayed for one night and overall very impressed. The initial room itself was fine, but we noticed a couple of things, firstly there was an odd smell in the room and secondly the phone wasn't connected/plugged in. When we connected the phone and tried to order room service, it took us straight through to reception and eventually had to phone again and ask to be put through to the right team. We were offered another room, on the same floor and this room was much better.

The real highlight for us was the evening meal at Baluchis restaurant. The food was amazing, especially the paneer dishes and would thoroughly recommend this if you are looking for Indian fine dinning. As part of our booking, breakfast was included and again, the food was top class.

We definitely intend to make this an annual visit!

Well done to all the staff who were very friendly & helpful.",5,2022,05,24
118,Outstanding dinner,"Went with a group of 20 work colleagues. Firstly the booking process was simple and left the menu to be designed by the team. The dining room in itself is beautiful with high ceilings.

The food was superb,mustard tandoori salmon, butter chicken, dal , spinach, rasmalai and gulab jamun. Flavourful and great presentation.

The team looked after us , thank you Harsit, Raj, Jaimon Chef who even came to the table to speak to us.

All in all a fantastic experience and throughly recommended.

Thank you team Lalit .",5,2022,05,17
118,"Excellent location, many amenities not available","Negative: someone entered our room without knocking, tv didn‚Äôt work well, many amenities not available eg. Room service and restaurant. Telephone to call reception not working. We called for it to be fixed but not fixed. Quite expensive.

Positive: good location, stunning building",2,2022,05,15
118,Delicious authentic Indian meal,"Just had the pleasure of a stunning Indian meal at Baluchis Indian restaurant, which is based in the 5 star Lalit Hotel. Many thanks to Harshit and his team for the excellent hospitality and service. Equipped with a tandoori oven this kitchen provides some of the finest authentic Indian food in London. I highly recommend the dal, which I'd as good as any I've tasted. Thanks again, and we'll be back soon",5,2022,05,12
118,Beautiful hotel let down by mediocre service,"Pros;
-beautiful building steeped in history
-excellent location
-unique, impressive looking rooms 
-beautiful interior
-there are some good deals to be had 

Cons;
-service was slow, awkward and lacking in the restaurant, bar and at check in. Ironically, the man on check out was the most friendly and professional of our stay.
-breakfast was poor; tasteless, oily, and poor service. Not 5 star at all.
-room had some scuffs here and there - not 5 star 

Would we stay again? For the right price and we'd eat off site. That kind of defeats the object a little doesn't it?",3,2022,05,07
118,Best ever,"At Last! A hotel that gets it right! Beautiful rooms, clean, elegant and in the best position possible for Tower Bridge and the Sky garden. 
My only regret is not having 2 nights because it was so luxurious and sophisticated. 
Many thanks, Suzi Taylor and Sacha Francis",5,2022,05,03
118,3 nights London,"Stayed here for 3 nights whilst working Canary Warf. Room clean good size, great location loads of bars resto's nearby. Borough market 10mins away. 
Great place to use as base to explore london. Just by the river so lots of walking opportunities. Tube nearby too.",5,2022,04,16
118,Held money against a card for nearly ¬£1000 - even though I settled in full on departure,"Stayed for 3 nights in March, and still arguing trying to get ¬£955 back, even though I settled in full on departure.  

My real issue is the service.  They brand themselves as a high-end boutique hotel but are lacking in providing a good ""Customer experience"".   Worse than this, they are slow to respond, difficult to communicate with, and disinterested in solving the problem.  They are even refusing to details - so that my bank can ""void"" the charges.

Kanchan Das should be ashamed of her responses and look for work outside of the hospitality industry.  Looking through other reviews - it would also appear I'm not the only person battling the same issues.  

Namaskar and have a nice day!  I shall never be using your hotel or the SLH chain/brand again.",1,2022,04,12
118,Terrible amateurish bar,"We called in for a drink post theatre. We ordered vodka martinis, but the barman did not know how to make them and did not have basic ingredients behind the bar, such as a lemon. He added candied fruit and other odd ingredients creating an undrinkable cocktail. Not only that, my husband waited at the bar for 25 minutes for the cocktails to be made. Disastrous and unprofessional. Shame, because it's a great location and lovely setting.",2,2022,04,11
118,Relaxing Stay in Lovely Boutique Hotel,"We stayed two nights in a ""senior classroom"" (Room 201) which was a bright double aspect room with views of the Shard and the river.

The room was a decent size, beautifully furnished and with a comfortable bed. 

The bathroom had a walk in shower rather than a bath tub and the high tech ""Japanese toilet"" always has a warm seat! Rather surprisingly there were no hand towels, just very large bath towels.

Breakfast was good enough and staff always friendly.

One minor issue was the safe did not work in our room, fortunately we did not need to use it, we did report it to reception staff but it did not get fixed.

The position of the hotel is very good for river walks, Tower Bridge, HMS Belfast etc. and we would return. Pricing is acceptable for the quality level.",5,2022,04,11
118,Very positive experience,"We were there for 2 nights. Very comfortable room, great breakfast and very helpful staff. 

I unfortunately forgot some items in my room safe when I left back home. 

The concierge and security staff are absolute professionals and took care of the matter perfectly. They take their job and the safety of their guests very seriously. This deserves the utmost respect and speaks for the hotel!

I absolutely recommend the hotel and will stay at The Lalit again on my next stay in London.",5,2022,04,11
118,Charged twice for completely unimpressive stay. Avoid this hotel!,"My family stayed at The Lalit hotel London for a weekend in March.

When we arrived Fabrice the receptionist asked me to sign some forms. They were so faintly printed and the light so dim I asked him what they said as I could not read it. He said they were for the room booking and to keep a charge on my card of ¬£300, which I was not really happy about. No copies were given to me. Having just arrived and feeling excited for the weekend, I did not feel making a fuss at this point would be a good thing.
I was quite happy and excited to be staying at Lalit London when we arrived, (our first time staying in central London), but he really did put a dampener on things from the start. I tried to be friendly to him to no avail. He neglected to tell us (I think we arrived at about 10.30/45pm) that the bar was shortly closing, so when we came down with our sons for a drink the barman said the bar was closed, and he didn‚Äôt know anywhere else to get a drink. We had just arrived and had a long journey including flight and train and just wanted one drink and a relax with our teenage sons, but was told there was no room service either.

I related these concerns to the delightful, checked suit wearing manager on Saturday morning who was extremely pleasant. He made apologies and thanked me for my input, and sent a very pleasant man from the security team to help me with the safe which I could not get working.

I also did email about 2 weeks prior to coming (via message service from booking.com I think) to ask if my sons could have separate quilts for the bed, as my sons are not used to sharing a room let alone a bed. This did not happen, but the boys managed, so I did not mention it as I was conscious of a long list building up.

Also, I was extremely disappointed to find that the restaurant was not open for lunch, and neither was the spa available. There was not even a bath in the ensuite, and only 2 tiny milk cartons for the tea and coffee. When I was young, my parents had a friend from the north of England, and he had a phrase most applicable to the Lalit London: ‚ÄòAll fur coat and no knickers‚Äô. LaLit London looks splendid, and is in a really special location, but actually that‚Äôs all there is, looks and location. 

Your receptionist on checking out said that the ¬£300 charge on my account would be available for me in 3-5 working days, which I found shocking since I had nothing to pay, and this unavailability of my own money  was not made clear to me ever. The charge was in fact for 7 days. Taking my card number in case of extras is ok, and was explained by Mr. Checked Suit. But actually stopping me using my own money? I am not comfortable with giving my card number out like this, and my feelings have been justified by the following:
On my return home I checked my bank account to find that ¬£873.70 has been removed by LalIt hotel from my account without authorisation or notification when I had already paid via paypal on booking.com. This really has lent insult to injury. I phoned the accounts team, emailed the bookings.com receipt and Stutik phoned me (very polite and pleasant and excellent phone manner in an unpleasant situation) to say that the money was indeed taken in error, and would be put back in my account in the next day or two. Not the case. It was in fact back in my account 8 days later. When I pay my bills I pay online the funds are available to whomever I paid immediately, so why couldn't they do the same? It was not a refund for goods or services. It was an illegal transaction of their doing. I am also now worried they will make another mistake and take more funds out. 
Harshit the general manager did email to apologise, but has since disregarded my numerous emails asking for comments on the other things I mentioned. I also emailed Lalit‚Äôs head office in India, and they have also ignored me.

I expect that Harshit would like to reply to this by saying:
Dear Guest,
Namaskaar!
Thank you for the feedback. We are sorry to hear that you didn‚Äôt enjoy your stay at The Lalit London. Our endeavour has always been to deliver the best levels of service, but we are concerned about the feedback.
Your feedback has been taken with highest priority and shared with the concerned department who has, in turn, counselled the respective teams.
We would also like to assure you that every feedback is very important to us and that every possible attempt will be made to ensure that these issues are resolved.
We look forward to welcoming you again at the LaLit London soon.
Thank you

But he probably won‚Äôt now as I‚Äôve said it for him. I wish I had read the Tripadvisor reviews before booking. A lesson learned, as I have since found that this is not the first time.

Overall my experience of LaLit London has been extremely disappointing. I have spent extra time chasing up my own money because of a mistake by the hotel, and just feel I should have booked a different hotel with a restaurant available for lunch and dinner, a spa, room service, a bar, enthusiastic reception staff that don‚Äôt overcharge me by ¬£823.70....

I will never ever visit again, and definitely would not recommend it to anyone. They have a few charming staff members (not enough name badges worn), but however charming they are does not make up for the disappointment I have in LaLit London and its lack of facilities and absolutely awful financial efficiency.",1,2022,04,09
118,Friendly boutique hotel in a great location,"I chose this hotel due to it's location and I'm so glad we stayed here instead of a large hotel. The hotel was finished to a high standard with what use to be a grammar school hall, changed into a restaurant with an amazing high ceiling. The building has been tastefully renovated and our room was comfortable with a lovely ensuite. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly which made our stay even better. A good place to stay if you're looking for more than just a room to sleep in.",5,2022,03,29
118,Impeccable in every way.,"This hotel is immaculate.  Beautiful rooms, impeccably presented.  The staff are attentive but not in your face.  This is proper old fashioned service at its best.  The location is probably the best in London for tourists and I look forward to going back when I'm not on business.  My only negative is Baluchi, the Indian restaurant, was closed so we went to Brick Lane which was frankly disgusting.",5,2022,03,27
118,Not worth 5 stars,When we arrived to the hotel room vents above the bed were coated in dust above our heads. In the hotel room description it said ‚Äúcity view‚Äù we were facing buildings. No windows opened and room was super hot. Staff were kind. Floor was covered in crumbs etc especially under the bed. Okay hotel but definitely not worth the money for it being a ‚Äúfive star hotel‚Äù,3,2022,03,22
118,Beautiful smallish boutique hotel,"So this is a smallish hotel full of character. A converted school with a beautiful hall that serves as the main restaurant. Rooms were tastefully decorated and bathrooms very smart. Loved the hi tech Japanese toilet too. My only disappointment was that the spa was closed, I was told due to covid but there are no covid restrictions in the UK anymore so that seemed odd. Anyways I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll change soon.",5,2022,03,19
118,Business Lunch,I had visited this place for a business lunch and had an amazing time. The ambience of this place is fantastic along with the incredible service. Top it up with the awesome food served by Chef Jomon and even a business lunch can turn into a memorable evening. Looking forward to more business and personal events at The Lalit London.,5,2022,03,17
118,The Lalit London,"I visited The Lalit London, for business. The hotel is beautiful and within a lovely location. The hotel has a great restaurant. The staff were very accommodating, the food cooked by Chef Jomon was amazing and the fish was cooked to perfection. I highly recommend a visit to The Lalit London, and I am sure my next visit, will be an overnight stay.",5,2022,03,16
118,Business Lunch,"Fantastic venue, fabulous food, great pricing, excellent venue and Chef Jomon is one of the best and dynamic Indian Chef's in UK.

Very organised team and hospitality was brilliant. The bar served some equisite drinks and pricing is fair comparing to other pubs in this area.",5,2022,03,16
118,Excellent Food and Service,"Remarkable experience at Lalit's last week. Chef Jomon brought flavours from all parts of India in our lunchtime menu. 
I have tried Indian food in numerous places in London but Chef Jomon's food was extraordinary. Everysingle dish was made and presented to us in fabolous manner. I also came to know that Chef Jomon came on Masterchef and I have no doubt about his abilities. 

Fantastic Service and I would recommend this place to everyone.",5,2022,03,16
118,Great location great staff,"Perfect place to see the tower bridge from and lovely location to be in London. great restaurant, specially borough market. A must visit place in London. 

The staff is friendly and courteous, good room with great views.",5,2022,03,08
118,perfect family stay,"Everything you could want from a luxury stay in the centre of London but without any of the pompousness of some places. The slight nod towards the group's Indian roots while still keeping the grandeur and history of the building its set in was very impressive. The staff were excellent, especially Moses at the bar, and the main hall where you eat is so special as is hotel's location in general, perfect. We travelled with our 6 mouth old and would definitely recommend this hotel for families as well.",5,2022,03,07
118,Amazing food at an extraordinary location by a passionate Chef !,"A classic old school renovated to the highest possible standard without losing its legacy. 

We had an awesome evening with Chef Jomon and team at Lalit on our anniversary day. We experienced the flavour filled high tea here which took us back to our childhood memories.

Chef Jomon is really passionate about food and explained us the concept of High tea. The staff are very polite and friendly.
The food is delicious and its a real luxury in the heart of London.

Highly recommended.",5,2022,03,04
118,A perfect break,"This was our third visit at the Lalit but the first after the covid. The restaurant was still closed but we enjoyed the cooked English breakfast. The stay was a very relaxing. Not Manu staff but always there to assist with a smile. Breakfast team were very polite. Tried few new cocktails in the teachers bar. 
We really enjoyed our stay which was much needed. Will be back soon.",5,2022,02,27
118,Luxurious couples break,"Great evening away. We stayed in LaLit suite, having stayed in a Classroom previously the suite was obviously bigger and felt instantly relaxing on arrival. As usual all soft drinks included and we ordered room service drinks late evening which arrived quickly. The hotel kept our luggage until much later in the day and the area around the hotel is improving with every visit. Many restaurants to choose from and a lovely riverside walk.",5,2022,02,22
118,Superb service and fantastic food! ,"Had high chai at Lalit for Valentine's Day and it was a wonderful experience from start to end. We were greeted by a very polite staff member who showed us to our table and explained the process. Within minutes we were attended to by the lovely Sujeetra, who explained the various Indian foods included and poured us the delicious freshly brewed chai. She proceeded to make sure we were always topped up with tea or mango lassi whenever our glasses were empty. 
We were also given impeccable customer service by Haysten, who introduced himself and made sure we had everything we needed. He even topped up one of our food plates so we could enjoy some more of the selection, which we really felt set Lalit apart from most other places in the best way. 
The atmosphere was lovely and relaxed and it was really nice to feel like we were well cared for by all the staff. Even the chef came out to wish us a happy Valentine's Day, which we thought was really nice. 
I've already recommended Lalit to several friends and colleagues and will continue to do so. The food was fantastic, the atmosphere serene, but it was the staff and their friendly and caring service that really made the experience impeccable. Many thanks to everyone working at Lalit on 14th February!

118,Return to my old school to enjoy 4 generations of my now family,100% in all areas. Afternoon Chai that was great food and exceptional service. The experience was perfect from the moment we drove in and were received. To cater for a family ranging from 98 to 1.5 years old was never going to be easy but everything worked perfectly.,5,2022,02,14
118,Superb dinner - highly recommended,"The Lalit was St Olave's grammar school before being converted to a boutique hotel. I was a pupil there 50 years ago and am delighted to see the way it has been stylishly modernised, whilst retaining much of the architectural beauty of the original building. Having stayed at the hotel in 2019, I returned with a group of school friends for a reunion dinner. We had a fabulous evening! The staff were excellent; very attentive and friendly service. They did everything possible to make our evening a success. The food (Indian) was truly delicious, good sized portions and the dishes just kept coming and coming. And the bar is well stocked, which we certainly enjoyed. Highly recommended!",5,2022,02,10
118,Sunday with Chef Jomon/ Afternoon tea at Lalit,"What an epic day at Lalit kitchen seeing these amazing chefs work , their passion and it was a rollercoaster of emotion when I ate Lalit Highchai /  afternoon tea. Feeding people brings nourishment not only to your bodies but to your spirits , left @thelalitlondon with my booster  for the week, keep cooking guys and bring the happiness flavour to many. Thank you for treating us the best highchai in town",5,2022,02,06
118,And old property but beautifully done and modern at the same time,"Staff very polite and helpful - reception was more intimate which was a pleasant improvement in the chains. 
Whilst the room was a little small - the quality and approach to the decor was as good as any hotel I have stayed in in London. 
There was a coffee machine as well as a kettle. Choice of hard and soft pillows and a fridge with some free soft drinks and still/sparkling water, some crisps etc.. Hotels rarely give anything away so this was a refreshing change.
There was a digital aircon panel but it was winter so unclear if it would work well in the height of summer. 
The bathroom was very small but usable for one person. The shower was a good size but the door was a little too large for the room, and getting in was a tricky if you wanted to avoid the bathroom being flooded. Also excellent water pressure and two heads (one flexible). And, for a first for me in any hotel I have every stayed in - a heated toilet seat that had the functions of a high tech beday with 'cleaning' jets. Bit odd to use at first but an excellent idea for additional hygiene. 
Well located near to Tower London station / tube and very need to Tower Bridge/ Tower of London/ HMS Belfast. And there are lots of places nearby to eat.
I would definitely stay here again - if I can be pulled away from the free breakfast and collecting points at the nearby Hilton.

118,Pleasant stay,"Stayed in a hotel for the first time after covid...it was special day for us- our anniversary. Although the restaurant was not operational but we were offered to try the Indian Afternoon tea...it was a really good first encounter with Indian Afternoon tea. The room was very clean with the best shower and the toilets- Toto,and the espresso machine and minibar was a surprise. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Will surely return back again.1",5,2022,01,30
118,Awesome Afternoon Tea @ LaLit,"Had an awesome evening at LaLit London.

Stunning venue, lovely atmosphere, fantastic food & awesome experience. Special thanks to F&B manager Moses and Chef Jomon who looked after us.

An Indian inspired afternoon tea - multitude of flavours with bhel puri, samosa, chicken pakora, chutneys with masala chai combined with traditional sweets like halwa & mango lassi. Food was top notch with right blend of traditional Indian flavours and unlimited :)

Great concept and vision by the passionate Chef Jomon, who ensured we enjoyed the food and happy to take our feedback. Venue is walking distance from Tower Bridge & a must try in London!",5,2022,01,28
118,A definite must!,"Attended for the afternoon tea. The service was simply perfect and the food is amazing. We will most definitely be back for dinner once the hotel is open fully. 

A definite must for everyone. It‚Äôs really is the perfect hotel, with perfect dining.",5,2022,01,28
118,Afternoon tea,"Fantastic food,beautiful building and great service provided from the Ma√Ætre d' Moses.
We went there for the unusual Indian inspired afternoon tea.
 It was very savoury heavy and no scones in sight. Instead a savoury puffed rice bowl, samosas, spiced chicken fritta were just a few of the savourys.
.The sweet dishes were a creamy sweet shortbread, shaved halva and carrot fudge. Extra plates were available if you wanted a top up.
The tea itself was replaced with Chai which was lovely, but I would have liked a regular tea to be available. 
An English afternoon tea was on the menu, but was not available when we asked if we could have one English and one Indian.
The building is a old school and the rooms are named to reflect this. I would definitely recommend having a cocktail in the Headmasters room.
We were also given a personal tour around the building by Moses who was incredible proud of his hotel and it's history.
I would recommend this place as a hidden gem in London. Although it is a chain of hotels  it does not seem corporate and has a individuality not often seen in the bigger hotels on London.",5,2022,01,22
118,1 night part of a birthday celebration stay,"We were very happy to have stayed in this beautiful luxurious hotel. 
all the little room luxuries were there. 
coffee machine, robes, toiletries super large bed. 
very attentive staff and a great breakfast. 
it felt as though nothing was to much trouble. 
would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,01,15
118,Date night away!,"This overnight stay was a Christmas gift for my husband. Such an amazing find! Stunning hotel, old with beautiful period features, but also very tastefully renovated with all the mod cons you could wish for. Super service from checkin, to bar, breakfast and checkout. All the staff were lovely. The room was spotless, really comfortable and the bathroom was perfect. Cocktails at the beautiful bar were delicious and the breakfast in the gorgeous dining room was too. Couldn‚Äôt fault any of it.",5,2022,01,15
118,"Beautiful, spotless hotel with very attentive staff","Stayed for one night at the LaLit for a little couple get-away and couldn't have been happier. It's a beautiful hotel with a lot of attention to detail and even the cheapest room which we booked was gorgeous. Everything is very clean and it's not tattered like a lot hotel rooms are nowadays. The staff were very attentive, and service was very quick. Add the prime location near Tower Bridge to it and you've got a great hotel option which is not overly expensive.",5,2022,01,10
118,Don‚Äôt stay during Covid all you get is a bed,"Currently here and yes the hotel is beautiful, although I probably wouldn‚Äôt stay here again during the pandemic. 

We are staying over New Year so understand you pay a premium, but most people understand nowadays you pay for an experience not just the hotel room. But it seems at this moment in time, all you pay for is the hotel room, ¬£700 might I add for two nights‚Ä¶.for a bed‚Ä¶have to laugh. 

I would consider another option at this moment in time as other hotels with the same price tag (some cheaper)  have restaurants, gym, spa and room service available.

They probably have a la carte breakfasts available too, the breakfast was pretty dreadful. We don‚Äôt mind a buffet breakfast but if you compare buffets to what you have at premier inn, sorry, but premier inn trumps Lalit. Which is really frustrating!  Hot food was only scrambled egg, bacon, sausage, beans and mushroom. The pastries were small, look like they‚Äôd been stood there all evening, the kind of multipacks you pick up at Tesco with 12 in a pack. It lacked, It was really really disappointing. 

For ¬£700 and the restaurant and every other service the hotel has to offer being closed, you would think that an a La carte breakfast would be available, it‚Äôs a shame as we feel really robbed.

It would be nice to see the hotel in all its glory, but if you are considering to come here I personally wouldn‚Äôt until the other services reopen.",3,2021,12,31
118,Lovely Stay at Lalit,"The Hotel is perfectly situated for Tower Bridge and Butler‚Äôs Wharf. It‚Äôs closest tube is London Bridge. The hotel is in a large grand old grammar school. The restaurant is very beautiful but currently only open for breakfast (¬£25 per person) and High Chai (afternoon tea).  The spa is also closed due to Covid. Check in was smooth and simple with Fabrice helping us with our bags. He was very helpful throughout our stay. Our senior classroom was clean and tidy. The bathroom was stunning and the shower was great. The toilet is heated and there is a good range of amenities. The complimentary mini bar was a lovely gesture and had soft drinks only in it.  It was perfect for us. The staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for you. Any request at anytime of day or night was possible. 
The only downside was we decided to have a few drinks in the bar, then we realised how expensive they were. We had a 15% off voucher but the bar staff only actually deducted 10% even after a discussion with him. The Rose Martini however is a must! 
We would definitely stay here again, but eat and drink elsewhere.",4,2021,12,30
118,Fabulous building converted from a school,"Excellent stay at this lovely hotel.  Very high standard of service.  Excellent location for Tower Bridge area.
Building is very interesting as it is a converted school with amazing character, they have managed to modernise while keeping traditional features.  Everything was of  quality, bed extremely large and comfortable with quality bed linen, room had fridge, tea and coffee, bathroom with all provisions you would want.  Well heated but also ventilated, so did not get too hot like a lot of  hotel bedrooms!   Staff were polite and very helpful.  I lost some jewellery whilst at the hotel and on enquiry, it had been found and stored safely and they returned it to me immediately.  Very honest and efficient.   Would stay at this hotel again with no hesitation.",5,2021,12,30
118,A stunning hotel with character to stay at whilst celebrating my half century.,"We stayed at the Lalit London for a long weekend, the suite was fantastic and immaculately presented, a real treat for the wife and I. The staff were most helpful in particular Fabrice the Concierge. The hotel was ideally located for us as visitors to London. The Shard and Tower Bridge on the doorstep, restaurants down by the water. I particularly enjoy open top bus rides and they happen to have a stop right by the hotel. We did not sample the hotels restaurant's etc. but would love to return for another stay when we are not in the grip of a pandemic to see them in full flow.",5,2021,12,28
118,Baluchi restaurant - Amazing experience,"I was very privileged to experience an authentic Indian fusion over lunch with work colleagues. Good company is always a good start, then 'wow' what can I say about the food! It was absolutely delicious and I certainly left feeling fully satisfied. Chef Joymon was on hand throughout, delivering each dish before talking us through each flavor profile of his dishes he had created with real passion - a true man of talent. I am looking forward to returning once the restaurant reopens fully.  ",5,2021,12,16
118,Wish the restaurant was open.,"Just decided to spend a couple of days away from home and decided on London at random. Decided to visit Baluchi and was disappointed to hear it was shut. Having stayed in Lalit properties over the years we decided to stay at Lalit London anyway. It was good to hear that the restaurant was open for High Chai which did not disappoint. The Kathi roll was superb as were the other bits on offer. Masala chai reminded us of tea breaks while driving around in India. Had a chance to meet the Chef Joymon whose passion for cooking just shone through. Really looking forward to visiting Baluchi when it reopens and hopefully will get to experience some of Chef Joymon‚Äôs creations. If the afternoon tea and the conversations around the food from Kerala were any indication, it promises to be a fantastic experience. The Indian themed cocktails were superb and the Imli Daiquiri is definitely worth a try.",5,2021,12,15
118,A Converted Victorian School where the Staff could learn a thing or two.,"Easy to find and situated close to Tower Bridge with easy walking or Tube/Rail connections nearby. It took a while to find our way inside the grounds with no real signage to assist in finding the entrance or the reception area. 

The person who greeted us in the reception room lacked empathy and interest in us [where we had travelled from, purpose of visit, how we were feeling etc.] no champagne reception [but he did ask if we wanted a glass of water]. This lack of interest and personality was duplicated throughout the staff we encountered during our stay. They were really not interested in us at all [we were almost an inconvenience to them]. All he was interested in was explaining how the hotel vouchers in the 'tiniest ever' welcome pack would save us money on eating in at the hotel, or using the bar, and in taking an extra ¬£100 from our card which would be refunded if we hadn't purchased any 'extra's'.

When we booked we were told they had no onsite parking, but the first thing the person on reception asked was if we had parked outside? We stayed on the third floor in a 'Senior Class Room' just a name I'm afraid it was just an attic room with very low roof trusses which on more than one occasion caused a bump to the head [there was a warning sign - but you can't see that in the middle of the night can you?]. 

The lift from reception to our floor was efficient and spacious. The room was warm and very clean. It was excellently furbished with a good size double bed. Plenty of wardrobe space, wooden floor, excellent decor, with free soft drink mini bar, tea & coffee making, biscuits & posh packets of crisps. The bathroom was spacious with a heated floor, automatic bide toilet and good sized shower with a really nice hot powerful shower. [the bathroom was definitely the highlight of our stay!] 

Our room safe was not working and after calling reception twice we were told it had problems and we were offered another room, or they would hold our bits & pieces in their reception safe. We choose the later to save bother. 

Breakfast was in what must had been the school assemble hall, with panelled walls and huge blue glass chandeliers. The room was much more impressive than the service! The food was good and the coffee was individually made, tasted good and was hot. 

Overall our stay was 'pleasant', the hotel had been excellently converted from an old school, the room was spacious, clean and warm. For the price we paid we expected better service from the staff, after all a simple 'how are you today, is there anything I can help you with? how was your day today etc costs nothing - does it?

I think next time we will save our money and book the Premier Inn which is only a short walk from this location. 

Final note to the Manager, Reception staff and person who signed off the map in the welcome pack ""you might want to check the correct location of Trafalgar Square!"" They had it on entirely the wrong side of the river and this error and lack of detail sort of summed up our stay. As many a school teacher has said ""Could do better!""",4,2021,12,14
118,December 1 night stay,"From start to finish this was a great trip, we had room 222 which was large and spacious had a comfortable bed nice sofa and good in room amenities, the soaps and shower gels ect were excellent quality and all areas of the hotel were extremely clean, the staff could not be more polite or helpful 5/5",5,2021,12,06
118,Disappointing stay,"Having previously stayed at the Lalit, my family were very much looking forward to our  recent stay. On this occasion we came away disappointed.
The Lalit is a beautiful hotel with beautiful rooms and this hadn't changed.
However, things got off to a bad start when we checked in and the gentleman involved with this was unable to accept that we had prepaid for one of our two rooms. He was less than apologetic when he found his mistake.
Our rooms were lovely and we slept well but breakfast was very disappointing. This was a buffet which is fine but there seemed to be some privileged guests who were being served with different items. There was no prepared fruit. There was no bread apart from some slice white bread to make toast. The orange juice was not fresh juice. Coffee came from  a machine and was served but when it did eventually arrive, my cup was stained with an old coffee ring which I discovered as I drank.
I realise that Covid has caused all sorts of problems and this may have been a factor but it was still a disappointing stay and could easily have been made a better experience.",3,2021,12,02
118,Best place in town,"Hello! This is such a great place, nice and clean, wonderful people, fancy rooms, bathrooms smooth and well furnished. We went to serve dinner, get some drinks and have some time together with our friends. Our guest, Maria, was very nice and well informed about everything arround, gave us some advices, and by the bar,  Sorin, made us all some great drinks. It all was a beautiful experience, and we will always come back with plasure ! Thank you !",5,2021,11,28
118,Great place! 5 *****,"Been there with friends and familly ! Great place, great food, great chai, great people! I recommend it with all my heart! I will always come back at all costs! Maria and Sorin at the bar were wonderful guests, very entertaining, made us smile and tasty cocktails also, and have a great time, me beeing kind of sad after a long and ugly divorce. We really enjoyed it and for that, I will always remember this place with gratitude Thank you ! ‚ù§üé©",5,2021,11,28
118,Everything is excellent!,"Me and my wife came to The Lalit for our 15th anniversary. We were looking for a special experience and professionalism, and that's exactly what we found! The food was amazing, and our server Maria was so lovely, she made our night and experience better. But what was the most outstanding were the cocktails that the bartender Sorin prepared for us. We will for sure come back again!",5,2021,11,27
118,Wonderful Afternoon Tea Indian High Chai,"We wanted to try the famous afternoon tea here and have a special experience which is exactly what we received! We were amazed by the whole assembly room! Food was to die for and the staff was very professional. Our experience was topped up by the charming lady Maria who served us, made us laugh and also took pictures for us from all the possible angles, she was very dedicated in making our afternoon tea even more special. We also took a look in the Headmaster's room in the bar and we can't wait to come back and enjoy a drink in there as well! Everything was perfect!",5,2021,11,24
118,Nice stay in South London,"Great location, near London Bridge station, but still very quiet place. Imposing old aged building but beautiful renovated. Clean bathrooms with everything in need and comfortable beds. Friendly and always there to help staff. We look forward to have again the great experience of  ""Baluchi"" Indian food",5,2021,11,23
118,Indian High Chai (Fabulous Afternoon Tea),We came because we were looking for an afternoon tea with a difference. And we found it. A beautiful selection of Indian street food snacks replaced the traditional sandwiches. Light delicate flavours meant we took advantage of the free refills. This was washed down with a sweet and subtly spiced Chai and a refreshing Lassi. This all took place in the deep dark blue of the old school assembly hall with the most fabulous blue chandeliers. The staff were charming and the Chef fascinating to talk too. A perfect and very different afternoon I will do again. Definitely worth a try if you are bored of sandwiches and cakes!!!,5,2021,11,20
118,"Weekend break, Thames Suite","Came to this hotel for the second time.a lot of staff were changed we really missed the Baluchi food we had last time. The bed in the room was very comfortable, the heated toilet seats in the bathroom were the best. Staff was friendly and the cocktails in the bar must be tried.",5,2021,11,14
118,Exquisite,"Gorgeous, well kept hotel. Excellent customer service and hotel very clean and welcoming. Felt it was good value for money for London.
Stayed in a senior classroom which was a comfortable size, good pressure in the shower and bed very comfortable.",5,2021,11,14
118,"Memorable afternoon tea, loved it.","Had afternoon tea here today and it was wonderful!! Indian afternoon tea was a delicious and unique experience, that I shall soon be repeating!! The dining room is gorgeous too, with unique stunning decor. The service was attentive and kind. I was even kindly allowed to see and shown around the top gallery so I could see the room from the top after finishing. What a kind thing to do! Thank you so much! ",5,2021,11,12
118,Afternoon Tea at an iconic place,I went for afternoon tea with my team and really pleased with the services. There were great choices for Tasty Indian snacks just perfect with afternoon Tea. Staff and team were really helpful in explaining about the hotel and very friendly. All staffs were smiling and  !,5,2021,11,11
118,High tea experience,"We went for a business meeting there and were quite impressed with the ambience and quality of service. Harshit and his team were so good and fabulous. The selection of food for afternoon tea was fantastic. We loved the Samosas, Panner kathi roll and masala chai.",5,2021,11,11
118,Our Lalit wedding!,"We were married at the Lalit and it was the perfect venue - a hidden gem in central London! Harshit and his team were so kind, and thoughtful, we were able to review the menu, the room set-up and talk through everything in advance - the room I got ready in was so chic. The day was amazing, and ran super smoothly, thanks to all the work the team put in - and the food was delicious! Can't wait to visit again!",5,2021,11,10
118,Excellent Hotel Stay,"Had a great time with my family in The Lalit London and would definitely recommend to my friends.

Excellent Service & Staff with always smile on the face.

Look forward to come back in future again !!!!",5,2021,11,09
118,Great Stay and Afternoon Tea,"Had a fantastic stay as a treat for my fathers B'day.

The high light of course was the Afternoon Tea great choice of Indian delicacies along with service with a smile. Certainly worth trying out and the Chandeliers are grand.",5,2021,11,09
118,Afternoon tea,I book afternoon tea for me and my sisters. Moses sorted everything out for me before hand. The chef came and said hello to us. Food and tea was amazing. Great experience. The place was clean and beautiful. Easy to get to from London Bridge Station.,5,2021,11,08
118,A poor experience,"Restaurant closed, Spa closed, bar empty, two small towels only in the bathroom, two milks only for morning coffee. ¬£270 a night. Poor. Breakfast was ¬£25 each.

For the money it could be better. The room and bed was lovely, the toilet exceptional!",2,2021,11,06
118,Poor service and charged for something I did not break,"It is very unfortunate that this hotel has a very poor way of dealing with clients. I had what I thought was a nice stay and 48 hours later was sent an email with a picture stating I broke a chair and they were charging me ¬£200. I didn't touch the chair and did not break it (they sent me a picture of a chair in pieces - I would have noticed this  (!) and certainly would own up it I damaged anything). 48 hours later I received an email from the 'duty manager' stating they were charging me ¬£200. I immediately replied and 7 days later have still not received a response. I called several times and today was told by a duty manager they followed hotel policy and attempted to call me back (note no calls were received on my phone from hotel or unknown numbers and no voice mail; also to this date no response to email). I am irate at the lack of service, the accusatory nature of the duty manager Michael (he would not reveal his surname and no name was given on the email I was sent). He stated housekeeping could not have done this or anyone else therefore it was me! He said there is no recourse. Save your money and go elsewhere! I've now seen similar reviews and wish I had consulted them before I booked this scam of a hotel.",1,2021,11,04
118,Jnr Suite Disappointment  - Shame,"An honest review: - Lovely Hotel, Good Overall Std and Impressive however, extremely disappointing as (despite the aforementioned) it was also cold, with no one on reception and without atmosphere.  Needless to say,  some background music wouldn't go amiss throughout the hotel or even in main areas.    In addition and unless i missed any pre-notice, the dining at this hotel was ""off limits and closed"".
My complaint with this hotel centres around the price paid for the Jnr Suite Accommodation.  Placed at the top/highest  part of the hotel, my room 307 was extremely noisy with very disturbed sleep from outside.noises in addition to bizarre clicking sounds in the early hours from inside the room ? Bad signaled wifi  to the TV meant i couldn't even watch TV.  I reported the problems this morning and was informed it would be passed to the General Manager.  Certainly expected a lot more for the monies paid for the night - disappointed as mentioned and such a shame for a historic hotel.

",2,2021,11,04
118,Wedding anniversary celebration,"Date of stay - 25-27th October

My first anniversary was terribly ruined due to poor communication between Expedia and The Lalit Hotel london. When booking via Expedia I specifically stated a special request for my room to be decorated prior to my check in for our 1st wedding anniversary.  

Arrangements were initially made through Expedia for the room to be decorated however upon arrival the room had not been decorated in any shape, way or form. At the hotel reception i was then told that no special request, which is pure nonsense as I have proof of this ! On top of all this, they didn‚Äôt even offer to decorate the room for the evening when we would be out, even when I had told them I will pay for this additionally. 

We had come over 100 miles from
Birmingham for so much of our day to be wasted between both parties. Management had wasted around 2 hours of our time when this should have been a 10 minute straight forward conversation 

Nobody was willing to take responsibility or resolve this problem, and i was left very frustrated and upset as this was a very very special day for me and my other half. 

Overall I was not happy at all with how we were treated and would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",1,2021,11,02
118,"Absolute scam, charged again for a prepaid room","We stayed for a night in September for a room that was prepaid for. We'd heard from other guests not to give the Lalit our card details as those guests had been charged for drinks they did not have or room service they didn't get.

We tried not to give them our card details for the deposit as we arrived, but they told us that it was a minimum ¬£500 cash deposit. This in itself is extremely dodgy. Obviously we didn't have ¬£500 cash so reluctantly we gave our card details for the deposit.

Lo and behold a couple of days later I'm charged ¬£224.91 out of nowhere on my card, even though we had already paid for the room. What ensued over the next month can only be described as a wild goose chase as I tried to get my money back. They even admitted they had made a mistake and promised to get my money back within 3-5 working days. It's now been almost 2 months and I still haven't gotten it back. Ridiculous scamming hotel and I would not recommend them to anyone at all.

On a side note, the hotel itself is definitely not up to 5 star standards. I have stayed at many 5 star hotels and this is nowhere close to the level of luxury required to be 5 star.",1,2021,11,02
118,"Terrible bathroom, unacceptable for a hotel of this category.","We chose the junior classroom.
The room we had the first night was not confortable at all. The light in the cupboard was on the whole night.
The bathroom had a very tiny sink and a Italian shower in the middle with a plastic curtain. Unacceptable for an hotel of this category.  We could move to a better room the next night but no apology nor compensation was offered for the first night.",2,2021,11,01
118,Disappointing afternoon tea,"Unfortunately this nice hotel is let down by an overpriced afternoon tea which is not comparable to alternatives offered by other establishments. 

I understand that the Indian variant is different to more traditional offerings but it still needs to leave guests feeling like they have received value for money which it certainly does not, even though unlimited refills are available.

As a result of this afternoon tea experience we have decided to cancel a future reservation at the hotel and will rebook elsewhere as we feel we have been ripped off.",1,2021,10,30
118,Very friendly  small luxury hotel,Stayed for 2 nights in October one of my favourite parts of London that has changed dramatically in recent years . Very friendly welcome nice room with huge bed lovely shower room with odd Japanese toilet but you soon get used to it .nothing too much trouble for staff all in all a very nice 2 night stay,5,2021,10,18
118,Lalit Afternoon Tea,"Awful! Don‚Äôt do it, overpriced, food mediocre, place empty 4pm on a Sat no atmosphere. Service was slow even though we were the only table there. Chai was like warm rather than piping hot?! Food such a disappointment, for that price you can go and have a nice Indian meal",1,2021,10,16
118,Will be back,"My partner chose this hotel as a treat and for its location just off the South Bank. On arrival we were welcomed warmly and our first impressions were really good. We were allocated room 001 on the ground floor. The room was spacious, spotlessly clean and had good light. The bedding was good quality (I am very fussy about bedding) and the pillows comfortable. The bathroom was also clean with a plentiful supply of hot water from the powerful shower. The room was serviced twice per day and the bed turned down in the evening.  The staff were exceptional throughout our 3 day stay, polite, helpful and eager to provide a good guest experience. Breakfast was lovely in the large hall/dining room and again the servers were efficient, pleasant and well trained. The only criticism I would have is the prices in the bar- my partner paid ¬£17 for a double vodka and lemonade which seems unreasonably expensive but i do recognise these are London prices in a prime location. The story of the refurbishment of this hotel from a  school to its current incarnation fascinated me and a quick search on the www tells the story of the project to transform it to the beautiful hotel it is today. We will be back on our next trip to London and highly recommend it for its service, location, staff and departure from the average beige ,soulless and impersonal experience of other hotels I have experienced in the past.",5,2021,10,14
118,Definitely NOT a 5 star,"The check in staff, one older gentleman in particular, was very rude. When I called down from my room several times, no one answered and when the older gentleman did finally answer, he was rude and very dismissive.  Our upgraded room was also located right next to where a door was consistently slamming, which was quite annoying at night time. Our tv did not work properly, but we didn‚Äôt want to call and ask as last time we did the rude man came from downstairs and basically told us it was our fault. It was a nice stay, but definitely not worth the money and with the rude older gentleman at the front desk, definitely not a 5 star experience",3,2021,10,12
118,Poor service and a unclean room,"Stayed here for one night last week (Rm 219) and our experience left a lot to be desired. For a 5 star hotel they certainly don't keep their rooms clean or up-to-standard.

The bathroom counter-top was covered in watermarks and stains. The shower door wouldn't close because the rubber seal hadn't been put on correctly so a lot of water would just spray out onto the floor. The Wi-Fi wouldn't reach the bed so if you wanted to connect to the internet (no cellular signal in the room), then you have to move towards the door. If you get offered Room 219, make sure to check the whole room before deciding to stay there.

If that wasn't bad enough, the breakfast made it even worse! For a ""full English breakfast"" it costs ¬£25 and you would expect to get one of everything. Unfortunately what I received was half of a black pudding and chewy bacon. I queried this with the management and he said ""that's the way it's portioned out.."". I'm sorry but if I'm paying ¬£25 for a breakfast I want one of everything especially when the waiting staff described it as a ""black pudding"" not ""half a black pudding"".
Then when breakfast was almost over we had to overhear (twice) the management telling off their waiting staff in front of everyone for not clearing tables properly. The fact that it happened once is bad enough but the poor staff member had to endure this twice and not be taken in the back and told.

Overall I would not stay there again and would hope that someone from the hotel sees this and takes a look into it. It ruined our wedding night that we were so looking forward to.",1,2021,10,12
118,not great value,stayed here for one night last week....on arrival we were told the spa and restaurant were both closed at present...may be helpful if the hotel let people know this when booking....room was very nice (no view really)....in the bar (which was empty and had no atmosphere at all) the draught beer was off so a small bottle of Cobra was all that was offered...that and a single vodka and tonic was ¬£20...(os even if you allow ¬£5 for a small bottle of beer you are being charged ¬£15 for a vodka and tonic...will not be returning...,3,2021,10,10
118,Very poor customer service - I had such high hopes,"Having stayed in a Lalit in India I was looking forward to staying at the Lalit in London with my wife.
Unfortunately it is very difficult to get through to anyone on the phone to discuss a reservation and messages are left unanswered. When I did finally receive my confirmation they had booked the wrong room type. 
As this was for a special occasion the room type was important to us however no one responded to my emails or phone calls. I ended up booking another hotel at the last minute as I was unsure what was going on with my reservation.
I have emailed a complaint to the reservations manager and hotel general manager without receiving a response.
This ruined our special weekend in London as we were so looking forward to our trip.",1,2021,10,06
118,Excellent hotel,"This hotel is amazing you want for nothingüòä
Staff are all very professional attentive and very polite.
The rooms are very well equipped bathroom is excellent and the view we had from our room was lovely. The beds were so comfortable I had the best sleep ever! 
It was our 25 wedding  Anniversary and when we were taken to our room they had left a lovely bottle of wine and balloons in the shape of hearts - a very nice surprise. Thank you so much.",5,2021,10,04
118,Not what we hoped for on our luxury stay,Booked this hotel for a lovely stay away for my husbands birthday and didn‚Äôt want a Standard hotel wanted a bit of luxury but didn‚Äôt feel we achieved this. Hotel was in a good location and on arrival didn‚Äôt disappoint but once in our room felt it went downhill from there. Window ledges were dusty curtains hung wonky with broken clips which was left on the window sill. Tv had a fault on the screen and socket was hanging off at the back. Surfaces were marked and badly scratched. Toilet area had apart hanging of the wall some areas looked grubby had only one loo roll for two on a two night stay. Mini bar disappointing just water and two soft drinks each kettle had limescale in it bathrobes were torn on arm .Other than this room was very basic expected more for a five star. Hotel was pretty in areas but lift was broken on day two and then our room key would not work. Breakfast was very basic no hot choices just a basic cooked breakfast but done poorly cold choices were poorly stocked so always waiting to be filled up long waits to take our order really thought for what we paid we would have the wow factor. Staff in general very polite especially the gentleman on the concierge. Unfortunately I would not return as we feel our money was poorly spent.,2,2021,09,30
118,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in,"I stayed here for a night and had the most amazing experience. The room was spacious with high ceilings and the most comfortable bed. The bathroom featured a fantastic spacious shower, everything you'd need in terms of toiletries, plus a toilet with a heated seat! Breakfast was delicious, served in a stunning restaurant. There is a lovely outdoor area at the restaurant as well. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is spotless with a stunning style. Such an amazing place!",5,2021,09,30
118,A real gem of a hotel,"We arrived at this amazing hotel, converted school, wow have they done a great job on the conversion, keeping the spirit of the school. 

Rooms amazing, fab bar and amazing restaurant. The staff were great , especially the concierge, so helpful .

Bookings.com had made a mistake and not reserved us a room,  the hotel gave us an upgrade to ensure we had a bed for the night.

Location is fab, London Bridge, borough market and check out burmansy high street for great bars and reatauranta",5,2021,09,26
118,An absolute gem!,"Just had a weekend at this hotel and it was fab. The staff were so attentive on arrival and through out our stay! |The hotel room was amazing we stayed in a suite, there were so many special touches like complimentary soft drinks and snacks, The bed was so comfy with really luxurious bedding. We had a lovely breakfast freshly cooked to order and it was delicious. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels in London and this is the best so far, do not let the fact it is listed as small / boutique put you off, it was lovely. Thank you LaLit we will be back!",5,2021,09,19
118,"Cancelled my stay last minute, after confirming with me over the phone that everything was in order","I don‚Äôt expect a hotel of this standard to firstly accept bookings, have me call them to confirm (their reception is only available to accept calls on Wednesdays?!) 

After assuring me they were open and my stay is confirmed, they cancelled my booking without warning a few days later, leaving me needing to scramble and pay up for alternative accommodation that night! 

Completely unacceptable and not fitting in any way for a ‚Äú5 star hotel‚Äù! 

Frustrating and not a good sign of good customer service.",1,2021,07,14
118,Girls weekend,"Me and my friends went to London for the weekend and was especially recommended to visit Lalit baluchi for dinner. I'm glad we went there. It was indeed a treat and an experience we all will never forget. Chef Jomon personally came and met us. He noted our preference and what came afterwards was just mind blowing. We started off with hors d'≈ìuvre which was inspired infused version of pani puri and South Indian traditional curry which came infront of us in the form of a shot. Then came the starters which left us craving for more. The chicken tikka boti, lamb chop and grilled salmon were just delicious. He then sent a perfectly balanced sorbet to cleanse or palette. What followed next created a havoc in our stomach's(in a good way). We were bombarded with a tsunami of delightful delicious flavours. We were stumped. Needles to say we dug right into the delicious chicken biryani (veg biyani for the less fortunate vegetarians üòÅ), paneer makhni,  lamb shank and daal baluchi were mind blowing. The chef really stirred up some magic in his kitchen to make our trip a memorable one. We were so full but a meal is never complete without a dessert and when gulab jamun is on the menu then how can one say no. It brought back memories,  home away from home. Thank you Chef Jomon for the most memorable experience.",5,2021,07,02
118,Baluchi Restaurant - Beyond words,"I had dinner with my friends last weekend. I really don't know where to begin. The food was just extremely delicious. I have no words. The presentation was excellent. The chef was lovely and he made sure we had a great experience. The presentation was mind blowing. I particularly loved the ""Dal Makhani"" - finger licking good. I'll definitely be back again. 
Thank you Team Baluchi for making our evening memorable.",5,2021,07,02
118,Amazing Birthday Afternoon Tea,"My wife and i celebrated her birthday at the Lalit's and I have got to say we had a fabulous afternoon.  The endless supply of Indian street food went down a treat with mango lassie and proper Indian massala tea.  From the moment we walked in, to the quality of the food was top notch.  Deepika and Ali who looked after us just could not do enough to make sure my wife and i had a memorable experience.  

Cant wait to return again soon at this spectacular building to eat some more of their wonderful food",5,2021,06,22
118,Best Abience and Food,"My husband and I were at Baluchi on the 12th June for my birthday meal. I believe it was one of the best birthday celebration I have had in the past! The stunning ambiance, delicious meal and wonderful service by Baluchi staff made it a memorable experience! 

Chef Jomon is truly a talented man. His brilliance is visible in the rendition of Indian cuisine he plates in every course of a meal.

You must taste the starters. Each piece of kebab we ordered in our starter platter had unique marination- each packed with flavours.  Every morsel of food was relished to the fullest. Prawns on a bed of spinach served with the most creamiest moilee sauce and fried samphire looked and tasted absolutely magical! We had refreshing mocktails to go with our meal. 

Rarely does one see the chef checking on each table and making sure the guests were enjoying their experience and making the most of their visit to the restaurant. But Chef Jomon at Baluchi, made sure each of his guest was happy. 

Thank you so much for the lovely birthday experience Chef Jomon and Lalit, London! I will cherish it for ever!

Preeti Rajesh",5,2021,06,18
118,Exquisite Dinner with Chef Jomon,"I took my whole family to Lalit Baluchi on 14/06/21 for a dinner. It was one of a kind, so delicate yet complex. We loved how we were taken care of, Morover how Chef Jomon has articulated each dish with so much passion. 
Truly exceptional. Thank you to Chef Jomon for creating each dish and truly serving it with love. 
Special mention to Deepika. Looking forward to many more memorable dinners at Lalit.",5,2021,06,17
118,An amazing experience at Baluchi Restaurant.,We celebrated our wedding reception at The LaLit and it couldn‚Äôt have gone more perfect. The venue was beautiful and the food and level of service was outstanding. Thank you so much Harshit Vyas and Chef Jomon for creating a wonderful menu and reception for us. The team were so accommodating and lovely. We will definitely be returning and highly recommend a visit to The Lalit if you are looking for delicious Indian food.   Radha & Vishnu,5,2021,06,12
118,Excellent first trip to The Lalit!,"We took our first trip to The Lalit last month and it definitely won‚Äôt be our last! The hotel is beautifully decorated and the staff are so friendly and helpful.

We tried some of their signature cocktails in the bar area and had dinner in the main hall. The food, drinks and service were all excellent. 

I would highly recommend a visit to The Lalit if you are in London and are looking for some tasty Indian food. 

I am looking forward to our next trip already!",5,2021,06,10
118,Baluchi Restaurant,"A wonderful experience at Baluchi Restaurant.  
@ChefJomon - Thank you so much for the delicious food, and for the time taken to come and talk to us too, it was highly appreciated. 

Had taken my kids and they enjoyed the meals too.
We had the lamb chops, paneer tikka, aloo tikki chaat and for mains, ghost biryani, Baluchi daal and coconut and mango naan!
To finish off, a chocolate and walnut brownie, chai masala creme brulee and ras malai!

Definitely a place I'd highly recommend to visit and enjoy these pan Indian meals in London!

Thank you once again Chef Jomon and your team. ",5,2021,06,05
118,Baluchi Restaurant experience,Baluchi restaurant serves authentic Indian food that was s delicious and on point. The outdoor seating is so well organized with heaters and well lit tables. We enjoyed a summer evening with great choice of wine. The highlight of the evening was definitely the cocktail menu that came inside a book from the property‚Äôs oldest school library. It simply brought the history on the table which made a great conversation.,5,2021,05,30
118,Lovely Stay,"My boyfriend took me on a weekend away here and it's such a lovely, unique hotel. The room was really nice and the bed was so comfy. The bathroom was massive and i loved the underfloor heating (and heated toilet seat!) . It did get quite hot in the room though but it was ok because it was quite cold outside. 

The staff were all lovely and I would 100% stay again",5,2020,08,04
118,Stolen my money,"I paid over ¬£600 for a suite for what should have been my wedding, which was cancelled due to coronavirus. The hotel was closed on my dates but is refusing to refund me. I have asked for my money back so many times and they won't give me it. They also won't refund other family members who were travelling from overseas to come to my wedding. No matter how they dress it up, it's theft and they should be ashamed of themselves.",1,2020,07,25
118,Thieves,"We stayed here for our anniversary at the beginning of March and, honestly, I couldn‚Äôt fault a thing with the stay itself or the hotel, it was wonderful. However, what they did after we‚Äôd checked out was appalling. We settled the bill upon check out, there were no extras we needed to pay for, so it just the stay inclusive of breakfast. They cannot be trusted with your card details though, as a couple of days later I noticed an additional random charge of almost ¬£200 on my credit card from them. I contacted them via phone about it and was told to email. I received no acknowledgement of my email until I chased them and even then they were dismissive and unconcerned. Eventually they just stopped replying and I had to raise a dispute via my credit card company to get my money back. Even my credit card company were confused as to why they would have made that additional charge. Thankfully I have the money back now, but that‚Äôs no thanks to LaLit who could not have been less interested in helping me. The way they treated me was criminal and if they‚Äôd have had it their way they‚Äôd have unlawfully kept my money forever. Be wary if you choose to stay with them - they are light fingered with your payment information!",1,2020,06,07
118,Nice and original boutique hotel in London,"Was looking at a small and nice hotel on the South Bank. The Lalit appeared to be a nice option. Welcome was nice. My room, a former classroom like all the others (this used to be an old school) was nice with all the required amenities. So everything should have been perfect. But it was not, I am afraid. Breakfast time had been changed so I had to negotiate to have one and Spa was not really helpful so I could not get the massage I wanted. I got apologies upon check-out. Still, these things should not happen in hotels that aim at being luxurious.",4,2020,04,26
118,Lovely Hotel,"The Lalit Hotel was a pleasure given it is in central London... really lovely reception, rooms, furnishings. 
Clean and neat, friendly staff, value for money and excellent location.... big spacious rooms!",5,2020,04,24
118,Perfect place to stay near everything!,"Had an amazing stay here for the night for my husbands birthday. Hotel is stunning, staff are really friendly and they surprised us with a bottle on ice when we arrived and a birthday cake delivered to the room also! We had room service food which was lovely and breakfast the next day- highly recommend this as a place to stay. We didn‚Äôt park at the hotel as there are only 4 spaces but parked at Q parking which was only a 10 min walk to the hotel and easy to find.",5,2020,03,15
118,"Luxury stay, generous and warm / welcoming staff","I was very fortunate to stay at the Lalit Hotel.
From the first moment we were greeted by friendly, courteous and helpful staff.
Staff inadvertently learnt that it was my birthday and this prompted a complimentary bottle of bubbly being left in our room. 
There were a range of treats, snacks and drinks in the room as well.
The staff were very attentive at all times and nothing seemed too much trouble.
Being an Indian owned hotel meant that I could take advantage of the specific Indian Breakfast. The choices at breakfast were not the most extensive that I have seen, but this would be a minor niggle.
Great Stay.",5,2020,03,10
118,Beautiful hotel! The best service.,"The staff can't do enough for you especially the man who created us and took our cases to our rooms. The hotel itself is in a great location, clean and the bedrooms have modern and ethnic decor which was lovely. Highlight is heated toilet seat! That is next level comfort :) Would go back in a heart beat! x",5,2020,03,09
118,Outstanding Boutique Hotel ,We stayed here for 2 nights and were blown away by this hotel and the amazing staff. Nothing was too much trouble and we were made to feel like royalty. From the ease of check in to the stunning room - we were so impressed and made to feel welcome. 5 star all the way! Would definitely recommend this hotel - great location too. ,5,2020,03,09
118,Truly Excellent Stay,"We visited the hotel for a two night stay. The rooms and public spaces a very well appointed and spacious. We found the food to be excellent and service of the highest standard.

The hotel is in a very convenient location for many attractions and a very short walk from the Bridge Theatre. 

I would also add that the room rates are incredible value for a luxury hotel in the centre of London. The cockatils are great too!",5,2020,03,08
118,Beautiful ,"Got to say impressed me , staff are really friendly and very helpfull. 
Nothing is too much trouble. 

Breakfast is really good .
Highly recommend  close to trains etc.
Only dissatisfaction was the tv kept playing up. But forgot to tell them. 

Would stay again ",4,2020,03,08
118,Amazing stay,"My husband and me had an amazing stay, the hotel is stunning and rooms are spacious and very comfortable. Tony the concierge is so friendly and very knowledgeable and helpful about the hotel and area. I would definitely recommend and definitely stay here again",5,2020,03,05
118,Better options out there,"My wife & I went to celebrate my 30th birthday - the hotel is a 5star but the  customer service by most could define it as a 2 star. We had to report multiple problems with our room (Bathroom smell, WIFI, toilet was not cleaned on arrival, nightstand not clean, TV stops working) - only 1 individual Tony was able to provide enough information and try and help us enjoy our stay. Unfortuntley his team let him down and due to this we would not recommend anyone staying here until the team changes. We understand problems can occur but if your paying a 5* price you expect 5* service  as the bear minimum which clearly was not the case. Spend your cash elsewhere. ",2,2020,03,05
118,Best Stay I've Had,"Thoroughly enjoyed my time at the Lalit- beautifully decorated, spacious, spotless rooms. Large shower, clean bathroom with lots of amenities, free fridge of drinks and snacks and friendly staff willing to help!",5,2020,03,05
118,Exceptional experience,A wonderfully restored old building in a perfect location both for business as well as for holiday trips. The Indian restaurant is a very nice experience for dinner. Staff's friendliness and service focus make this a memorable stay.,5,2020,03,05
118,Excellent,"Very happy. It was a lovely stay. Beautiful hotel. Great location üëç 
Would stay again for a little longer the next time. 
We did not get to try the food but the menu looked like it had a great variety. ",5,2020,03,02
118,Best Hotel in London,"I stayed at the Lalit for my anniversary and it was exceptional, the rooms are beautifully decorated and the service couldn't be better it was all perfect! Lots of extra touches for our anniversary which was appreciated greatly. Will definitely be coming back to stay again!",5,2020,02,29
118,Amazing hospitality ,"I was just walking by the Tooley street in the rain and i saw this beautiful hotel by the side. This being a famous Indian hotel and the only Lalit in London i went inside. 

Its an amazing hotel with brilliant associates. So curteous and welcoming that i havent seen for sometime in London. 

I had a masala chai which was decently priced. 

A suggestion to the management here, it would be nice to offer some basic cookies with the tea like in India. I am sure it will add to your cost but tea alone doesnt taste that good. 

This review cant get over without the mention of two staff specifically at the hotel - Tony and a very sweet girl Mashiba (pardon me if I am wrong in remembering the name). They are true asset to the company, making it brilliant for the guests. Attaching a pic of them so they can take it if they like it. 

",5,2020,02,28
118,What a find!,"Indian decadence in London...from the welcome to the comfort and style of the rooms, the bar for pre-dinner drinks, the team has converted this beautiful old school into a real treat of an hotel, in a great location!",5,2020,02,27
118,Great London Hotel,"You cannot go wrong booking at the Lalit. The rooms are great, the service is attentive without being overbearing, and the location is good. Plenty to do in the area but also a good location for business. Easily accessible and do try traveling by ferry, much better than the underground.",5,2020,02,26
118,Great hospitality,We very much enjoyed our stay in this beautifully renovated hotel. All members of staff were very attentive and made us feel welcome. Fabulous breakfast- both full English and an amazing Indian option available.,5,2020,02,23
118,Utter disappointment!!!,"My partner and I booked this hotel for a special occasion (Valentine‚Äôs Day), now I wish we had never bothered and saved our money! 

Our sleep was disrupted  at 4am due to a loud thumping noise coming from another room, the noises kept happening so we decided to call the concierge who went to investigate and advised that they told the other guests to keep the noise down. We decided to leave our phone on record incase it happened again as evidence. We then managed to get back to sleep (about 5/5.30am) till 7am which again we were woken up by loud bangs. We called concierge who said they would speak to them again and called us back to confirm they had spoken to them. Unfortunately the noise carried on so we decided to pack our bags and leave to go home so we could get a peaceful nights sleep. We were offered late check out but would be unnecessary if we couldn‚Äôt even get to sleep! We left at 7.30am even missing out on our breakfast that was included in our stay.

The general manager was not there so we filed our complaint with Varun (duty manager), I received an email later on offering a discounted stay with VIP treatment but I politely declined as I had requested a full refund since we had paid for an experience that had not been fulfilled. 

My email quite clearly provided proof (from the recording) but somehow Mr Harshit Vyas seemed to think our experience was only worth an afternoon tea experience or 3 course meal. No refund of any sort has been offered and to be honest for a 5 star luxury hotel chain I am disgusted. We have been made to feel as if we are not worthy and have fabricated the whole thing. It is a shame",1,2020,02,21
118,Lovely bit of luxury near Tower Bridge,"What a nice hotel, with great staff and housed in an extremely interesting building.  The room was excellent and the little treats provided perfect.  With a perfect location near Tower Bridge, handy for the underground and great for exploring a fab part of London, we would come back again in an instant.",4,2020,02,20
118,Little romantic getaway,"Building was beautiful and I loved the old pictures, wish each room had a little booklet to explain the history of the building with more of the old pictures, so i can take my time to look at it instead of just looking at it in the foyer.
Bathroom was amazing with the toto toilet.
Restaurant layout was breathtaking and the food was delicious. We had the 'High Chai' afternoon tea and dinner there too.
Staff were very polite and friendly.",5,2020,02,20
118,Like a Luxury Country Hotel In London,"The Lalit is part of an Indian small select chain of hotels and has been created from an old school which in itself makes it interesting.
The decor and attention to detail is excellent especially the flooring - everything is clean and lovely with unusually large spaces 
It has a very large lounge ( the old Headmasters Room ) and bar area and is light and airy 
We are not that keen on Indian food but judging on the English breakfast we had I would imagine the food at Dinner and lunch would be fantastic
The staff are all very helpful especially Tony ( Head Concierge ) who is the most genuine and helpful man I have ever met - nothing was too much trouble for him or indeed the other concierge ( who even escorted us to a nearby restaurant so that we did not get lost ! )
The rooms are light and large and decorated to a high standard with excellent showers and heated toilet seats!! 
The general Manager is always to be seen which I feel is excellent and he is very approachable 
The position of the hotel is excellent on the South Bank next to Tower Bridge and the delights of Bermondsey Street and the area around that including Tate Modern and the Globe 
They have tried to keep the old with the new and have largely succeeded 
An excellent place to stay in London

118,Friday nigh in London,"Stayed at many hotels in London, thought we would try here as saw the restaurant, Beluchi on Masterchef and the food looked amazing.  Arrived at the hotel and was greeted by very friendly staff. After putting our bags in the room we decided to have a quick look in the restaurant and as we didnt know what we had planned for evening hadnt made a reservation in advance, there was a member of staff in the restaurant and we asked about a reservation for dinner that night and she  said and I quote ""as you are staying in the hotel just come in when you feel like it"", which was amazing and unheard of in London.  We ate in Belouchi that night and the food was wonderful, only bad point that it took forever to get our drinks when we arrived, but the waiter didnt charge us for one of them, which was fair enough.",5,2020,02,19
118,"Great hotel, fantastic location","Room was fantastic, all the staff were really friendly and helpful and the decor of the hotel overall is stunning, look forward to staying there again on my next business trip. few minutes walk from London Bridge and of course, the Thames.

118,Family break,"Stayed for the weekend just for a break from the kids after a long time..food was just perfect and the cocktails were even better.. but the best was the Indian Breakfast.

Will return with kids again",5,2020,02,12
118,Beautiful Place and amazing ambience.,"Booked last minute in this hotel.. must say it was really a good decision. Used to stay across the river but stayed this side for the first time.

Tried the murghadraki- as was recommended by the manager, was great. Will come back with all my other colleagues",5,2020,02,12
118,Good facilities lovely food ,Visited for the second time. For a training course. Must say that the restaurant Baluchi is phenomenal. The  character in the building is still intact. WiFi is the best as I can do my work from the room without any issues. Tower bridge is just one minute. Great location. Looking forward to coming back hopefully next month.,5,2020,02,11
118,UnForgettable experience and perfect Stay ,Stayed with my partner as a celebration of my first year anniversary. Room was very clean and with a view of Shard. Coffee machine and complimentary minibar was unexpected. Also was given a surprise by bringing a small cake for us after our meals by the restaurant team. This made our day.,5,2020,02,11
118,Excellent,I am writing to express my appreciation for the quality of service. Celebrated my sons 18th birthday.. the team from the concierge to the restaurant to the chefs were all excellent.  It was good decision; I enjoyed and  already planning my works day out.,5,2020,02,11
118,Beautiful Gem! Great Location!,"Great Location! A five minute walk from the London Bridge train station! Great staff, amazing restaurant, great rooms. Spacious and elegant. One block from Tower Bridge and a 10 mine walk to the Tower of London. We found this online and took a chance. We are going back in 4 days to stay another two nights. Make a great drink called the Headmasters cocktail. 

The hotel was previously a boy school. amazing architecture.",5,2020,02,11
118,Best posh Indian restaurant in London,"I went to LaLit to have dinner and meet some friends one night. 
From what I had heard it is an Indian restaurant which serves tasty Indian dishes presented in a fancy French style. 
And from what I tasted this most certainly is a top Indian restaurant serving very rich and carefully prepared foods that for how tasty they are, could only be made with love. 

It may seem to you that my review seems a bit over the top but don‚Äôt be misled. My cousin and I own a South Indian restaurant in California so we know good Indian food. 

After my meal I asked to speak to the chef to pay him some high compliments. Chef Jomon came out to greet me and spoke with me for several minutes patiently answering each of my questions. He shared with me his philosophy of preparing tasty Indian foods and not just ladling them onto the plate the way most restaurants, including mine, do - but preparing a visual feast that precedes the culinary one 

As you can see I had the tasty eggplant - I almost thought it was meat as Chef Jomon had prepared it such that the texture was almost meat-like. Take home point - Don‚Äôt fear the veg items here. 

Then I had the dessert all in house made. A pistachio cake. A delicious brownie with licor infused fruit and of course one of my fave‚Äôs: ice cream. 

Overall a wonderful taste experience that left me perfectly satisfied. I did not leave hungry. 

As a restaurant owner and a man who enjoys high quality food I must say Chef Jomon delivers in all areas and I would rate this restaurant a 10 out of 10. ",5,2020,02,10
118,Great Location,"Nice clean, warm hotel in a great location. Staff were very polite and attentive. The included breakfast was good with plenty of choice. Would recommend if visiting the Shard and local tourist spots. Nice room on the fourth floor facing the Shard, it all added up to a wonderful weekend.",5,2020,02,04
118,"It's ok, nothing special","Nice place, but constant interruptions be staff spoilt our stay. The front desk called 3 times asking when we were checking out, even though we had a late checkout.

Then housecleaning walked in without knocking and also ignoring the do not disturb sign.

We had afternoon tea, it was ok, nothing that special considering the price.

Not keen to revisit",3,2020,02,02
118,Really lovely,"It is a beautiful hotel situated in a great location. Central to most places when using uber. Would defo come here again. Heated toilet seat and bathroom flooring.

Amazing

Customer service great. They do require a ¬£100 refundable deposit which we wasnt aware of but it wasnt a problem. Situated next to the shard which we had a reasonable view of.

Mini bar was complimentary and we turned up with a bottle of prosecco on ice. :)",5,2020,01,31
118,Great hotel,"We stayed in a Senior Classroom which was lovely. The room was spacious, clean and tidy. The bed was large and comfy and the bathroom had awesome heated floors. 

The breakfast was either a cooked English or Indian hot meal with a well stocked buffet too.

We were made to feel very welcome when we were arrived and the staff were helpful and very polite.

The location is greay, just in front of Tower Bridge. We would stay here again.",5,2020,01,30
118,"Great Location, Friendly Staff, Heated Bathroom Floors!","Stayed at the LaLit London from 12/23/19-12/28/19 and had a great time. The location is great, right around the street from the Tower Bridge. The Shard is a quick 8 minute walk away for some great restaurants/bars. There's a few pubs and restaurants just around the corner.
The staff was amazing and super helpful. We had a lot of luggage and they were right there to help during arrival before we could even get out of the Uber. Check in was fast and the bags brought up to our room quickly. Same service on the way out too.
The room was great and had a Japanese style toilet and heated floors! Shower was nice, plenty of space in the room, and free drinks and snacks. 
Great location, friendly and helpful staff, nice rooms. Yes, I would recommend the LaLit London!",5,2020,01,28
118,Good Trip,This hotel is my number one for when I am going on business on this side of the city. Rooms are lovely and spotlessly clean. It is a MUST to dine in the dining room!! Fabulous food and drink. Wonderful ambience!,4,2020,01,27
118,A hidden gem but not for long!,"This hotel is off the beaten path.  But once people find out about it the secret will be out.  We normally stay on the other side of London and came across this hotel.  
Boy what a treat - luxury hotel, staff beyond fantastic, the rooms were cozy, clean roomy - loved the heated floors and toilet seat.   
You won‚Äôt be disappointed - will come back again. ",5,2020,01,26
118,"Wonderful hotel, excellent staff, highly recommended.","The breakfast bacon and coffee could do with upgrading, that‚Äôs all 
Other than that, a hotel to die for. Just brilliant. Area transformed to a safe one. Easy walk back from Bridge theatre.  (You would not walk here at night 30 years ago. ) We‚Äôll be back.",5,2020,01,26
118,Faultless service and experience,"From the minute we arrived to beaming smiles and respectful authentic greetings, our stay has been exceptional.
The service is on a level I have never experienced before.
Nothing is too much trouble for the staff from reception to restaurant to bar to room staff, each one has gone above and beyond service excellence.
This has to be added to a ""must stay at"" list of hotels.
Thank you for making our stay and my wife's birthday exceptionally special.
We look forward to returning.",5,2020,01,26
118,Excellent hotel,"Namaskar.
Nothing to say. It was perfect. May be just a little bit hot inside, but it's nothing...
Beautiful place, friendly personal, perfectly clean rooms and so quite! The best experience in London.
I recommend it definitely.",5,2020,01,26
118,Beautiful Hotel,"A beautiful hotel. Great if you are looking for something a bit different. Lovely attentive staff The concierge Tony was so helpful as we were confused with all the bus lanes whilst travelling to the hotel by car. He was patient and guided us and then came out across the road to help us with our luggage. 
Breakfast was so tasty! Delicious Indian food made to order. I really enjoyed the Aloo paratha.
Bed was big and comfortable. We loved the underfloor heating in the bathroom and the heated toilet seat!! 
Great location when visiting London. I would recommend not travelling to this hotel by car unless you are familiar with driving in London.
",5,2020,01,25
118,Good location,"Bed narrow and not very confortable if we compare with other Hotels. Good location. Splendid d√©coration. Baekfast too expensive for what it is (no eggs for ex)
Personnel very kind. Calm Room - good isolation.",3,2020,01,25
118,The most special stay,"My other half booked The LaLit as a surprise. He spoke with the hotel beforehand and asked for the best room for a special occasion (which turned out to be our engagement!) and the hotel delivered the best! We had a stunning view of the shard and it was the perfect setting for such a wonderful weekend. The room was clean, comfortable and the bathroom was fabulous. There were so many lovely touches like the complimentary snacks and the chocolates. The location was absolutely amazing. My only gripe would be that it would be good to be told ahead of time that there's a wedding, as the restaurant was then unavailable and this might affect guests' decisions to stay on that particular night. 
Overall, a very, very special hotel that we'll remember forever.",5,2020,01,21
118,Nice hotel - shame about the noise,"Good first impressions of the LaLit, nice staff and beautiful surroundings. At check in we were asked if we were part of the wedding booking - we were not and had no idea a wedding would be happening as we had not been Pre-warned. We booked via booking.com and I have had communication previously from hotels I have booked, via their messaging service.

Room was nice, good bathroom, bed a bit small, even for a double. The complimentary mini bar which we‚Äôd told would be stocked with soft drinks and snacks had only water in it.

In the evening the restaurant was closed for the wedding, the bar was still open and would remain so until 1am. I had asked a staff member early evening for the mini bar to be stocked but this was not done.

When we went to our room, we noticed just how loud the wedding disco was as we walked along the corridor - our room was situated pretty close to the function room. By this time in the evening - 11pm - they‚Äôd moved onto 90‚Äôs house music...loud 90‚Äôs house music at that.

In our room we could clearly hear everything and it was quite intrusive. I asked a staff member what time it would be finishing and they didn‚Äôt know. I figured 12am so didn‚Äôt think it would be too bad.  The music did end at 12 but as the bar was open till 1, there were loud wedding guests traipsing up and down the corridor, talking loudly and slamming doors till about 1.30am, not quite so good when you pay ¬£200 a night for a calm and tranquil hotel room.

Upon check out, we expressed our view and the staff did knock the cost of our bar bill from the final bill, however, given that we only get to come away together once a year if that, this was a bit disappointing as the wedding really had ruined it in part.

Ideally - we should have been made aware of the wedding in advance and given the option to cancel.

The hotel should also have been sure to place non-wedding guests away from the wedding function room.

Essentially, if you cannot look after other guests with a wedding on, with the mini bar and noise disturbance etc, then you should offer exclusive-use only.

Sorry LaLit, unlikely to return. We‚Äôve stayed at various hotels in various parts of London, this has been the most disappointing so far.",3,2020,01,19
118,Perfect location,"The Lalit is located within a 10 minute stroll of London bridge and you can't really beat the location in central London. The hotel is luxurious, the rooms are big and the staff are very friendly.

Would stay here again for sure and recommend to others!",5,2020,01,15
118,Home away from home!,"We spent 10 days at the lalit & were super comfortable! Staff was very friendly & helpful especially recommend Harshit, the manager & Sergio n Tony from the concierge desk. Baluchi is a lovely restaurant. The decor is very luxurious & pleasing to the eye. On the whole a super stay. We‚Äôll be back üëç",5,2020,01,15
118,Excellent Hotel,"Great service on check in and check out, the food is excellent and the rooms and public areas are spotlessly clean. Located only a 5 minute walk from London Bridge station. The Lalit is by far the best hotel I've stayed in in London",5,2020,01,11
118,Gorgeous Anniversary Stay,"Myself and my partner stayed the night here for our anniversary. Our room was stunning. 

Complimentary chocolates and Prosecco, use of the mini bar including drinks and snacks. 
Our room was ready when we arrived at 11:30 which was great as we left our bags and headed out for the day. As the hotel knew we were stayed for a special occasion, we were treated to a cake which we found on our return to the hotel in the evening which was a lovely tough. 
The bed was very comfy and the bathroom had underfloor heating which was so nice, with complimentary toiletries and flannels also in our bathroom. 

Breakfast was included within the price of our stay, with a continental option available as well as the full English breakfast or Indian styled breakfast. Good selection and very tasty. 

3-5 minute walk from London Bridge station, good location with views of The Shard and Tower Bridge. 

Would totally recommend this hotel for a special occasion",5,2020,01,05
118,LaLit - could have done better,"Unfortunately not an experience I would expect from a five star hotel. First of all gave us a room that already had a guest staying in it. Staff was quick to change the room, but the room was lacking - no info in the room - spa, room service, WiFi etc and the tv remote didn‚Äôt work. 
Room was very small, no coat hooks, handle on shower only on outside not on inside which made it awkward to open the shower door. Also no one on the front door of the hotel to welcome and greet you. Although staff were polite and quick to rectify any problems. Communal areas were good.
Just not what I expect from 5 star hotel and I have stayed in many. Left feeling as if ‚Äúcould have done better‚Äù. Shame was supposed to be a celebration.",3,2020,01,05
118,Anniversary Staycation ,"We have just returned from our staycation at the Lalit. We got married at the Lalit in Udaipur but live in London, so we thought we‚Äôd celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary here. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay, just a few things to note: 
- check in: I called in the morning of our stay to see if we could check in slightly earlier. I was told that would not be possible as the staff will need to decorate our room as it was our anniversary and they wanted to do something special for us, so they asked we come for 2pm which was totally fine. I also asked whether I could make spa treatment bookings over the phone. The receptionist then said the spa wasn‚Äôt open on the weekend which surprised me as the website suggests that the Rejuve Spa is open Monday-Sunday 10-6pm. The receptionist advised he would double check and see if he could organise something as it was our anniversary. I would be told at the check in. Alas, at the check in, I asked and was told that the spa is open on Saturdays. I queried this as the website said something else and I was told something else on the phone but I was assured the spa was open on Saturday but just not on Sunday. When we entered the room, I called the Spa - no response. Called the concierge and was told that the spa wasn‚Äôt open on the weekend. Informed the concierge that I was told differently at the check in and the website also provided inaccurate information. No apology or anything just a ‚Äòthe guy at the check in just didn‚Äôt know‚Äô. Now, I have a few issues with this - please train your staff. This kind of misinformation is not befitting of a five star hotel. Secondly, please correct your website - it is quite distressing that the website displays false information about the hotel‚Äôs facilities. As it was our wedding anniversary, we really wanted to relax and the spa was part of the reason I booked the hotel. Thirdly, the room wasn‚Äôt decorated at all for our anniversary. There was just a note and four little chocolates. Again, I think a five star hotel should do better to make a stay memorable if it is for something like birthdays or anniversaries especially as the hotel had now told me that they would be decorating our room and hence we would not be getting the room any earlier. 

- minibar: I booked a senior classroom and paid slightly more as the website advertises free minibar. Again, inaccurate information as the website fails to explicitly mention that the complimentary minibar only includes water, coke, chocolate, 1pack of popcorn, crisps and pretzels. I would have expected based for the prize and the information on the website. 

- restaurant/food: staff and food absolutely exceptional. Compliments to the chef, Jommo and Moses who took amazing care of us and thank you for the for the complimentary chocolate cake in the restaurant and the room at the end of the evening.

I really like the Lalit and will be coming back but it would be great if the hotel could take the above into consideration and improve people‚Äôs stay even more as those are very easy ‚Äòfixes‚Äô. ",4,2020,01,05
118,Lalit Hotel,"Excellent hotel and excellent service, the staff very friendly. We enjoyed our stay immensely. Perfect location and near by restaurants and places of interest. Easy access to central london. Will go back definitely in the future.",5,2020,01,05
118,Amazing Experience,"I stayed here over Christmas with my son and we both thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  We each stayed in a Senior classroom, the room was very spacious and had a lot of light.  The bed was very comfortable and the water pressure in the shower was awsome!  The room has a small refrigerator and they also brought bottles of water during the evening turn down.  Slippers and robes were also furnished.  Everyone was very friendly and willing to help with anything.  The restaurant is beautiful and the food was very good.  The location worked great for us as well. It's was an old English school house.   I will definitely be back.",5,2020,01,04
118,Perfect Anniversary Stay,"Me and my partner had booked in here to stay for our one year anniversary and we were not disappointed at all! From the perfect location to the politeness of the staff everything was above and beyond! We arrived 3 hours before the usual check in time and were given our room early which was fantastic to drop our bags off and get exploring London ! Due to it being our anniversary we were also given a bottle of champagne and a cake which was a great touch !
The room was spacious and mini bar plentiful (which was also complimentary)! 
A choice between soft and hard pillows was also a very nice touch!
The bathroom had heated flooring and a heated toilet seat (Japan style) which was very modern ! I could not fault this hotel at all, and the inclusive English & Indian breakfast in the morning in the stunning great hall was great too! A perfect stay thanks for making it memorable! ",5,2020,01,04
118,A Great Place for meeting,"I celebrated my company‚Äôs year end party here. It s amazing with the manager help and support. The place itself looks great, we have lots of nice pictures. He offered the meeting room that my team enjoyed a lot.

Would highly recommend for group in here.

I totally love it.",5,2020,01,04
118,Absolutely STUNNIN!,"I was booked to perform at the Lalit and we stayed in a massive gorgeous room on the 3rd floor. The service was incredible, so polite and welcoming. By far the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Our room also had a lovely view of London. Thank you! Happy new year from Juno Birch ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,2020,01,01
118,Very much enjoyed my stay,The friendliness of the staff has been exceptional. I also much appreciated the effort to have two adjacent rooms (additional family) in spite of different check-in dates for these rooms. Room was clean with luxury bathroom (heated floor),5,2019,12,31
118,Really disappointing experience ...,"I was in London for Christmas vacation and stayed at Hilton Bankside for 7 days or so (which is an amazing hotel! review coming up). For the last day, we stayed at the Lalit since we had read really stellar reviews about their breakfast/food and the whole experience. I must say that was a big mistake.

The room is average at best and the bathrooms are extremely small with limited number of towels. The room doesn't heat well- so they provide you with this mini heater- in our case it was mucked in dust so it felt pretty disgusting to bring it into the center of the room so the room could be heated.

Now the breakfast- it was the most terrible experience I have had in a long time. We were down in the restaurant at 10 am. They had the continental breakfast (cold breakfast) and an option for English or Indian breakfast. We ordered the Indian restaurant and went to get some of the ""cold"" breakfast. They were out of juices- so waited for 5 mins so it could refilled. The juices are supposed to be ""freshly squeezed"" but we saw them emptying fruit juice cans in the jugs :). Next we go to get fruits- and they were out of those too. I went back and asked the lady- this time she just chose to ignore us! Then we get some bread and look for butter and weren't able to find it- so we had to again ask for it- just to be ignored again. We go back to our table and we saw we  were already served tea/chai- but there was no sugar on the table. At this time, my husband went back again to ask for butter and sugar and we were asked to wait again. In 5 mins a server came back to our table with sugar- again with no butter! By this time it was 10.25- at this point I lost my patience and I went to the serving area and told them how silly it was to not give us butter for last 20 and the fact that we were now waiting for more than 25 mins for our Indian breakfast- Azim- another guy simply chose to ignore us until someone else showed up and got us butter and asked to wait for full breakfast some more! By this time our toasted bread was cold and hard. We waited for 10 more mins- and there was still no breakfast so again we had to go and ask for it- finally the waitress (Michaela) got it. It was 35 mins we were waiting for this- and her tone was not at all apologetic- when asked why the food was cold- her response was- it's a very busy time for them and they got it when based on when our ""ticket"" was created. By this time we had completely lost our patience- so we didn't even care to respond and just had the cold breakfast - which btw was not even the best to taste. We asked for extra tea given the one they served before was very cold by now- we were given a fresh cups of tea- but I could tell it was just reboiled: it was extremely strong and simply disgusting. 

All in all our experience was beyond pathetic. I reported this to the manager- he did listen to me but to me this was a complete waste of money. I would never come back to this hotel or any hotels operated by Lalit. I highly discourage booking this hotel!",1,2019,12,29
118,Really disappointing,"We were really disappointed with our experience of La Lit.  Firstly be warned that they will pre charge your card with 100 pounds per night for any extras.  This wouldnt have been a problem if they hadnt added a load of extras to our bill which they refused to remove on check out until they had further evidence that they werent ours.  They still havent removed the extra charges despite us contacting the manager direct.  Also dont expect that because youre staying at a 5 star you will get complementary 5 star service, service charge is added to everything even if you just order a cup of tea directly from the bar.  Our room wasnt cleaned and we had to wait in the lobby for this to be done.. even then the cleaners only did half a job.  Breakfast service was terrible , mistakes made repeatedly and we were told we would need to make our own toast despite it being part of the full english option. All in all a really disappointing experience which we wont be repeating.  We are contacting Visa to reverse the unauthorised charges to our card btw.  Really shouldnt be necessary... guests should have to sign for anything they add to the room then there can be no disputes.",2,2019,12,27
118,Wonderful hotel and fantastic staff,"The hotel is beautiful and the staff are extremely helpful and very courteous .  The check in and out has a personal touch with no big reception desk and large entrances, but a desk that you sit at and complete your details. The rooms are large and have everything you need, also with heated toilet seats.

The restaurant is beautiful with large blue crystal chandeliers hanging from a very high ceiling and the food was Devine. The service was impeccable and added to a lovely night with the family. 

This was our second stay in this hotel and would definitely stay again when in London",5,2019,12,23
118,Top hotel.,"Would highly recommend the Lalit Hotel. Room was perfect, comfy bed, spacious, bathroom excellent, complimentary fridge replenished upon request and the room was spotless.
Breakfast was excellent and something for everyone.
Staff - very pleasant, friendly and welcoming. On arrival met by Tony who was extremely helpful throughout our stay, especially with local knowledge.
Location - within easy walking reach of London Bridge tube station.
Will definitely be coming back. ",5,2019,12,22
118,Perfect hotel,"We stayed for one night but would have loved to stay longer. We were in London for our anniversary and the staff went out of their way to make us feel really valued. 
The hotel was really clean, impeccable service, comfortable bed, perfect room temperature and a superb view of The Shard. At Christmas this view is even more impressive as we watched the colours change. 
The breakfast room is truly beautiful with the blue chandeliers and high ceilings. Again, food and service excellent!
This hotel has been beautifully and respectfully converted from a Victorian School to a top class hotel.
We will definitely stay again whenever we can.
",5,2019,12,20
118,Not an inclusive hotel-no twin rooms so made to sleep together,I was shocked to discover this hotel doesn't cater for people who do want to sleep together??? My husband and I cannot sleep in the same bed due to medical needs and this hotel doesn't accommodate that which I find quite shocking. What if brother and sister wanted to stay or friends. I rang to book and the receptionist was quite blase about it. Bizarre!,2,2019,12,20
118,Accomodation,"Good accomodation specially referring to the location very close to the tower bridge.
Very good Indian restorant (perhaps a little  expensive)
Excellent room service.
the only recommendation I can make concerns the management of expense records at the restaurant, initially I had in fact been charged another guest's account",4,2019,12,20
118,Off the beaten track but well worth it,"A wonderful hotel with many unusual features 
The restaurant is excellent  - superb breakfast and an really good tasting menu all with vegetarian and Indian cuisine options 

the cocktail bar is definitely worth a visit ",5,2019,12,19
118,Excelent weekend hotel,"Really enjoyed our stay. This is a quality hotell trough and trough. Good food, nice staff and excellent location. Short distance to the tube and lots of sights. Will definitely choose to stay here again if we get the chance. ",5,2019,12,19
118,Annual company meeting ,"Such a great hotel and lovely staff . I booked  conference room for my annual meeting. All hotel staff is soo helpful ,such a nice atmosphere ,delicious food and excellent service.
Great Indian hospitality!!!
",5,2019,12,18
118,Weekend Getaway,"Such a lovely stay at the Lalit, never fails to impress. From the rooms, the Bar, the Breakfast. Everything was on point. Will def be back for sure to experience the dinner. 
The shower was lush and you can't beat a good power shower! Thank you x",5,2019,12,17
118,Pleasant Stay,"It is close to main attractions, food, bars, and transport. It was quiet in the evenings. Perfect for a good night‚Äôs rest. The hotel was clean and well appointed. The staff was great: professional and pleasant. ",4,2019,12,16
118,"Beautiful, luxurious and felt like a real treat","Great reception staff and doorman, a lovely welcome. Staff very efficiently and quickly dealt with a small issue we had with lighting in the room.

The building decor was stunningly beautiful, everything felt so luxurious, especially in the main dining hall. 

Really lovely complimentary items in the room including a delicious bottle of Prosecco, a really welcome touch.

The room was beautiful and comfortable and great room service with a bed turndown and replenishing water in the room etc. Amazing to have heated and washing toilet seats! 

Everything felt and looked really clean.

Would definitely recommend and would certainly love to go back.

On the very slight negatives, the breakfast and bar staff that were assigned to us were quite unfriendly and we had to keep asking for those simple little things like milk to have with the tea, and then needed to ask for a strainer for the tea leaves, it just all felt quite hard work at times, and no friendliness about those we had.

Both of the lifts were out of order all weekend.

The 'landmark view' (the Shard) could be seeing if you peeked out of a tiny window!

It seemed expensive to stay for one night in a 'suite' that wasn't really a suit as it was only one room with a bathroom still, it was slightly less than staying in the Shard!",4,2019,12,15
118,Very nice hotel,We enjoyed out stay at this hotel. Staff were excellent. Very nice decor and of high standard. Great location near to Tower Bridge. We ate at the restaurant which had a very high standard Indian Menu. We were disappointed that a tray with breakfast items was outside our room and stayed there for many hours after we reported it. The hotel was busy with a large function going on which may account for that but all in all highly recommend and we will go back when we stay up in London again.,4,2019,12,14
118,Lovely hotel and location,Had a a very nice weekend staying at this hotel. Only negative was the TV didn‚Äôt work which was a slight inconvenience and welcome someone else! But bar and restaurant was very good. Indian food and breakfast was excellent as well as the service.,4,2019,12,13
118,Great Experience,"We arrived several hours early and were given a complimentary upgrade to an available room with Shard view. Spacious and very comfortable. Amazing accommodating staff .Fabulous breakfast.  And dinner also.  Perfect location between London and Tower bridges, and close to public transportation and restaurants/shopping.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,12,13
118,Amazing stay,Can not recommend enough. Will be returning for sure.  They went completely our of their way to go the extra mile as it was my bf birthday. The room was amazing as were all the staff. Nothing was an effort. We have stayed in a few 5* London  hotels but this 1 is far our favourite. ,5,2019,12,13
118,very professional service,"Perfect location, very nice interior and friendly staff. Actually it is old school rebuild as a hotel and you will find many names as out of school like rooms and named classes...:-))
Check in/check out is extremely fast and effective.
Breakfast very good in a quiet restaurant.",5,2019,12,11
118,A few tweaks would give this hotel a five star rating,"First the good - great location with great views, lovely hotel building and rooms and generally friendly and professional staff, especially Fabrice and the English male concierge whose name I unfortunately forget.

Now the areas that I think need improvement - I was surprised that some of the staff were quite unfriendly and unhelpful such as one of the night managers who seemed more concerned about his paperwork than serving guests - he couldn't even be bothered to look up when I asked questions. The cleaning ladies were generally nice except for one who looked downright mean and refused to smile! 

For an Indian owned hotel chain that advertises ayurvedic massage in the spa, it was very disappointing. The massage was just hot oil, and the lady clearly had no clue what an ayurvedic massage really means - waste of GBP125. 

Also when I checked in the room was very cold despite the heat being set high. I was told it was due to the large windows and was given a heater and choice of another room. I stayed in the original room as it was lovely and the heater worked but realized the next am that it was cold because a window that was high up was left open!

With a few tweaks this would have been a much better experience, especially the bad attitude of a few members of staff.",4,2019,12,09
118,Absolutely lovely :),"This was our first visit & I must say it has the wow factor - from the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff to the decor. It is absolutely lovely & the Indian touches are beautiful. The room was beautifully decorated and really clean and comfortable. There is plenty of room wardrobe wise & there is actually a fridge that keeps things nicely chilled (the amount of times I have stayed in hotels with a fridge and they just don't work!). The bathroom was really clean with lovely products and if you are into gadgets, the toilet has buttons to press and a warm seat too!!! Well worth a visit :)",5,2019,12,08
118,Wow ü§© can‚Äôt wait to come back. ,"I often pass this lovely building as I work nearby.  I wondered what it‚Äôs like. 

Now I know: It‚Äôs awesome!

We decided to have a weekend in London as the kids bought us a voucher for a meal.

This hotel is a stunning building and our room was fantastic.  It was light, clean and comfortable. The toilet even has a heated seat and washes your bits!  üò≥

The staff were really friendly and knowledgeable. Tony was especially helpful and was happy to chat about the place and the hotel group.  We decided that if we win the lottery we will tour India staying at their hotels and using their air travel company to go between each. Seriously; google it. 

The Indian themed restaurant looked wonderful but, as we were going out for a meal anyway we did not try it.

We will be back soon and we will try the restaurant. 

Thank you. 
",5,2019,12,08
118,Stunning hotel & location,"If you're staying towards the east of London this is perfect, 2 minutes to Tower Bridge and 5 mins to Tower of London. A converted school which is simply beautiful. We had the basic room but it was beautiful and perfect for a one night stay. Most important the room was spotless and had everything that you need, and a really good size. The concierge pointed us to a great Christmas market, off the beaten track which we would never have found, great concierge work!! Loved it and would definitely recommend. How anyone can give this hotel less than 5 stars is beyond me.",5,2019,12,07
118,Incredible hotel,"This small hotel promises a lot in terms of aesthetics, with some neo-modern-Indian style not found in my book of styles, and a rich decoration. The result is surprising, and food for thought. The Japanese-style toilets, seldom found in London, are also a curiosity deserving an exploratory visit, as well as useful.

Where the 5 star offers more expectations than experience is for its food, generally average, or below expectations, such as dry croissants, or cold samosas.

Service includes personalised greetings the Indian way, and a high degree of attention.

This hotel with a personality is definitely recommended for a one-off trial.",4,2019,12,06
118,Disappointing,"I checked in and was put in a room which at first seemed quiet.  BUT at night the noise was unbearable from a pump of some kind.  I was moved to an accessible room which was quiet.

The very disappointing thing is I left a Zwilling manicure set in the room.  I phone within 2 hours but no one answered.  I phoned later and again no one answered.  I emailed no answer.  They sent a survey so I replied to that email but again no answer.  I sent a friend eventually but they said they did not have it.  This is very sad as this kit had sentimental value as well as costing 150 pounds.

This hotel is a mix of good and bad.  Great food but poor customer service.",3,2019,12,04
118,"Quality service, even better food, amazing staff","I was in The Lalit for a business dinner, and frankly - i never wanted the night to end. Food was amazing. Service was high level. Chef Jamon personally kept on coming few times to explain details about the meals. Might be worth mentioning that I really don't like lamb meat, but the way it was cooked was so delicious that not a single breadcrumb remained on my plate! Top class!!!",5,2019,12,03
118,Service was Exceptional !!!,"I stayed 3 Nights on a business trip and the hotel was very comfortable and accommodating with Great Location outstanding Ambiance Excellent Service from a very caring and friendly staff . I can‚Äôt say enough wonderful things about this Hotel ,All food was excellent loved it . I would happily stay here again and will definitely recommend family & friends . ",5,2019,11,28
118,Magnificent,This place widely deserves to be a 5 star luxury hotel because everything is perfect! The room was incredibly decorated and comfortable. The staff very professional but warm at the same time and the dinner at the restaurant of the hotel very tasting for Indian cuisine. We had a great experience here in London and we have been so happy to had decided to stay in this hotel. Highly recommended,5,2019,11,28
118,Quality food,We had an amazing experience in the Lalit. Both mains and starters were yummy. The staff was so helpful and friendly. Deffinetely worth visiting. The athmosphere was really nice in the hotels restaurant.,5,2019,11,27
118,‚ÄúFantastic Luxury 5 Star Experience ‚Äú,"The Lalit is a true international class hotel with highly professional service, luxury amenities and comfort. The staff is excellent - friendly and helpful, rooms are modern with very comfortable beds.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a 5 star hotel with top class service.",5,2019,11,27
118,"A beautiful visit to The Lalit London, true to it‚Äôs name - Lalit (Hindi translation of the name works to Beautiful)","Visited for the second time in one month, this beautiful hotel for sure has some magnetism......perfect for business travel as well, in addition to pure leisure. Restaurant and the staff were again great.  

The food here does not compromise on any of the spices, the essence of Indian culinary art.

Additionally the concept followed here, to retain the relationship from history, when this was a grammar school is worth a special praise as well.

Lives up to its name ‚ÄúLalit‚Äù, that has a meaning in Hindi as - ‡§Æ‡§®‡•ã‡§π‡§∞/ ‡§∏‡•Å‡§Ç‡§¶‡§∞; Beauty",5,2019,11,26
118,Stunning Anglo/Asian fusion,"Top class service from all staff, all seemed highly trainined and customer-oriented.
Beautiful building and interior-I especially love the wood panelling and archways kept from its days from being a school.",5,2019,11,24
118,"Interesting property, just not a 5-star","I am very conflicted about my stay at the lalit. If I was told this was a 4-star hotel, I would have been very happy. There's a lot to like. But I was told it was a five star hotel, and in the top fraction of a percent in london, and that level of expectation was not met.

First, the plusses. It's a interesting and quirky property. Being a converted school, you'll never think you were in just another business hotel. The room I had was to my taste. Poorly laid out due to the conversion, but these amazing huge windows with a great view of the shard from bed. Small things: free snacks in the room instead of nickel and diming from the ""minibar"". Wifi wasn't spectacular speed but was solid enough for video conference. One night that I had a unwinding beer at the bar was pleasant ( although no beer on tap ).

Then, a set of minuses. While people in review sites rave about the staff, the front door was usually unmanned, no door opening for you. The heat in the room would not go above 22 degrees, and when I discussed with staff, they blamed my inability to use the equipment ( but did no better themselves ). 22 wasn't cold, but isn't warm either. My colleague tried to host a dinner at the restaurant, but was told there was a technical difficulty and - if I have the story right - they weren't serving dinner ( he should have called ahead, but I wouldn't have expected! ), the phone didn't work when I first came ( easily rectified by staff ). No overnight laundry, laundry bags initially not in the room, and when I turned in laundry in my own bag, they lost the bag ( a fancy compression bag ). And it turns out walls are thin: one morning I could clearly hear the occupant of the next room's conference call and what they were saying, and I wondered what they had been hearing of mine! Finally, the location is only half-good because the nearest tube stop is a full 10 minute walk ( the 9 minutes on google doesn't include the extra distance into the station ), even though the river walk is a few minutes away. Maintenance is a problem: the table with tea and coffee had divots and chips and should have been replaced far earlier.

I think if you go in with the expectation that you're getting a quirky experience in the 4-star quality range, and upgrade your room to the slightly larger ones, you'll have a good stay. 5-star level it is not, your expectations will not be met.

This place is a great antidote to the ""standard business hotel"" blues, I think I'll try a few other places to find someplace more suitable.",4,2019,11,23
118,Great location variable service,"This hotel is in a perfect position to visit the Tower of London, the shard et cetera. Guests are greeted with gorgeous scent as they enter the main building. However we wondered around searching for reception as it was not manned when we arrived. The room was a good size with a modern Japanese style toilet. The spectacular old headmasters room is worth a look however the cocktails described as exotic and fantastic are simply average. Unfortunately the same applies for English breakfast which is described as having tomato mushroom and sausage which means half a tomato the Cap of one small mushroom and a small sausage. Once again just slightly underwhelming. We thought ¬£31 for two Irish coffees (made in a wineglass) was also a bit steep even though this hotel is in a smart area of London.The old school hall is now a stunning looking Indian restaurant where again the decor surpasses the quality of the food. Nearly worth four stars but I‚Äôm afraid has more work to do.",3,2019,11,20
118,"Lovely hotel, really small bed","Lovely hotel, prefect location. My only fault was the size of the bed. Fair to small!

Bathroom was a good size, especially the wet room shower area. 
Battery wasn‚Äôt working in the tv remote which was a little annoying. ",4,2019,11,18
118,A lovely hotel,"Well located close to lots of landmarks just on the south side of the river, this is a lovely upper end hotel.
The staff are very polite, helpful and welcoming.
I stayed in a mid-upper range room which was modestly equipped but had a lovely bathroom.
Mine was an all too brief overnight stay... I shall return to dine and visit the spa, both of which look very good.",4,2019,11,17
118,Birthday Treat,"I dont actually know where to start. From the moment we checked in to the moment we left it was all absolutely outstanding. We were made to feel so welcome and our room was amazing. 
We have stayed in a few luxury bigget hotels in london but can not rate nor recommend The Lalit enough.
The food in the restaurant was outstanding and all the staff from the reception, bar staff and waiting staff were lovely. 
Thank you for making my boyfriends birthday treat 1 to remember you shall be seeing us again very soon.",5,2019,11,16
118,Mr,"5 star surroundings

Clearly London‚Äôs most glamorous Indian cuisine. The most memorable and distinctive restaurant and menu I have encountered anywhere in the City. Something really special. A big thank you to all at the hotel.",5,2019,11,14
118,High Chai Afternoon Tea,"Great concept, cute presentation. However, the experience was underwhelming. I scheduled a High Chai for 2:30pm on a Friday. I was one of two dining parties in the entire Gallery of the Lalit. As a single diner, I was seated directly in the center, facing the wall. The empty space was quiet with soft music piped in; staff were mingling about setting up for (what I hope) is an evening rush and a phone loudly ringing near reception, and the echo of footsteps and dishes in the room over. First was the masala chai and mango lassi. Cute presentation, I was given a small whimsical glass of tea and a bottle of lassi with a straw. both good. I ordered the vegetarian plate. The samosas were good and probably the highlight. The veggie kathi roll was also okay but not a personal favorite. The second tray included the array of chutneys, bhel, and dhokla. The bhel had a slightly salty flavor that lingered, similar to a large flaky salt. Would have preferred a citrus or tangy aftertaste instead. And the khaman dhokla was dry, even with the addition of chutneys. Top level sweets were also good, but nothing fantastic and could have had more variety. I was provided only one cup of chai, and was not revisited by wait staff after the snacks were delivered and waited almost another 20 minutes past finishing before I was asked about the bill. The handful of staff in the Gallery seemed to be unaware there was a customer and spent this time pacing across the room in front of my table without so much as a smile to warm up my dining experience. While this is something unique and a wonderful space, it lacked passion, creativity, and liveliness that it should have had. I would say my experience receiving masala chai while queuing for Dishoom was much more invigorating and provided more value in quality and environment. The lack of service and personality make the High Chai at the Lalit a pass rather than a can't-miss.",3,2019,11,11
118,Gorgeous Hotel in Ideal Location,"We stayed on 09th November for our wedding anniversary and had a wonderful stay here. We loved the interior and decor of the hotel - it smells gorgeous as soon as you walk in (like a spa) and the oriental theme is great. Our superior classroom was reasonably sized and nicely laid out. We appreciated the little touches like the biscuits/snacks and the heated fancy toilet seat! We had a problem with the swipe card not working and had to use a manual key for entry in the end, but this was sorted out swiftly for us. We did find the check in a little slow/there was always a queue waiting for reception. We had some drinks in the evening in the cocktail bar and found the bartender wonderful - she made us anything we asked for (off the menu, but at a price!)... we loved the breakfast and the Balucchi room is stunning (those chandeliers!). The location is ideal for exploring tower bridge area/nice walks. Our biggest disappointment was that there was no cuddly elephant on our bed as per all the brochures/pictures online. The room was booked for us as our anniversary present and it was chosen by my brother specifically because he knows we love elephants (our wedding was elephant themed). We didn't actually see many elephants inside the hotel. The beautiful elephant in front of the hotel is great though! We would def recommend! ",4,2019,11,11
118,Great staff,"This is a newly refurbished boutique hotel which was clean and had a very comfortable bed. I did not think that it had the 'wow' factor but it was reasonably priced and the staff were incredibly helpful and personable and they pushed the boat out to make our stay enjoyable (which it was).

The breakfast was fine if a little restricted in range and every component that we tasted was of a good quality.",4,2019,11,11
118,The best hotel in se1,"Stayed here when visiting the shard which is only half a mile away and you can walk to in ten minutes. you walk into this hotel and immediately you notice how peaceful and relaxing it is with it excellent staff and the most helpful concierge, the rooms are beautiful, clean and well equipped,the food is amazing and the on site spa for even more of a relaxing stay, I would highly recommend staying here to everyone!!!!!",5,2019,11,08
118,Beautiful old school - now a hotel!,"Beautifully restored building, now a 5 star hotel.  The assembly room is now the restaurant and has exquisite cobalt blue chandeliers.The bar is the old teacher‚Äôs lounge which seems very appropriate!

118,My recent stay at The Lalit London,"Very good hotel, with superior facilities and services.
Cleanliness and sleep quality excellent
The hotel is located close to the London Bridge tube and station, nearby many restaurants and places of interest to visit. 
I really recommend it",4,2019,11,06
118,Beautiful boutique hotel tastefully furnished,"Lovely room, food, staff and ambience.  Speedy check-in process.  Bedroom (or classroom!) was super, en suite huge.  There was good choice of breakfast and the food was good.  Staff were attentive and asked if there was anything they could improve upon - I said no.",5,2019,11,06
118,Cozy hotel with simple service,"Lalit is a high priced hotel. The hotel is cozy and nicely located in London, but the service fails. There is no minibar and simple things as getting a cup of coffee in the room is very complicated and heavily charged. I have been spammed with review questionaires and promotion on the hotel after departure in spite of several requests to be relieved from their spamming. I have not received my invoice although I was promissed to recive this in an email at departure weeks ago. Overall a below average service experience somewhat compensated by a charming decor.

118,25th anniversary in London,It is a really really nice property; the staff is attentive and very professional.  It is located super close to the Tower Bridge and has many nice eateries close by.  The bar and restaurant at the hotel are very nice. It was a really nice place to stay.   ,5,2019,11,05
118,One night stay in the hotel- Horrible service,"I made two bookings in the hotel, one being one night and the other one being two nights for the next three days. Told them the night before that I do not wish to change room and the reception said it is probably okay. The next day, I was told to check out regardless right before i left for my meeting. The reception lady was rude and have 0 service minded. Started to threaten to call security saying that I have to move out regardless. 0 attempt to correct the inconvenience that they have caused me. Will never stay in this hotel ever again. For the price i paid for the rooms, would expect to treated better than this. Also was on a phone meeting during breakfast and indicated times and times again that i am on a call, but the breakfast lady keeps interrupting.",1,2019,11,05

118,"Pretty building, that‚Äôs about it.","This is not a five start hotel. Upon arrival, we managed to get our bags into reception (up the stairs, no assistance with door that was not automated). The bellman did a nice job getting our bags to our room but we were given the wrong room type. After that got sorted out, things were fine, not great, just fine. The staff was courteous when we had questions, but they did not go out of their way to help. One member of staff repeatedly greeted us with ‚Äúnamaste‚Äù and proceeded to walk away each time. It was strange. We had breakfast one morning and the staff was friendly. Our room was clean, the bed not comfortable. The bathroom was nice, but the lighting in there was very poor. Nothing terrible with our stay, but nothing remarkable either. We won‚Äôt stay again and do not recommend this hotel when there are so many others to choose from.",3,2019,10,24
118,Very disappointed ,"We paid just over $3,000 for 2 rooms for 3 nights.  One room was supposed to be a King Suite.  Well, I‚Äôve stayed at bigger rooms at a Travel Lodge.  Just because you call it a suite and charge for a suite doesn‚Äôt make it a suite.  There was no mirror or light at the dressing table so I put on my makeup in a dimly lit bathroom.  I had to use the blow dryer plugged in to the bedside table next to the bed as the only mirror was near the door as you left the room.  
I made my disappointment known to management whose reply was ‚Äúthank you for your feedback‚Äù.   Really?  Oh ok.  

The extra seating area was referred to which magically made this room a suite.   This was a tiny area about 3‚Äô x 5‚Äô which had the tea service, the dressing table (with no mirror or light) and a little table for 2 people with 2 chairs.   The windows were frosted as we were on the ground floor so there was nothing to look out at even if you did want to go have a cup of tea and sit in the little cave.   We kept our luggage in this completely useless space.  The room was so small you had a walkway around the bed and to the bathroom.  
How can you get a 5star rating without a swimming pool?
We did order 3 club sandwiches and told a delivery time of 30 min.  After an hour we phoned for an update and were told they were short staffed.   The sandwiches were very good once we did finally get them.  

We never saw any one in the restaurant the whole 3 days we were there.  
We did have 4 drinks in their tiny bar one night before going up.  1 beer, 1 vodka & Diet Coke and 2 non alcoholic drinks was ¬£40.00.   Just outrageous.  

I have travelled all over the world and only stay at 4-5 star hotels.  This hotel has a way to go!! 

I write this while sitting at THe Mere Golf Resort in Mere, Knutsford.  4 star.  We have a Jr Suite ¬£200/night.  It‚Äôs probably 3 times bigger than what we had last night.  Absolutely brilliant staff - so friendly - room service was quick and delicious and reasonably priced.  ",1,2019,10,24
118,Perfect Break Away with a outstanding restaurant ,"¬∑¬†We travelled down for our 6 year anniversary me and my wife, location specifically chosen fir it's great access to street food and borough market. our room was lovely with the little touch pre hand of champagne and chocolates on our bed it just made our stay more special. We chose to eat at the hotels Indian restruant which was nothing short of fantastic! what a beautiful blue hall room. The Food was absloutley the beast Indian food we have eaten, its traditional with a twist of class. My wife who eats octopus at every fancy restruant we go to said hands down the kre set menu making it a great evening. Breakfast in the morning was also top notch, large choice of continental food along with your English breakfast and the restruants Indian counterpart I chose the Indian breakfast which was superb and CSN be seen in my pictures If staying in the area again I would bit look elsewhere than to come straight back and booo the restruant for food again!

118,Fantastic Hotel In The Heart Of Big London Town,"Well, what a fantastic hidden gem this place is.  Bang in central London 2 mins walk to tower bridge and the crown Jules. You book in and feel like royalty but at a sensable price. Room was amazing and i had my first experience of a full automated heated seat toilet.  This place is a must and I will be back everytime I am in town. Great job guys.",5,2019,10,22
118,Perfect Stay,I'm wheelchair bound and I can't sing the praises of this hotel highly enough for all the help they gave me. Nothing was too much to ask. The room was lovely with a real accessible bathroom. Everywhere was spotless and the meals superb. We will be back.,5,2019,10,18
118,Overpriced hotel / poor service,"We had booked the Tower Suite, which is charged a considerable amount of money to add an extra bed for our son, who is 12 years old. 
Upon check-in (late at night), the receptionist informed us that he wasn't sure if the bed is in the suite, and he was quite comfortable with his answer, given the fact that we had to take a rest after our long journey.
He also informed us that he would charge our credit card with an extra of 200 pounds in case we cause any damages in the room.
When we arrived at the Tower Suite, we realized that the bed for our son was nothing more than a cot (if this is the right word). 
Attached you will find a photo of it. 
Apart from the above, the service during our stay was nothing special. 
From the first night, we had to ask for vanity kits, bottles of water, towels for hair, and other things that should be in their place all the time in a 5-star hotel. 
But the cherry on the cake was when we had to check out. 
From the moment my husband arranged the checkout, all the key cards didn't work, and we had to put our suitcases to hold our door and the floor door open.
At this point, I should add that for our five nights stay, the hotel charged our credit card in advance. 
AND NO, upon coming into the Tower Suite, there was no Lalit Elphie to greet us (that is the toy elephant, the signature of the hotel).",2,2019,10,17

118,Loved the Lalit,"We just spent one night at the Lalit in London and love it. Staff were amazing, and willing  to hold our luggage even after we checked out so we did not have to carry our luggage on the second day of tours. 
Love the location next to Tower Bridge and the Tower of London.",5,2019,10,11
118,"Best Indian Food in London, Stunning Location","A truly stunning location only minutes from London Bridge station, the Lalitl is a hidden gem. 
From the warm Indian welcome of ‚ÄòNamaskar‚Äô as the doors are pulled open, to the comforting smell of cooking bread wafting from the naanery to the beautiful rooms, it is hard to fault the Lalit London.
I was there for a romantic night with my wife, and we were made to feel as though nothing was too much trouble. 
Dinner in the opulent and dramatic Baluchi restaurant was the absolute highlight: award winning pan Indian food with a menu so extensive as so make choosing difficult, but with every dish more than hitting the spot. Lamb chops and chicken tikka to start were fragrant and delicate, our mains spicy and perfectly prepared and served, and the absolute crowning glory, the accompanying naan breads, cooked in their tandoori oven. Soft, buttery, hot and so moreish that we had 5 between us‚Ä¶!
We ended the meal with pudding in bed, equally delicious despite being absolutely full, and slept soundly in our king size bed.
Breakfast was lovely, the restaurant coming alive in the morning sunshine, and we left happy and relaxed, still reminiscing over the buttery naan and looking forward to our next visit.",5,2019,10,07

118,Reviews were spot on!,"We loved the hotel in its entirety. The rooms, staff, service were excellent. The staff went to extremes to make our stay the best possible. I really valued having a small boutique hotel in the heart of the city. After a long day of touring and rain, it was so nice to be greeted warmly. I realized how nice it is to be in a small hotel without crowds and waits for anything.",5,2019,10,03

118,Thank you for making my bday special ,"We stayed at The Lalit for one night in this exquisite hotel in London. Right from the moment we stepped out of the car the service was 5*. Sergio welcomed us to check in and showed us to our room. We travel all over the world and the service here was exceptional. Waiting in the the room was a bottle of bubbly for my birthday, a cake was presented at dinner and again at breakfast. The chef was very accommodating with our request of a dish. Just a beautiful property to stay in and excellent service. Thank you we will be back hopefully even though we only live in Surrey not too far from London.

118,A fantastic hotel- must stay!,"Was visiting London from California for my daughter‚Äôs college admission  and discovered this hotel by accident while walking towards the tower bridge.  It was breakfast time and we tried an amazing indian meal and indian masala chai. Service was very friendly even though we were not the hotel guests. Even the chef came out to greet us! The manager showed us around and told us about the history of that hotel. Remember we were not staying at the hotel and we got such excellent attention from manager to server to chef! 
We will be surely staying here on our next visit.",5,2019,10,01
118,Very good but service could be better,"We stayed five nights in the Lalit London hotel. On arrival we were greeted by a lovely friendly doorman. 

The room was very nice with a very comfortable bed. I‚Äôm not sure that I could tell the difference between the hard and soft pillows, even though they were labelled. I enjoyed the turndown service. The bidet toilet with its heated seat was cool too!

Breakfast was included in our room rate and it was okay. The danishes were very tasty. I asked for a tea without caffeine but was told they didn‚Äôt have any. The waiter even left the restaurant to see if he could find some but said he couldn‚Äôt. Odd because in our room we had lovely twinings red bush and chamomile teas - both caffeine free! Despite eating when there were only one or two other tables dining, our plates took a long time to be cleared, or sometimes weren‚Äôt. On one occasion I took our plates up to the person standing at the bar.

The hotel‚Äôs location is great, next door to the Potters Garden and Mayor‚Äôs office, a street in from the Thames river. There are good food options in the area. The London Bridge underground station is a ten minute walk from the hotel, so it‚Äôs easy to move around the city. 

This is a nice hotel but it just felt like something was missing. We had few interactions with staff apart from at breakfast. Some interactions, like the doorman when we arrived, were great, others were just flat. If all the interactions were on point this would be a great hotel.",4,2019,09,30
118,18th birthday meal,"We had my sons 18th birthday meal with 30 family members in the main restaurant.

The food was delicious and served when we required it. All good allergies were noted.

Due to late arrival of guests the staff accommodated them.

After cutting of the cake on the terrace we moved to the Headmasters room which everyone enjoyed having one last drink for the road.

Special thanks goes out to Raj and his staff.",5,2019,09,29
118,Lovely hotel,"Fantastic spot in London. Great building and great concept. Spacious rooms, excellent bathrooms. 
 Check-in was a little disappointing - rather manual and slow and not set out well or to the expectations for a hotel of this calibre. 
Breakfast was disappointing too. Usual layout of cereal, bread and juice, hardly luxury. The cooked breakfast took absolute ages to come - perhaps more staff in the kitchen and dining room would have made it better.",4,2019,09,26

118,Beautiful Hotel in prime location,"We have just returned from a 1 night stay at the Lalit and enjoyed everything about this lovely hotel. The staff were so friendly and the breakfast exceptional. The main dining room, with the blue chandeliers is very impressive. ",5,2019,09,23
118,An Intimate and Sophisticated Hotel Bar,"This review relates to the bar as I have not stayed in The Lalit. 

The Bar is luxuriously decorated in line with the buildings original purpose of that of a school. The wood flooring and high ceilings lends its self to a comfortable and intimate atmosphere. The ceiling is decorated in a mother of pearl matrix and reflects the light exceptionally well. The details in the bar is what makes the place worth patronising, super comfortable bar chairs (which is a rarity and sure sign of the high standard) combined with appropriate music and lighting. However the most impressive part of the bar are the staff who are excellent, friendly, accommodating and knowledgable about the impressive selection of alcohol available, particularly the whiskeys.

If you are in the area it‚Äôs well worth a visit particularly  if you are a whisky, vodka or rum fan. The extra dirty martinis are also worth a special mention.. 

The only downside is that it is not open late to non residents and hence not a late night bar due to, as I understand, licensing restrictions. 

TIP: the food is out of this world! Neo Indian bar snacks, lamb roll if you are hungry ",5,2019,09,11
118,Lovely stay,"Fabulous staff, beautiful hotel, loved my heated loo seat üòâ shower was drenching which washed off the London feel very well. Breakfast was delicious and great choice to of food, Would stay again, Thanks ",5,2019,09,11

118,a birthday treat,"I was given a curry for two by my children, as they know how much I love a good curry, we were booked in for a 7.00 dinner we arrived early to enjoy the hotel bar :-) as it was a school for over a hundred years the owners have kept the theme of a school in naming the rooms, the main dinning hall is a  magnificent high valted room, staff were very good and friendly, the food is total different to what you expect to see in a curry house, but the taste was also very different this is 5 star curry dinning, a very good experiance, small down side could have done with being a bit warmer as was a cold night",4,2019,09,10
118,Great stay in excellent hotel.,"Very comfortable hotel in excellent location. Staff are very helpful, rooms spotless and generously appointed. Public areas are very comfortable with a spectacular dining hall. Location is superb, only 400 metres from Tower Bridge and within easy reach of good restaurants etc on South Bank and Borough Market.",5,2019,09,08
118,My absolute worst hotel experience ever.,"Below is an email I wrote to the Manager of this god awful hotel.  I am yet to receive a call back.  Shocking!! dreadful, I will never recommend this hotel EVER! 

Dear Monica

Thank you ever so much for your empathy on the telephone earlier, the manner in which you received my call defused the situation from the offset as I am greatly disappointed and in some ways frustrated with my experience since checking in on Monday.  

On Monday morning when I arrived, after an 11.5 hour flight and a trek through the city I was as you can guess exhausted.  I had an hour to shower and get to the office but your front desk could not find my booking which left me sitting slightly embarrassed in the foyer for 40 minutes while he tried to locate my reservation which he then finally found  in guest services or something or other. 
 
On Monday night after work I removed my dress to have a shower, I placed my dress on the shelf by the mirror in the bathroom and have been coming back to my hotel every day since then to find my dress in the same place.  I am not expecting anyone to pack my clothes for me, but simply to hang it over a chair to neaten things up would have been a standard I am used to.  
My shoes have been all over my room, the person could not even straighten them, I ended up doing it.  Again, I‚Äôm not asking anyone to pack my suitcase, but the state I found my room in was rather poor.

On Tuesday after arriving back at the hotel after work, my half-finished cappuccino from the morning was standing on the dresser where I had left it.  I called down to the front desk to ask to have it removed.  That same night I ordered room service to the value of GBP27.00, when my food finally arrived I found myself signing a bill for GBP59.00 ‚Äì I went back to consult the menu because the charge was a lot more than what I had ordered.

Lastly, but definitely not least ‚Äì I am humiliated to have to explain the nature of my bedding.  It has not been changed for my entire stay.  There is a speck of blood on my sheet, I don‚Äôt think I need to go into further detail with this, but this has been so since Monday night!!!
I cannot imagine any hotel who leaves a guest sleeping on dirty bedding, especially sheets and covers which is evidently stained.  This is way below my standard and I am hoping yours too. 

My company has a corporate relationship with The Lalit, we are a global firm and we put guests and staff travelling to London up in your hotel frequently.  

I am bitterly aggrieved by my experience to this point.",1,2019,09,06
118,Excellent customer service,"We enjoyed La Lit because of the location and the friendly staff.  The rooms are clean and spacious! The mini bar and coffee/tea was refilled every day, and was free of charge which is nice late at night when you just want a little snack.  The location was perfect, and directly across the street from the bridge!  Staff went out of their way to accommodate every need and request.  ",5,2019,09,03
118,Great Stay ...,"This is a high quality place, with excellent service, lovely rooms, and a fine restaurant, all housed in an intriguing and beautifully restored building.

Breakfast was particularly good, with a selection of Indian dishes offered by our knowledgable waiter.

Highly recommended!",5,2019,09,02
118,Our London Stay at Lalit,"The hotel itself is a true splendor, the staff extremely polite, warm & friendly. Also of note is the Location!...just a few short steps from Tower Bridge and the Thames. I would definitely recommend Lalit to anyone I know visiting London and we will certainly try to stay there again on our next trip. Lalit was an amazing find!",5,2019,09,02
118,Continental breakfast,"The reservations were made including a continental breakfast ( coffee and bread?), but upon getting to the hotel, we were told that the reservations didn‚Äôt included a continental breakfast, they even wrote a letter telling us the continental breakfast wasn‚Äôt included . How much is the cost of the continental breakfast ? , $10.00?? . We were expecting deference on what was negotiated with the respectable travel agency that has made our reservations around the world for the las 35 years !! Well they lost 6 clients , the money we were going to pay for a complete breakfast , since we decided not to est anything in the hotel . ",2,2019,09,02
118,A Truly Brilliant Place!,"A truly must visit! Stayed overnight at this wonderful hotel. The service was outstanding, from the brilliant concierge and his reception team through to the breakfast room staff. All were helpful, polite and truly expert at their roles.
The ambiance was excellent, with beautiful bedrooms and common areas. The catering was superb with a wonderful set of choices across Indian and British best dishes.
Location was great - a stroll away from London Bridge and easy transport into the City.
We could not have asked for a better stay - our thanks to all who work there and to those who have created such a fine and memorable place.",5,2019,09,01
118,Historical Experience in the Heart of Tower Bridge!,"My experience at LaLit London was beyond surreal. The building, which used to be a school previously, is beautifully refurbished into an elegant boutique hotel.

The staff was attentive and knowledgable in all things related to the hotel but also it‚Äôs surroundings. I got showed to my room which was the Senior Classroom and I was immediately taken away by how amazing it was.

The staff had taken note that it was a birthday celebration and they beautifully decorated the room and offered a complimentary bottle of champagne. The room had loads of space for myself and a friend and it was more than we expected.

The location of the hotel was brilliant as well, being a short 5 minute walk from London Bridge station and bus routes to different parts of the city.

I would definitely visit LaLit London again and I highly recommend this establishment to anyone who wishes to pamper themselves while visiting the beautiful city of London!",5,2019,08,28
118,A luxurious Birthday celebration!,"Stayed for 1 night at the LaLit to celebrate my boyfriend's 21st birthday and wasn't disappointed. The room itself was fantastic, spacious, clean and bright with all the amenities and little extras you could hope for. Arrived to find a chilled bottle of prosecco and a box of chocolates. Upon arriving back from being out in London we had received a turn down service and someone shortly arrived with a birthday cake! Luckily we hadn't eaten dessert with our meal out as the cake was delicious. Had a couple of drinks in the bar downstairs in the evening and staff were so attentive and helpful, allowing my partner to sample some different drinks to see which one he preferred. We enjoyed a great night's sleep, the bed is big and very comfortable and the room dark and quiet. No noise could be heard from the road outside. My only one gripe was the continental breakfast was quite lacking and no other breakfast items other than full English was offered. All in all though we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the hotel and wonderful staff all helped my boyfriend enjoy his special day in style!",5,2019,08,28
118,Exemplary ,"Super polite, personal, understated service is standard in the luxury hotel. I love it. Super little touches in the rooms take it to the next level and the staff are all wonderful. I highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,08,27
118,Wonderful Bar,"I have visited this bar many times. All the bar staff, without exception, are wonderful!  Charming, welcoming, efficient and make excellent cocktails
Nothing is too much trouble, it‚Äôs spotlessly clean. Just a bar from another (much better) era! Amazing. Pop in and enjoy the experience ",5,2019,08,27
118,Highly Recommend!,The rooms were very comfortable and beautifully decorated. The staff was friendly and went out of their way to ensure we had a great stay The breakfast was amazing and included everything you could imagine. We will definitely be back!,5,2019,08,27
118,Excellent!,"Service was superb and staff were incredibly helpful! Husband and I traveled with our baby and they were beyond helpful with crib services, helping us(in/out) hotel, warming his bottle, and providing any support we needed. ",5,2019,08,27
118,A great stay at a historic site,"The Lalit is wonderful old house with a magnificient service, the rooms are spacious and well decorated, the staff was very friendly, jet sometimes a little bit overbearing at the front desk, the staff at the restaurant and the porters are very attentive. The Lalit is very close to the next tbe station and everything is easy to reach.",5,2019,08,26
118,Great Hotel,Staff provide outstanding help.  Hotel has  all the modern amenities that you need. Southbank location is very convenient.   Near multiple theaters and many restaurants.   Underground transportation very close.   Overall first class hotel at a good price,5,2019,08,26
118,Very comfortable and great location,"What a magnificent building! An old school, the oldest in London,  transformed into a very spacious luxury hotel. 
Our (schhol) room was huge as was our bathroom, and very comfortable and equipped.  Complimentary mini bar which was a lovely touch.
Breakfast was the only thing that was not quite 5*
It lacked the wow factor and was a little lacking in choice. Also you could not make your own toast - it came from the kitchen and was forgotten on the first day. With a little more thought on how to make breakfast a little more selective would bring this hotel right up there.
Staff were helpful and friendly. ",4,2019,08,26
118,Our wonderful stay at the lalit,"We have just come back from an overnight stay. We were welcomed by Fabrice who helped us with so many things during our stay from sorting out car parking, helping with our bags, suggesting places to go for lunch and even bringing a beautiful cake up to our room as it was my birthday and our wedding anniversary.
We stayed in a junior classroom which was lovely and spotlessly clean. The hotel had even laid on some chocolates, prosecco and a balloon for the occasion and wrote a little happy birthday message on the mirror. Was so nice to walk into the room and see these lovely gifts.
We had dinner in the restaurant in the evening and cannot fault a single thing, the food was fantastic, we even got to meet the head chef Jormon as he was coming round and making sure all his guests had enjoyed their food and evening, we thought this was a really nice touch and he even gave us a little tour of the kitchen which was great.
We will definitely be recommending this hotel and restaurant to friends and family and look forward to coming back soon.",5,2019,08,26
118,Great location and service; mediocre food,"We stayed for one night before flying from London back home. The greeting and check-in process were a bit over-the-top (some of the staff couldn't take a hint about when to stop chatting) but the staff overall was very friendly and welcoming. Room was bright and airy, and bathroom was huge. The heated bathroom floor was a nice touch. Unfortunately the bottles for the shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel are difficult to use (very hard to squeeze - couldn't get out any of the conditioner), and I found the bed too firm (although the husband liked it). 

As our flight was delayed a few hours, we stayed for breakfast and it was one of the more disappointing meals of our 9-day trip. The granola was average at best, eggs for the eggs Benedict were over-poached (basically hard-boiled), and fees for breakfast are exorbitant considering the quality. 

Would recommend this hotel for the location, especially if you can get a good deal on a room, but suggest dining elsewhere.",3,2019,08,24
118,Baluchi,"An amazing venue , show casing class and style
Chef Jomon, has exceptional culinary skills and pride in his work 
Service and Food , meet and exceed expectations
                                                    
Try the lamb chops and coconut and mango naan",5,2019,08,23
118,Great spot by Tower Bridge,This was my third time staying at this location and the service and rooms were excellent as usual. The restaurant dining room and the bar are both beautiful. I always book either a dinner or lunch as it is my favourite Indian food in London. I love the peacefulness of the property and will be back again.,5,2019,08,23
118,Wife's 40th Afternoon Tea,"Really impressed with this place, well looked after from the off set, all ways attending upon, and glasses were full!

We also had the opportunity to experience one of there master chief classes, which has really sold the both of us to register on one.

Worth it and recommend this place.",4,2019,08,22
118,Perfect stay,"we enjoyed our stay in Lalit London very much. Staff and breakfast were very fine. The rooms are very comfortable. 
The location of the hotel next to Tower Bridge and tube and train stations are amazing. ",5,2019,08,22
118,Great ambience and food,"I‚Äôve been meaning to try the restaurant for awhile and had a great evening yesterday! Excellent service from Gianni, absolutely fantastic ambience and food. I love restaurants with a high ceiling and these are hard to come by in London. Perfect setting for a business or casual meal.",5,2019,08,22
118,Well worth a visit,"Beautiful historic hotel in a great location. Close to London Bridge.
 Friendly welcome. Classy hotel. All.mod cons. View of the Shard and park. Wish we had more time to enjoy our stay here. Recommended A++",5,2019,08,21
118,Excellent Hotel!,We had a superb weekend at Lalit. This is a super luxurious hotel with true 5 star service and amenities. It is an excellent choice in the Bermondsey area and I would not hesitate to return. A special shot out to Fabrice the concierge for his excellent service!,5,2019,08,21
118,Just the Bar,"We have gone to LaLit a few times in the past, just for drinks. This place is perfect, and very nice. The bar is very nice, has a good selection of drinks, and cocktails. There is outdoor seating which is heated, so your able to enjoy the mild London evenings, whilst enjoying a good gin and tonic on the balcony.",5,2019,08,19
118,Absolutely superb,"I feel I may have incorrectly given other hotels 5 stars after staying here, as it has left me no further to go.... what a truly superb hotel. 

Location....
The hotel is located in a fantastic position in London, right next to Tower Bridge and the Mayors office.  It is also just a short walk to the Shard, Tower of London and HMS Belfast from here.  The station we used the most to get to other parts of the city was London Bridge, which is a 10 min or so walk away. 

Hotel staff....
The staff were fantastic.  We went for my partners 30th birthday.  They looked after us so well and even provided my partner with a cake, chocolates and a bottle of red.  The staff were so wonderful to go the extra mile.  They were all very courteous and helpful. Couldn‚Äôt praise them more highly.

The room....
Very well appointed rooms.  The come with a complementary mini bar (at least the room we had did), bottled water in the fridge, excellent tea and a coffee machine, a beautifully finished and clean bathroom complete with toilet with heated seat and cleansing features.  The bathroom also has underfloor heating, which is a nice touch.  The room we had also had a view of the mayors office and the shard, which was great.  The room was regularly visited by staff to keep it clean and tidy. 

The breakfast....
The staff at breakfast were very attentive and professional.  The breakfast itself was superb, where I had a full English on the first day and a full Indian on the second.  I highly recommend trying the full Indian. It was fantastic, if a little on the spicy side. 

Overall, I could not recommend this hotel more highly. ",5,2019,08,17
118,Good hotel lacking a bit of spark,"Overall a very nice hotel that just misses being a 5/5. We stayed 5 nights in a junior classroom. Room is spacious, well equipped with a great bathroom. Breakfast looked impressive but lacked a bit of flavour. Service was a bit mixed. The doorman was great but most of the staff just seemed to be going through the motions. Some service superstars would give this hotel a bit more of a buzz, probably the only thing it is missing.",4,2019,08,15
118,A true 5-star experience in a convenient location,"My father and I recently stayed here and we could not have been more pleased with our experience. From the beginning we received excellent service, something that was maintained throughout our stay. We were offered water while checking in, and our bags were delivered to our rooms. The process mirrored old-world class. The rooms themselves were spacious and comfortable, with large windows to keep the rooms bright and airy. The beds were comfortable, and the bathroom was stunning - equipped with everything you could want, including a dental kit, sewing kit, shoe shine, among the other more traditional amenities. Bathrobes and slippers also included.

The air conditioning worked very well, for those who are in need, but it was also nice to be able to open some of the windows and let in the cool breeze. 

Each room came with a kettle, tea, coffee, and hot chocolate, along with some biscuits that were replenished daily. This was all complimentary, which I expected, but was still glad to see it offered and refilled.

One of the mornings we were there, a lovely staff member noticed us looking around the hotel, as it is a beautiful hotel. He stopped what he was doing to give us a brief tour and took us to the balcony overlooking the restaurant, sharing with us the history of the room and how it would've been used previously when it was a school, along with some other interesting facts about the room, its details, and the hotel itself. This little extra just showed the how wonderful the staff is, as well as how informed.

The location of the hotel is great, especially if you've been to London before and are not looking for that over-hyped city centre/Oxford circus experience. It's a quieter neighbourhood but close to so much. You can walk to Tower Bridge and the Tower of London easily, as well as so much along the south side of the Thames. Museums, Southbank, restaurants, the Shard... all so close. In the area there are some restaurants within a ten minute walk but what I found more important was that there were great quicker options for breakfast in the morning as you walk to the tube (which is about 8 minutes away). With an M&S, Starbucks, Pret, all so close, among multiple other cafes, you can have a nice quicker breakfast before starting your day. Also very close (though I wouldn't recommend for breakfast), is Burroughs Market. Not even 15 minutes away, it's the perfect place to go for lunch after you've checked-in. Just be prepared to stay there a while with all the choices.

We did not have breakfast included with our booking but still tried the restaurant the last morning. The food was very good and the restaurant was a pleasant room to dine in. Yes, if you order one of the fixed meals which allows for buffet access, it can be pricey but not over the top and expected in a hotel. Actually, we found it to be rather reasonable for a hotel breakfast. My father just had eggs and tea, which was very affordable. I had the breakfast buffet experience for 20 pounds, which included eggs prepared by the chef however I wanted them, in addition to access to the buffet. For those who care about these details, the buffet had a good selection of cheeses, bread, various jams and marmalade, fruit salad and individual fruits in a bowl , yogurt (selection), pastries (croissants, danishes, etc.), charcuterie meats, and fresh squeezed juice.

The only rooms for improvement I'd offer (and not that this hindered our experience at all) is that 1) the TV was quite slow to turn on and start working - it seems rather trivial but at 11:30pm when you're trying to unwind, it's nice to not wait a few minute for the TV to properly start up, and 2) the slippers were quite small. For my dad - they were impossible to wear. For myself, they were just small and tight. The only other suggestion would perhaps be more a-la-carte options on the breakfast menu, at least on weekends when we are looking for more of a brunch experience. However, none of these are true complaints and did not bother us at all- just mere observations.",5,2019,08,12
118,Birthday Celebration,"We stayed as part of my wife‚Äôs birthday celebration. The hotel is superbly located a short distance from Tower Bridge and the area is lovely. 

Staff was super attentive and she felt pampered from arrival. I had arranged for a gift and flowers be delivered to the room and the hotel was super accommodating with making it happen. We were given an upgrade to a senior classroom with a beautiful view of the Shard and there was also a nice welcome gift of wine and fruit from the hotel. The room was nice and spacious for us with a small table and a sofa. Bathroom was nice and I loved the anti fog mirrors. Amenities were of good quality and plenty. Complimentary minibar is a lovely touch and we were really pleased.

Breakfast was a nice surprise as I tried the full Indian and was not disappointed. They also have a small buffet where you can get the usual continental fare of fruits, cereal, yoghurts, pastries and cold cuts. 

The staff overall was very attentive and helpful without being ‚Äútoo much‚Äù. We really loved our stay and look forward to coming again.",5,2019,08,11
118,Excellent stay for a special occasion - the staff could not have done more!,"It was recently my mums special birthday and we booked her in as a special treat whilst we celebrated in London. From the start to the finish all the staff could not have been more attentive in order to ensure that our stay was extra special. A special thanks to Tony who no ask was too much, the bar staff and the lovely lady who took the time to decorate my mums room for her birthday surprise. The hotel is beautifully decorated and has many luxurious touches that really make the stay. As well as the beautiful rooms it is the staff that really make the hotel what it is! I shall be returning. Many thanks again for such a special stay!",5,2019,08,10
118,Terrible experience,"Terrible service, doesn‚Äôt justifies them as 5 star hotel, no help with luggage, no flexibility for rooms or guests needs, stubborn staff, not flexible with service. Set menu for breakfast, 5 consecutive mornings we were served same breakfast, no changes made upon request.",1,2019,08,08
118,"No privacy, room not cleaned.","Really disappointed. Exterior was lovely and staff walked me in to reception to check in, I felt comfortable and welcomed. 

Once sent to the 3rd floor I found a trolly outside my room, on stepping over it and trying to get in there was staff making the bed. This was at 6pm. 

I went back downstairs to be sent back upstairs to a lower floor and different room. Inspecting my room and there‚Äôs a cheap android phone which doesn‚Äôt work properly docked on the table. More importantly there is no bath. I called to reception as it didn‚Äôt seem right that a hotel at this price point would not have a bath. The receptionist confirmed that I had not paid enough for a bath. 

It‚Äôs a shame as I came here on a recommendation. I would have given one star if it wasn‚Äôt for how nice the staff I‚Äôve come across have been. It seems the problems experienced are with the setup of the company. 

*edit*

Changed to a 1star as I just had one of the staff open my door with a key and come in asking if I wanted water???  

*edit 2* 

Went to make a drink and there was dirty used spoons and plates. Pictures attached

*edit 3* 

I‚Äôve had a response from the duty manager, who seems to be approaching the situation by telling me it is common practice for the maid to come in to my room of an evening to replenish my water that has already been replenished. Because they knocked three times that gives them the right to then enter my private room without permission. I‚Äôve tried to spend as much time as possible out of my room, I skipped breakfast this morning as I‚Äôve found the experience throughly unpleasant.",1,2019,08,07
118,Memorable Summer Vacation at 'The Lalit',"We just returned from a vacation to UK and reside in The Lalit Hotel for the entire part of our vacation we spent in London. We travelled with our two children and all of us truly cherished our stay in this charming hotel. 

Undoubtedly it has a great location with the London bridge literally in its backyard allowing us to enjoy joyous strolls by the vibrant pathway along the Thames and overlooking the Bridge every day. Its also located 5 mins walk from the London Bridge station and its central location allowed the Big Bus tours to pass by and we literally jumped into one right outside our hotel gate. 

The hotel allows one to experience  a warm environment. It is tastefully decorated and has a wonderful history being a Heritage building which was once upon a time a school. 

Last but definitely not the least are the exquisite creations in the Baluchi restaurant. Our favourites were the soft melting Aloo Parathas, Aromatic Lamb Biriyani and the innovative desserts - Bhapa Doi and Paan Kulfi.

We wish the entire team of 'The Lalit' the very best and will certainly recommend this Hotel as well as its restaurant to all our UK friends and relatives.",5,2019,08,07
118,Fabulous Indian Hospitality ,"Checked in for a Saturday night stay in the senior classroom while we were in London for a theatre weekend and had a very pleasant stay.

We have wanted to check this property out for a while now so we're pleased to finally check in, the building is beautiful and decorated perfectly.

We had booked the senior classroom, on arrival we were checked in room 5, this is ground floor so slightly disappointed as not keen on ground floor.

On entering the room it's of a good size and has everything you require including some nice touches such as complimentary drinks and snacks along with robe and slippers.

The bathroom was also very beautiful and the toiletries smell fabulous, however for some reason you have to unscrew the caps as the product wouldn't squeeze out of the bottle...

Had a fantastic night's sleep after walking 15 miles round London and sitting through 2 theatre shows to wake in the morning to enjoy a beautiful Indian breakfast before checking out.
",5,2019,08,04
118,Really Nice Hotel,"It's in a historic building with amazing grounds in a central part of London.  The room was large and comfy and the food at on-grounds Indian restaurant (the main reason we stayed here) was fantastic.  There were some minor details in the check-in process that made this seem like a hotel that just opened and they are ironing out processes.  Also, our booking through Small Luxury Hotels of the World didn't seem to net us the kind of treatment we normally receive at other SLH locations.",4,2019,08,02
118,Enjoyed our stay at Lalit,"We had great stay in June. Room and breakfast superb. Liked the complimentary  snacks  in the room and a really good selection of toiletries. 

Staff helpful and polite. Will stay  again when visiting London.",5,2019,07,31
118,The most fabulous Indian experience,"The hotel was fabulous, well situated and held up to our expectations, the rooms were opulent and the dining room was welcoming but amazing. 
Indian food is our favourite cuisine and having travelled India was looking forward to our evening meal . 
It did not disappoint, I choose the monk fish for my main and it was delicate but rich with spice at the same time, unbelievable good .
The staff were very friendly and efficient.
This was a joint birthday treat and for something special the price of hotel and restaurant combined was totally realistic.
We plan our next tour birthday treat back there again 
Please go try it , you won‚Äôt be disappointed. ",5,2019,07,30
118,Perfect Anniversary Stay,"Myself and my husband have just returned from a night‚Äôs stay at the LaLit to celebrate our 9th wedding anniversary. Beautiful hotel in a brilliant location- you feel away from it all yet you‚Äôre right in the heart of it! Room was really lovely and service was prompt. The hotel itself was immaculate and incredibly clean throughout. Lovely little touch (little cake) left in our room saying ‚ÄòHappy Anniversary‚Äô however - if I had to be picky - I‚Äôd say that this would have been appreciated much more if in our room at check in and not once we‚Äôd returned from a huge dinner at 11pm!! 
Would definitely recommend and would definitely return. A really special find!!",5,2019,07,29
118,Awesome is an understatement ,"‚ÄúThe real Boutique hotel‚Äù
Stayed with my wife and son during my recent london visit for the cricket World Cup... must say that you can‚Äôt find a single fault. Rooms are clean with huge windows. Reception girls and fabrice were helpful. Food was truly an Indian food. Manuela was very friendly. Only one thing went wrong during my stay - india lost the World Cup",5,2019,07,24
118,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed one night in a suite, the hotel is beautiful, service was outstanding and nothing was too much trouble. First class. Location great for exploring, we did the shard, borough market, sky garden and a show. Would highly recommend a visit.",5,2019,07,24
118,Short stay,"Very nice location, good service. A large and clean room. Rich and healthy breakfast. Nearby London Tower and Tower bridge, 5 minutes walking. A good indian - european restaurant. A nice place to be during London visit. ",4,2019,07,23
118,Simply Fantastic,"What a gem of a hotel!  It was clean and very well maintained. Tony, who is the concierge, had wonderful customer service and great ideas.  The location is fantastic.  Near the trendy Borough Market but near the Tube that will take you everywhere.  The hotel has lovely appointments and a fantastic breakfast.  

The only complaint is the conditioner.  I saw that in other reviews and thought it was silly.  But seriously, it took me 5 minutes in the shower to get a dab out.  That's just a waste of water to me.  But just bring some with you.  I will the next time I book. 

Thank you!",5,2019,07,22
118,Birthday getaway,"This place is truly amazing. The location is great, and the property is so wonderfully put together. It's a fabulous contrast and combination of Indian elements and the old grammar school, and it works really well. The rooms are a good size and great value for money, and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. This place is a real hidden gem in the middle of the city! Would absolutely recommend staying here and will definitely be back!",5,2019,07,22
118,Family trip...,"Discovered this hotel while walking to the tower bridge. Sat on the outdoor area. Although the place was busy but Santiago took time to show me the restaurant- Baluchi. Just amazing cocktails and food. Moses was very friendly. Looking forward to stay in the hotel soon on my next visit. Beautiful settings.

118,‚ÄúSebastian the Manager‚Äù: Your Actions don‚Äôt match your words,"We booked two rooms at this hotel, one Senior Classroom and One Cosy Classroom for our 4 night stay. 

The Cosy Classroom was good and our 11-year-old enjoyed it. My wife and I had to rotate sleeping at night with our 11-year-old in the Cozy Classroom as the two rooms are at the opposite ends of a LONG hallway. There are several doors between these two ends of the hallway that ONLY open with your room key if your room is within a certain zone. Cosy Classroom was booked at the suggestion of the Reservations Desk as family of three could not be accommodated in a Suite or Senior Classroom.  

Senior Classroom was nice except that its Air Conditioner did not work during our entire stay. It was brought to the attention of the maintenance person who blew us off by stating that temp will go down from 23 C to 19 C in an hour or so. It did not happen all night and made for another night of extremely uncomfortable stay. 
Feeling exhausted after sleep deprived nights, I asked for the Manager to show up to our room. Mr. Sebastian showed up who after being apprised of the situation promised to fix the issue and ""do something"" to make it right . He asked us as to which Travel Agency had we used to make the reservation. Since we were flying out of London that morning, Mr. Sebastian stated that he will meet us downstairs at check out. We were surprised to not find Mr. Sebastian at the checkout.  Maybe Sebastian was busy with the operations. But we waited for two weeks to write this review hoping that ‚ÄúSebastian the Manager‚Äù would communicate via email that this hotel had no trouble sending our restaurant bill to.  In addition, the checkout by the front staff was quite hasty as if they were aware of the issue and were trying to avoid a conversation about the issue in the presence of their other clients.  

The food at Balucchi Restaurant was good: Nice Breakfast and Dinner. Mr. Santosh served some great Indian food.

118,LaLuite suite excellent,"Great size room and brilliant shower. Bed extremely comfortable. Late night room service also exceptional.
House keeping prompt and cleaned from top to toe. Even repacked an open suitcase with clothes spread everywhere.",5,2019,07,19
118,Lovely boutique hotel in the heart of London,"Warm/ friendly service, excellent location, superb dining and designer accommodation... we felt pampered from the moment we walked in the door! It's located within short walking distance of the Tower of London, London Bridge, Bermondsey and major transport links.  Enjoy a long walk along the Thames. ",5,2019,07,18
118,I would have given The Lalit 5 stars but I found the amount of single use plastic disturbing,"Well, The Lalit (my second visit) is situated in a beautifully repurposed old school close to the Tower and Tower Bridge. The rooms have an air of tranquility and style - even if they are compact. The bathrooms are elegant, and the breakfast is super. Lastly on the good side - the staff - I found them to be impeccable. All of this is deserving of 5 stars. But, where the hotel loses 2 stars is on the amount of single use plastic amenities in the bathrooms. I must confess that left me dumbfounded. Why can't The Lalit have refillable bathroom amenities - they do not need small plastic bottles of shampoo etc etc.... Given that plastics are poorly recycled in the UK and we all need to shape up when it comes to reducing plastic use - the hotel should and needs to do better. I sincerely hope on my next visit it improves significantly in this area.",3,2019,07,18
118,KING OF THE KINGS,"I had a trip to UK recently in june,2019 and I was in London for 7 days and I was staying at THE LALIT senior classroom which was the most fabulous room I ever stayed of Lalit.
It was a great sty with great security and amazing lovely staff with great ambience..
As well as it represented a school theme which was really surprising and I got to know it after 3 days of my 7 day long stay.
Thank you THE LALIT for your love and  ambience...

118,Excellent service!!,We loved our stay at the LaLiT! The service was truly AMAZING! The rooms are well appointed but we were close to the street and it was a bit noisy on the top floor. We had breakfast in the dining room every morning and it was DELICIOUS! The Chai tea is very good!,5,2019,07,17
118,Delightful hotel,"The Lalit is perfectly situated, very near to the Thames, the SkyGarden and great for the Tower and the O2. It is an oasis of calm and beauty in a very busy city. Public rooms are stylish and unusual, our bedroom was gorgeous and there were lovely surprises like the free mini bar treats and the chilled Prosecco ready for our arrival. Breakfast was perfect and we shall be back to try dinner next time. We loved it all! ",5,2019,07,17
118,Great family holiday!,"Always difficult travelling with two little ones (under 3) but thanks to the excellent staff and service at this property, was made a breeze! The little enhancements like the mini bar included with constant snacks available went a fair way in keeping the kids happy!",4,2019,07,16
118,Simply Lovely,"Not only is the Hotel an easy, short walk from London Bridge Station but it's right by the River and Tower Bridge - so convenient for our morning visit to the Tower of London and Clipper ride, but it really didn't feel like it was amongst the hustle and bustle. Loved our beautiful and very comfortable third floor room and shower room (pics uploaded), in fact our room was remarkably quiet both from other guests and from London life outside.  Staff members were all supremely accommodating and pleasant. 

We didn't dine in the evening this time, but certainly will when we can. We did have late night drinks in the bar, which were very enjoyable. I'd also like to make special mention of the excellent turn down service we received and the birthday cake, which was a lovely surprise when we returned from our day and night out. 

Cooked breakfast was excellent with the best coffee I've had in a while. We were also particularly impressed on check out when we'd asked to leave our bags and were told we could complete the formalities when we returned in the afternoon rather than wait for the guest in front of us to finish. The overall impression is that this is a very well designed and managed Hotel.

The LaLit London oozes quality, history, unique style and service and we both heartily recommend as our short stay was very memorable.",5,2019,07,15
118,Impeccable!!,"A superb experience. Tony at the concierge show us around this magnificent building. He is a credit to your hotel group and couldn't have been any more helpful. The room was spacious, spotlessly clean, quiet and cool.
The location was perfect and the breakfast delicious. Well done Lalit London...",5,2019,07,15
118,Indian luxury in heart of London,Amazing hotel with good food comfortable stay and great location in heart of London 2 mins walk from Thames and Rower bridge. The rooms have all amenities and comfortable beds. He English tea with Indian snacks was a welcome on day one . Best of London with feel of Indian warmth,5,2019,07,14
118,Summer weekend in London,"I stayed at the LaLit for 3 nights in June. It was a wonderful experience with the highest levels of service. The restaurant had excellent food and cocktails. A fairly minor detail, but one I really enjoyed was the electronic do-not-disturb/clean-my-room system. First time I ever saw anything like that. ",5,2019,07,12
118,Beautiful in all ways ,"Stayed at The Lalit for two nights and it was fantastic. The service is amazing and rooms are lovely. Everywhere is immaculate! On arrival we are greeted and bags taken to our room, were offered drinks and quick and easy check in. Great location! I will happily come back to stay next time. Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2019,07,12

Fantastic location on the south bank which always has a fantastic buzz .
Room was clean comfortable with luxury touches . 
Staff were helpful and polite .
Walking distance to most of our favourite places .

Perfect weekend",5,2019,07,12
118,Stunning hotel just some teething troubles,"A fabulous location and the building is gorgeous - an old school house. I booked the Thames suite and it really was exceptional - mixing traditional features with up to date tech in the room. Supper comfy bed, fantastic shower etc. The hall where I ate breakfast was also superb! There were some issues with ordering room service food and when it did arrive, the tagliatelle was swimming in olive oil and was completely inedible. When I called down the guy was so keen to get me off the line to swap the food, he wasn‚Äôt sympathetic to the fact it made me ill just trying a mouthful. There then followed a comedy of errors with different staff knocking on the door: a club sandwich replacing the tagliatelle 40 minutes late. A single glass of wine arriving when I‚Äôd ordered two and then waiting some time for that to arrive. No knives to eat with. Some frustrations and seemingly no one to share them with but I have to say, this is a stunning hotel and I would highly recommend it",4,2019,07,10
118,Amazing London Hotel,"From the second we saw The LaLit Hotel in London, we couldn't wait to book a room for a few days.  We were coming off a 10 city European trip and had already spent time in some amazing places.  This hotel shines in every way and we can now say, it was truly one of our favorites.  We were met in the courtyard by two gentlemen who were eager to help with our luggage and then we were escorted to our room.  The Women's US soccer game was playing and we quickly turned it on and sat down on the settee to watch.  A minute later one of the gentlemen rang the room bell and handed us a welcome letter with details and Wifi password.  He also noticed the game and was quick to point out that it was playing in the Teacher's Room, the bar downstairs, or we were welcome to have snacks and drinks from the mini-bar in the room free of charge.  He opened the closet and took a quick inventory and made a call for more things to be added to the refrigerator and to the pantry.  We had traveled all day from Stockholm, and we were so thankful as we wouldn't have found those things until the game was over.  We ended up heading to the bar area and couldn't help but ooh and ahh over the decor on the way.  We love all the details.  The drinks in the bar were good and the hospitality was kind.  Afterward, we went out and were surprised to come back to our bed being turned down with slippers waiting for us and a bottle of cold water and a glass on each bedside table.  Such a nice surprise!  The shower was amazing and the toilet is the most high-tech toilet we have ever seen.  Breakfast in the great hall cannot be adequately described in words and must be experienced.  This is one of the most beautiful spaces ever.  Everyone was especially kind and helpful, but Deepika, who had the best smile greeted us and explained all the things on the menu that we had questions about.  She made our cappuccinos and made sure that we had everything we needed.  We hope to return soon and after posting pictures on a social media site, we had a few friends ask for the name and address so that they could add it to their travels.  They will certainly not be disappointed.  Thank you so much The LaLit London, you were amazing!",5,2019,07,10
118,Up & Close Nannery Experience at Baluchi,"Chef Jomo is affable young man from Kerala with tremndous professionalism well versed communication skills but to top it (and expected) providing you bits of fresh naans cooked in front of you of different composition, accompaniments ingredients. I had wonderful time there with my daughter treating Dad to Father's Day dinner. The tiffin which followed was plentiful and the Chef ensured to provide diffreent and tasty veg to one in the menu. The old school building is amazing and adds to the rightful charm of a fine dining venue",5,2019,07,08
118,Our stay in London,"Got the opportunity to stay in a 5 star hotel. Great experience Staff and the hotel itself were excellent. So close to the Tower Bridge and the Thames and all that goes with that area. Hop on bus stop is five minutes away. If you like indian must try the restaurant, ",4,2019,07,07
118,Wedding hotel,"My fianc√© and I stayed here for a couple of nights while we were in London to get married. The hotel is absolutely stunning from the moment you arrive, we could not believe how beautiful it was. Before we arrived I had contacted the hotel about hiring a car to take us to the registry office on the day of our wedding; we were assisted by Tony, what a truly wonderful gentleman he is. He was welcoming and friendly from the very start and is a true credit to the establishment; he took the time to ask how our wedding was and was very calming as we were heading off on the big day, an absolute gentleman! We had some Prosecco waiting for us in the room when we checked in, and a wonderful dessert when we returned after getting married. Thank you to everyone at the hotel, we loved our stay and you made our wedding day that extra bit special. We hope to return in the future!",5,2019,07,04
118,Great Hotel,"My daughter and I arrived in London July 2,2019. We had a surprisingly awful hotel experience so my daughter searched online and found LaLit London. WE LOVE IT.
Our room is beautiful...great bathroom...room to spare for both of us. 
Staff is great...location is fantastic. We walked and used Uber everywhere...arrived back after full day of sightseeing.
Bed is so comfy...lots of outlets for phones and iPads. 
So happy daughter found this!",5,2019,07,03
118,Beautiful venue,"Had a 3-course dinner here to celebrate a friends graduation. The food was excellent and we were in the headteacher's room which is beautifully appointed. The service, on the whole, was excellent with the exception of 2 family members who had specified no chilli food who were served a chilli meal. The entire hotel is beautifully and tastefully appointed and we had a wonderful evening.",5,2019,07,03
118,Last minute booking ,"What a gem of a hotel. We were in London to see Pink in concert and booked quite late as just needed a nice place to stay. We will re book to go back as missed out on what looked like a lovely taster menu. 

Hotel is beautifully restored and quite striking in its design. 

Staff were pleasant and friendly. Only feedback would be for the staff to be confident in the menu and the service they can offer. A simple training issue ",5,2019,07,02
118,Not 5 stars,"Really nice hotel but not 5 star.

Check in was poor. Electronic room keys weren't working at all, apparently this is was happing a lot. So why give your guests electronic keys? Make sure its sorted out before you send them off to their rooms only for them to have to come back. The porter took our bags, but simply left them on the other side of the room! Very strange.

We were sleeping soundly sunday morning with the 'do not disturb' sign on. We still had a phone call from reception waking us up to see if we wanted anything. Really annoying.

When lying in bed you cant see the TV as its way too low.

The website says  Car parking is now available at the hotel on first come first served basis. Spaces are subject to availability and can not be reserved.
It doesn't say its ¬£50!  Very poor. It you've paid a lot of money to stay at your hotel and you have a car park, then let your customers use it as part of the fee.

The rooms are quite small. We had a senior classroom and its quite small for what you'd expect from a 5 star hotel. 

Great location, very clean, nice bar and restaurant area, fast wifi.

Overall, lovely four star + hotel.",3,2019,07,01
118,Third time unlucky,"It really does pain me to write this review - our third visit to the Lalit hotel / we do love this place but this visit has tainted our opinion. Not sure where the real problem lies with this place but sometimes it‚Äôs a collection of small issues that just spoil the overall experience!
No hand towels - you have to ask for them! (Yes seriously!)
Shower head not fixed in place and covered in limescale!
Metal plate around light switches fell off and was not rectified after we told reception about it!
A 15 minute power cut and back up generator did not come on so corridors in darkness! It also meant no tv for 12 hours!
A very loud dj on the outside terrace - only 4 of us drinking outside - you couldn‚Äôt speak!
We had to ask for more pillows - pillows in room are too soft and no further ones in room!
As per my previous review - drinks in bar too expensive!
No manager on duty - only junior staff! On checking out issues raised again with staff but we got a ‚Äòshrug of the shoulder‚Äô ?
Breakfast order wrong!
We do love this hotel but we have to post this review as it needs attention!
Due to return in a few weeks but seriously reconsidering 
For the price we paid it‚Äôs a real let down!",3,2019,06,30
118,Great service but slipping,Our third visit in a year. Lots of small issues took the edge off the stay. Shower head loose and dirty. TV off for 13 hours. Had to ask for hand towels. Light switch cover fell off and not repaired and even after pointing everything out stuff not rectified. All we got was either a shrug of the shoulders or ‚Äúmaybe we can get you free breakfast next time. Total customer service misfire as we left. Not impressed for a two night stay costing over ¬£700. Have a 4th visit in a few weeks but may cancel,3,2019,06,30
118,Friendly and efficient service,We only stayed one night but we had a lovely spacious room and enjoyed a delicious breakfast. Room service was also excellent. Efficient check in from friendly staff. Nice quiet room with good amenities ,5,2019,06,30
118,Left really disappointed ,"I originally wrote this review and sent it through the hotel‚Äôs contact page on their website. I stayed there 2 weeks ago. I then forwarded the message via their email address on Tuesday. To date, haven‚Äôt received any response. I just wanted an acknowledgement and for them to say they‚Äôll amend their procedures. Am in the business myself so not after any compensation, just to help them out. As not heard anything, felt I should post on here. Here‚Äôs my original message:

Hi, I stayed in room 118 last night with a friend of mine. Just wanted to give you a bit of feedback. Firstly, upon arrival, we were greeted by the doorman and taken through to reception. The concierge was great, offering us a drink and then suggesting we go to the ivy for some food. He really was exceptional. When my friend wasn‚Äôt there, I mentioned to the reception staff that it was her 30th birthday. They said they would do something and took her name. Also, as we were early, our room obviously wasn‚Äôt ready, but they said they would call me as soon as the room was ready, as they‚Äôd make it a priority to clean. I thought they were lovely touches and was most impressed. Unfortunately I was then left disappointed. I didn‚Äôt receive a phone call and nothing was done for my friends birthday. 
I also would like to say that the room was lovely, but a couple of suggestions are due. Firstly, the tv is too low to watch in bed comfortably. Secondly, the hair conditioner bottle was awful, couldn‚Äôt squeeze any out, definitely a design flaw. Thirdly, when they came in to turn down the bed, they left my dirty tea cup which I was surprised about. 
In the morning, we came down and wanted to go for breakfast at the ivy as fancied an English breakfast. Didn‚Äôt want to use hotel as there is nothing in literature to say you do English breakfast. The concierge assured us you did so we did end up having breakfast but he is aware that it doesn‚Äôt seem to show anywhere. The lady who served us didn‚Äôt seem that pleasant either, which is a shame as everyone else comes across very well. Sorry for long message but I bought this for my friend as a birthday gift, so didn‚Äôt want to say anything at the time. Also, didn‚Äôt want to post on social media. Many thanks. ",1,2019,06,27
118,Incredible stay,"Incredible property to stay at. Went to celebrate my partners birthday, and he was thrilled at the details and hospitality by the staff. From decorations, to making sure we had dinner after coming in late due to a flight delay, we were so happy that we‚Äôve already booked another stay later this year! Thank you to the Lalit staff for taking such good care of us. Location/room quality is great, and easy to get to from the tube ",5,2019,06,26
118,Luxury boutique hotel that‚Äôs hard to fault and a great find for a London staycation,"I came across The LaLiT after Googling luxury hotels close to The Shard and I‚Äôm pleased to say that this fabulous boutique hotel lived up to my expectations. It is located perfectly for visiting London attractions like The Shard, Borough Market and Tower Bridge, which are a short 5-10 minute walk away. The hotel itself is a former grammar school which was converted into a hotel in 2017 and it‚Äôs hard not to be impressed with the makeover. It‚Äôs the perfect blend of Victorian charm and 21st century amenities. The bedrooms are a decent size, well equipped and beautifully designed. The beds are so comfortable you might struggle to get up in the morning. And the marble bathroom is equally impressive; I especially loved the gorgeous tiled floor and the shower. I can‚Äôt comment on the food in the hotel as I didn‚Äôt sample any of it on this occasion, due to taking afternoon tea at The Shard. I will say that the staff I met during my stay are a credit to the hotel. They were genuinely friendly, helpful and polite at all times. Another thing that attracted me to The LaLiT is that the hotel celebrates and embraces diversity. It markets itself as a hotel for everyone. So if you‚Äôre looking for a luxury boutique hotel in London, I totally recommend The LaLiT. If I visit London again I wouldn‚Äôt want to stay anywhere else. It‚Äôs that good.",5,2019,06,24
118,Superb Hotel,"I booked this hotel because it was near to The Shard which it is, I cannot say how lovely the Staff treated there guests, so freindly and proffessional, Teh stnd outs where Our Receptionist (i hope I got the name spelling correct) Frenella , she was a breath of fresh air and so helpful . also Tony the Concierge he was clearly passionate to make sure his guests had the best experience and information.  
It was my birthday and with no prompting other than I was coming to celebrate my birthday the Hotel gave me an upgraded room and a bottle of champayne to celebrate in my room which did not go un noticed. This hotel was once a Grammer school and has been converted to a Hotel to the highest standard. The Hotel has Disabled access and located near the Shard and London Bridge with Bus Routes all around as well as London Bridge Station 10 Mins Walk Away. 

This will be my number one hotel choice in London from now on.",5,2019,06,24
118,Fantastic,"This was the second time we stayed here and we have definitely found our London home!

Everything was great and a special mention must go out to Tony the concierge guy who in my experience was the backbone of everything that made this place great.",5,2019,06,21
118,"As always, excellent.","The LaLit is our go to Hotel when we escape to London for a break. This was an anniversary trip, and the hotel knew it and made a few gestures to make us feel special. The hotel is in a quiet area (for London), close to the river and with some great restaurants nearby.

The only issue, not a complaint, but worth noting - the waiting staff are not very aware of food allergies, ensure you check the ingredients list on things yourself if you have allergies - they claimed muesli was dairy free when it clearly highlighted milk as an ingredient.",5,2019,06,19
118,Ok - not fantastic -but OK,"We booked a junior classroom, and we were very disappointed. Our room 309 was not made for two people - just one bedside table, not enough space for two in the wardrobe etc etc. We asked to change room - and that was no problem - but not free of charge. The second room was nice and we enjoyed it, but we weren¬¥t blown away. The restaurant was a in a big hall, and it felt like that. The music played was strange (modern chillout pop) for a restaurant with Indian dishes. But - the food was excellent and at least on of us ate one of his best indian dishes for decades - Murgh Adraki (ginger chicken). The service was ok, but it felt somewhat like everyone was new at work. This dosen¬¥t  apply to Tony, at the reception - he took good care of us and gave us interesting tips for things to do. ",4,2019,06,18
118,What an amazing oasis in a brilliant location,"Everything about this hotel was lovely; the building, its location, the food, the room, the service. i would thoroughly recommend staying here. i think the bed was the most comfortable i have slept in. It was fabulous to be so close to Tower Bridge too.",5,2019,06,15
118,Best 5 Star,Really nice hotel if you can afford the luxury. Staff were excellent.Situated 1 block from the Thames and Tower Bridge so much was in walking distance. Hop on off bus right at your front door nearly. old school building.,5,2019,06,14
118,Amazing food and hospitality,"Impecable service really, very helpful, professional and friendly staff.
The food was delicious and great selection of options on the menu.
The venue is absolutely gorgeous and of course the location is amazing!",5,2019,06,12
118,Lovely boutique hotel in a fabulous location.,I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel.  The staff were excellent and quite welcoming (and spoke an amazing range of languages!).  Situated very close to Tower bridge and the City. Great for business as well as tourism.,5,2019,06,12
118,Indian Hospitality,"My wife and I always stay at the LaLit when we go to London. We have stayed there at least five times and have no desire to stay anywhere else. 
Exceptionally friendly, and helpful staff.  Excellent location.",5,2019,06,12
118,Goegeous Hotel,"Fantastic hotel and lovely service, I'd definitely go again!
The staff were friendly and I was very happy with the room. The hotel is a beautifully restored former school.

Thank you for making an anniversary special.",5,2019,06,12
118,Amazing Service at Wonderful Hotel,"We held a 2 day conference at the hotel for a party of 15.  The staff were attentive and the service was exceptional.  The hotel has an Indian theme throughout, the rooms are decorated beautifully and the food was lovely.",5,2019,06,12
118,Excellent hotel with excellent service,"We held a 2 day meeting at the hotel with overnight stays etc; the service was fantastic throughout, they couldn't do enough for you.  Very professional and attentive.  The lunches were nice with an Indian theme running through the hotel.",5,2019,06,12
118,Great stay again,"Stayed here for a birthday and wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all! They filled the room with decorations, a bottle of bubbly and a surprising cake later on in the evening which made the trip fantastic. The breakfast was excellent too! Highly recommend this place and no doubt the place to stay in London.",5,2019,06,12
118,Wonderfull hotel with great service,"Wonderful hotel with beautiful rooms and an extraordinary service. The service was fantastic, Unortunately I hadn't the the time to go to the spa. The hotel is located directly at the London Bridge so it is also a great hotel for a city trip. I will definetly come back!",5,2019,06,12
118,Excellent Hotel,"This place is great, a bot off the beaten track but Donte let that put you off
Service is fantastic and the rooms and restaurant are great.
All rooms I have stayed in are good 
Definitely try the tasting menu, the wine flight has some very unusual vintages",5,2019,06,12
118,"OK, but I expected more for the money","A comfortable enough bed, but the breakfast experience was dreadful. we waited and waited to be acknowledged, then the time intervals between being provided with menus, to having our orders taken to the breakfast actually turning up were far too long. When the food did eventually turn up, it was mediocre at best.",3,2019,06,11
118,5* Service in a 5* Hotel,"I've always said it is the little things that make a difference and this place really does make sure all the little things are looked after.

First of all, we had to reschedule out trip due to illness and special thanks to Violet for helping sort out a difficult situation.

On arrival (it is more than check-in) we were warmly greeted at the door and escorted in, then offered refreshments while they took our details.  While checking our room was ready, Tony the concierge was great in asking our plans and providing really useful suggestions for our time in London.

The room was exceptional, great bed, choice of pillows, comfy sofa, nice seating area, etc.  The fridge was full of complimentary soft drinks and there were also complimentary snacks.  Decent hanging space and a safe.

The bathroom was beautifully fitted out with a lovely large shower.  The floor is heated and the toilet/bidet was very funky and also heated.  A complete range of toiletries and other items were provided if you need them.

When we got back to our room, we were pleasantly surprised to find a lovely cake for our Wedding Anniversary.  I hadn't mentioned this on check in so it must have been noted when I was trying to reschedule the booking.  As I said, they really look after the little things that make such a difference.

We had breakfast in the main hall which is a stunning room.  Again, service was excellent - efficient but unobtrusive - and the food was good.  Only very minor disappointment was that for an Indian hotel, there was no Chai Latte for breakfast but that's just a personal thing.

Location is great - right by Tower Bridge and only a five minute walk to London Bridge and Borough Market.  If you are a tourist, it seems on many of the hop-on hop-off routes.

For a special occasion this is a special hotel, one of the best I have stayed in around the world and I hope to come back again at another time.",5,2019,06,08
118,16 m2 room or a closet ?,"Well !
If you were 13 years old in boarding school you will may be feel at your place in this room !
The fact is they charge 317 pounds ( with breakfast included ) and I am not in a boarding school ; we have an issue there .
It‚Äôs not central London neither but London bridge , not a bad district if you work near by .
The hotel beside this kind of room with the smallest bath too I never seen is fine 
Huge lobby and dining hall where they could have fed 150 kids may be !!
May be next time I ll move and sleep in the lobby !!
Seriously I had to switch room at midnight since with the doors closing noise  near by in addition I could not take it !
They upgraded me after discussions but in a positive way at the end so I got 6 sq m in addition free !!
It‚Äôs not the surprise effect who bothered me it‚Äôs the fact they sell it to you !!!!",2,2019,06,08
118,Amazing Boutique Hotel!!!!,The amenities and staff at Lalit were absolutely superb!!! It was so cool that the building was an old school and the facilities were amazing!! My wife and I had such a great time!! The location near the tower bridge was also convenient as well.,5,2019,06,06
118,"Exceptional hotel, staff and service!","A real gem of a hotel. I don‚Äôt usually leave reviews but this place deserves the short time it takes to write this. I cannot fault this hotel in anyway. I‚Äôve stayed in many 5* hotels both here in the uk and abroad, can I can honestly say this is up there with the best! Try the food and cocktails you will not be disappointed. Our breakfast was included in the price, a real delight not to have just a buffet but a mixture with table service. I very rarely go back to the same hotel, however I will make an exception with The LaLit.",5,2019,05,28
118,Pity we had more expectations after staying in several different Locations of Small Luxury Hotel's,"Checkin:
We received an email confirmation that we can use checkout at 3pm the next day and had to argue with the hospitality desk about this. Unacceptable.

Room 201:
No sofa or comfortable chair to sit on in the room, pillows were not adequate.
Room for the price are to small. 

Facilities:
A 5* Small luxury Hotel should have a pool, our experience is that this hotel is just an outer average 4* hotel with average service. 

The Staff:
It left an impression on us that the staff is under a lot of pressure and this leads to uncomfortable situation.

The bellboy ask to take my luggage and I replied to him there is no need, his reaction was that's what I'm here for. There is no need to explain to me what his job description is. 

Conclusion:
All the above led us to do not come back to this hotel again.",2,2019,05,28
118,Perfection,"Rooms are quiet, spacious and very nice. Great atmosphere and breakfast, and close to both river, restaurants and transportation. SPAfacilities (had a back and neck massage) was best I ever had! Only thing is that the gym is small, but recommend run along the river instead!",5,2019,05,23
118,Excellent small hotel,"This hotel is an excellent choice for business or leisure trips. We stayed the first time in a Lalit and were impressed by the service orientation and the kindness of the staff and also enjoyed the Indian touch. Rooms are small like in every London hotel, but nicely decorated. The small hotel is very clean. Architects created an environment where you feel home. Excellent breakfast. London Bridge and Tower Bridge are close, so the hotel is a great base for reaching most of the central and eastern parts of London. Clear recommendation!",5,2019,05,23
118,Blown away with Lalit,"Well I just got home from my night at Lalit Hotel.. What can I say 5* luxury all the way.. Staff so attentive. Cocktails amazing.
Dinner was so good I cannot recommend it highly enough. I love Indian food and this was a cut above!! I had 2 Indian style breakfasts as I had just couldn't choose.. They were fantastic.
If  you get an opportunity to stay here do it. I'll be back 100%",5,2019,05,19
118,"Great hotel, great location","Hard to find a reasonably priced boutique hotel in London but Lalit fits the bill! It‚Äôs a great hotel with good sized rooms, lovely staff and the right amount of quirk. 
Easy walk to London Bridge and Tower bridge but far enough away from the noise. Definitely recommend",5,2019,05,17
118,An Indian experience in London?,"Well not quite, but pleasurable nevertheless. The staff here are welcoming, attentive and courteous beyond measure, they are happy to engage in conversation about their home country and I learned more about India, the transition and current economic activity in half an hour conversing with the staff than I did from my history teachers (that was a while ago in fairness to them). The hotel is extremely comfortable, well located near the Tower of London and extremely handy for walking along the Thames embankment towards the Houses of Parliament taking in Borough Market, The Globe Theatre, Tate Modern, National Theatre and London Eye en route. It is an ideal place for a stress free stay being away from the hustle, bustle and noise of the City centre whilst providing easy access to it by tube.",5,2019,05,13
118,"Amazing stay at a truly wonderful hotel, can't wait to return","Stayed here for one night for my Husband's birthday. Ended up in The LaLit Legacy Suite, what an absolutely spectacular room! Pictures of the old room (Headmaster's office) and old school on the walls - what amazing history. Special thanks to Tony for showing me a tour of the available suites, what a nice chap! Tony even offered me an ice bucket / glasses without me asking!

Breakfast was fantastic - check out the huge Dosa!! Masala Omelette was great too.

I will certainly be back again and again - have already booked another stay in June!

I don't say this lightly but the hotel is one of the best I've ever been to in terms of historical building, really helpful employees, room amenities (free minibar / good snacks / tea and coffee), beautiful bathrooms.",5,2019,05,13
118,Awesome hotel and a hidden gem. Has a great feel and all staff were very courteous and professional,"Firstly the hotel is kept in superb condition and has a very welcoming and homely feel to it. All staff I encountered were extremely friendly, helpful and professional. Furthermore the location of this hotel is extremely convenient in terms of the South Bank, Borough Market, Tower of London and transport connections from London Bridge.

All in all a perfect place to stay and us staying here made my wife's birthday celebrations even more special.",5,2019,05,13
118,Splendid,"What a place to revisit Lalit without going India. The staff at the front ( looked one too many) were ever helpful including Violet and concierge from our check in to check out.

Rooms were top with top decoration. I was really amazed by the breakfast selection and another time we will try the lounge.

Only feedback was that there was no door man or agarpathi (fragrance) that we receive in the India hotels but nevertheless what a hotel in the footsteps of the iconic Tower bridge.",4,2019,05,12
118,Saturday Night Cocktails ,"This is a little hidden gem, so I'm writing this review reluctantly as I don't really want anyone else to find it... 

I have family who live within walking distance of this hotel, so we popped into their main bar for a few cocktails after an early dinner. The welcome was polite, service friendly and ambience chilled. It's not far at all from the hub-bub of the Tower Bridge area but feels far more relaxed. Highly recommended, but keep it quiet!",5,2019,05,11
118,Great service,Popped into the place for a drink while I was passing by. Had a couple cocktails and was amazed by the friendliness of the bar staff. David and Reka were the best hosts I have came across in a long time. They not just made my drinks incredibly delicious but were up for a good chat which is rare these days. All in all great bar to visit.,5,2019,05,10
118,Treated like royalty,"Upon our arrival at The Lalit my Wife and I had just been married the day before. Staff had ensured our suite was decorated and had a lovely bottle of prosecco waiting for us with chocolates, fruit and a hand written card of congratulations.

We were well looked after and had complementary cake delivered in the evening.

This for us was a good quality 5-star hotel and my wife really enjoyed the extensive indian breakfast menu, she ate everything.",5,2019,05,08
118,A beautiful new hotel in a great location,"Beautiful throughout, well equiped, welcoming rooms and a hotel which has been stunningly designed and well equipped. An amazing bar and restaurant make this a great choice for a stay in central London.",5,2019,05,07
118,Hidden Gem,"What a stunning few days staying at this divine boutique hotel. Once home to students of the former St Olave‚Äôs Grammar School, the refurbishment has been undertaken with a nod to its historical past. Our room, formerly a ‚Äòjunior classroom‚Äô, was large, immaculately presented with a comfortable large bed and well appointed bathroom. The staff were exceptional; incredibly professional, attentive and offering helpful advice about where to eat. We dined at the main restaurant on our last night and the food was stunning and the wine list amazing. With a two minute walk to the Thames and rail connections and an easy stroll to lots of food markets and other historical sights, The Lalit is the perfect place to base oneself in London.",5,2019,05,06
118,"Lalit Hotel, London","Everything was excellent! The staff was professional and helpful. The food was delicious, the room was beautiful! I found this hotel on Trivago, and it exceeded my expectations. Terrific location at the foot of the Tower Bridge. 
",5,2019,05,06
118," Classical, friendly and five star","The hotel displays great attention to detail in all aspects of its design and furnishing. The main dining room is simply stunning. Our accommodation 'The Mountford Suite' was a good size, light and airy with a very comfortable bed and views of The Shard. An option of a lighter weight duvet would have been beneficial. The staff were courteous, polite and very helpful, especially Tony. The Spa treatments were professional, relaxing and a great way to unwind. Evening cocktails were sublime and breakfast in the morning excellent and relaxed. We look forward to our next stay. ",5,2019,05,05
118,How a hotel should be run...,"My favourite hotel experience for a long time ‚Äì a beautiful hotel that is run expertly by its staff.  I got a great deal through Booking.com and enjoyed a one-night stay in room 3  - a good size with a separate small breakfast/desk room, a large marbled bathroom (shower only, but fancy Japanese-style toilet system!) and electronically operated blind for the high arched window. Lots of extras including a free mini bar (snacks and soft drinks), fruit bowl, more toiletries than standard and housekeeping that bring you chocolates before bedtime! Incredibly comfy bed and luxurious, powerful shower made for a very comfortable stay indeed.  I did hear a lot of road noise outside, which is unavoidable due to its brilliant location ‚Äì less than a 10 min walk to Borough market/London Bridge station, with plenty of restaurants, bars and scenic views on the doorstep.  Breakfast isn‚Äôt included in the room price and so I did not have this ‚Äì I would have perhaps ordered breakfast to the room, but the options on the room service menu were limited. I would definitely recommend and hope to return soon.",5,2019,05,01
118,Lalit London Stay,"Quiet- almost peaceful. Great location, with Tower Bridge nearby. Fantastic staff. Good-sized rooms and reasonable value. This was our second stay- a return visit - and we thoroughly enjoyed the eight days.",4,2019,04,30
118,Birthday ,"Visited end of April for birthday celebrations. Had a wonderful stay, couldn‚Äôt have asked for more.  Lovely room, extra special touches throughout our stay. Recommend.  Ate in the Beluchi restaurant - contemporary Indian cuisine, beautiful building. ",4,2019,04,28
118,Amazing 5 star stay!,"Our experience with the Lalit London was absolutely fantastic from start to finish. They couldn‚Äôt be more helpful, friendly and welcoming. We stayed for one night for my partners 30th and all of the little extra touches were so thoughtful and made our stay so so special. They even bought a cake up in the evening and sung happy birthday. The breakfast the next morning was amazing and worth every penny! Amazing stay and we will definitely return! Thank you so much to all the staff at the Lalit London that made our stay so special.",5,2019,04,28
118,Wonderful luxury boutique hotel,"Lalit is a luxury boutique hotel with an excellent location beside Tower Bridge. It has a stylish and high quality, modern decor in a charming old building.

118,Relaxing Stay,"Our stay at the hotel was beautiful and we were very relaxed by the end of our stay. I loved the fact the hotel provides a complimentary minibar :)The room was very nice and clean. The Spa was amazing and enjoyed the Himalayan Salt Scrub - it left my skin feeling really soft.  The staff were very friendly and attentive at all times. The breakfast was delicious, and dinner was nice but ideally would have liked to see a few more vegetarian options. Overall, I would recommend to anyone who wants the English/Indian fusion feel. Excellent location and 2 mins walk to London Tower Bridge. ",4,2019,04,23

118,Great Stay!,"I had a wonderful stay at The LaLit! The staff was very welcoming, the room was beautiful and I absolutely loved the warm tile floor in the bathroom. The breakfast was really good and the dinning room is absolutely gorgeous. 
Restaurants, pubs, and a grocery store are nearby and it is about a ten minute walk to the subway/rail station. The neighborhood is quiet which was a plus. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2019,04,19

118,Fabulous Hotel‚ÄºÔ∏è,"I have passed this lovely hotel on previous trips to London but have not stayed here until now, and will never stay anywhere else in the future. Stunning hotel in every way! From structure, to beauty, to amenities to a warm and gracious staff.  I cannot rave enough about The Lalit. The hospitality is paramount. Sam and his crew attended to our every need‚Äîlove my conversations with him and he was so thoughtful. Everyone greeted us with a sincere ‚ÄúNamaskar.‚Äù The property, a former school, is so elegant and stately. We had a lovely, quiet room  with the softest, most luxurious  sheets and fluffiest pillows,  to the best replenished, complimentary products from soft drinks, Pellegrino, water, snacks, the absolute most delicious  teas I have ever had, and luscious beauty products.  The stunning dining room serves world class, critically acclaimed food. The bar is vibrant, relaxing, and fun! I cannot day enough great things about The Lalit and can‚Äôt wait to return upon our next trip to London. Thank You üôèüèª üôèüèªü•Çü•Ç",5,2019,04,15
118,The Beautiful LaLit,Absolutely stunning hotel. Immediately you walk through the entrance the ambulance and welcome is truly amazing.

A special note to Tony the Concierge who certainly takes pride in the Hotel and so helpful. Will definitely  return for longer if possible...,5,2019,04,14

118,Loads of Charm and Top-Notch Service,"The Lalit is just across Tower Bridge from the City and Leadenhall, but it is unlike the many character-less hotel chains you have to choose from in the area. The hotel is in a former boys school that has been renovated to keep the historic charm. Every room is unique, the restaurant (serving Indian food at dinner, but a full English breakfast in the mornings) is excellent, and the staff is unfailingly attentive. I love to run, and the Thames path is just steps away. ",5,2019,04,09
118,Mrs H,"A beautiful building with an immaculate interior. The food was excellent at dinner and breakfast, plenty of choice and cooked to perfection.

118,April,We had a wonderful two night stay. The building and decor is amazing. Best of all the service from all the staff was equally amazing. From the minute we walked through the door we had the most warming attention. If you get the chance this is the place to stay in London ,5,2019,04,07
118,Fabulous stay,We often stay at a hotel chain when we visit London but as this was our anniversary decided to treat ourselves to somewhere a bit more special...the staff were so friendly and we were delighted st the prosecco and chocolates in the room. Nothing was too much trouble. We ate in the restaurant that evening and the food was divine. Thankyou to everyone for making  our stay so special ,5,2019,04,07

118,The MOST wonderful stay ever in London,"My husband took me away for my birthday to this wonderful hotel. From start to finish we had the most wonderful stay, we were greeted with very friendly staff at reception, and also the porter was so helpful too. On learning it was my birthday, we were upgraded to an amazing room, and given a complimentary bottle of prosecco and chocolates. We didn't eat there that night, as we meeting friends, when we returned to our room we found a complimentary cake left for us too. I have never been so spoilt by a hotel. You are made to feel like you are the only guest there. 
I have never stayed in a hotel in London where the minibar is complimentary, it was also so quiet there, you would never have known your surroundings. 
I can not wait to go back and stay again. This is by far the best stay in London I have ever had, and possibly the best hotel I've stayed in. Thank you The Lalit for an unforgettable stay.",5,2019,04,05
118,Overnight stay,It was a disappointing stayed in a small room with vents which were really noisy. The facilities otherwise were OK but it's not obvious what is complementary and what you have to pay as they told me they would take a ¬£100 deposit for room items so I didn't bother with having a drink - even of water!,3,2019,04,02
118,Hidden Gem,"From the moment you pull up and walk thru the door till you leave you are treated like you are the only guest at the hotel. This hidden gem located close to the tower bridge is a must stay if you are visiting London. Excellent service, bathrooms, food & amenities.",5,2019,04,02

118,A lovely Afternoon Tea twist,"For my mum‚Äôs birthday, I took her for a special Afternoon Tea at The Lalit London and I was not disappointed! The hotel is beautiful, while it may  not be as big in size as some of the well-known chains it is grand in style and the staff are very welcoming and friendly.

We walked into the Great Hall and were amazed by the beautiful decor, simply stunning. We had the High Chai Afternoon Tea. When the food arrived initially I thought I would miss the traditional elements of Afternoon Tea but after some bhel and a bite into a samosa any cravings of for sandwiches and scones were soon forgotten. The food is awesome - my favourite was probably the paneer ki tikki! The chutneys were also amazing and tasted so fresh. At first I thought there wasn‚Äôt enough food but I had to have a break before the sampling the Indian desserts (it‚Äôs a hard life at times!) - none of the items disappointed. The desserts were great and the Soan papdi in particular was divine - just melted in the mouth.

The chef came out to introduced himself and when we complimented the food he was humble enough to give credit to the team.  After we had eaten all we could a member of staff came out with an extra dessert - a chocolate mousse dish with a ‚ÄòHappy Birthday‚Äô message and a candle - a really nice touch for my mum‚Äôs birthday. 

Also, the toilets are pretty special too!

I would definitely recommend this place and will certainly be making another visit, perhaps to try the dinner menu!",5,2019,03,22

The menu was designed with the help of the chef by Rav who was on series 7 of The Great British Bake Off. 
The pastries had the most delightful tastes which would burst in your mouth.

The service was of a very high standard. All staff made you feel very welcome and would accommodate all needs and requirements to have a pleasant afternoon tea.

We will most certainly return again. We also ate in the restaurant twice during our stay and the service and attention to detail was also exceptional.

118,Lovely hotel slightly ruined in last 30 minutes! ,This is a beautiful hotel and on arrival I was warmly welcomed. The room and decor were lovely and the attention to detail was perfect. After a good night's sleep we woke a bit late and missed breakfast. When we went down and realised this we asked for a coffee. We proceeded to leave and the restaurant manager presented us with a bill for ¬£9. I was a little taken aback as I thought that as a gesture of goodwill and for missing our breakfast she might have wavered this. I'm a hotel owner myself and I would never gave charged for the two coffees if someone had missed their breakfast. It just left a slightly bitter taste in my mouth which was a shame as overall the stay was perfect. ,4,2019,03,01
118,Nice but average ,"Advertised as deluxe hotel, but it is simply normal. Very few things for breakfast and you pay for having scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages. During the night i could hear people walking on the wood floor upstairs. Very clean. Beautiful restaurant room. Very close to London bridge station",3,2019,02,28
118,Fabulous hotel,"Amazing hotel, beutiful building looks like a true castle. Great service, big beautiful bedroom (senior classrom), free snacks, drinks and chocolates... Amazing giew. The best hotel hotel we ever stayed. We definitelly coming back.",5,2019,02,28
118,Absolutely amazing!,The room was beautifully decorated for my partners birthday and there was fizz for us on arrival. The staff even left him a mini birthday cake! Please visit The LaLit... you won‚Äôt regret it. I can‚Äôt wait to go back! ,5,2019,02,26
118,"At last, a London hotel that delivers","I booked the Lalit for us to celebrate my husband‚Äôs 60th. We have had experienced a lot of disappointment withbLondon hotels before, either great hotel and poor service or vice versa! This was not the case with The Lalit. From the moment of arrival, the staff could not have been more helpful or friendly. Our room was spotless and huge for a city centre room. The complimentary snacks and soft drinks were very welcome as was the fresh fruit. 
We didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel, simply too busy so cannot comment n the food but we did partake of the cocktail menu and loved them all! We would thoroughly recommend this hotel! ",5,2019,02,26
118,Excellent venue for a special occasion dinner,"The staff did a super job to plan a great evening for us for this special occasion.  They redid the impressive Headmasters Room where we could start the evening with champagne. The table in the chandaliered dining room was impeccably laid, the Baluchi restraunt food was warm and delicious.  The Indian red wine Jnoon was smooth- worth tasting.  One of the few places in London you can get these excellent Indian wines.  The restraunt staff were helpful and polite. 
We will go there again and again for Indian High tea and lunches and dinner",5,2019,02,25
118,A birthday night in town ,"A really lovely hotel . Beautiful interiors with a calm and tranquil feel . An interesting area to wander around - maltby street arches are great and it‚Äôs easy access to walk along the Thames. A very comfortable room with generous range of complimentary snacks, soft drinks and toiletries.  
We enjoyed cocktails and drinks in the bar before dinner. 
The Baluchi Restaurant was a great restaurant for our evening meal - we enjoyed a delicious Indian meal there. 
Breakfast was fun - husband stuck to traditional English fayre whilst I enjoyed the Indian choices . Never have I had such a spicy breakfast ! 
All in all a very enjoyable trip and a good value hotel with attentive service and lovely attention to detail. We‚Äôd be happy to recommend . ",5,2019,02,24

118,Exceptional,"The hotel is in the most beautiful building, clearly an old school, the theme of which is elegantly used throughout. The hotel staff were gracious, kind, polite, attentive without being intrusive and just super nice! The food in the restaurant was impeccable, as was the silver service that came with it. Somehow the hotel found out it was my husband‚Äôs birthday, and the most delicious miniature birthday cake was delivered to our room! There was Prosecco and fresh fruit in the room, free of charge. The toiletries smelled insanely good, and in-line with the Indian heritage of the hotel brand. The whole experience was exceptional. I would definitely recommend, and we will be back!",5,2019,02,18
118,Charming boutique hotel in great location,"Beautifully restored old school buildings located next to Tower Bridge and in brilliant location for Bridge Theatre, London Bridge, Globe theatre and Tate Modern.

118,Boutique hotel in prime location,"I had to book Lalit as all the business hotels around the area were booked. It was such a pleasant surprise. The location of the hotel is amazing. The rooms large enough, spcially compared to the business hotels in the vicinity. Although not a pure business hotel, the wifi speed was excellent, 
The Indian food for breakfast and the mouth watering biriyani at Baluchi makes for a culinary treat, 
But the icing on the cake is the service. 
They do make you feel very special.
Lalits ging to be my choice for my next trips to the city. ",5,2019,02,12

118,"Absolutely Perfect, and thank you Tony. ","We, a family of 4 stayed in this hotel. We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights. 

First, the slight irritation. We spent a lot of money for two rooms over 2 nights. My teenage son and daughter were sharing a room and as the hotel don‚Äôt do twin beds, I asked if we could have a camp bed which they did provide, but at a cost of ¬£30 a night extra. This seems very petty and unnecessary and was really very disappointing. 

The hotel is beautiful. It is an old school which still has its original feel. The hotel has been tastefully decorated and is beautifully serene. The hotel is part of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World group and I can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough. 

It is an Anglo Indian hotel which is decorated in a traditional English style and the food has Indian influences but with traditional English still available. 

The bar area and the Headmaster‚Äôs room are beautiful and the great hall is simply breathtaking. We sat and drank tea and played cards in the bar and headmaster‚Äôs room. 

The location is excellent. It is right by Tower Bridge but it feels so calm and a world away from the tourist madness. 7 mins walk to London Bridge Tube Station and 7 mins walk to the wonderful Maltby Street food market which the hotel staff recommended. 

A very special thank you to the head concierge Tony Cayley who was simply amazing. His knowledge and history of London (and the history of the hotel) is awesome. He was very helpful, kind and generous with his time. I wanted to go to a pub for a pint of London Pride. Not only did he recommend a pub, but he rang 2 pubs to enquire what beer they served. Tony is an absolute credit to the hotel and group. 

Tony really made us feel very welcome and special and nothing seemed too much trouble. 

It was my wife‚Äôs 50th birthday and the holiday kindly decorated the room and suprised us with a bottle of bubbly and a cake. Thank you to the team. 

The food is delicious and the service sll round is great. All the staff acknowledge guests with a wonderful warm Indian greeting. 

Please do stay at the hotel if you have the opportunity. We will definitely return. 

Once again, a huge thank you to Tony Cayley for being so wonderful. 

",5,2019,02,09
118,Great friendly Hotel that goes the extra mile,"We stayed here for my Birthday weekend and I couldn't fault the place. We have stayed in some amazing hotels but for service, friendliness & going the extra mile the team at the Lalit were brilliant. From great advice as to what & where to go locally to a surprise Birthday cake in our room when we returned one evening. The Lalit is a big enough hotel to do things right but small enough to still care and know their guests. Would recommend this hotel to anyone. ",5,2019,02,05
118,Great hospitality,The stay in LaLiT London was a great one. 1stly they upgraded the room; the Indian masala tea as a welcome drink was awesome- there is generally no welcome drink in London hotels - LaLiT was an exception..! On check out they also helped in delivering my luggage till Paddington- this was just exceptional. Lastly they also gave an umbrella for me to take as it was snowing outside while I was leaving the hotel. One of the great stay experienced Int London. Thanks to all the staff in LaLiT London,5,2019,02,04
118,Superb Hotel and Spa,The Lalit Hotel is a hidden London treasure. I visited the Rejuve spa where I had the most relaxing massage. I spent a night at the hotel and my room was perfect. The staff are friendly and welcoming .You have to try the food it absolutely delicious.,5,2019,01,30

118,Faultless,"Our stay was perfect in this lovely characterful hotel.  Location just round the corner from Tower Bridge is excellent for seeing this part of London.

118,Exemplary Stay,The LaLit is a hidden gem but in a fabulous location for travel in and around London. I received exemplary service from the moment I entered the hotel. The staff were friendly and went above and beyond - I would definitely like to return whether for business or pleasure. I only wish that I had had the opportunity to try out the restaurant!,5,2019,01,28
118,Fantastic value boutique hotel with great service and location.,"I have been staying at The Lalit Hotel repeatedly since I discovered it about two years ago. It‚Äôs a five star Indian brand with great service and very good value. It is centrally located immediately south of Tower Bridge so very well placed for both business in the city and tourism. It has a truly excellent Indian restaurant, Balucha, which presents some of the finest food I have eaten. The hotel has a limited western menu, but that suits me fine. The room sizes are good (except a few of the very smallest rooms - suggest you check size on booking), but most of all the decor is luxurious with very nice touches - underfloor heating and Japanese style toilets. The staff are extremely courteous and helpful. Most of all, it is great value.",5,2019,01,27
118,Stunning hotel with top quality service,"I booked LaLit as a treat for my husband‚Äôs birthday, and he was thrilled by the quality of both the hotel and it‚Äôs staff. Very customer focused and well trained staff, great food with an East West fusion of cuisine. The building and it‚Äôs great hall are a sight to see on their own, and the stunning sapphire chandeliers offer a dramatic dining experience. 
To our delight, having let the hotel know it was a special occasion, we found complimentary champagne, extra handmade chocolates plus a birthday cake üéÇ!",5,2019,01,27
118,Lovely hotel,"This is a really nice hotel, helpful, friendly staff in all parts.  We had a Junior Classroom room which was clean and comfortable, with a great shower that had such a clean screen we managed to both walk into It!  (It‚Äôs a teeny niggle, but a bit of fenestration would improve this). Breakfast was lovely and in the most beautiful room, they even had grapefruit juice, which is usually overlooked!",5,2019,01,26
118,very enjoyable stay,friendly and helpful staff. very good restaurant that specialised in indian themed dishes. Room was quiet and the shower was great and did not need a manual to operate it. the ambiance was calm and relaxing in surroundings of under-stated luxury and quality. My wife and I will be staying at this hotel again and we are looking forward to it.,5,2019,01,26
118,"Elegant, comfortable - and amazing chocolates!","After staying for weeks in a tiny flat while visiting my husband in London Bridge hospital, to celebrate the fact he is doing better I decided to stay for the weekend at Lalit, with my stepdaughter who was here for the weekend. It was a real treat and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff were welcoming and attentive, the building is fascinating and it was nice to learn about the history. Very elegant and comfortable, and the choclates left in the room at night were amazing! - I guess home made.",5,2019,01,23

118,Review of the Lalit London,Great location and excellent service. The rooms are very nice but for the price you pay they could be bigger - especially the bathroom. Breakfast in the dining hall was disappointing. It was ¬£20 just to have a full English and did not include any continental options. Overall the Lalit is a very nice hotel and in a great location but overall I felt it was slightly overpriced. That could be as I stayed there over New Years Eve.,4,2019,01,17
118,Excellent Service,"The location is brilliant, easy access to lots of places, staff are brilliant, very friendly and eager to help. Rooms are clean, not the biggest but more than adequate. Ordered room service and food was delicious and service prompt. ",5,2019,01,16
118,Superb hotel,"The LaLit is an absolutely gorgeous and unique base for sightseeing in London. We had a cosy classroom for our 20-year old daughter and a junior classroom for my husband and me. The decor and tiled shower are outstanding. The thoughtful touches included spicy aromatic toiletries, bidet function on modern toilet, and evening chocolates. Location was perfect for Shakespeare theatre.",5,2019,01,15
118,Great hotel and  London Bridge,"Amazing facilities, great staff service and very closed to the business area of London.The bar is really good as well and the staff are supporting all the time to make the stay perfect.Good food and all the room amenities (food) are included.",5,2019,01,15

118,The best hotel we experienced in our lives!,"I have no words to express how wonderful has been our stay on Lalit London Hotel. It's has been the best hotel we experienced in our lives! We felt very welcome, into a sweet and romantic cocoon. It's not only a question of beauty of building, decoration, comfort, location. The most important value of Lalit London Hotel is the human beings who compose the staff. Each one is driven by a service soul that we have felt in each friendly action or word. Long Life to Lalit London Hotel! We'll surely come back again.",5,2019,01,13
118,Excellent,"Excellent service, very good location near London Tower. Very nice treatment like supply of fruits and pralines every day together with arranging the room twice a day. Great value for money. We had a great new year eve stay in London. Definitely we will tell all our friends about this hotel, and hope to come back soon.",5,2019,01,11

118,Exceptional! New Year's Eve @ Lalit London,"My girlfriend and I had an unforgettable experience celebrating New Years at the Lalit, London. We were looking for an intimate fine dine experience with entertainment for new years and this did not disappoint. The 5 course dinner was wonderful and flavorful, each dish was prepared beautifully and as an Indian myself thought it was both authentic, traditional with some modern twists and enjoyed it immensely. The service from booking my table last minute at 3pm on New Years eve until the end was fantastic. Eliana Athanasiou was prompt in letting me know availability and the itinerary of the evening and very helpful with making my decision to make a reservation. All the staff were polite and courteous on the evening and it was very well managed in the beautiful dining restaurant. We had waited a little longer then expected for our main course, but before we even had a chance to say anything, our server brought over our food with an extra special main dish for us try as an apology which was fantastic service. An extra special thank you to Rohit Arora who was additionally attentive to our experience that evening and ensure we had all we needed and courteously served our needs that evening. Even though we had stepped out to see the fireworks on Tower Bridge, he allowed us to keep our table to return to after, with a glass of champagne that we had missed at midnight! Exceptional service, great entertainment and a lot of fun dancing the night away at the party, we had a wonderful New Years and we look forward to coming back and staying there on our next visit! Thank you! Kindest Regards, H & S",5,2019,01,05
118,Outstanding,"I have nothing bad to say about the LaLit. Fantastic location, wonderful staff and immaculate throughout. Lots to do within walking distance as well as public transport links, shopping and River walks. 

We spent 10 nights in a Senior Classroom which was extremely spacious, luxurious and comfortable. Every single member of staff went out of their way to make our stay perfect. 

I will without a doubt stay at LaLit again in future and have already recommended it to several people.",5,2019,01,04
118,Happy New Year,"We stayed new years eve just one night,my wife thought it would be a treat as we always go to london to see the fireworks.
We arrived and were made welcome by every member of staff on duty,so polite.
We were shown to our room,which was very luxurious,it also had a mini bar(stocked with complimentry drinks,popcorn,crisps and chocolate),safe,dressing gowns ,slippers wonderful toiletries,heated flooring
also.
We had a look at menu and see that afternoon tea was still available in the resturant,so we ordered,
not your normal afternoon tea,but indian just amazing the flavours will knock you for six.
On the evening the hotel had a sit down meal and show followed by a diso to welcome the new year in,we were a bit disappointed to miss out because had arranged to meet some family members around 9pm.
We asked at the reception if it was ok to have some drinks at the bar when we got back and was again made very welcome.
The bar staff were excellent and again very polite to us,we even managed to get a bit of dancing in,what a day.
Breakfast was a feast nothing was to much trouble,the choice was unlimiting.
I would like thank all at The Lalit London for making it a wonderful night and day and will be back.
Kindest Regards Michael & Sharon",5,2019,01,03
118,Splendid,"We stayed for two nights just before Christmas and had a really nice time. The Lalit is located next to Tower bridge which makes it almost central. It's a good area with a short walk through Borough market to Covent garden for example. The rooms are very nice with great bathrooms - large showers, heated toilets. 

The Bad:
We arrived slightly early and left our luggage which was no problem. When we returned we were simply given keycards and left to find the room ourselves. We also experienced odd service in the bar and restaurant. It was never really clear who was serving us and drinks took a long time to arrive.

We will return.",5,2019,01,03
118,Second Christmas in a Row!,"We flew from the US to stay at Lalit for our second Christmas in a row. What makes this hotel is not only the ambience and the quality of the rooms - but it is the staff. Reviewers often talk about the ""staff"" because they had one good experience.  We had dozens. The maids, Fabrice the doorman, Sebastian who checked us in and greeted us on our way home, the dining staff at breakfast, the bartender who gave my husband a glass of free prosecco when he ordered a peroni :), they all are so unique warm and good at their jobs.

Truly, there is no better place in London. Between the location, (proximity to Thames, proximity to Borough Market, proximity to the underground, close to good groceries stores and restaurants), the old schoolhouse vibe with excellent modern finishes, the complementary breakfast (if you book it with your rate), we can't wait to be back.",5,2019,01,02
118,The Most Amazing Hotel in London!,"I have spent over 1,000 nights in hotels over the last 20 years and been Platinum at SPG, Hilton and Marriott etc. I can safely say that I have never experienced this level of hospitality and customer service. The entire staff at The Lalit is oriented to making your stay as comfortable as possible paying attention to the minutest of details to deliver a WOW experience every day. My wife and I spent 8 nights at The Lalit this December (2018) and were actually sad to leave. That pretty much sums up our sentiment towards The Lalit. It will be our home in London on each visit from now on. I wish other hotels learnt from The Lalit about customer service. Thank You to the entire staff and Naz, the manager, in particular.",5,2019,01,02
118,Nice Hotel but Certainly Not Five Stars,"Couple stayed here on recent visit to London. 

Along with hotel amenities, I always judge the quality of a hotel with how many times they feel the need to apologize for something and at LaLit they felt that need just far too often.

We arrived shortly after noon due to our overseas flight so checked in, but understandably our room was not ready yet. Check in is posted for 2 PM. We left our luggage including our carry-ons and went for a nice long walk and lunch. We were told our room would be ready by 2 PM. Not a problem. We came back at 3:30 and were advised our room was not ready yet so we went to wait in the lounge as they stated another ten minutes or so...Almost an hour later we were finally led to our room. While we were walking to the room the gentlemen mentioned (first apology) that he somehow spilled a bit of water on my carryon bag and could he have it dried for me? 

His definition of a bit of water and mine are completely different. When I got to the room and opened my bag everything was soaking wet and the bag had a couple of inches of water still sloshing around at the bottom! Travel documents, medicines, Ipad, etc...everything that you typically try to protect from the airlines. This wasn't a bit of water, this was a soak in the tub for an hour or so...OK these things happen. They called me later and offered a bottle of wine. Never did receive that nor would I ask for it as that would be awkward and staff should follow through.

Next day we return to the hotel after a day out and our room has not been cleaned and it's well after 4 PM. So we sit in the lounge once again and wait. While we were waiting two different people told us we could not sit in the lounge as they were readying it for a private function that evening. I advised we would not be waiting if the housekeeping folks had done their job. ""Oh sorry"" - apologies 2 and 3. 25 minutes later our room was ready.

We stayed in a senior classroom - nice, clean, well appointed, but nothing awe inspiring about the room, just a typical nice hotel room. The lack of towels is a bit strange and others have commented on this.

So the hotel gives you what you need, is well located and the staff are all very friendly, but somehow this is an awkward sort of place. Don't think it's the best option in the area and would likely look elsewhere next time.",3,2018,12,31
118,Luxury,Loved my stay at the Lalit!  What a treat to myself!  They knew it was my birthday and surprised me w birthday messages and chocolates in the room!  Location is a 10-15 min walk from the London Bridge stop so a little hard with big suitcase but lovely for walking around the South Bank!Would 110% recommend this hotel!,5,2018,12,29
118,Would not recommend staying here for a celebration!,"We stayed here for my husband's birthday celebration. I was not impressed! They gave a small cake and a standard bottle of Prosecco. However nothing was complimentary given I gave the hotel notice, there was a previous guest's hair in the bathroom, room service entered our room even though there was a do not disturb sign on, ceiling light was not functioning, the bell boy was rude, the reception staff was unhelpful, and the cherry on top, the massage at their spa was awful!

118,Marvellous luxury boutique hotel,"Had a wonderful 2 nights stay at the LaLit. A big thank you to all the staff,expecially Tony. Myself and my son had our birthdays during our stay and we where very spoilt.
It really is a lovely hotel just a few minutes walk from tower bridge and the Thames river. London brige station is about a 10 mins walk. 
The hotel has a great Indian restaurant. Around the hotel there are many restaurants and the bridge theatre. 
The hotel has about 70 rooms. All done up to a very high standard. Complimentary soft drinks and snacks.
The hotel is beautiful,we enjoyed the ambience and boutique style it offers.
Would most certainly stay here again.
Exceptional service and attentive staff.
A big thank you.",5,2018,12,27
118,Lovely boutique hotel!,"Very nice hotel, with friendly and helpful staff that make you feel welcome from the moment you enter. Former school building gives stunning bar/lounge room, impressive restaurant, entry,... The rooms are beautiful, all decorated in the same style, having complimentary soft drinks, coffee and snacks. Very comfy beds with the choice of firm/soft pillows so you can enjoy a great rest after a busy day in London...",4,2018,12,27
118,La lit... The perfect treat! ,"The staff were friendly and attentive. The food was absolutely stunning, excellent creative cocktail choice and we especially enjoyed the ambience and boutique style the hotel had to offer. Lovely complimentary snacks and drinks in our room ... Lovely touch... a truly wonderful visit!

118,Disappointing night,"We booked the Lalit mostly due to the proximity of the restaurant, Baluchi, which serves very good Indian food.  our party included six people so it made sense to have rooms at the hotel so dinner could be enjoyed without more travel- we had been on the road for 10 days.
the evening started well, with drinks at the bar- i was surprised by the bill (350 pounds) but it was the end of a very good trip, so no worries.  charged to our room on behalf of the group.  then had a very good food experience but poor service experience at Baluchi, again charged to the room, still overall a good night with friends celebrating business.
Room was good, nice towels, chocolates on pillow etcetera, and bed very comfortable.  Woke up to meet for breakfast, and ahead of going down went to my credit card account to move money over to cover bill (was not certain of status after 10 days on the road) only to discover that the bar and restaurant charges had already been put on hold- lucky i had enough clarity left!  
Went downstairs and checked out, complained about the pre-charges as i had now to pay again and wait for the pre-charges to be refunded to me.  this practice was totally unnecessary and effective tied up 1500 dollars until my bank returns the pre-charges- all done without warning- if they had said something to me that this was policy (no other hotel i have stayed at for the last several years has ever done this!)  i would have charged to my card to avoid the delay in my bank refunding the total bill- a real inconvenience at the end of the trip and near holidays.  Staff were very disrespectful and condescending. 

Wont stay here again, given the reputation it was overall a dissapointment.",2,2018,12,24
118,Excellent high class hotel,"You won‚Äôt be disappointed if you stay here. Wonderful hotel, rooms and food. Located in a good area to access London. Very comfy bed and room had nice view. Staff extremely polite, helpful  and friendly ",5,2018,12,20
118,Celebration Night in London,"We arranged an over night stay in London as part of our 50th year and over night Christmas London celebration. We chose the Hotel as we saw this property on Celebrity Master Chef. We were contacted by the property two days before hand stating that the restaurant was closed because of a private function. We were disappointed, and so  told the property about how we had booked this event some months ago and was really disappointed that this happened. They informed us that they small Head Masters Room will be as good and the management will insure that our evening will be as special and that they will look after us.When we checked in we were greeted by the Hotel Manager, Restaurant Manger and the Duty Manage, which was really nice. we were shown to our room which they upgraded. When we were in our room they bought a bottle of Prosecco, Chocolates and fruit which was really nice.The room was nice and you good and comfortable. My wife was looking forward to a bath but unfortunately these rooms do not have baths The dinner was lovely and we all ordered the 7 course taster menu. Very different and not quite as you would expect from an Indian restaurant but well worth a try. The Head  Chef came in to check we were having a nice meal which again was nice. the Hotel deducted our predinner drinks which was a nice touch as well.When we got back to our room there was a nice small birthday Cake waiting for us.We also managed to book a massage in the spa which again was nice. Over all the property was a nice stay and the management really redeemed the dispiriting start to the booking.Well Done!!!",4,2018,12,19
118,Absolutely Fabulous!,"What a wonderful gem of a hotel, excellent service, immaculate, quirky in a refined and very artistic way, wonderful warm, caring staff and so many little extras and such attention to detail. Felt thoroughly spoilt. And a beautiful colourful environment.",5,2018,12,19
118,lit up the weekend,"This hotel is beautiful, Tucked away next to tower bridge. The rooms the staff and the whole hotel is amazing. The hotel is a old school that has been converted.  The restaurant looks great but unfortunately we was already pre booked elsewhere but will definitely return and try it out.",5,2018,12,17
118,Beautiful Property,"My office is near the Tower of London so this was the perfect location for me. Just about a ten minute walk over the bridge. It is very cool that they made this hotel from an old boarding school. It is a cute boutique vibe. The main thing that stood out to me was the service. Everyone was lovely.I also liked the restaurant and the order in menu. The room even came with free snacks. Two things that weren't as nice though were the bed being very firm for a side sleeper. Also, the lighting in the bathroom could be brighter. ",5,2018,12,17
118,Romantic weekend,"We had a lovely stay at the Lalit.  I mentioned in passing when I reserved the room that it was our wedding anniversay.  When we arrived in the  room it was delightfully and appropriately decorated with a nice bottle of Proseco and a cake.  A nice touch.  Excellent service, super clean rooms and nice location.  Also value for money.  I would certainly recommend.",5,2018,12,17
118,Just Wow!,"We have stayed in some lovely hotels in London but this one is just so special.

From the moment we entered the staff could not have been more attentive and helpful. They made every experience and touch point amazing.

The hotel is very chic and beautifully decorated; it has a very decadent feel and the room was just great.

For a hotel that isn‚Äôt much more expensive than a chain it is so different.

Great position for the shard, tower bridge and hms Belfast.

A real wow factor hotel and very special break.

Thank you La Lit.",5,2018,12,16

118,"Stunning Gem, a stone's throw from the sights","We stayed here as an anniversary treat while in London and the staff couldn't have treated us better.  We had one of the Larger Classroom rooms and it was so very nice.  Appointed with a very large bed, lots of space, quiet, comfortable and luxurious.  Because the hotel knew it was a special occasion they'd written beautiful notes on the mirror, covered the bed in petals and left some bubbles for us to drink too.  These finishing touches make so very much difference....
The hotel itself is luxurious and opulent, overflowing with south asian charm and greeted at every turn by another friendly face wishing us 'Namaskar'.
The bar is friendly and warm, and the atmosphere calm.
We will absolutely definitely be returning to this stunning hotel that's located 200 yards to the world's most iconic bridge ""Tower Bridge""",5,2018,12,12
118,"Fantastic Luxury Hotel with 1st class service, food and rooms","We stayed here as we had a work Christmas Party in the Main Room.  I cannot fault anything about this hotel, yes it is a little pricey, but you totally get what you pay for.   The food was outstanding for Christmas party dinner and the breakfast was excellent.   From the minute we arrive the staff were amazing and our room was top class.    For special occasions, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to any of my friends and family.",5,2018,12,12

 100% I will be back.",5,2018,12,11
118,Perfect location and efficient staff members,"Email correspondence with the team was very speedy and efficient. They communicated well within departments. Upon arrival we‚Äôre greeted by the friendly doorman. The front desk staff was also friendly and polite. The hotel manager & his staff members very kindly & thoughtfully arranged a bottle of bubbly, chocolates & stuffed elephant to celebrate my recent achievement. My friend and I stayed here for 1 night in the junior classroom with views overlooking The Shard. The bed was super comfy as well as choices of pillows (firm / soft). The temperature in the room was just right. The desk was furnished with new magazines and fridge with complimentary drinks and snacks. The next morning the housekeeper asked if we needed to replenish snacks & drinks.  I rang for an iron and it got delivered quickly by a very polite concierge. The location is perfect for the South Bank, main sites such as Tower Bridge and perfect if one is travelling to Gatwick airport as there‚Äôs a fast train that connects to the airport in 30 minutes. We would stay here again in the future! ",5,2018,12,10

118,"Lovely hotel, good staff and very private",I‚Äôve stayed here a few times and find it to be a very comfortable hotel. Staff are all very polite and no one bothers you throughout the stay. If you need anything it is solved very quickly. Beds are super comfy with a wide range of pillows and if you are used to an American sized bed they are one of few hotels that offer bigger beds. Location is good if you want to be beat tower bridge. ,5,2018,12,08
118,Majestic hotel,"Converted Victorian school. The decoration, marble entrance and chandeliers, it‚Äôs just fabulous! It‚Äôs a combination of classic and modern meeting to give you perfection.Walking distance from tower bridge.Staff is very friendly.Hotel is very secure and only allowing access to corridors and hallways who have key access.",5,2018,12,07
118,Perfect Position,"We stayed at the LaLit in London recently and it is perfectly positioned on the opposite bank of the Thames from the Houses of Parliament and right beside Tower Bridge. This is a converted former school, and what a transformation has taken place. We used their airport pick-up and it was great. Our reception was great. The room which had a view of The Shard wa super. Underfloor-heating (in the bathroom in the shower this was particularly great!). The bathroom & shower were both room. The bed was really comfortable. The modern-Indian inspired restaurant was spectacular with fabulous meals. The bars were great. The service super. The security (to each floor) was super. We'd stay here again without hesitation",5,2018,12,05
118,Disappointed. Flatters to deceive.,"The LaLit is undoubtedly a beautifully appointed hotel.However that is where the quality stops.Our check in experience was quite an awkward uncomfortable affair.. despite being offered refreshments the process took nearly half an hour to complete. There had been a mix up obviously with the reservation and the front of house manager Naz, although very polite. offered excuse after inconsistent excuse which was all rather a shame.Initially we were offered an upgrade which was withdrawn when Naz realised we were staying for two nights. We were immediately downgraded back to the standard room.This was not an issue for us as we had booked a standard room, but to raise our expectaions and then dash them was putting it mildly disappointing.The rooms are nicely appointed, however housekeeping would seem to be a problem at the hotel.One of the packets of complimentary snacks was actually already opened and had just been replaced in the tray.On searching for the tv remote control during our stay, I had the misfortune to look under the bed. It was quite frankly filthy, and obviously hadn't been hoovered in quite some time.Another disappointing feature was that cups were not cleaned and replaced by housekeeping. It was really off putting to return to the room after a day out to find the bed made, but the dregs of our early morning tea and coffee still in the cups (bizarrely the cups had been returned to their original place on the tray but just not cleaned or replaced).The room was generally quiet, but the windows seem to vibrate, which makes relaxing quite difficult.Breakfast was very good and the chandeliers in the dining room are indeed impressive.Tony the concierge was the only member of staff who offered us 5 star service. The rest fall way short.We have raised the matters with the hotel who offered us 15% of our next visit.A hollow gesture really, as London offers so much choice, why would you return to somewhere that disappointed so much.    ",3,2018,12,04
118,Great hotel but not the best location,"Awesome hotel, great area, but very quiet and far from the center and airport , staff very diligent and friendly, confortable rooms and bathroom, geat restorant and bar inside the hotel, but difficult acces in Uber or local taxi",5,2018,12,04
118,Indian afternoon tea,"It was my first trip to the Lalit, the service was really extraordinary! It was in the detail.... so many hotels and restaurants miss them, the Baluchi certainly exceeded my expectations.
The hotel and indeed the restaurant is beautifully appointed as you can see in my pictures - the hotel has taken over an old school and turned parts of it it in to a fascinating (attractive) ‚ÄúBollywood meets London‚Äù look. The tea comprised of street food like various ‚Äúchaats‚Äù, bhel puri,samosas, kati rolls, chicken tikka and kebabs. The top layer of the 3 rung tray was dedicated to Indian sweets and unlimited chai and delightful mango lassi. The restaurant was staffed well under the watchful eye of the chef, our waitress looked very quizzically when we turned down a refill- there was way too much in the first serving! All v v delicious. 
If you want afternoon tea with a twist, and you like Indian street, then you‚Äôll love this. Well done Lalit!!!  

",5,2018,12,04
118,Home alway from home,"I had to spend my birthday in London by myself as I‚Äôm here for business. I think the lovely staff noticed that and they sent to my room a very kind and sweet birthday cake.
I stayed here for 8 days. Location was excellent. A lot of things to do within a walking distance.",5,2018,12,01
118,La Lalit Land,"I remember Tooley Street before the Shard, London Dungeon and Hays Galleria when, if you didn't injure yourself tripping over a down-and-out the muggers would get you.   But boy it's scrubbed up well and typical of the transformation is The Lalit. Once an old school house it's been artfully done up as a classy small luxury hotel with a combined old English prep school-indian theme. Whacky kind of Raj style but everything's looks top quality.
Funky modern rooms and very nice bathrooms and excellent cocktail bar.
Single best thing is the restaurant Baluchi. The best high class Indian food I have had in London outside of the Cinammon Club, probably no surprise as the chef used to work there.  And it's half empty which is a tragedy. Go there NOW and eat before everyone realises how good it is!
Tips for improvement to the manager:
Turn the bright dining room lights down and let the chandeliers and the candles give it the atmosphere it deserves.
The rooms are too hot for the massively thick duvets. Why are British hotels so poor at A/C? Please sort out the room temperature control.
Other than that, this place is spot on. 
",5,2018,12,01
118,"Gem, if there were 6 stars you would have them","Lovely property with Indian influences being Indian owned. Possibly the best Indian restaurant in London!

The rooms are stunning! I love how they have kept the history of the School throughout even naming the rooms after classroom's.

Very high tech and with the 21st century.",5,2018,11,29
118,"The Lalit Rejuve, Afternoon Tea",Great customer experience. I would recommend to all my friends.

118,Simply Beautiful,"What an absolutely stunning hotel, a beautifully restored interior, amazing service by all the staff who were very discrete but couldn't be helpful enough if you needed them.

118,Best Hotel Ever!!,"This was our first visit to the Lalit London and it certainly won‚Äôt be our last. 

Booked 2 nights for my wife‚Äôs 55th. When we booked they sent a lovely email asking if there was any special reason for our visit so we told them about my wife‚Äôs birthday and thought little more about it. 

On arrival we were checked in by the lovely staff and went up to our room. 

On the bed there was a heart shaped balloon a card and rose petals, on the mirror was a lovely message wishing my wife a happy birthday. 

15 minutes later there was a knock on the door and a delivery of a lovely bottle of Prosecco & chocolates for my wife. 

5 minutes later there was another delivery of some macarons. 

To say we were gobsmacked was an understatement. 

We went out to the show we had booked and when we got back there was cake on a plate with happy birthday writing in chocolate on the plate. 

On top of all this the room was amazing, the bathroom large and well stocked and the minibar complimentary!

The staff were so helpful and friendly. 

The cocktail lounge (called the Teachers Room (the hotel is a converted school) served amazing cocktails üç∏ 

Will definitely stay here again (already looking at booking for our anniversary)",5,2018,11,25
118,Amazing birthday treat,Loved everything about this hotel. Very comfortable pillows and bed. Excellent bathroom. Staff were all extremely helpful and professional.

We will definitely be coming back to stay again. ,5,2018,11,25
118,Lovely Hotel in the perfect location,"Anniversary treat in London and we were not disappointed with our choice.

Beautiful hotel with bags of character (former Grammar School) and a cracking location near the very hip and cool bars and restaurants of Rope Walk and Tanner St in the Bermondsey and also close to Borough Market. You are also right by Tower Bridge and the Queens Thames Path Walk. Location in our opinion is 5/5 unless you really want to be close to the West End but even then it‚Äôs a direct Jubilee line from London Bridge to Green Park and Bond St.

As far as the team are concerned they really pushed the boat out for our Anniversary and the staff were so friendly and efficient and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us to make our stay special.  The rooms were lush and the beds so comfortable... given the name of the Hotel is LaLit, that‚Äôs appropriate! This hotel is an oasis of calm in a busy city. A rare find...quality over quantity.

",5,2018,11,25
118,Wonderful hotel,The LaLit exceeded all expectations. We were greeted by really helpful staff who gave excellent recommendations for places to visit in the area. The room was very comfortable as well as very clean. We will absolutely stay here again if we‚Äôre ever back in London!,5,2018,11,24
118,Pleasurable business,"Good location for central london and a short stroll from Tower Bridge. Nice Indian theme in a school converted into an interesting, comfortable and modern hotel with old fashioned charm. I was too late to try the restaurant but it looked very nice, I will try next time for sure. My room's air con was noisy and so I marked the hotel down for sleep quality but I suspect I was just unlucky and too tired to ask that someone look at it (which I'm sure they would have).",4,2018,11,24
118,"Convenient location, hidden gem",Felt spoiled and smug in this oasis of calm and quality tucked away in the heart of London. Close to the sights and near to transport links to make it the perfect indulgent hideaway. Already planning to go back. ,5,2018,11,24

118,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed here for four nights in early November. We were looking for a hotel in this area and what a nice surprise to come across the lovely Lalit.

We will definitely stay here again and recommend the hotel to our family and friends. Namaskar. ",5,2018,11,22
118,Great hotel in a wonderful location ,"We picked this hotel for its close location to The Bridge Theatre and dinner at The Ivy Tower Bridge.

118,The best luxury boutique hotel in London with first-class services.,"I cannot recommend this hotel enough, their superb hospitality from management to staff, warmth and kindness is second to none. I've been to many so called prestigious hotels in London, who's first class service has proven many times to be a shambles. The LaLit has such a beautiful culture ambience, we were looked after and,they accomidated our needs above our expectations, for business and pleasure the LaLit fits all. And it's luxurious ambience, is perfect for fashion, and hosting events, definitely an Instagramable environment. I fully recommend this hotel to anyone, I'm definitely going back, that's for sure.
A hidden jewel- Thank you The LaLit for a truly memorable experience.",5,2018,11,20

118,A Wonderful Unique Luxury Hotel with History and Charm,"My husband and I stayed here for our first wedding anniversary and had an absolutely wonderful stay. We had a senior classroom which was spacious, luxurious and designed beautifully. The bathroom was also exquisite as was the service. We would particularly like to mention Tony who was invaluable with top tips on the local area. What a lovely and super helpful man with such a wealth of knowledge. If i had to nit pick I would suggest a mirror over the desk/dressing table as makeup and hair was a bit of a nightmare without one and a heated towel rail plus a smaller hand towel which can be used for hair would also be a great addition. Like I said though, small things as your hotel is AMAZING and we will definitely be back. Thank you so much :0)",5,2018,11,19
118,Luxury?,"First let me say that the staff was lovely!  However, the room was far from luxurious!  Tiny with no place to sit other then bed, overhead shower didn‚Äôt work and virtually no closet. The closet they provided that my shirts did not have room to hang - and I am not even 5 feet tall!
Disappointed because location was perfect for me and plan to visit my children who live a mile from there often, next time in January. But my husband and I will not be staying at the LaLit.",3,2018,11,18
118,"Hugely disappointing, not 5*","We had high hopes of this hotel after reading the reviews and seeing it on Made in Chelsea, but were very disappointed in it.  Not sure quite why it is 5*.  It is in a downmarket part of London, although close to the Shard, but it is very difficult to get taxis or Ubers from this area.  There are no signs at the entrance on the road or at the front door so we actually walked past it thinking there would be a main entrance further on, we were not sure how to get into the hotel.  There was no doorman on the front door and nobody offered to carry our bags to our room, although we did see other people having their bags taken.  This is unthinkable for a 5* London hotel.  So we traipsed all the way to the room we had been allocated only to enter it and find that it had not been cleaned after the previous occupants left!  I have never encountered this anywhere and I stay in top hotels twice a month.  So we had to walk all the way back to reception to inform them of this but received no apology, the receptionist just told us to wait a moment then disappeared into a back room.  We stood there for ages like idiots until he returned and just gave us a key to a different room.  Because of this treatment, I voiced my unhappiness and he offered us a free cocktail, saying ""let us know when you want it"".  What does that mean?  We can have it in the bar?  In our room?  No idea.

Our room (a senior classroom) was quite small, very dark, with a small bathroom.  Considering this hotel is quite new, the furniture isn't wearing well, there were bottle marks on the sink surround, chips on the furniture and the shower floor was stained.  The shower cubicle was quite large but just had a very small shower head, no rainfall shower.  The wardrobe and drawers had no handles so were hard to open and I broke two nails on them before giving up and living out of my overnight bag.  There is no information pack (you are just given the wifi password when you check-in and have to remember it, why don't they just put it in the room?) and the room was extremely hot but there are no instructions for the air-con which is extremely confusing, not like other hotels at all.  So we had to phone someone who came and turned it up for us.  Again, I am an intelligent woman and have never had to ask for help with air-con before!  There were no hand towels so I phoned reception who told me that they did not routinely provide them to make the hotel the same standard as the ones in India!  But they did send some up.  I do not want to dry my body with the same towel as I have used after using the toilet.  The duvet and pillows were nice quality, feather, but the under-sheet was stained.  The room was extremely close to the block of flats next door, who could see straight into our room from their windows or balconies so we felt obliged to keep our curtains closed the whole time, making an already dark room even darker.  The room was nice and quiet, however.

The bar was a nice room, with friendly staff and good cocktails (we did get our free cocktail here in the end).  Breakfast was good with a nice hot buffet and eggs cooked to order.  The scrambled eggs were particularly good and pastries were lovely.  This was in the Headmaster's Room, which was very impressive.  Again, staff at breakfast were very nice.

We were very disappointed with this stay and I would not return.  For the same money, I would stay at the Shard and have an experience a hundred times better.",2,2018,11,18
118,Anniversary ,"Hotel was amazing, totally worth staying at. Staff helpful and friendly. Bed was so comfortable and the room was lovely. The location of the hotel was good as it was very close to the station. The bar downstairs served some great drinks. I will definitely be staying at Lalit again!!",5,2018,11,13
118,Charming boutique hotel near Tower Bridge,"What an amazing hotel.  Converted from a school house to a boutique hotel with a strong Indian influence (it is part of a small chain of hotels developed by an amazing Indian entrepreneur - the in-house TV has a small program on the story that is worth a watch if that sort of thing interests you).

The rooms are ample and very comfortable.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  They seem to all understand that great hospitality can really make a stay at a hotel special.  I felt they really wanted me to enjoy my stay and my time in London.

The restaurant is an amazing room.  It must have been the assembly hall in the old school. Massive ceiling with amazing chandeliers and a great colour scheme.  It gave such a feeling of space and grandeur.  The breakfast buffet was adequate.  Not the greatest range but enough for me and it was supplemented by a good a la carte menu that was included in my room rate (given there were prices on the menu I assume this is not the case for all room rates).  I was never at a loss for choice and the food was good.

The room service menu was relatively limited as well but one evening I had the Indian dinner set and I really enjoyed it.  A good meal that was well presented.

For me the quality of the service lifted my view from good to great and made my stay very enjoyable.  Thanks to all the staff.",5,2018,11,12
118,Lovely place but afternoon tea could have been better ,"We had afternoon tea with Indian snacks today at The Lalit. Since our arrival we were welcomed by the most charming and lovely staff. Their service was impeccable and they looked after us really well.

The hotel is simply beautiful and after our visit of today we were thinking that staying for a night or two must be something to try!

The only disappointment was perhaps the snacks itself during our tea.  We opted for the basic afternoon tea deal (¬£47 pounds per person). When we booked we were told that it was Indian street food but nevertheless I had higher expectations perhaps... The basic menu gives you the option of only one type of tea... and the samosas were quite heavy.  The Indian sweets made up for them though.

We will probably go back for drinks at the bar or maybe to stay at the hotel but not sure whether to have afternoon tea here again. ",4,2018,11,11
118,Birthday Treat,"We stayed for two nights celebrating my birthday. We had a beautiful suite. From check-in  to check out we were looked after superbly. The staff are excellent and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. We had afternoon tea which was amazing. We had dinner in the restaurant, the food and service was fabulous. One slight issue was breakfast on the Sunday. There were four of us, two had to wait while the other two breakfasts were luke warm, this was disappointing and a very basic mistake. That said everything else was just perfect",4,2018,11,11
118,Fabulous week long stay!,"First off, we stayed here for 7 nights.  This hotel was absolutely beautiful and the staff was super friendly and accommodating. The staff went above and beyond and was always available to provide assistance and make you feel welcome. The hotel is only a few years old, with updated amenities, which included remote controlled blackout blinds and heated floors in the bathroom. However, we stayed on the ground floor and there was some street noise in the mornings.  The restaurant in the hotel is gorgeous, and the food was very good.  They do have a nice bar and outdoor terrace seating area, but we found the drinks to be a bit on the high side.  The hotel had very good security during the day and evening hours.  We also never felt uncomfortable safety-wise in the area.  

The hotel is located on the south side of the Thames, and just behind the hotel, allows for excellent views of the Tower Bridge and the Tower of London.   It is located outside of a lot of the hustle and bustle, which was nice after a long day of sightseeing. The Shard, the Tower of London, London Bridge and Tower Bridge are within walking distance (less than a mile), and is about a half of a mile to the London Bridge tube station Jubilee line (5-10 min walk).  Also near the location is the riverwalk, which has several great restaurants, ranging in middle to higher end.  We found a great little place right under Tower Bridge called The Vault, to have a nightcap before heading back at night.  There is also a small grocery store next door, which was convenient for additional water and snacks.

If you are looking for a quaint boutique hotel off the beaten path, we would highly recommend this hotel.  Thanks to all of the staff at the La Lit!!",5,2018,11,10
118,Great service and beautiful hotel,It was my second time staying at the Lalit London and both stays were fantastic. The staff is very friendly and the service is great. The building is beautiful and the rooms are very stylish. The restaurant serves one of the best Indian meals I have ever had and the bar is very cozy.,5,2018,11,07
118,Cancelled stay,"We were due to stay at the hotel last weekend to celebrate my husband's forthcoming 60th birthday. Unfortunately he went down with a really bad virus and we had to cancel our stay. Naz had gone out of his way to organise decoration and a cake in our room. He was extremely concerned about my husband's welfare and even though we didn't stay there,  if this is the standard service and care given at this hotel,  then we would definitely be lookingto rebook in the future",5,2018,11,06
118,Night's stay at the Lalit London..,"Great room and amenities in the bathroom. We seemed to struggle with the heating/AC and the lighting in the bathroom could've benefitted from a vanity spot light. Otherwise, wonderfully styled and the selection of complimentary snacks and drinks were a welcome boon, especially the chocolate!

The staff were attentive, warm and friendly. The attention to detail and service makes this a gem of a boutique hotel. Would definitely recommend it, even more so for those looking to tour around London and its famous sites.",4,2018,11,06
118,Memorable stay,We recently stayed at the Lalit as a celebration for our 50th Wedding Anniversary.  The stay was made more special by the fact that the building was my husband's old school St Olave's and St Saviour's. The hotel management went out of their way to make our stay special. We had an upgraded room and they had provided chocolates and a bottle of Prosecco on our arrival and a beautiful cake after our evening meal. Made us feel very special. We would certainly stay here again for another special occasion. All staff were lovely and very courteous.  Our evening meal in the Baluchi restaurant was very good too. My husband was thrilled to be seated in the same spot that his old headmaster used to sit and survey all the boys at dinner. All in all a very memorable stay.,5,2018,10,31
118,Amazing evening of food and drinks with friends!!,"We recently enjoyed a fantastic evening at the Lalit with friends. The evening started with cocktails in the Headmasters Room. The cocktails were beautifully presented and tasted amazing.

The Baluchi restaurant is a great find for us as the food is some of the best I have eaten in London. We were pleasantly surprised when the head chef came to say hello to our table and even recommended a few dishes for us to try. We had a couple of vegetarians in the group so had the opportunity to try a broad mix of dishes and every dish was cooked to perfection. The wine recommended by the sommelier complimented the meal well. 

We had a great evening and will definitely be visiting again. Thank you all for making our evening so memorable :)",5,2018,10,30
118,Great boutique hotel experience,"Unbeatable location in vibrant London Bridge area. Friendly staff and lovely building and rooms with excellent shower. Close walk to Tower Bridge, the Shard and other nearby attractions. Will be my first choice accommodation next time in London. ",5,2018,10,29
118,Perfect!,"What an amazing hotel - we only had one night here but it felt like longer.  Senior classroom was lovely, with fluffy duvet, marshmallow pillows, thick bathrobes, free mini bar, Korres toiletries, Japanese toilet, even toothbrushes and a shaving kit, and a beautiful mini box of chocolates at bedtime.  An Indian breakfast in the fabulous dining room was amazing.  Staff were all very kind and smiley, and we left feeling relaxed and happy. Recommended.",5,2018,10,23
118,Superb Luxury Hotel,"Upon arrival we were warmly greeted and made to feel at home. Bizarrely enough my father came here in the 70s when the building was Lambeth College (sadly neither his graffiti nor mislaid Parker pen were anywhere to be seen). The inside has clearly been lovingly and painstakingly restored; original wooden floors and other features throughout. As this was a special occasion the duty manager, Naz, had arranged for a complimentary bottle of bubbly in a ice bucket to be in our room. He also sent a beautiful cake up later on. The room itself was very nice indeed - comfy Hypnos mattress on the king bed, well stocked complimentary mini bar (refilled each day of our stay) and a free mobile device for us to use out and about. Naz was also to give us some good recommendations for bars etc nearby. The view of the Shard from our Senior Classroom window was amazing. The bathroom had a heated floor (she wants one at home now) and walk in shower, as well as a super modern hi-tech toilet (be careful if you press all those buttons haha). We didn‚Äôt dine or drink in the hotel as we had already booked these things elsewhere, but the dining room looked stunning, so perhaps we will next time. Thank you for a lovely weekend. Until next time, Namaskar.",5,2018,10,20
118,Celebration tea from heaven,"I invited 15 guests to tea at the Lalit to celebrate a special occasion.
The chefs and staff could not have been more helpful.
They devised a bespoke menu of Indian and Western snacks, washed down with Champagne and tea.
The Gallery overlooks one of the most beautiful rooms in London.
Superb service, superb food, superb ambiance.
Well done, The Lalit!",5,2018,10,17
118,Unique property with some flaws,"I REALLY wanted to like this hotel, as I thought it looked unique and was in an interesting location ‚Äúoff the beaten path‚Äù by Tower Bridge.  I have stayed at The Langham (still the best - hands down - regarding service and the beauty of my room) and the Berkeley prior in the last couple of years, so I have some 5 star comps....

First, the room was not as big as some others in this category (Senior Classroom) and doesn‚Äôt have a bath, but it was well appointed.  We requested - and received - high ceilings - which was very nice.  The black out shades are a nice and welcome touch.

The service was mixed.  It was our honeymoon, which I mentioned in communications with the hotel and when asked if it was a special occasion, but I‚Äôm not sure why they ask since nothing special happened (unless you count towels folded like swans - which was cute I guess).  I had requested a particular bottle of prosecco a few weeks before on arrival and we arrived maybe 30 mins - 1 hour early as our plane was early so it wasn‚Äôt in the room.  I understand that, but I got a call from the restaurant later in which I was told they ‚Äúran out.‚Äù  Since it was a surprise, well, that‚Äôs not so great for a 5 star property.  After I mentioned it to the front of house manager via email, he kindly provided a bottle in our room the next night - which was appreciated.  But - that brings me to my biggest point -

To get anything here, even basic things, you really do have to bug them, and I got tired of that and gave up after a bit.  We only ever got 2 towels - I had to ask for more every time and then just gave up.  We had to ask to have the mini bar restocked a couple of times.  We had to ask for more umbrellas at the front.  We had to ask to have our room made up even after I hit the ‚Äúplease make my room‚Äù light and left for most of the day (until 2 or 3 or 4 pm).  It was that kind of thing, and I hated (!!!) feeling like I had to bug them all the time for towels, etc etc.  I‚Äôm not a towel hog but my husband uses one and I use two - not asking for the moon on a gold platter, folks!

Usually, this isn‚Äôt the case at 5 star hotels, so it was very odd to me.  Also, there was almost never anyone to open the door (VERY different than the Langham) even though there are probably 5 people who pop out of the small office next to reception at any given time!  Want to mention Rosca (sp?) though - he ALWAYS came to the door when he was working.

Would I stay again?  Hmmm...I‚Äôd have to get a pretty good deal to do it.   It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúbad‚Äù but it wasn‚Äôt up to par compared to some other London (and 5 star properties) in general.  I did love the location though.  

Odd.  ",4,2018,10,17
118,A very comfortable stay in London,"For me as a business traveller, it's very handy that the excellent and extremely friendly staff at the Lalit takes care of virtually everything. Although my company limits allow only the ""tiny room category"", a stay at the Lalit is definitely quite different and can hardly be compared with the usual suspects (ibis, holiday inn...).They offer delicious breakfast options, everything is perfectly clean, staff is great.....The overall impression is excellent, but it's the small details that really make the difference.",5,2018,10,16
118,2nd Visit & Stay,We came here last year for an Anniversary meal so this time booked two nights. A lovely welcome as usual & a super room for the two nights made for a relaxing break. We parked nearby in Q parking which is safe & secure but predictively  expensive & had a meal in Baluchi. We highly recommend this  hotel which is also in a great location! ,5,2018,10,15
118,Quirky hotel,"Located close to tower bridge this hotel is a converted Victorian school. We stayed in a senior classroom and it was very comfortable and if I was in the area would stay again, we did not use the restaurant but it looked very interesting ",4,2018,10,14
118,Another amazing dinner thanks to Chef Jomon,"Last time we went for the Naan tasting menu that blew our minds. I go to the Delhi branch for business, which is famous for having the best breads, and London may actually be better! Certainly more innovative. Chef Jomon was the perfect host, going out of his way to make sure the meal was an experience. So, naturally had to go back, and go back again, and will be going again and again, and again. Last night went to the main dining hall which was being refurbished last time. I had a Friend in town who does not like Indian food! She was mopping up every ounce of sauce with her ‚Äúbest naan ever,‚Äù while the lamb fell off the bone. Innovative, delicious, and of course Chef‚Äôs passion for food and hospitality may well be the best I‚Äôve ever experienced in London.",5,2018,10,12
118,"Amazing Service, impeccable rooms and fabulous location","Could not have asked for a more positive experience at the LaLit this past September.  We arrived from the states very early in the morning; the LaLit accommodated our early arrival so we could arrive and shower, sleep and refresh in lieu of waiting to check in at 2pm. From the moment we arrived until we left, the service was over the top. The senior room was immaculate, well stocked and perfect!  We will definitely be back!!  Thank you!!!",5,2018,10,10
118,Superb!!,"We stayed here for a few days and thoroughly enjoyed it. The location was perfect, right at the Tower Bridge. The staff were very friendly and welcoming to my 8 year old son. The rooms were a bit small but well appointed, modern, spotless and comfortable. The breakfast was plentiful and delicious. The ladies in the spa were friendly and accommodating. I have nothing negative to say about LaLit and would definitely stay there again on my next trip to London! ",5,2018,10,09
118,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed at LaLit for the weekend for our anniversary.  The hotel is beautiful, the room was spotless, spacious and very comfortable.  The bathroom was lovely with a brilliant shower. The staff were friendly and very helpful.  We will definitely stay here again",5,2018,10,08
118,Lovely wedding anniversary celebration,We stayed at The Lalit on the 6th October 2018 to celebrate our 6 year wedding anniversary and it was a wonderful experience. All the staff were professional and couldn't do enough for us. We stayed in the Lambeth Suite and the room was spacious and had everything we needed. The location was great and the breakfast was perfect. Overall an amazing stay and we wouldn't hesitate to go back!! Thanks to all the team at Lalti London,5,2018,10,08
118,LaLit,"We had a senior classroom and it was quite spacious. Everything in the hotel was new and the staff were were friendly and helpful. The room was well stocked with free minbar, Prosecco in an ice bucket and chocolates ready for our arrival. I would stay there again but the breakfast was a bit disappointing ",4,2018,10,06
118,Overnight with dinner ,"Beautiful hotel well renovated from an old school.

Service impeccable, great welcome and check in.

Food in the restaurant outstanding along with very well thought out cocktails 

If we are being fussy could do with blackout curtains in rooms and hand towels but other than that perfect 

We will no doubt be back ",5,2018,10,06
118,Stylish hotel at a reasonable price,"Stayed at Lalit on business yesterday. Really classy hotel, great location near London Bridge Station and Tower Bridge. Helpful and courteous staff. I would recommend it, particularly for business travellers.",5,2018,10,04
118,Great service and staff,"The service and staff is amazing.  Hotel bar closes quite early and you have to go pretty far to find an open bar, but the short walk to Tower Bridge is great!  About 15 min walk from London Bridge tube (easy to get form there into central London).",5,2018,10,03
118,Incredible service - would definitely recommend,"I can not speak highly enough of this hotel. From the minute we (myself and my best friend) walked through the door we had exceptional service, and were really treated like individuals. We were helped up to our room with our shopping bags, and during conversation mentioned we were having a trip away to celebrate our birthdays - there was no agenda to our mentioning this, just purely polite conversation. Upon arriving back from dinner we found a cake had been delivered to our room wishing us Happy Birthday, which was a pleasant surprise for us both. The room was fresh (I believe the hotel has only been open a year and a half), spacious and very clean, with all the amenities you would expect, and more. My only regret is that I didn't have time to take up the very kind member of staff who helped us to our room on his offer of a tour of the hotel and the history of the building. Location is perfect for Tower Bridge & The Shard, without feeling like you are in between two major London landmarks - our room was facing the river, and it was a comfortable & peaceful nights sleep.",5,2018,10,02
118,It was an amazing stay.,"This hotel stay was a complete surprise.  My fiance and I was not prepared how lovely this hotel is.  Naz, the duty manager, was very attentive and detail to the satisfaction of our entire stay.  He made sure that we have everything we need in our room, down to the details of how our bed is made every day.  I will make Lalit my default hotel stay the very next time I am visiting London again.  Thank you, Lalit for making my trip a wonderful memory for both me and my fiance.",5,2018,10,02
118,Mrs allison cliff,"We stayed for a weekend to celebrate my brother-in-laws 50th birthday.
Fantastic hotel with wonderful staff who could not be more welcoming and helpful
I would highly recommend the LaLit for any occasion we had a fantastic stay",5,2018,10,02
118,Amazing! ,"The hotel was amazing and the service we received matched. Our stay was perfect. Naz, the duty manager, checked us in and was so helpful and friendly and ensured we had an amazing stay. The teachers room had a number of exotic cocktails and they tasted amazing. The room was perfect and we had an amazing view. Would stay here again when in London next. ",5,2018,09,30
118,Amazing Afternoon Chai,"Had the most amazing afternoon chai. From amazing samosa, bhel puri, cutting chai and sweets. The hotel itself has a lot of character given the building is a conversion from a Victorian school. Chef Jo personally took care of our table! Highly recommended ",5,2018,09,22
118,"Great staff, great rooms and location","What a lovely hotel this has become, I have stayed in the lalit in India and the service here is just as exceptional. Super friendly staff and the food was awesome. Catered to all our needs, I would definitely recommend to anyone in the ldn Bridge area. For fitness addicts, it doesn't have a pool or steam room. ",5,2018,09,22
118,An exquisite luxury hotel with character,This hotel was excellent from the moment you arrive until you have to tear yourself away. The conversion from a striking Victorian boys grammar school into a characterful luxury hotel has been done sympathetically and with an eye for detail. We were upgraded to a lovely suite which was spacious and comfortable. The ‚ÄòNamaskar‚Äô welcome was friendly and efficient and we were made to feel special throughout our stay. We will definitely stay here again.,5,2018,09,21
118,Lovely hotel! ,"My friend and I had such a wonderful stay at LaLit last weekend. The staff is friendly and helpful and there are great complimentary perks in the room to make the stay comfortable and feeling like a home away from home. To give some insight into their customer service: it was a trip for my friend‚Äôs birthday and the night of her bday the turn down service included a personalized cake. That‚Äôs the kind of thoughtful service we received throughout the weekend.

Gorgeous old building. Walking distance from Borough Market (went daily!) and just near Tower Bridge. Some may consider it a bit out of the way but we were very happy with the location and found it very easy to take the Underground or walk anywhere we wanted to go. Would certainly recommend LaLit to friends and stay there again if my travels take me back to London. 

Thanks again for making our time in London so relaxing and fun! ",5,2018,09,20
118,Treasure of a place at Tower Bridge,"Elegant yet relaxed.  Exceptionally friendly staff eager to please.  Our room was fabulous and the bathroom gorgeous with every amenity imaginable.  And snacks/Green & Black chocolates and bottled water/soft drinks in the room refrigerator AND on the house.  Loved the area.  Walked up the Thames through a scenic neighborhood to St. Catherine's Cathedral, a terrific market, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre and spent hours at the Tate Modern.  Pub hopped back to hotel past the Shard.  Can't wait to return.  Excellent in every way.  Very good value considering the high price of good hotels in London.",5,2018,09,20
118,Attention to detail seriously lacking,"Someone has clearly decided that check-in is massively important in the guest experience but unfortunately they have manged to make it so complex and involving so many staff that our experience was one of massive confusion and stress not reassurance.
But that ‚Äúwelcome‚Äù faded into insignificance when we arrived in our room and my wife went to the bathroom. What awaited her there was what looked suspiciously like the aftermath of a previous person‚Äôs very upset stomach. A phone call to reception brought the promise of a visit from maintenance despite my wife assuring them this was a housekeeping matter.
We decided to retreat to the bar whilst the problem was sorted. Unfortunately no one was manning the bar and after a search we located a very reluctant member of staff who took a drinks order and duly deposited the drinks on a table with neither a smile nor a coaster. After what we considered a suitable period we returned to the room and it was obvious that someone had indeed visited and flushed the offending toilet and duly left. The mess on the porcelain still present. Another call to reception resulted in a visit from 2 senior members on the housekeeping team complete with clipboards to demonstrate the room had been serviced. A protracted discussion with them brought a promise of a housekeeping visit.
Eventually 1 suit returned with a house keeper who was desperately ill equipped for any toilet cleaning duties and neither of them seemed to have any cognisance of the significance of cleaning the toilet bowl and the seat when someone who was not well had used the facilities . 
Finally my wife cleaned the toilet herself whilst the 2 members of staff looked on. We have stayed in countless hotels over decades but never have we had to clean a toilet on arrival anywhere.
Later the other suit knocked on the door with chocolates and a bottle of wine as an apology ‚Äì nice gesture but the Malbec he brought was straight from a fridge and freezing cold and he had not brought glasses to drink the wine, they arrived some 40 mins later as we were leaving for our visit to the theatre.

It goes without saying we will never be staying here again",1,2018,09,20
118,Visit to London for a few days,"Nice people, lovely hotel and history being a converted school.   Food was excellent and so was our room. No issues other than what we had to pay for this stay.  The prices ranged from ¬£300 to ¬£554 per night.  At ¬£300 I was OK, but ¬£554 forget it.  Remember this does not include breakfast and 12.5% charge for every service which I was not happy with, but paid because I'm English and don't like to make a fuss.",4,2018,09,19
118,Excelemt,Chosen because it was easy for me to meet my husband go to drinks at shard then dinner at restaurant. I got via SLH  and booked suite which was kindly upgraded to main suite. Impressive. Major Indian vibe and part of a big brand. Breakfast was buffet but Indian specialities available. Well located and excellent service,4,2018,09,19
118,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"We only stayed at the hotel overnight and didn‚Äôt eat in the bar or restaurant so I can‚Äôt comment on that aspect. Hotel staff were very polite and helpful. Our room was lovely and quiet with plenty of space and a really refreshing shower. The hotel is located a short walk from Tower Bridge and Butlers Wharf in one direction and Borough Market and London Bridge in the other which is wonderful. We decided upon checking out to walk all the way along South Bank to Westminster which is a lovely walk. Definitely want to go back to try the hotel‚Äôs restaurant and bar which looked really nice as we checked out. One minor ‚Äòcomplaint‚Äô, the receptionist pointed out that everything in the minbar was complementary which set our hopes up only for us to get to the room, open the minbar and discover two bottles of tonic water and a Diet Coke... not quite what we‚Äôd been hoping for!",5,2018,09,16
118,Amazing massage and dinner,"I have just been to the lalit for a massage, it was divine- caron was my therapist and she was amazing- very skilled with great customer service. The spa is quiet and relaxed- will certainly be returning.

We then decided to have dinner and we were not disappointed. One of the waiters was a gentleman who had come from the lalit in delhi for the week- he was very attentive and polite. What a little gem in london!",5,2018,09,14
118,Can‚Äôt fault it really,"Lovely luxurious hotel with fantastic service.  It‚Äôs expensive but you get what you pay for.  The really nice thing is there are loads of complimentary things too (ie bottles of water, biscuits, chocolate, Nespresso coffee, tea etc are all free and are replaced daily).
The attention to detail is great too.  The room is made up while you are out as expected but it‚Äôs the little touches that are great.  The turn-down service is cute too - Little chocolates, lavender pillow spray, bottle of water and slippers.
The location is really really good.  Near the Shard and London Bridge station.  Right next to the Scoop and Tower Bridge.
Tony the concierge (aka the walking GPS) is so lovely and helpful too.  Would def stay again for a romantic couple of nights.",5,2018,09,14
118,Dinner,Food at The Lalit was excellent. We were recommended by friends and it lived upto our expectations. The staff and the chef were very warm. It was my husband‚Äôs bday; and the hospitality by them made our evening. Will visit again soon.,5,2018,09,11
118,A very lovely stay,We stayed here for my girlfriends 30th birthday. I only mentioned it when they asked if it was a special occasion but they went above and beyond anything I was expecting to make it a memorable stay. The facilities were amazing and the staff were fantastic. Will definitely be staying here again,5,2018,09,11
118,Birthday treat to a 5* hotel,I booked this hotel on reading the reviews alone. We often stay in London but it was our first time staying at the La Lit. It was fantastic from start to finish. The staff were amazing and so attentive it reminded me of being in a five or six star hotel in Dubai. Everything was perfectly done. We stayed in a senior classroom and the room is absolutely beautiful. I mentioned in an email before arriving that it was my partner‚Äòs birthday we had a complimentary bottle of champagne in our bedroom on arrival and a beautiful cake arrived for him in the evening. The staff could not have done more we will definitely stay there again and I definitely recommended this beautiful hotel.  The location is amazing and five minutes walk away from London Bridge and all its attractions and restaurants. We can see the shard from our bedroom window.,5,2018,09,09
118,Not a great location,"I stayed here in September 2018. 

The biggest downside to this hotel is its location. It is a good thirty minute drive away from the city centre, and unless you are in London to spend time inside the Shard, this is the worst choice you can make. Each trip to Central London took an hour each way due to traffic and made life very difficult. London Bridge station is just a few minutes away though so the tube is a more sensible option. 

On the positive side, they have Tony- who is probably the nicest, most professional concierge in the whole world. Tony knows how to handle difficult clients, make them feel comfortable and well taken care of and provide helpful solutions. The Lalit have an asset in Tony and they would do well to recognise it. 

On food, the hotel serves primarily Indian food. The breakfast is nothing to write home about, though they do provide dosas and idlis on request, but the a la carte menu is very good. The restaurant service could improve.",2,2018,09,08
118,Hotel,"Fabulous boutique hotel.   Very friendly staff.   The food was some of the best Indian food I have ever tasted.   The location right near the Tower bridge, lots of great restaurants and pubs and a tube station was great.  We will be back.",5,2018,09,06
118,"Stylish, quality, personalised - I'll be back","Stayed here unexpectedly for the first time.  The welcome was warm and helpful.  I had a request in advance for extra pillows due to my broken collar bone and they had it all arranged.  I also had a surprise room upgrade to a suite which was a bit special.  The staff were friendly and ready to chat but not in your face.  You can tell it's a relatively new hotel because it's still very smart and well finished.  Quality bed, pillows and bathroom fittings.  I ate at the restaurant.  Food was really good quality.  Quite pricey, but to be expected at a hotel like this I guess.  I'd eat there again instead of going out.",5,2018,09,06
118,Staying at this beautiful hotel made the wedding we went to even more special!,"Brilliant service - Beautiful Hotel - Great location - Traditional English Breakfast lovely, the Indian option was very tasty. We were lucky, the sun was out and it was lovely and warn - we took the opportunity to make the most of the lovely outside sitting areas.",5,2018,09,06
118,Cute and luxurious at the same time,"I didn‚Äôt know what to expect since the building itself doesn‚Äôt feed your imagination. However, the moment you walk in, it changes into modern castle setting. There are three floors, 70 rooms only I understood so the service is really personal. What I really liked about my stay, is the kindness of the staff and willing to go an extra mile to accommodate the client. The only small detail I would comment, is the neighbourhood...",4,2018,09,06
118,Wonderful experience ,"While recently opened, they have done a very good job of being customer centric. Great location, well appointed rooms and instant service. Loved this gem and have already recommended it to many friends ",5,2018,09,02
118,"Beautiful hotel, very relaxing and great location","We stayed at this hotel for a special occasion one weekend. The hotel was lovely from the greeting at reception, to the lovely rooms and bathrooms. The room was great, very quiet with comfy bed. The free minibar was a nice welcome with a good selection. The bathroom was lovely and couldn't fault anything. The location is great as well a short walk from the river and Tower Bridge.",5,2018,09,01
118,Splendid Afternoon Tea,We booked for an Afternoon Tea at the hotel to celebrate our anniversary. Restaurant was half closed due to renovation due to refurbishment work going on. Staff was attentive and friendly. Portion sizes are small but you fill up quickly.They refill it very quickly whatever you fancy.Variety of choices in the tea as well. ,5,2018,09,01
118,Beautiful Hotel,"Would definitely go again, small rooms but decorated lovely. Good service and good location! Everything was clean and we had no problems. All the employees are friendly and someone greets you on the door and takes your luggage on arrival.",5,2018,08,30
118,Wonderful Hotel,"Having stayed in a suite  here last September and visited again this month for dinner I certainly recommend this hotel. 
All members of staff were friendly and helpful and made our visits a delight.
I was a boy at the old St Olaves school in this building and the hotel has done justice to keeping the ambience of this lovely old structure. The food is a fusion of Indian and English cuisine, beautifully presented and served.
I will certainly be returning.",5,2018,08,29
118,Lovely Birthday stay!,"Stayed here for my birthday for one night and the staff made it extra special. I booked in for a treatment in the spa and my only negative about this were the staff. As i arrived, the staff made me wait for 15 minutes whilst they chatted away. After the massage she didn't explain the after care treatment either and most spa's would do. The stay was good - room was super clean and beautiful view of the Shard. As it was my birthday they gave us a bottle of wine and a cake which was really cute and made it special. The bathroom was amazing - heated floors and power shower with lovely toiletries. Would stay here again as the staff are so friendly and welcomed us with open arms.",5,2018,08,28
118,Amazing Hotel & Staff,We were made to feel like we were their only guests. The staff were amazing and went above and beyond to make our stay feel special. I will definitely b staying there again. We requested a quiet room with a nice view and they certainly delivered. Room 201 was really quiet and we had a slight view of the Thames and the Majors building.,5,2018,08,28
118,Fantastic anniversary stay,"My husband and I stayed at the LaLit for our 5th anniversary and had a truly amazing stay. We arrived early as were off to see a show but they took our case and it was waiting in our room for us when we returned. The room was fantastic and very large for one in London. The room really can‚Äôt be faulted; large comfy bed, excellent complimentary toiletries (which smelt amazing) and a free minibar. To top it off there was a complimentary bottle of Prosecco, fruit basket and macaroons along with a lovely postcard congratulating us on our anniversary. It doesn‚Äôt stop there! Upon return to our room that night there was a gorgeous cake waiting for us. We were truly spoilt and cannot thank the hotel enough. We have a toddler (who was with her Nanna) and we are expecting our second child so nights away happen very infrequently. The LaLit we cannot thank you enough for making our stay so wonderful! We will definitely be back!",5,2018,08,26
118,Very nice & restful ,"You get value for money. Good neighbourhood close to many attractions. Rooms are big and very nice. I did not try the restaurant which serves Indian food. The breakfast was though no special.
Highly recommended.",4,2018,08,23
118,Lovely stay.,"We enjoyed our stay at The Lalit very much.   It is a great place to stay, very close to many of the attractions of London, close to many excellent restaurants.   Our senior room was spacious and very well equipped.   All the staff were friendly, knowledgeable, attentive and helpful.   We had an excellent meal in the Baluchi restaurant.   The hotel, having been converted from an old school, has a much more spacious feel than most London hotels.",5,2018,08,21
118,Top Notch! Outstanding stay at LaLit London!!,"We had a marvelous and first class experience at LaLit! All staff members were courteous and accommodating. The facility is fantastic and top-rate. The turn-down service was excellent, and the heated floors in the bathroom were amazing! Stay here!!!",5,2018,08,21
118,Fantastic hotel,Lovely weekend away really relaxing hotel staff are so friendly. Wish we could of stayed longer. It was our anniversary we had fruit champagne and a cake in our room complimentary. Look forward to coming back üòä,5,2018,08,19
118,Didn't want to leave the room!,"Our first stay in this hotel and would highly recommend it. We were looked after and warmly greeted by all staff,who couldn't have done more. There was a good selection of complimentary hot & cold drinks, savoury snacks, chocolate & magazines in the room. The bathroom had plenty of luxury toiletries, robes & slipoers, nice finishes & a smart-loo. It was a relaxing haven that was hard to leave.
A short stroll from the river & plenty of attractions within walking distance during the day. This part of London is quiet of an evening so if you want hustle & bustle you'd have to go to the west end but the tube is only a short walk away. I would definitely stay here again",5,2018,08,19
118,Best stay in London,"Words can‚Äôt describe how amazing my stay at the Lalit was, staff were outstanding and accommodated my every need. Made my birthday very memorable and I‚Äôm already planning my next stay there. 
Food was also excellent, the chef went out of his way to make me something which wasn‚Äôt on the dinner menu which I was very impressed with. 
Credit to all the staff for there hard work.",5,2018,08,19
118,Lovely stay for work,"Lovely room, facilities. Really enjoyed the hotel. I stayed on the bottom floor with a view of the carpark which was a shame but I wasn't there much during the day so it didn't really matter. Didn't get a chance to eat there, but looked good. 

Worth staying in if near London Bridge - short walk from the train station.",4,2018,08,19
118,"Comfortable, beautiful hotel",Could not have been happier with our stay. Staff were so friendly and helpful. Rooms feel very luxurious - bathroom has heated floors and the shower was incredible. So happy with our stay and will definitely stay here again when back in London!,5,2018,08,16
118,A hidden jewel,"We called in for an impromptu drink after escaping from the dire performance at the Bridge Theatre and we were just bowled over by the fabulous venue -  stylish, classy and faultless. We then met with friendly and helpful staff so we stayed for a drink -  or indeed two -  and enjoyed delicious Indian snacks with our cocktails. This is definitely the place I will stay when I am back in London. I can't remember when I was last so enthused by a place.",5,2018,08,16
118,Indian fine dining of great quality ,"This was a log due post. We bumped into this lovely individual, Chef Jomon at a supper club where he mentioned about the Baluchi @thelalitgroup of hotels in #london. I had seen a few fellow #foodbloggers post about this place, so I had it at the back of my mind. So when a friend from Amsterdam came visiting, we enquired with @chefjomon if we could book a table for the evening. What followed was a gastronomic journey of epic proportions. The Beree toophan is a drink to be savored so make sure you go slow on it. He then served us with one of the most delicious custom made platter of lamb chops, chicken, fish (panch pohran mahi tikka) and tofu we have tasted in a long time. If the starters were delicious, the mains were a notch above. Do not miss the Dal Baluchi. The butter chicken is one of the best you will have. The lamb shank gush taba left us licking our fingers. And the Awadhi chickenbbiryani from Lucknow reminded us of so many flavors which we have perhaps lost somewhere. The two desserts - paan ki kulfi and saffron infused compressed pineapple - disappeared as soon as they appeared. Sadly could only manage an Instagram story about them. And all this while @chefjomon and his team looked after us with great hospitality. We were even shown around the kitchen as they wrapped up for the night. If you need an exquisite fine dining experience this is one place you should definitely visit. Thank you chef for the amazing evening. Best wishes to you always. The entire hotel property is in a converted grammar school St. Olave‚Äôs. Many elements remind you of the old days here like the names - headmasters room, laboratories, teachers room. ",5,2018,08,15
118,Excellent Restaurant,"An  impromptu visit to the restaurant at Lalit for Indian cuisine turned out to be the best we have had lately. Be it efficiency or courtesies by  staff or Cocktails or the food, every preparation was excellent. our special thanks to Chef Joman and his team. Butter chicken he offered was most delicious. cocktail Headmaster and Red Velvet was amazing.",5,2018,08,13
118,Amazing Hotel,"This hotel was amazing. Went there over weekend for indian afternoon tea for our Anniversary. Was former grammar school turn in hotel now. Made us feel so welcome the moment we arrived and left with indian greeting (NAZ). The hotel had no car by let us park for free on in there courtyard. Would recommended the indian afternoon, as it different to all other english ones you get with sandwiches, scones and cake. This had indian food. Most important of all they asked if you want more food. Which was great
Never been asked that any place where I had afternoon tea, so that is plus point.
The food was amazing would not fault. The hotel staff was so welcoming.
Would stay at this hotel any time if had stay in London for something. So for I no faults would give more 5 star rating. I surely say you should try this hotel it is true Gemma.",5,2018,08,13
118,Great place for Indian fine dine,"Visited with family for dinner. Very impressive ambiance ..ordered some cocktails I think they can mix up some most amazing drinks ... then came the starters...presentation awesome with amazing flavours ..just too good... main meals superb lamb shanks, butter chicken n list is endless.. mention of daal Baluchi is must...desserts take the cake.. very creative with fusion desserts... great flavours. ... 
thank you to THE LALIT team..",5,2018,08,13
118,Excellent restaurant,"Although undergoing a slight refurbishment of which we were informed prior to arriving the service and authentic food was excellent and offered good value for money.
The staff have a  genuine desire to please and are very knowledgeable of the menu.
The ice cream is awesome.
Some customers have commented in regard to the refurbishment being undertaken on the flooring...this caused us no problem what so ever.
In summary..authentic food served by caring staff",5,2018,08,13
118,Good but not fantastic ,"My husband and I stayed one night in Lalit for a birthday getaway. The staff were welcoming and check in was excellent. 
We went to our room on the 3rd floor and all was quiet and we were very impressed. 
Once in our room there were a couple of problems. The bed is a standard double. We‚Äôre not particularly big people but we have a king at home so it was uncomfortable in a double. We didn‚Äôt sleep so well. 
Then in the bathroom the sink is tiny. You can‚Äôt brush your teeth without dripping toothpaste onto the floor. And washing hands makes a big mess. Also my husband is a huge coffee drinker and was disappointed in only 3 drinkable pods. He doesn‚Äôt like decaf. 
Apart from that the room was comfortable but to be honest a little underwhelming. 
All staff great though. 
We didn‚Äôt have breakfast so can‚Äôt comment on that. ",4,2018,08,13
118,Exceptional ,"Exceptional service and quality which exceeded our expectations. My wife and I stayed for 1 night on a Saturday. Rang ahead to enquire about parking and offered the opportunity of parking in their courtyard instead of the car park off site. This was offered as complimentary by concierge Fabrice. Greeted by concierge Tony who is a true professional and very experienced. He went out of his way to get to know our needs and purpose of our stay. Very relaxed check in which was an early check in at 12 noon. Again warmly welcomed and accommodated by the team. Tony took care of our bags whilst we checked in then escorted us to our room giving a tour of the hotel and brief history of building and the family who own it. Then orientated us to our room and facilities.
From the moment we arrived the atmosphere and decor of this hotel is exquisite. We have stayed in a number of 4 and 5 star hotels in London over the years and the quality of finish is excellent. Whilst unpacking we received a call and we're offered an upgrade to a senior classroom which we gratefully accepted. This room was fantastic and one of the largest when looking at the floor plans. 
The bathroom is on the smaller size in both the junior and senior classroom rooms with a single vanity and large shower enclosure. No bath however the shower was powerful and there was a smart toilet which I've not seen in the UK before. The robes and slipper and large bath towels all great quality. Hair towels supplied promptly on request. Great selection of toiletries already in the room including tooth brushes, combs etc. Normally these are on request in other hotels. TV large lcd/led. Complimentary snacks and drinks in room which is not normally the offer from other competitors. Comfy bed, sofa, table and chairs and desk in the large room which also had 15ft ceilings. The hotel has great character and the Asian decor complimented the historic building. The hotel felt calm and possibly not too busy however there are only 70 or so rooms. Did have the feel of a boutique country hotel in the heart of London's key areas. Great for London Bridge, Tower Bridge, Tower of London, The Shard, Borough Market, Tait Modern and Southbank areas. Great transport links only a short walk away and convenience stores such as Sainsbury's or Tesco a few minutes walk.
Unfortunately we didn't sample the restaurant as had made alternative arrangements however will at our next stay.
Continental breakfast was included in our room rate booked through an online hotel site. The dining room team were only too happy to bring this to our room again without tray charge. 
Overall this was a fantastic hotel with an  excellent team who made it a very personal and 5* experience. 

THANK YOU 

Highly recommended and when you take everything into account it was great value and worth the room rates we paid. We will visit again. ",5,2018,08,12
118,A weekend in London...,"Very nice hotel, a former school building! Very friendly and perfect service, perfect cleanliness, very tasty breakfast! The location of the hotel is very central just around the corner of Tower Bridge, every place around Tower and London Bridge can be reached by walking - perfect! And you always love coming back to your beautiful hotel..",5,2018,08,12
118,AMAZING!!!!,This hotel was amazing nothing was to much to ask ! They went above and beyond to make us welcome every minute any request wasn‚Äôt a problem either! Stayed there for my birthday and they really did make me feel special on my stay there! I wouldn‚Äôt fault them at all. Hotel was beautiful the rooms were modern and fresh and everything was clean! Really happy with our stay here and will definately recommend this hotel and revisit ! THANKYOU SO MUCH!,5,2018,08,12
118,"Quiet, clean hotel with class and care","Ice cold bottle of Pelligrino upon check in on a hot day,  sitting down in front of a dedicated check-in staff, no rush, with respect.  This hotel won my heart within the first 5 minutes.  The turn-in service at night was so good, they observed, and place the soft pillow on my side, the firm pillow on my husband‚Äôs side.  We hadn‚Äôt even slept in that bed yet, how did they know? Just amazing.  Every night I came back from dinner, there was a bottle of cold drink and a glass on my night stand, a pair of soft slippers at my bedside.  Those little things show they care, with classy touch throughout the decor, I am in love with this hotel.  The shower is also one of the best I‚Äôve seen.  Best two nights of stay in London!",5,2018,08,12
118,Wonderful stay,"The Hotel was absolutely wonderful. They let us check in early after a long red eye flight. Naz checked us in and upgraded us. He was so kind, gave us great recommendations for our trip and for the next leg of our trip to Amsterdam. The room was spacious, the bathroom is incredible. Our room was so quiet! We had very peaceful nights rest. The hotel is very close to borough market for a wonderful Saturday of taste testing delicious food and drinks. Would stay here again and recommend to friends.",5,2018,08,12
118,Anniversary ,"Fab.
Fabulous.
Uber fabulous.

Booked it for our wedding anniversary and wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Nazi Khan was the manager who met us, very attentive and professional. Building was originally a Grammar school until the 60s, and lay empty all alone slowly ignored and ignored next to Tower Bridge for decades. Then one day The Lalit Suri Hospitality Group came along and tuned it into an Indian theme contemporary British hotel. And voila. So they kept all the gorgeous Victorian building and fittings, sprinkled it with Indian art and culture and made something wonderful. Okay it isn‚Äôt cheap, but if you want cheap, go to some chain. Here you get a nice relaxed vibe, highly attentive and helpful staff, superb amenities, superb location, very good food and drink. If that‚Äôs not enough for you, frankly you aren‚Äôt going to like anything. Go give it a go. ",5,2018,08,11
118,Excellent Experience,"We were welcomed by Naz who greeted us at the reception and made the check-in process simple. He gave us a quick tour of the hotel giving us a bit of the history of the place. Naz was very kind and helpful, nothing was too big of an ask. The location of the hotel was also in a short walking distance to the train station. Our rooms were comfy and clean. The breakfast was great and the service top notch. They were on top of everything. Thanks for a great stay!",5,2018,08,09
118,Great hotel but not perfect ,"Second visit - we came across this hotel via our travel agent - it seems quiet and understated - rooms are simple but well appointed - due to location is is quite overlooked but it is London - however just a few yards away to have the Shard, Tower Bridge and Tower of London. Some great restaurants on the doorstep - staff are friendly - air conditioning was great - breakfast and bar overpriced - however is our second visit and hopefully not our last - it has charm! ",4,2018,08,05
118,Superb Coffee...,"We stopped here for a coffee. This old Victorian building used to be St. Olaves Grammar School for boys until it moved in the late 1960‚Äôs to Orpington in Kent. It is right at the end of Tooley Street on the corner of Tower Bridge. It has been refurbished and transformed into a 70 bed luxury hotel by the Indian Lalit family who also own 12 other hotels in India. We were shown one of the bedrooms which looks very well appointed and comfortable.
Here is a picture of the Headmasters room and a beautifully decorated elephant outside.",5,2018,08,04
118,1 night stay,"Good location, just a short walk from the tube. Beautiful building and welcoming staff on arrival. Our room was not ready at check in time, we were told it'd be half an hour but it was still not ready so in the end they moved us to another room to stop further delay. Good sized room and big bathroom with lovely toiletries but no hand towels? Bed was comfy. Came back to room after evening out and curtains had been closed and some lovely chocolates left on the bed. Breakfast was nice in the morning, buffet style. We timed it badly and all of the hot buffet food was gone, once pointed out to the waitress it was restocked after a short wait. Would use this hotel again.",4,2018,08,02
118,"wonderful location, right next to Tower Bridge....","wonderfully cool in peak summer temperatures :)  restful, quiet. comfortable bedroom; super Indian breakfast! Highly recommend the dosa :) ... super shower! Staff very helpful and friendly... a super place to stay.",5,2018,08,02
118,Fantastic 1 night stay,"My husband and I booked Lalit as a treat and we absolutely loved it. 

Naz checked us in, sat us down and we were given cucumber water (appreciated after a long walk on a very warm day). He talked us through the history of the hotel as he sorted out our room booking. 

We were in one of the senior classrooms and it was simply spectacular. Large, spacious, comfortable. The bathroom has heated towels and a large shower, the bed was a comfortable king size and we had a chaise in the room too. 

More impressive was when we returned to the hotel that night. All the curtains and blinds had been drawn, laundry was laid out and slippers at the side of the bed with a cool bottle of water. 

Little touches really made the hotel stay 5 star. We didn‚Äôt eat in the restaurant but the smells as we walked by were wonderful. Would absolutely stay here again. ",5,2018,08,01
118,Beautiful and blissful,The Lalit is an oasis in foreign land as it is a welcome sight to see the Ganpati idol in the hotel. Delicious cuisine is offered in the hotel. It is well maintained and clean. The staff is extremely friendly.,5,2018,08,01
118,Majestic Destination,"The Lalit London is situated in a pristine and serene location. The hotel offers a variety of options to the visitors, the large spread of menu, especially with the authentic and rich cuisine offered by Baluchi is marvellous. A touch of Indian culture in the land of the English is a great experience to be a part of. Tower Bridge is at a walking distance.",5,2018,07,31
118,Elegance Personified ,"The Lalit London lives up to the expectations of a five star luxury hotel. Set up in a picturesque location, the hotel has an unparalleled grandeur. Located in vicinity of the iconic Tower Bridge means you can enjoy a pleasant walk any time. The hotel has a majestic ambience, offers assorted delicacies, and the staff is always ready to cater to the needs. Mr.Joshi was especially cooperative, as he saw to it that I had a comfortable stay.",5,2018,07,31
118,Anniversary Trip,"Everything about our stay at Lalit was 5*. From the moment we arrived we were offered water and our luggage taken up to the room. The room was a senior classroom, spacious and luxurious with great touches like the free snacks and drinks and robes. The bed was very comfortable and the shower powerful and hot. The service throughout our stay was second to none and we hope to return soon. ",5,2018,07,30
118,A fabulous hotel with a picturesque architecture,"During my London visit I decided to stay at The Lalit, because I had heard a lot about this brand right from my days in India. The the place goes vis-a-vis the name.
Its a nice and beautiful building with a charm of the true British architecture with an Indian touch inside. The ambience and the feel of the place is really commendable.
The staff is polite with very and took care of us really well. The food at Baluchi is very delicious, and they have considerable amount of food options for vegetarians too. 
All in all I loved this property and would surely like to visit there again.

Thanks. :)",5,2018,07,28
118,One of the best properties in London.,"I stayed at Lalit London for 2 nights, Can't ask for more, Great ambiance, lovely Indian food. Service par excellence. In a foreign land if you can find a home away from home ..what better.

Thank you, team Lalit for the lovely hospitality...",5,2018,07,26
118,Product & Service Improvement needed and wouldn‚Äôt return.,"
Stayed at the hotel for two nights staff looked busy although it didn‚Äôt looked like a busy place, WiFi could be better, wardrobe space was less, AC wasn‚Äôt working at all, no hand towels. TV didn‚Äôt work.
Seemed like there was a change in management probably. Wouldn‚Äôt return as I pay higher price than Hilton but not worth the money as it‚Äôs not 5star at all.",1,2018,07,26
118,A fabulous hotel,"We booked this hotel initially as we were invited to a function there which subsequently changed venue. We are so very pleased to have not altered our accommodation as this hotel is amazing. We loved everything about it from the very warm welcome on arrival to our solicitous departure. We were very fortunate to be given a room upgrade on arrival which made our stay even more special. Our room was opulent, beautifully appointed and very comfortable. The fridge contents were complimentary. A few days before arrival I was asked by email whether we had any specific requirements- I requested lactose free milk - it was there waiting for us on arrival. I would absolutely recommend this hotel, we loved it! We had a view of the shard from our room and the hotel is a short stroll from Tower Bridge.",5,2018,07,24
118,An OK hotel - certainly not 5 star boutique!,"Cleanliness, food, room amenities, location are all fine. We booked the Lalit after staying in sister hotels in India. It's fine, it's ok but if you pay for 5 stars you expect a certain level of service. 

The hotel has had several changes in mgt since it opened and that showed. The overall quality of the service is not good enough. The impression is compounded for me because after 2 weeks I am still waiting for a reply to my feedback email. That sums the place up

No problems - we will use the Taj or the Oberoi when we visit India next. As for London, well it certainly won't be the Lalit.

Arrival

We booked a table in the restaurant in arrival. The restaurant had not been informed when we turned up for our meal.

Breakfast

We tried to order some Indian food. The waitress looked very doubtful and said ‚ÄúI will see what I can do‚Äù. She returned with an omelette.

Room

We paid for a junior classroom. The room was clean and well appointed. However room 009 is on the ground floor and the windows face to a public area. We had no privacy from deliveries, people walking into the adjacent apartments or from the staff having smoking breaks. It was awful and not the quality I would expect in a 5 star hotel. Using some simple voile or blinds could have improved the ambience. We had NO privacy.

We thought the free mini bar was a little on the sparse side when we arrived. We realised on the next day that it had not been stocked for our arrival.

The is nowhere to dry the towels during the day in the bathroom. This is fine if they are used once but in the heat of the heatwave we wanted several showers a day.

Night-time food

We arrived back at the hotel one night at 23:15.

I asked the Barman for a bar menu and was told that no food was served in the bar. I had to order room service and eat in my room. Granted the room had a small sofa and an even smaller table ‚Äì but where exactly do they expect guests to eat a meal in comfort? There are tables everywhere in the bar and restaurant. Any hotel that is resourced properly will serve late night food/snacks in a bar or restaurant irrespective of how many stars it has. We do not expect to eat our food in our bedroom.

Getting back to the room we found that the room service menu finished at 23:00. This was despite it promising elsewhere in the menu that your ‚Äúspecially curated Indian Selection in-room dining service was available any time, any hour‚Äù. If they mean that they were happy serving pizza, pasta, burgers, sandwiches in a dabba then I think that‚Äôs going to be interesting. 

I asked the night manager, Paolo, to clarify that in a fine dining, 5 star Indian boutique hotel the only food your Chef (!) could provide at 23:15 was pizza, pasta, burgers, sandwiches. He was as embarrassed as I was angry.

So, we ate popcorn, crisps and chocolate from the mini bar ‚Äì how delightful

We raised these problem at check out and were given a ¬£50 discount off our ¬£650 bill. The reason we raised the matter was primarily because we booked the hotel after enjoying 5 star service in New Delhi and Udaipur. We wanted the hotel to know that it could do better. The London hotel is no different from the multitude of bland hotels across London. 

The check out staff suggested next time we contact the hotel direct so we could be looked after. We do not expect treatment that is different to other guests, and besides I do not think that offer would correct the deficiencies I list above. 

We are easy going travellers and understand that sometimes mistakes happen. The reviews for the hotel are great ‚Äì It‚Äôs a good hotel for sure, but it is not a 5 star hotel.

We will be travelling to India next year and have decided to use the Taj or Oberoi or similar. I really think the Lalit needs to reconsider how they transfer the service from India to London as at present we think the London hotel underdelivers on its promises.",2,2018,07,24
118,When India meets the Empire ,"We liked the cool and stylish blend of Indian luxury and English post-industrial brickwork. Superbly decorated interior, so different from old style American 5 star chains. Service in this hotel is very friendly. 
Unfortunately, the floor of the restaurant which is situated in a fantastic ballroom-like hall is being  reconstructed during the whole summer, so we did not enjoy the     suposedly high class Indian cuisine.",5,2018,07,24
118,3rd stay,"The fact we have stayed here 3 times says it all. We really love this hotel, the service is excellent and the hotel and rooms spotless and stylish. My only complaint and I leave the same feedback every time, there are no hand towels in the bathrooms. It‚Äôs a pain when you have washed your hair. That said I can‚Äôt wait for my fourth visit.",5,2018,07,24
118,Wonderful location,The best aspect of this hotel is its location so near to Tower Bridge. The reception areas are well appointed and the members of staff greeting us were welcoming. Our room was one of the largest rooms on offer and was huge but very bare. The bed was comfortable and we slept well. The bathroom however was tiny and although the shower worked well there was no bath. The room could be overlooked from the rooms to the side and the opposite flats so there was no privacy unless the curtains were drawn.,4,2018,07,20
118,Why did I get the maid's room as a paying hotel guest?,"I liked the building, the wooden floor in the room. But frankly my room was ridiculously small and at not discount. So just bad luck to get this one. I have no problem paying if I get something in exchange, but this was not the case. Cupboard was for a kid, not possible to hang a shirt. Thanks got I could make it out of the bathroom without help.  LIMITED value for BIG money. Avoid or ask for surface of room",2,2018,07,18
118,Warm on the 3rd Floor,"This is a lovely hotel, in a great location with an excellent staff. The ""king"" bed was smaller than I was expecting, but that is my fault for thinking the US and UK use the same definition for ""king"". The weather was warm while we were in town and our room was on the 3rd floor. The AC in our room just could not keep up with the accumulated heat of the day on the top floor, so our room was warm, a little too warm all day and night. Another couple on our floor complained and were moved to a 2nd floor room. That isn't my style, but if 5 star hotels aren't going to be proactive in accommodating their guest I may have to adopt a squeaky wheel approach in the future. The staff had been made aware of my issues with the AC. If you are traveling in the summer, request a room on something other than the 3rd floor.",4,2018,07,16
118,"No closet, 1 person in the bathroom at a time",I don‚Äôt know what to say.  It was billed as 5 stars and I cannot even hang up my shirts - 20% of each shirt is puddling on the shelf below.  We can‚Äôt both fit in the bathroom at the same time - it is about the same size as the one on the cruise ship we just left.  There are larger rooms available but they won‚Äôt upgrade us.  Very disappointed- I would normally wait until we got home to post a review but I am too upset to wait.  It‚Äôs a beautiful building in a good location bit has been spoiled by this disappointing room and lack of accommodation.,2,2018,07,16
118,Not what I expected at all from a 5 star hotel,"We have stayed in many 5 star hotels in London including the boutique ones also, I had so many high expectations for our anniversary celebration and it just lacked the service, style, everything and felt staged!

I cannot fault the host but as soon as we got there (just before check in) we were told our room wasnt available, and he upgraded us to the suite - I know it was a nice gesture but I had heard this story on here several times and it seemed staged. The hotel was empty so this was not difficult but I appreciate it nonetheless and the wine and cake, but they got our years wrong and when wine was delivered to the room the staff just barged into our room straight after ringing the doorbell!

The room was spacious BUT lacked any soul, empty, souless and no character. The bathroom literally had a toilet, tiny sink area and a shower, thats it, no bath, in fact my bathroom at home is bigger. Quite shocking given the space. The room was really noisy, it was a suite but lacked anything suite like. I asked for ear plugs as I could hear everything felt like the window was open when it wasnt. They didnt have any ear plugs or cotton wool (staff at night were confused)

I was looking forward to cocktails on the terrace i was shocked to find it was a sheesha joint that attracted young clientele....why!?!? why does a 5 star place need to have sheesha?! it felt like you were on a cheap terrace on the edgware road. Ordered our cocktails, they came after 15/20mins, no nibbles or water like other 5 star joints. Cocktails were awful and we planned to stay there till our dinner reservation elsewhere.....the waiter lacked any enthusiasm and was yawning most of the time. We swiftly left and went to our fav bar - the Gong Bar at the Shard - yes cocktails are pricier but the service is second to none! - please I urge management to go and see how other bars are run!

Onto our night cap, we fancied a coffee and ice cream after our dinner - came back to a souless bar. Ordered ice cream - told they had no coconut so got a chocolate scoop, i dont even know what it was but it was not chocolate it was foul!

The breakfast was okay. I ordered the masala dosa and found it to be the best, hats off to that chef! but I had to ask the waitress 3 times to bring water! 4th time lucky.
We had 10% off at food outlets there, I told the breakfast waitress and she said she could not apply it to the bill and that she would (I told her we were leaving and she said she would do it asap) she didnt apply it.

I did not want to ruin my husband's stay by moaning there because it would have ruined our whole celebration so I did email the duty manager earlier this week and have had no response!

Clearly on great reviews are responded to.

I reckon this place will shut down as swiftly as it opened.",2,2018,07,13
118,Elegant Indian Hotel with British history,"What a fantastic hotel. From the moment we arrived to the second we left we were made to feel extremely welcomed by Naz üôèüèº.  We had one of the average rooms, a junior classroom I recall. And it was perfect for our one night stay. 
The bathroom was just lovely with a big shower. The bed was confortable and the room was equipped with modern technology including electric blackout blinds. We requested an iron and the staff arrived promptly with an iron and board. 
The room comes equipped with complimentary toiletries (including a toothbrush and paste which was great as I forgot mine!) soft drinks and a few snacks which were all complimentary and Naz made sure we were aware to enjoy and to help ourselves- which was very much appreciated after tackling London‚Äôs traffic to arrive at the hotel.  We ordered drinks from the bar for room service, I had a cocktail which was amazing. Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt have opportunity to eat in the restaurant which boasts fantastic Indian cuisine- next time!
The hotel building is stunning, an old grammar school- I don‚Äôt need to say anything more as the photos will speak a thousand words. The best hotel I have stayed in for service and feeling welcome, as well as the decor. An all round winner. I want to go back. Loved it. Thank you LaLit. ",5,2018,07,13
118,Nice hotel but service was lacking,"We stayed here 4 nights. Our room (senior classroom) was spacious with high ceiling. Overall, the hotel was very clean and quiet. The location is convenient for those wanting to visit Tower of London, Tower Bridge,HMS Belfast or other locations. The London Bridge tube station is a short walk away (5-10 min.)

Although we were happy w/ our room, there were some issues with the service. Our room wasn‚Äôt cleaned on two occasions when we returned to the hotel in the late afternoon. One time we didn‚Äôt get bath towels, and they were only delivered to our room after calling about it twice.
There were also a couple of more small issues (not enough coffee capsules and milk) that should have been taken care of automatically.

We enjoyed our stay, but our high expectations weren‚Äôt quite met.",3,2018,07,11
118,"Excellent Good, Great Ambience and Fantastic Chefs","Went for Sunday afternoon lunch and I am truly impressed with the Lunch menu. The menu had a theme based on school term times.

Very innovative and traditional Indian dishes, I was greeted by Chef Jomon who took excellent care of us.

They presented one of the finest Indian dishes, the quality and food quantity was mind blowing.

The food presentation was Michelin standard and the desserts were truly amazing.

Prices were fantastic, could hardly find any issues with this hotel. 

I would rate this hotel the same as Quilon restaurant in Taj Buckingham Gate.

Would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends.",5,2018,07,09
118,Service is lacking,Beautiful hotel. Nice staff but service was slow and lacking. Seemed as if all the staff are new and nervous. Not great for a hotel of this calibre. Plus ladies toilet was broken. Place was quite empty on Saturday night. Lacked atmosphere.,3,2018,07,09
118,Poor service. And manager was a liar ,"4th visit to the Lalit since visiting it in the opening week.  Today was the worst.  As we entered an empty Balluchi, we were told that a party of 2 in an empty restaurant, was not possible as they were fully booked.  We were ushered to the bar.  The bar man led us to the terrace through an empty restaurant. 

So... the terrace was all about shisha. They didn‚Äôt care we ordered a bottle of wine, food and had empty glasses for 15 mins.  The waiter even forgot our water,lemon and ice.  

I asked to speak to the supervisor / manager and no one appeared.  I had to go and visit the hotel part to have a junior who‚Äôs name began with W tell me he was sorry.  He came to the table where I pointed out the empty glasses.  He stared and it‚Äôs when I pointed out they were still empty and our wine was in the bucket, and I said if he could refill them, did he.  

We were sent a dish in error and the waiter asked us to try it.  It wasn‚Äôt what we wanted, so he sent the chef to us. We had to explain why we didn‚Äôt want the dish and the chef agreed with our opinion after our 4th visit and offered to send out a dessert.  Nothing turned up.

We asked for the bill and were surprised that the ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù we were offered hadn‚Äôt been applied and the waiter denied all knowledge of knowing.  When we paid and I saw the manager whose name began with W, said he asked for the waiter to apply a discount.  He was all talk and no action. 

This restaurant has lost its charm.  It‚Äôs a glorified shisha bar.  Women‚Äôs toilets are broken.  Service is poor and food is mediocre.  Management need to have more responsibility and take action for ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have enough staff today‚Äù. Perhaps this is why the lalit hasn‚Äôt done so well. 

",1,2018,07,07
118,Very special ,"I love this place 

It was an old school and has been beautifully converted into a boutique hotel only a few metres from the Thames 

Indian restaurant is very good and all rooms very individual 

No In house movies or gadgets but it‚Äôs a great place - it‚Äôs quiet and charming 

I‚Äôm coming again ...and again",4,2018,07,02
118,"Beautiful small hotel, great location","We stayed at this delightful property which is a renovated school called St. Olave's. It has been beautifully restored, so many interesting details starting from the chandeliers, woodwork on doors, ceiling and staircase have been kept intact. The room was beautifully decorated in pleasing colors, very luxurious bathroom and all amenities were top notch. Another great plus is that it is next to the waterfront, 2 minute walk to the promenade near London and Tower bridges. The food at Baluchi restaurant on the premises was tasty and innovative. It is walking distance from many other restaurants along the waterfront, close to tube and bus stations. ",5,2018,07,02
118,Great location recommended,This hotel is located in an old grammar school and has retained the school flavour with the naming of the rooms as classrooms. The outside is impressive and the interior fabulous. The dining room is particularly impressive. The location is great as the hotel is on Tooley street close to Tower Bridge.The hotel is part of a large Indian chain and when we stayed there they were only just getting their act together. Service at times could be a little intermittent and slow. At the price we payed for two nights this hotel was very good value for London.,4,2018,07,02
118,True 5 star hotel with exceptional service,"My husband and I stayed at the LaLit hotel for our wedding anniversary celebrations and the hotel went above and beyond for us. The room was beautiful with 5 star touches such as underfloor heating in the bathroom, complimentary mini bar and a whizzy electric toilet! 

Nav checked us in and when he learnt it was our anniversary he arranged a bottle of champagne in our room and when he came back from dinner there was a lovely cake waiting for us.

The staff are all incredibly professional, warm and welcoming making you feel very special. Breakfast was again superb and the hall is a stunning setting.

Thank you Nav and all the team for making our anniversary celebrations 5 star!",5,2018,06,27
118,Wonderful Anniversary weekend,"The hotel is really fantastic, the staff make you feel so welcome. The restaurant food is just amazing and the chef will make it to your requirements. As it was our anniversary they gave us an upgrade as well as a lovely cake brought to the room. We used the spa and the massages were very good and professionally done.
we are definitely visiting next year!!! Thanks very much to all the staff.",5,2018,06,25
118,Beautiful hotel but not up to 5 star level,"We were really excited to stay at this hotel. I'd seen it during its refurbishment/change to a hotel and had read the other reviews so thought it would be an excellent stay.  My husband emailed twice (with no reply) to request a nice room for our stay. Although many people commented on the lovely welcome we sadly had a disappointing check in experience which put us off for the rest of the stay.
On arrival we were barely greeted, and although it was a hot day were offered no drinks or refreshments as we checked in. We had booked a prestige room, and when we went up to the room were confused as to how it was considered prestige. It had a tiny bathroom and a hallway (rather than any usable space) a window onto the busy main road and a TV just sat on top of a pole with cables barely hidden. We went back to reception to ask to move to a quieter room (we could hear the buses idling outside the window) and were told they were fully booked. 

We then offered to move to a lower class room if it meant it would be quieter. However even though fully booked the hotel then found us another prestige room on the 4th floor. It had low ceilings (not ideal for my 6'4 husband) but it was quiet so we agreed to move to that room. However after about 20 minutes we realized there was no WiFi connection at all. As we were both working on part of the trip we called and asked for this to be looked into. Reception advised IT would help fix this, and when we heard nothing, I called back after 30 mins and was again told IT would be looking into. We were then told the WiFi did not work in this room and were offered another room to move to instead. This took almost an hour, so 2 hours after we arrived we were finally in a room without road noise and with working WiFi. 

We had planned to stay 4 nights but decided to check out after only one due to this experience. The Lalit charges 5 star prices, and yet seems to be missing the 5 star factor. The room we were moved to (a suite) had the same amount of furniture as the previous rooms and felt empty and cold. Again it had TV on a stick with visible cables. Considering the location, and the beauty of the building, its a shame that the most has not been made of the space to make it cosy and welcoming for guests.",3,2018,06,25
118,A wonderful Escape,"I love staying here, it's a tranquil place just outside of the City (and 5 minutes walk from my office), perfect for work travel.  the hotel rooms are lovely, no baths (at least not in the rooms I've stayed in), but the luxurious showers more than make up for it.  One slight frustration is the bar and restaurant prices are just a little bit too high for my liking; it is a luxurious hotel, so you'd probably expect to pay this.  Staff are always attentive and helpful and prepared to go the extra mile to make your stay perfect.  It really is my first choice hotel when I need to stay in London.  Every room I've stayed in is entirely different - the last one I walked into (a senior classroom) made me draw breath with a ""Wow"" as I walked in.",4,2018,06,25
118,Amazing service ,The service here is the best in a London. They go above and beyond. The staff are very professional and friendly. Great place on a balmy summers night to enjoy some cocktails and shisha outside. Will definitely be back. We had a fabulous time.  ,5,2018,06,24
118,One of the nicest places to stay in London.,"Nice hotel and value for money.
Exceeded our expectations.
Awesome rooms.
Rooms r big.
Amazing bathrooms.
Everything about the hotel is ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ.
Loved it.
I recommend this place to stay.

Thanx Nazrul for making our stay a memorable one.",5,2018,06,23
118,Perfect Place,"Amazing place, with excelent service, breakfast, room and so on. I would like to come back as soon as possibile not just for business travel. London is perfect if you can stay at Lalit Hotel. Enjoy!!!",4,2018,06,20
118,A good place to sleep - a great place to eat.,"The rooms and amenities are good. We imagine the expensive ones are superb - but we could only get into a standard room.  But - the curry was outstanding.  It is not a curry as we know it - but a wonderful experience that lasted over two hours, accompanied with the most fantastically paired wines.  Worth the visit just for this experience.",5,2018,06,20
118,"Good hotel, great staff","One of the challenges of trip advisor is it‚Äôs reasonably blunt scale - 5 star perfection or something less. This hotel is very good but it isn‚Äôt perfect - maybe 8.75/10. The staff are great - every staff member I encountered couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful, from the receptionist who helped me with somewhere to change to the concierge who literally sprinted off with my letter so that it would catch the last post. So 5 star staff without doubt.

The actual hotel is very good but not quite perfect. Firstly location - I stayed here as I was at a function in a nearby restaurant and a very early flight the next day so for that it was perfect but for tourists, who I would say are 90%+ of the guests, the location isn‚Äôt so great. Not that there is anything is wrong with it, it‚Äôs just there are better locations (west end, Kensington etc). Second the rooms - the room are spacious but, oddly, have no bath (or at least mine didn‚Äôt) and no sky sports on the TV. I was hoping to catch some cricket in the afternoon on the tv while working but couldn‚Äôt. Far from the end of the world but a minor irritation one wouldn‚Äôt expect when paying these prices. 

The Wi-fi is fast and free, the shower pressure is good. As other reviewers have noted they have Japanese style heated toilets which are a bit odd in a hotel that claims some green credentials but fine.

I would certainly stay here again for similar reasons or if I were visiting one of the large firms nearby and wanted something boutique style. Very good, but not perfect.",4,2018,06,15
118,Quite perfect in every way,"Lovely large room (216) with a comfy bed and good quality linen.  The staff are first class especially the doorman and ground floor staff. They could not do enough to help and with a genuine approach, sometimes lacking in 5 star hotels.  Great location two minutes away from Hays Galleria in London Bridge.  The building is lovely and has been converted sympathetically.  There are spa facilities but I didn't have time to use them or have breakfast.",5,2018,06,14
118,The BEST hotel I've ever stayed in,"This is hands down the best hotel I've ever stayed in..it really does stay true to its 5-star rating. My boyfriend and I were welcomed to the hotel by the incredibly friendly and professional staff who immediately helped us with our luggage and offered us drinks whilst we checked in. 
I had informed the hotel prior to our stay that it was my birthday and asked if we could have a room with a view of The Shard. They were more than happy to accommodate this and we were given a complimentary upgrade. I booked a Junior Classroom and we were given a LaLit Suite! The room was bright and spacious - it had all the little touches that make it super special (macaroons by the bed, complimentary mini-bar, robe and slippers) and we were even given a bottle of prosecco! We went out into the city during the day and they had come into the room and put a birthday cake in for when we returned; it was a truly lovely touch.
The shower was also amazing - I could not fault the room at all.
The staff were friendly and welcoming; everyone was absolutely fantastic. 
I could not recommend this hotel more. The location is ideal, placed right next to London Bridge station and overlooks The Shard.
If you're looking for somewhere a bit special whilst exploring London, then definitely book The LaLit. You will not regret it. I will be returning!",5,2018,06,11
118,Very Impressive,"This is a stunning conversion of a Victorian school building in to a fabulous hotel. We stayed in a Senior School room (105) which was a reasonable sized room with very high ceilings. The window was comparatively small and hada view on to the rear courtyard which isn't exciting, but window and view aside the room was very nice. The bed was very comfortable and there was complimentary fridge with some Coke, tonic water and water together with a few snacks and some chocolate which was a nice touch. Also tea and coffee making material provided. The bathroom was smallish but had a large ""wet room"" type shower which had reasonable water pressure - although I prefer a bath which are getting rarer in London hotels! The bathroom had heated black and white tiled floor and a loo with built in ""washer"" function and heated seat which was a novelty!!
The service everywhere in the hotel was impeccable - all staff extraordinarily polite! The Teachers Room bar and Headmasters lounge are small but comfortable spaces, although the bar prices are a little eye-watering!
The restaurant in the Great Hall is stunning with the Gallery above giving great views of the space. We didn't eat here, but the two or three occupied tables did look a little lost in this vast space.
All in all this was a very pleasant stay, although with no parking on site and no valet option coming by car (which we did) is a bit of a pain and involves a 10 minute walk with bags to the nearest public car park. If they could sort out a valet parking service this would be an ideal London hotel with its great location right by Tower Bridge. Would stayagain but would try to come by cab!!",5,2018,06,11
118,Stunning Hotel,"A beautiful hotel, ideally located for a visit to The Shard. The staff are very welcoming and nothing is too much trouble. Naz took time with us to explain the history of the building and treated us like VIP's.
The rooms are beautifully decorated and are spacious and well equipped.
We ate in the restaurant in the evening, the Indian cuisine was sublime. Thank you to Chef Joe 
We will definitely visit again",5,2018,06,11
118,Beautiful Hotel and great staff,"The hotel is adorable! The staff was very kind and allowed us to check in early which I was beyond thankful for since we had minimum sleep due to overnight flight and time change. Very close to the London Tower Bridge. Be prepared to travel when checking out other locations. Using Uber we spent on average 15-20 pounds for one way to see other locations. The Ivy was a great restaurant that you can walk to by the tower bridge. Other than that, the London eye, Westminster Abbey, Chelsea, Buckingham palace are all too far to walk personally to us.  Overall great experience and gorgeous!",5,2018,06,04
118,Excellent local to stay in London,"Superb, stuff helpful and very friendly.
A special word for the excellent work of Mr. Shola.
Near to the tube and a lot of good restaurants.
The room was superb, very quiet.
an excelent choice between confort and price",5,2018,06,04
118,School of thought,It was my wife's birthday and she wanted to see a performance at the Bridge theatre. The Lalit is 2 mins away and was perfect in every detail. The day was hot and we were welcomed with a smile and a cold glass of water as we checked in. We loved our stay as the staff were brilliant and all were schooled for thought. Thank you,5,2018,06,04
118,Southbank London discovery,"The Lalit is an amazing, beautiful restored building near the river and great Southbank neighborhoods and features like Borough Market. The service was variable--some staff were excellent, others seemed poorly trained and clueless. A highlight of the hotel is it's restaurant, featuring Indian cuisine and a twist on English High Tea dubbed High Chai. The hotel chain highlights it's commitments to diversity and inclusiveness but there were some lapses",5,2018,06,02
118,Peaceful island in the sea of London noise and stress.,"My partner and I stayed over the bank holiday weekend for 2 nights in order to watch rugby at Twickenham.  The hotel is beautifully designed, perfectly combining modern Indian design to an old grammar school in central London.  The room was comfortable, clean, quiet and well equipped, I slept well and woke up refreshed.  The bar is sleek and the cocktails well thought out.  Unfortunately we didn't eat in the restaurant however I will when we go back.  The key area of success is the staff, the true mark of a good hotel is the people who work there.  The staff are certainly the greatest asset of this hotel.  I am not a great lover of London but the Lalit made the stay a pleasure, a peaceful corner that I would recommend to anyone.",5,2018,05,29
118,Great place to stay,"I frequently stay in London since 25 years and this was one of the best hotels I have been so far. The room was pretty spacious and it contained a free minibar with some snacks, soft drinks & of course a tea and coffee maker. In the evening you get a little goody.
The hotel just opened in 2017 and you can see the Indian influence starting from the doorman to the interior of the rooms and hallways. The staff was very polite and friendly at all times. 
As I stayed there during my birthday I got a pretty large birthday cake even without mentioning my birthday at the front desk.
The surrouding area of the hotel is also great with lot's of restaurants and the river Thames nearby. Less than 5 minutes walkway to the Tower Bridge or London Bridge Station.
There are many expensive hotels in London which aren't worth the money. The LaLit isn't the cheapeast but worth the money you spend. So I strongly recommend it.",5,2018,05,28
118,"Amazing hotel, food, cocktails and staff!","Thoroughly enjoyed it! 1st class all the way! Would highly recommend! The staff were fantastic, the massage was unbelievable and the food and cocktails were spot on. Definitely one to recommend. Loving the theme too! ",5,2018,05,19
118,Outstanding ,"We could not have prepared ourselves for the amount of love and care shown by the fantastic staff at The Lalit. We stayed for one night to celebrate a special occasion and were made to feel truly spoilt. From gifts (a delicious fresh cake, flowers, bubbly and chocolates!) in the room to exceptional service and friendliness around the hotel, I can not recommend this place enough. Delicious breakfast, we slept soundly, generous complimentary snacks and a room with a view that fulfilled our every need and more. Thank you to all the staff we met at The Lalit, you made our special occasion more special than we could ever have hoped. ",5,2018,05,18
118,Your hapiness is their motto,"I found the room through Booking.com, (which I'll never use again byt he way), and had no specific expectation. But the hotem looked like a castle in the middle of London and it was cool.
The staff is amazingly careful at providing you a great experience and make sure you have a memorable time in the place.
Of course all the 5* boxes are ticked and even more, (very speedy Wi-Fi).
The original room I was given had some limitations, but following a quick talk I got a new one that brought me to another planet.
The diner room is worth the look, as also at least a breakfast.
All in all a great experience, not only the hotel as also the people",5,2018,05,18
118,In view of all the positive reviews we were disappointed,"Found the room very average and rather small. No bath
Biggest issue was the noise outside our room from 6 am onwards of wheelie rubbish bins being pushed around plus conversations taking place and then at 7 am a bottle collection or the emptying of a bin containing bottles took place - certainly no consideration here for the guests
Great food in the restaurant but service rather poor",3,2018,05,16
118,Great service and a beautiful hotel,"I chose the Lalit as an alternative to the Hilton close by due to better price. This was really a positive experience.Very polite and welcoming staff throughout my one night and morning there. Very nice to find such a charming hotell ans transformed old school. I had a standard room, with complimentary mini bar and coffee machine, and a very well-equipped bathroom. Bed was nice, with selection between soft and hard pillows. Only thing I missed was a working table or at least a chair, as I had to work some hours in the room during my stay - working from the bed is not optimal. Breakfast was good, but next time I will choose anything else than the Full English, which was nothing special. Very quiet and nice hotel close to all the restaurants and cafes in the Tower Bridge area.",5,2018,05,16
118,"Prestige, class and elegance","When I walked into the venue I was amazed by the decor and the well presented staff.
The food was presented beautifully and tasted very nice indeed. The flavours of the wraps and chutneys were lovely.
Chai was served in lovely small glass cups which brought back memories. 
The drinks menu has a vast range of cocktails which were gorgeous.
Whilst sitting and enjoying our tea we admired the high ceilings, the prestige and we actually felt as if we had gone back in time - the Victorian era.

The experience is worth every penny",4,2018,05,15
118,Amazing food ,"My wife and I visited the Lalit restaurant as non residents and had the most amazing meal. It was our first experience of Indian fine dining and very different to our usual trip to the local Indian restaurant. The food, service and surroundings were really exceptional and we are looking to returning soon. We met Jomon, the Chef de Cuisine, who‚Äôs enthusiasm and professionalism were contagious. We‚Äôll be back soon. ",5,2018,05,13
118,Great location and a real focus on hospitality,My second stay and a real effort on making your stay a pleasant one. Certainly not cheap and you need to watch the drinks prices (¬£20 for a gin and tonic by the time obligatory service charge added) but overall given location and quality of the hotel it's a place I will come back to.,4,2018,05,12
118,Amazing boutique hotel,"We had a wonderful stay, our room was top class (we stayed for seven nights), the service was excellent, all the staff were friendly and accommodating, and an absolutely brilliant location.  Couldn't have asked for anything better.  Namaste ",5,2018,05,10
118,2 Day stay,"Had a great stay in Lalit London.  It was a close walk to London Bridge station, situated just off Tower Bridge, so a nice walk by night. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the hotel itself looked great. Definitely would stay again and recommend to others",5,2018,05,10
118,A magical place in the middle of a busy city,"The Lalit, based in a beautiful building once a boys grammar school, has been skilfully converted to a luxury hotel.     Elegant, stylish bedrooms in an Asian theme with many extra touches provide a wonderful haven in a busy City.

The staff deserve special mention from the Concierge to the Management they were a fantastic team of welcoming, helpful colleagues who could not have done more for us.

Highly recommended.",5,2018,05,04
118,Excellent service and great rooms,Really enjoyable stay. Rooms were very well equipped and decor was subtle but fitted well with the hotel. Staff were extremely helpful. Location is excellent in that it is very close to the Tower and London Bridge. Overall would definitely recommend for a great stay in town.,5,2018,05,03
118,Beauty of a hotel,After an inauspicious start where it took 5 mins to find our reservation - we LOVED the hotel. Their apology was to provide a free upgrade which was so kind of them and the room was a wow! Bright and clean and comfortable. The staff were - without exception- friendly and polite. Lovely location and a cracking base for London breaks,5,2018,05,02
118,Wonderful hotel!,"My husband and I stayed overnight here when we visited London and it was absolutely wonderful. The hotel really went above and beyond what we expected, we even got a bottle of fizz, chocolates and a birthday cake for my husband, which was a lovely surprise! We stayed in a senior class room which was very spacious for a London hotel room, and the bed was so comfy! The staff even remembered we had been to show and asked how it was on checkout. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel it's perfect.",5,2018,05,01
118,Excellent Service,"Except the transport company they have, everything else was managed very well. Staff is very friendly and supporting. Very conveniently located property, easier to go a different part of the city. 
If you choose their transport services (airport transfer), make sure that you add buffer time which you might need at the airport for immigration or customs otherwise, you might be charge the parking fees. (Very disappointing, apparently, the company which provide that service is not part of the Lalit group)  ",4,2018,04,29
118,top location,"Excellent Location near Tower Bridge; old converted school building, very charming, very Special, totally different to the design of the larger hotel spaces. cool Restaurant breakfast space in super-high assembly hall. great value for your money",5,2018,04,29
118,Business was pleasure,"I was staying at the Lalit for work which is a lovely experience anyway, but I had the luck and privilege to be upgraded and experienced the best room I‚Äôve ever stayed in. The service was incredible, as was the room and I didn‚Äôt want to check out!",5,2018,04,27
118,Excellent services,"Attended for a birthday dinner. The food was superb, the chef recommended dishes especially for members of the group who were vegan. The staff were very attentive and friendly. We all loved it and will be back. ",5,2018,04,25
118,Beautiful building brought back to life,"Really liked this hotel ,the decor is elegant and stylish....so nice that they have complimented the existing old surroundings with just a touch of Indian sophisticated glamour!
Rooms are perfectly decorated,furnished and with everything one could need.
Hotel is in the Tower Bridge area of London which looks like there has been some Redevelopment going on so now a nice area to walk to the tube station.All good üòä",5,2018,04,20
118,Overnight stay for the Shard,"We wanted to find a convenient location for a trip to London, especially for the Shard and Tower Bridge. Staff were unfailingly polite and helpful. Our room was excellent and it was helpful to be able to check in before the stated time",5,2018,04,18
118,Wow!,"This is an amazing hotel, fantastic attentive service from the staff. Beautiful rooms with every amenity and product you can imagine - and some you couldn‚Äôt imagine (the automatic bidet). Minibars are free and restocked daily, there is a free mobile phone for use during your stay, the shower is great, I could go on..... the restaurant is also very special, modern Indian dishes are served by attentive staff. The breakfast is beautifully cooked too.",5,2018,04,17
118,Beautiful and great welcome,"Stayed for one night as close to work. The building is beautiful and the decor stunning. It even smells great- fresh flowers all over. Check in a pleasure- sat down with a glass of water and my bag made it to my room before me. Good selection of items in the fridge too. Security good- which is important.  Yes the room is small ( so are most in London) the textiles are beautiful and the bathroom perfectly formed. I needed an iron and ironing board and it arrived within a few minutes. Why not  five stars- well there is nowhere to hang up a coat, the wardrobe is small and you cannot hang anything longer than a blouse and even then it's a push not ideal for business travellers. The welcome is warm and beds are very  comfy.  Looking forward to my next stay. ",4,2018,04,13
118,Excellent!,This hotel was fantastic - I would definitely recommend! First of all the location is right in the centre of London and very easy to get to. The exterior of the hotel is stunning and upon arrival we were greeted with very friendly staff who quickly took our bags to our room and efficiently checked us in. The interior of the hotel and the rooms were also amazing. Breakfast in the morning was excellent also. Overall a fantastic experience and I will most likely be returning to the hotel. ,5,2018,04,13
118,Great stylish hotel with patchy service,"We loved our room, the dinner, the restaurant in an old assembly hall.
It could have been a perfect 2 nights, if the billing procedure had been OK. We opted for the breakfast and a dinner package, only to find out that a) nobody knew about the dinner package and we were billed twice for our dinner, b) breakfast is more expensive when booked online than it actually is sur place. a) can happen, but it took them 20 minutes and 2 people and a lot of mistrust to remove the 90 pounds from the bill. ",4,2018,04,11
118,Fantastic Hotel with Brilliant service from Hotel Staff!!,"Magnificent Hotel with lovely staff who helped organise the perfect evening to propose to my GF. My now fiancee very much enjoyed the evening and was impressed with the warm and personal welcoming.

I was very privileged to have the help of The Security Manager - Mark Jacob who organised the proposal perfectly. He also informed all members of staff to play along with the surprise proposal. Kristina was another member of staff at the Hotel who went that extra mile to assure there were no flaws in the plan.

The Food was remarkable and the Senior Suit Classroom was fantastic! 

I would recommend this Hotel to anyone.",5,2018,04,09
118,Nice atmosphere,Me and my wife stayed at the Lalit from the 6th. - 8th of April. It was our first time at this hotel.The hotel is quite new . As far as I understood it is an old boy school building. Charming and very delicate building and rooms all over. Well equipped. Quite and calm atmosphere. Nice breakfast with a lot of chioces. We had dinner the first evening at the hotel. My wife had vegetarian tasting menu which did not impress her. My lamb was very good. Very nice staff. We had hotel arranged transport from and to Heathrow. On our way back the transport showed up 10 minutes late. The situation of the hotel is a bit outside Londons core center. We walked by the Thames in to Covent Garden. Nice if the weather is good and you are able to walk an hour. We also walked back on the other side of the road. Nice experience. If u are not able to walk I guess taxi and tube is the right thing.  ,4,2018,04,09
118,Full of character with good hospitality,"A charming and characterful hotel offering good hospitality and well-located near London Bridge for trips in and around the City and the West End. We occupied one of their smaller rooms for one night and found it perfectly fine. Especially good were the wonderfully comfortable bed and the underfloor heating in the bathroom. We didn‚Äôt have a view, but the room was not gloomy. We had an excellent sleep and recommend the hotel. (We didn‚Äôt have breakfast so Can‚Äôt comment on that, but we did eat lunch at the Baluchi restaurant, the subject of a separate review)",4,2018,04,07
118,Wine and bread tasting!,"Amazing naan bread and wine matching experience as the Lalit London. Very nice atmosphere, friendly staff and service. Reasonably priced. Recommended for dating :) Knowledgable staff and enjoyed the recommendations made on the wine selection.",5,2018,04,02
118,Amazing!,"My hubby and I recently stayed at this hotel for our last 3 nights in London. Right from the moment we pulled up we knew we made the right choice. The decor is very posh and ornate...and the service was impeccable! There isn‚Äôt a true check in desk but a small room off to the side where we were immediately taken care of. Our room was very large, quiet and well appointed. We had drinks at the Teachers Lounge a few times as well as supper one night at the Indian food restaurant.  I had been craving butter chicken and wow, this restaurant did not disappoint. The naan bread was the best I think we have ever had. You can‚Äôt help but stare up at the amazing ceiling in the restaurant and the blue chandeliers. This hotel is perfectly located within walking distance to the Thames river, tower bridge and several great restaurants.  We would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2018,04,01
118,A true London bolthole,This is a beautiful building with individual rooms and impeccable service. I am sure that Lalit Suri would have been been proud of this great hotel - the first outside of India. Of course you could pay a few pounds less and stay in a soulless chain...but why do that when you can stay at the Lalit London. Its only a few hundred yards from Tower Bridge and the Shard. Only stayed one night but that convinced me of their ideals. Fantastic breakfast as well. Highly recommended.,5,2018,03,31
118,Incredible stay,"I decided to book last minute as a surprise for my wife and we were both pleasantly surprised by how good this hotel was. The room, service and staff were all brilliant and will definitely be back for another visit. Cant recommend highly enough, really made our weekend!",5,2018,03,27
118,Romantic Again,"The Lalit is an amazing hotel in a wonderfully fun area of London. It is comfortable, beautiful and friendly and so close to the Tower of London, the Tower Bridge and the Royal Jewels. We hope to visit you again one day!",5,2018,03,27
118,Great Hotel,"The Lalit is an old school building TURNED INTO THE MOST DELIGHTFUL HOTEL on the banks of the Thames. Short distance to walk to London Bridge/The Tower of London and the Shard. Rooms were of the top notch with heated bathroom floors, free minibar. best bed we slept in on the whole trip. Staff was awesome and very helpful finding us the best Thai restaurant in london......... will visit again in May but book direct rather than agoda as I thought breakfast was included which is wasnt !!!!!!",5,2018,03,21
118,"Great, elegant, personal","I had a great stay at the LaLit. Shola and his team were very friendly, attentive, and responsive. The room was unique and elegant and room service was reasonable and tasty. My only qualm was that the service in the restaurant itself did not meet the standards of the hotel overall.",5,2018,03,20
118,Lovely stay,"A delightful hotel, the best we have stayed in by far in London. Good size room, very quiet and a large comfy bed. I only have trivial things to grumble about. No hand towel in the bathroom just a bath towel, flannels and bath robe meant wrapping hair after a shower at bit difficult. Also no obvious bottle opener even though tonic water was provided in the mini fridge. Everything else was lovely.",5,2018,03,19
118,Great stay!!,"An amazing hotel could not fault it at all ! Would highly recommend this hotel. What great character this building has. The staff were very friendly aswell and could not of been more helpful. Location was excellent aswell, close to London Bridge station and London borough market.",5,2018,03,08
118,"Heart warming 5 star experience in the middle of biting, dreary English winter","The Hotel is a complete haven. The hospitality, care, genuine concern and the warmth of food and care - sum up my experience at the Lalit. I managed to meet with an accident and had 8 stitches on my knee at the start of the trip. The hotel staff took great care of me - from the ice packs to holding my hand and walking with me to the taxis in the bitter wintery cold... they did it all to ensure i felt cared for even when i was miles away from home. The food is delicious and the place is super clean with a touch of Indian culture that is heart warming.",5,2018,03,05
118,Quiet and comfortable luxury,"I stayed for just two nights at the Lalit, but I loved it. It's a wonderful old building in a convenient corner of London. Though it's on a somewhat busy road, there's little noise in the hotel making it easy to relax.

The room was amazingly comfortable with an enormous bathroom. Next time I'd avoid a ground floor room (my view looked out on a parking area for delivery trucks), but that's a small complaint. The service is amazing, as well, and both the bar and restaurant are excellent.",5,2018,03,04
118,A great boutique of tranquility & taste in the heart of London ,"Great location right behind London Bridge, a 10min walk to the underground Stn.

A stunning property that is decadent, elegant & refined.

Vlad the concierge was an outstanding advocate of the service levels the Lalit chain is well renown for. Showing us around the property & its heritage.

The food quality in the dining establishment was of a high standard and bar menu snacks would have us returning soon. The CMD - Mr Lalit Suri loved his sugar-free Ras Malai and we certainly now know why, it was sublime. 

The rooms are outstanding, especially the bathrooms with ornate traditional showers, heated floor tiles and the latest Japanese bidet toilets. 

The Legacy suite is the old headmasters room and it certainly has a regal appearance with wood panelled walls. My advice is go for rooms on the third floor with extra height ceilings. 

If you like luxury but want to some tranquility in London, the Lalit is the perfect find. ",5,2018,02,25
118,"Great place, superb service ",Great hotel. Every thing exceeds expectation. Restaurant very very good. Cocktails bar great. Rooms new and comfortable. Loads of little extra touches that make a big difference. But the service from all staff is exceptional. Highly recommended ,5,2018,02,24
118,Full of character,"Everything about this small hotel reeks of good taste. The beautiful old building is framed behind by the steel and glass architecture of 21st century London. The grounds, with interesting statues, are very well tended, and the whole exterior is lit wonderfully after dark. The interior is no less impressive, with the most stunning room being the Great Hall. I cannot praise the staff highly enough. Every one of them I met was eager to be of service, and regularly I found my needs being anticipated. Our room definitely had a feeling of luxury, with a very comfortable bed covered in fine linen, all the amenities I could ask for, and even a heated toilet /bidet. My only criticism was that the bathrobes had been over dried, so that they were hard instead of being fluffy and soft. Breakfast in the Great Hall was spent gazing at the decoration of that room. The fare itself was fresh, and there was an extensive range from which to choose. I gauge hotels by the quality of their fruit juice, and the Lalit's was freshly squeezed, and chilled to perfection.",5,2018,02,22
118,A beautiful quiet hotel in an amazing building,"I had a 1st floor room - no view but fabulous high ceilings and great sized rooms. The bathroom had a heated floor and heated toilet seat. Lots of space for makeup but could do with a lot makeup mirror. The quality of the shower fixtures were very high. I would say that the inside of the shower could do with a better handle because it is quiet easy to get ‚Äòstuck‚Äô inside because the seal around the door is really good preventing the water getting into the rest of the bathroom. 
The bed was comfortable, had a choice of pillows and also a sofa. TV felt a little small for the size of the walls!
The only other little niggle was the brightness of the bar lighting. Thy need a dimmer switch!!",4,2018,02,22
118,My Old School has been converted into a Amazing Boutique Hotel,"The Building located in Tooley St. built in 1893, was originally my old school, St Olave's and St Saviour's Grammar School for Boys. The school was moved to Orpington in 1968. The building remained empty for some time but now has been converted into a Boutique Hotel, The Lalit London Hotel. I have visited the hotel three times, once for Afternoon Tea, the second time for drinks with a number of ex school friends and the last to stay overnight. The building is listed so the exterior of the building has remained virtually unchanged and the interior has been tastefully transformed, leaving most of the existing features unchanged like the main Assembly Hall which is now the Restaurant with the original Gallery. The Hotel is Indian owned and has been beautifully designed and decorated with an Indian theme. The staff are extremely attentive and knowledgeable. The Restaurant provides Indian themed food and staff are eager to assist with food selection for those who require help in making their choice. The menu is very varied and vegetarian options are especially catered for. Our meal there was superb. The rooms are very comfortable, well equipped and tastefully decorated. The location is ideal for visitors to London with easy access to many attractions and transportation",5,2018,02,19
118,A night of luxury,"Located right next to Tower Bridge so not in the hustle & bustle of the city but within easy reach of all forms of transport. Staff were all very attentive, helpful and polite. Nothing was too much trouble.",5,2018,02,15
118,Luxury and so close to the action,"We spent four days at the Lalit after a tour of Iceland, we were after a bit of pampering before taking the long flight home. The Lalit provided the goods, The service is totally on point, it was a quiet time for the hotel and we felt like everyone was working to make our stay perfect. The rooms are comfortably sized and all amenities of a high standard. The free mini bar was a nice touch...the tonic water was very tasty. We enjoyed the bar most days and the cocktail list is inventive!  We ate at the in house restaurant one night and the food was excellent, once again with very professional service. The room that is the dining room is amazing and worth the visit to take it in.The position is excellent, close to the river, close to the Shard, close to Borough markets and close to tube.  

The effort expended to make this former boarding school into a luxury hotel must be applauded.",5,2018,02,04
118,Old School,"My old school has been turned into a hotel with a delightful flavour of India.  They've done a beautiful job, keeping the best of the school features while adding wonderful Indian embellishments.  The Balruchi restaurant meals were superb.",5,2018,02,01
118,Exquisite Boutique Hotel - Amazing Attention to Detail,"This is a stunning property! Built upon the estwhile St. Olave school, this new boutique hotel has retained as much of the old heritage building as possible. The rooms have names synonymous to classrooms (Junior, Senior), the bar has been named Headmaster's Room and so on. Sparkling checkered black and white marble, plush carpets and rugs, beautiful broad stairway, cozy rooms and incredible eye to detail. For example, the rooms have automatic/electronic blind systems, the bathroom floor is heated, the commode seat is eletrically heated, the shower has no visible drain yet the water disappears, dental kit, comb and other small amenities available in the bathroom, evening turn down service with gourmet chocolates placed on your bed, free minibar and unlimited sparking water. Breakfast at Baluchi is most wonderful and all staff including those who aren't Indian greet you with a very warm Namaskar! 

Even though room rates are on the higher side, the extra touch and additional features more than makes up for it!",5,2018,01,31
118,A pleasant Surprise,"Beautiful building and decor; great history and very attentive staff.

I will definitely stay again when work permits.

The main restaurant is worth visiting for just to look at by itself.

The rooms are well designed and well appointed and the bathroom, so often neglected was first rate.",5,2018,01,29
118,A weekend in London,"My wife and I stayed at the LaLit for a weekend break in London. This was our first stay at the LaLit but we had been for afternoon tea last year so we had some idea of what to expect. The staff are very attentive and helpful, and the guest rooms are very well appointed. We enjoyed cocktails in the Headmasters Study and an excellent lamb biryani in the Great Hall restaurant. The room rates are on the high side and the location is not central although some tourist attractions (Tower Bridge, The Tower of London and HMS Belfast) are within easy walking distance. If you're looking for a high quality London hotel with an asian twist then the LaLit is it!",5,2018,01,26
118,Special birthday treat,"This was my old school, so my children thought an overnight stay with evening meal in this beautiful building would make an ideal surprise present. Fabulous building and wonderful attention to detail.  Staff were very attentive and made us feel so welcome. Location is very good for visiting local sites by foot.  Overall a wonderful experience - and the food was much better than when I was a St. Olaves school boy!",5,2018,01,25
118,Lalit London Jan trip,Relaxing stay at a quiet relatively new hotel close to Borough Market and More London.  Great service and well appointed rooms. Attentive staff who can‚Äôt do enough for you. Cozy bar. Great Indian cuisine in their spectacular Great Hall restaurant. ,4,2018,01,23
118,Luxury with style in a great location,"The Lalit is a hotel of great character in a perfect location for exploring the City or the South Bank. Housed in an imposing Victorian building that used to be St. Olave's Grammar School until 1967, it has been beautifully refurbished with a touch of India and a great deal of sympathy for its original architecture. The rooms are extremely well appointed. Ours had a great view of the Shard. The staff are friendly and helpful. It was my wife's birthday and unsolicited they provided a cake for her in the room. Breakfast was very good: a well provided buffet in the magnificent Baluchi dining hall, with eggs and other dishes made to order. All in all, a great place for a special occasion.",5,2018,01,22
118,A great week!!,"We just finished spending a week in London and this time we strayed from our usual default of a chain hotel, choosing the Lalit and we were most certainly NOT disappointed! 

Having spent a lot of time in London we have become accustomed to smaller rooms here but our room at the Lalit was surprisingly nice and comfortable. The staff from the front door (actually especially the front door) to the reception and lounge were all great! The property is well kept and has a great feel of elegance and warmth!
",5,2018,01,21
118,Good for business,"Generally a great boutique hotel 
Ideally located for tower bridge and the surrounding area.  Quite location south of the river but not that easy to get to unless you take a taxi   Staff are attentive and overal service was great. ",4,2018,01,20
118,An amazing stay,"The history of this building alone makes a stay worthwhile.  It was previously a boys' grammar school for many years, which my husband attended in the 1960's.  The building dates back over 400 years, before Tower Bridge (which is alongside) was even built!  The guest rooms are the original classrooms, and the beautiful dining hall was formerly the school hall.  The original parquet flooring has painstakingly been taken up during restoration, and replaced.  The decor is strong and luxurious, the staff are very helpful and friendly.  However, be warned, the prices are definitely 5*! ",5,2018,01,20
118,"Great, but unknown, boutique hotel","The property was outstanding and in an excellent location next to Tower Bridge. However, most taxi drivers won't know where it is.  The interior of the hotel was lovely, especially the restaurant and bar area.

The food is very good -- but the focus is on Indian cuisine.  Fortunately, there are many good restaurants nearby that offer other options.

The room was very nice and the bathroom was spacious. However, as a woman, the bathroom was not conducive for getting ready in the morning. As with most hotels in the UK, there are no outlets for hair dryers and no obvious area in the room to dry or style your hair. The bathroom lighting is also too dim and applying make up is difficult.

I definitely recommend the hotel because of its location, friendly staff and the beauty of the property.  If they would just make the bathrooms more female-friendly -- it would be perfect!",4,2018,01,19
118,Too short but sweet,"Fantastic location adjacent to London Bridge and the Thames.
The staff deliver an exceptional level of service.
Had to leave earlier than expected tragically as my partner was unwell.
We would definitely return as long as the elephant in the parking lot isn't hogging my space! ",5,2018,01,18
118,Best hotel in London Bridge!,"I stay in London Bridge regularly for work and this was by far the best hotel I have stayed in within the area!

My room was upgraded (which was a bonus) and the high ceilings along with heated bathroom floors, robes and fluffy slippers made the experience feel luxurious. Will be back again!",5,2018,01,18
118,Rejuve Spa; Not quite a massage. Relaxed but disappointed.,"I purchased a Groupon voucher for the Rejuve spa at La Lit London.  ¬£99 for a choice of one-hour spa treatment and a glass of Champagne for two.  The offer stated; Choice of treatments includes: aromatherapy or Swedish massage | prescriptive facial.  I got this for my sister's birthday and we went for the massages.  It was really quite an odd experience, and all we could do was laugh afterwards.  We were relaxed, but certainly not walking away feeling like we had a massage.  It was more like being rubbed down with oil.  The music that played during the massage was more like lounge bar music.  They were playing music from a phone connected to YouTube, so this might be why.
My therapist advised that I had the option of an aromatherapy or Swedish massage. My sister was not given an option of the type of massage and was told that they only do one kind. Her therapist spent quite a lot of time on the soles of her feet, even though my sister advised that she was ticklish there.  My sister thought her therapist was either tired or lazy, as she sat on a chair quite a bit during her massage.  My therapist didn't even knock the door to see if I was ready before coming in to do the massage.  She only spent the last few minutes of the hour massaging my back. Smaller less significant places, like my fingers, got more time than my back.  It wasn't all bad though; my therapist was very nice, gentle in her approach and she had conversation for most of the massage.
The spa itself is nice in terms of decor, surroundings and ambience.  It had a very serene feel and was very clean and modern.  I liked that the treatment rooms had toilets inside.  However, based on this visit, I would not go back or recommend the spa, at least not for massages.
Drinks in the bar were good.  The house champagne from India tasted great too.",3,2018,01,15
118,Girls Weekend,"We stayed here overnight for a girls get together. First impressions are extremely good and was very impressed. It is beautifully decorated and really wish I had taken more pictures though I doubt mine will do it the justice it deserves.

The rooms were well equipped with everything you should need. The beds were so comfy and you couldn't here any noise from outside or within the hotel from the rooms whatsoever. You get newspapers delivered to your room on a morning which was a pleasant surprise. 

We did have breakfast at the hotel which again was very nice and couldn't fault.

Would certainly stay here again. The hotel was very well heated and my own fault but it did get slightly uncomfortable in the room but there is a thermostat to change it if you so wish. The only thing that let it down was when we checked out we asked one of the staff to take a picture of us and we were told to wait a minute, then he came back and said he would have to be quick as he was very busy. After the fabulous dealings we had with all the rest of the staff sadly this left our stay on a bit of a downer as he was quite rude but otherwise than this I couldn't fault our stay here.",4,2018,01,15
118,"Great staff, spacious room","-Under 10min walk to Jubilee line undergound train service
- I stayed in the Junior Suite on the 2nd floor. Room was very spacious with free minibar (Nespresso, cookies, water), heated bathroom and good lighting. Lack of view though 
- Staff at reception is very helpful 
- Newspaper delivered to room in morning
- Quality of hotel is great, likely newly refurbished 
- Indian restaurant in the hotel for dinner with outside seating 
",4,2018,01,12
118,An oasis in the City,"I have now stayed twice in this beautiful hotel, just 5 minutes from Tower Bridge. Walking through the doors the stress from traveling through London falls away. All the staff are very sincere, very friendly, very helpful. A real delight ! 
The decor is also wonderful. The beds and sheets too !
The breakfast is a little disappointing. The coffee certainly. They should be serving fresh coffee. Not from a machine. 
But I certainly will return.",5,2018,01,11
118,So perfect ,"We have just come back from a two day stay. Everything was 10 out of 10. The room the food and every member of staff

We used the spa facility. Again perfect

The food in the restaurant perfect. The cocktails in the bar perfect. We didn‚Äôt want to leave

Everything is done so quietly and efficiently 

",5,2018,01,11
118,THE PERFECT STAY,"Where should I start from? We entered the hotel and Pharell the concierge kindly took us to the reception. On the check in time Mrs. Anetta, Mr. Wilson and Duty Managers Sam and Sami were very nice to us and they made sure that our stay is going to be lovely! When I made the reservation through the phone a lovely Duty Manager named Lidia helped us with all our requests and when I entered the room she made sure my requests were followed up! I was so amazed with the service of the hotel so I asked the names of the staff so I can give my feedback to them!! All the receptionists asked me if I have everything in my room and if I wanted anything else housekeeping brought them immediately! We also had breakfast included, beautifely made and the staff of the Baluchi were very kind to us! In general, our stay was incredible in the New Year‚Äôs, our room was so cozy, perfect bathroom, the most comfortable bed, complimentary minibar, I mean who doesnt want a complimentary minibar? The hotel was 1 min away from the tower bridge so the location was the most convenient, I AM DEFINITELY COMING BACK! I am so sorry if I do not remember the rest of the names who were unbelievably kind to us! Thank you again for the great stay! ",5,2018,01,10
118,Unique and Classy Indian plance,The hotel is a old grammar school. We dined at the restaurant on Boxing day . The menu was interesting and it was unique . We went there with kids . Kids loved as well . They didn't serve off the regular menu but a special four course menu .  The ambience was fantastic and the Chef was very friendly. Close to the tower the bridge and is walkable from here.,4,2018,01,06
118,Luxury in London,"Our first visit to the hotel on New Year's Eve was amazing.
The welcome was warm attentive and efficient. We were taken to our room which was beautifully decorated and furnished.
The in room facilities are very modern and luxurious. mobile phone, coffee machine, underfloor bathroom heating and a heated toilet seat. 
The communal areas did not disappoint with the opulent decor, and rich warm colours.
Cocktails were delicious as was the breakfast in the morning.

All staff are friendly and professional and know how to treat guests

Having lost my glasses the staff made serious effort over days to retrieve them for me.
I am very grateful.
This is really a luxury hotel with high quality in all areas.",5,2018,01,03
118,Perfect stay,"We booked as a last minute, arrived and were upgraded to a suite which was perfect! Staff were all fabulous and attentive! Cocktails were also spot on!
We were very impressed and will be back! Thank you",5,2018,01,03
118,Drinks & Shisha in the 'London Chill' (via the London Shisha Company).,"We only came here for drinks and a shisha/hookah on this occasion. I had been referred here by a friend as this is a brand new hotel (opened Feb 2017 I believe). 

  We contacted Hayz (who owns the London Shisha Company), and he arranged our seating just outside the divine dining hall/restaurant ""Baluchi"" (see photo) within the hotel. The Lalit is set to be a really nice place to go for food/drink or a mid priced luxury stay from what I can see.

  Drinks are priced at an expected London rate and the shisha a touch above the rates I usually pay, but absolutely worth it for the ambience and treatment we got. (Our visit was during a quiet part of the week during the Christmas & New Year).

  Thoroughly recommend it and our next visit is to be to ""Baluchi"" for Lunch or Dinner.",4,2018,01,02
118,Excellent hotel,"We stayed in Lalit London on NYE and loved it. The hotel staff were attentive and friendly and added the finishing touches to this well appointed hotel. Nothing was too much trouble. We stayed in a Senior Classroom - it was beautiful, spacious and clean with a queen size bed and super large shower. The hotel is beautifully decorated and furnished with a real opulent feel. Would highly recommend and hope to return. ",5,2018,01,01
118,Hidden Gem,"We stayed here on New Years Eve for one night, this is a gem of a hotel. The staff are fantastic, nothing is too much trouble and they are extremely accommodating, the hotel is fitted out to an extremely high standard, rooms are very comfortable, the restaurant and bar areas are stunningly beautiful. The renovation of this old school has been completed to the highest standards and every area is tasteful and faultless. Cannot recommend highly enough.",5,2018,01,01
118,"Best services, best location, best christmas","GREAT ACCOMMODATIONS - We had the pleasure of staying over the Christmas holiday.  The rooms were top notch.  We've traveled to Europe many times and are used to having smaller rooms. These rooms were very large and the high ceilings made them feel even more spacious.  Likewise, the bathrooms were good sized with heated toilet seats and very nice showers.  The beds were comfortable (although I don't understand why they designate one pillow soft and one hard when they feel the same).  They refilled the refrigerator with complimentary drinks and snacks twice a day.  Likewise, we received cleaning services with a turn-down in the evening (and yummy chocolates).  

TOP RATE STAFF- The hotel is most benefited by the terrific desk staff. They immediately learned my son's name (ashton), welcomed him with a stuffed elephant, and greeted him every time we arrived.  They were quick to offer suggestions on things to do that were beyond the guidebooks.  Likewise, they accommodated us keeping a birthday cake secret with great skill.   Our stay would not have been near as warm and welcoming without the LaLit team.

LOCATION - great way to stay away from the most crazy and crowded parts of London but to experience many of London's greatest treasures.  Our favorites that are within walking distance is Borough Market, Tate Modern, Tower Bridge, the Shard, and its an easy walk to the Tower of London, London Eye, and the Southbank Center.",5,2017,12,31
118,"A beautiful hotel, tastefully converted from the old school with great views, rooms and staff.","We could not fault our stay or what the architects have done with this old school. The public rooms are just beautiful and carefully restored. The bedrooms are modern, warm and very comfortable. Then there are the views, from our bedroom the Shard with its peak changing colour through the night ; turn right out of the hotel and after about 100 yards you are welcomed by one of the best views of Tower Bridge as you will see. The staff were polite, friendly and helpful. We could not have asked for more during our short stay.",5,2017,12,31
118,Highly recommend amazing boutique hotel! ,"I went to a function at this hotel and was so pleasant surprised with the tasteful decor incredible service and great food.

I cannot rate this hotel highly enough. A world class service food a facilities. It has an air of luxury about it and captures Indian art and design with a British but not colonial vibe loved it and would highly recommend it!",5,2017,12,31

118,Great hotel,"We stayed in September 2017 and the place was still very new.  The hotel is really pretty and cool looking. The main dining restaurant wasn‚Äôt very busy when we there and we wanted to check out the naanery (I think that‚Äôs what it was called), but it seemed like they weren‚Äôt really prepared for it. We did have some drinks and snacks and sat outside.  The drinks were really good. The room itself was also very nice.  Would definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2017,12,24
118,"Beautiful small unique hotel: great dining room, lovely place for tea or dinks","Mr Lalit has put 6 years into converting this wonderful old school building (formerly St. Olav's) into a magical, mythical bit of India only 100 metres behind  City Hall. Each brick has been scrubbed clean, each bit of parquet flooring buffed and polished. An elephant greets us in the courtyard, where plants are starting to grow up the walls. Another disembodied elephant/man  - Ganesh? - beckons from the distance.

The dining room has enormous glass chandeliers (from India) which gel perfectly with the old wood beams. We were shown into the Headmaster's Study, where huge carved cherubim looked down on us. We weren't in trouble, were we?

The reassuring, friendly and welcoming voice of a waiter assured us we were not, offering us a selection of fragrant teas, brought in a huge pot with 2 giant delectable home-made biscuits. The room is large, comfortable, beautiful. We fet very special and pampered, all for the price of 2 teas (¬£6 each). 

Lovely. The bedrooms are beautiful, too.",5,2017,12,23

118,5 Stars,Wonderful dining experience in the main restaurant. Wonderful table service always. Impressed with the decor and Ganesh statue displays. Thank you for always accommodating us at the very last minute. That is what I call 5 star service!,5,2017,12,18
118,"Stunning architecture, beautiful decor, warm atmosphere","I walked past the Lalit a week ago while visiting the Christmas markets around Tower Bridge and something simply looked very welcoming...the stylish Christmas lights, the elephant, the Ganesh, the gardens, the location...
I came straight home and booked into the Lalit for my upcoming night in London that week.  
I was not disappointed when I visited with my husband a few days later.
The Lalit is a stylish and stunningly-converted old school, St Olave's. There is great attention to detail and no expense has been spared in creating comfortable and attractive bedrooms and bathrooms. The restaurant, Baluchi , is the most glorious room I have seen for quite some time. Lavish and stunning in appearance it is matched by wonderful food and attentive staff. The two bars, the Teacher‚Äôs Room and the Headmaster‚Äôs Room retain the original frescoes and ceilings which are a joy to behold.
Staff are attentive and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. Every nook and cranny is clean and well cared for. 
I would highly recommend this hotel. This is an oasis in London - and it is well located by Tower Bridge, Borough and St Katherine's Dock . 
If you love India you will love the Lalit, if you love London you will love the Lalit and above all if you love good service, stunning decor and amazing food, you will love the Lalit. 
One tiny word of advice would be to check your email after your booking as we had booked a Christmas Baluchi package and somehow the information did not match up - it appeared to the hotel that we had just booked the room only and it was not clear on checking in whether the payment had been made. However, it is important to add that we didn't check the details on the email, we just checked that the booking had been confirmed. We experienced 2 rather embarassing moments both at check in and in the restaurant while we had to explain that payment had been made on booking and also what the payment was supposed to cover. The issue was dealt with relatively quickly but it was a little disappointing to be doubted.  
However, this does no detract from the fact that I would heartily recommend a stay in this beautiful hotel.",5,2017,12,18
118,Trip down memory lane,"A memorable stay in the luxury hotel that was once my old school which I left 50 years ago.
My wife and I were made very welcome by all the staff who were unfailingly courteous and helpful. The accommodation was luxurious, the food excellent, and the exotic touches of Indian hospitality truly memorable.",5,2017,12,14
118,Very nice,"This was my first stay at The Lalit. While I was only there for one night, I was impressed by the welcome, the friendly staff and generous guest room. The internet was fast, and I was generally very happy my brief stay.

I didn't eat in, but I did hear great things from the locals.",5,2017,12,14
118,Wonderful stay,We stayed for our 45th wedding anniversary. What a treat!! It was made special by the fantastic staff who could not do enough to give us great memories. Beautifully furnished with some quirky touches such as the top of the range loos with heated seats throughout hotel. The hotel is quiet and lacks a little atmosphere but I am sure this will improve once people find this jem. Thank you to all the staff Namaste,5,2017,12,14
118,Lovely spa day @ Lalit,"I visited Lalit London a couple of weeks ago with a friend as we had both booked a spa treatment there.  When we arrived we were greeted by a friendly and helpful member of staff who took us to the bar where we enjoyed a coffee each as we were a little early for our appointment.  A member of staff from the spa came to collect us and took us down to the spa area which was an oasis of calm and tranquility! We both opted for a facial along with a head, neck and shoulder massage.  The treatments were wonderful and the staff very professional.  We emerged over an hour later relaxed and refreshed to a cold chilled glass of champagne waiting for us back up in the bar.  We were having such a lovely time we decided to stay for lunch at the hotel, which we took in their restaurant called Baluchi.  The decor of the restaurant and the food were very good indeed and we really enjoyed our lunch, however the staff were a bit hit and miss and some clearly needed a lot more training!  That would be the only reason I could not give this experience 5 stars.. however I still would not hesitate to recommend.  The hotel has been sympathetically restored and retains much character (it used to be a grammar school) and most of the staff were wonderful.",4,2017,12,12
118,Afternoon tea,"My family surprised me with afternoon tea here. Have to say the surroundings of Baluchi is lovely and the afternoon tea was very nice. Obviously not your standard sandwiches but lovely samosas, aloo tikkis etc. 
We always stay at The Lalit when in Delhi and the Lalit in London is just as nice. Would recommend this hotel

118,Namaskar to the Power of 10!,"A lovely hotel with Indian flavour.  Peaceful, small, luxurious and perfect in every way.

118,Title - Austrian female trekkers reunion - initial booking proved difficult as the response was poor. ,"16 ladies Indian High tea 
The initial booking proved difficult . The staff who responded on the phone couldn‚Äôt converse due to language difficulties . No one ever returned your calls so it was difficult to convey any details of the dietary needs to them .
Although finally communicated with the restaurant manager Chanchal who instilled some confidence in my booking management . However , he didn‚Äôt take the deposit of  ¬£ 15 per head as previously requested nor my list of dietary requirements .
On the day everything was magical with excellent service and abundance food . The hotel itself is grand with very inviting atmosphere . 
And to top it all the toilet seats are heated too .
Highly recommend the Indian high Tea .",4,2017,12,05
118,Hotel stay,Had a lovely time beautiful hotel would highly recommend to people the staff at the hotel treated us very well and it‚Äôs such a lovely building in a great location the breakfast was delicious looking forward to visiting again ,5,2017,12,05
118,Lovely facilities but restaurant service lacking,"Overall we were impressed with the junior suite room and high quality facilities in the hotel. The highlights were the junior suite decor, character of the building and service at reception. And the heated toilet seat was a talking point!
Unfortunately we were very disappointed with the poor service at breakfast. We were shown to a table and left with no explanation of how the breakfast menu worked. We had to ask multiple times for tea and coffee which only materialised after we spoke to the manager. Then finally we found the breakfast buffet was out of a lot of the hot food items. This was way off 5 star breakfast service in my opinion. ",4,2017,12,04
118,Great boutique hotel with amazingly attentive staff.,"Superb hotel in a great very sensitively restored old school. Staff are top of their game in

118,A very welcoming hotel.,We enjoyed our stay at this friendly hotel. It is ideally situated with a ten minute walk to London Bridge Train/Underground station. A very different hotel to what you normally would expect in London. We definitely will be returning.,5,2017,11,28
118,Our recent stay 22-25 November,Lovely hotel with very attentive staff. Romm well appointed but small. Nice breakfast.  Had dinner there felt it was overpriced liked the location right next to tower bridge. Good walk in shower no view,4,2017,11,27
118,Amazing Hotel ,"What can I say, this truly is an amazing hotel and experience, right from the booking, where Wilson was outstanding, arranging a special treat for my wife‚Äôs 50th birthday, through to the moment we checked out, the entire staff were phenomenal, they have a way of making you feel special and completely looked after, without ever being overbearing. 
The hotel itself is stunning, with character you‚Äôre unable to find in most newly developed properties, and in a great location, don‚Äôt hesitate to book here you you‚Äôll struggle to find better. Once again thank you for making our stay special, without question we will return.",5,2017,11,27
118,"Great location, great rooms but the staff are what makes it exceptional","My wife and I stayed at the hotel for a weekend. Whilst some other 5 star hotels in London will provide a greater level of decadence, or will be more famous, I would be surprised if any offered such a friendly service. The value of the hotel was very good. The rooms spacious, the TV was not great but outside of that there was no complaints. The little extras go along way including the chocolates, complimentary water and soft drinks and high quality toiletries. Breakfast was good, with some great quality butter, and mushrooms. Some other bits of breakfast could improve but the room you enjoy it in is superb. All in all well done and loved the hotel.",5,2017,11,27
118,First Class Hotel,"We stayed at The LaLit this weekend, for the second time this year. 
For the second time, we were not disappointed! 
Everything about this hotel is first class. The staff are friendly,helpful, polite, I could go on. 
Check in is quick and easy, in fact this time, we were taken straight to our room and check in was completed there!
The room was spotlessly clean, crisp white sheets, choice of pillows, pillow sleep spray, chocolates, complimentary mini bar! Absolutely superb!
I cannot rate this hotel highly enough, we will definitely be returning.

118,Stunning hotel,"Stunning hotel, staff are all so friendly and helpful. Rooms are really well fitted out and quiet as well.

Cheers guys ",5,2017,11,26
118,Sheesha and Tasty Indian Cuisine Delights,"Simply delicious always with outstanding service 
Enjoyed The King Prawns with a spicy hot sauce as a main with pilau rice and naan bread.
Service was excellent and attentive at all times, including bar service.
The Grape and Mint Shisha to follow was amazing as always -there can be no finer shisha experience in London with a selection to please. The heated covered terrace with planting and music is also very attractive all year round-Sun, Rain and December! 
I recommend The La Lit Hotel total experience, venue near Tower Bridge , The Tower of London and London Bridge Tube.A true pleasure and a most professional team who work hard to please every customer....",5,2017,11,25
118,Great hotel with great staff,Stayed one night on a weekender. I can only say it was absolutely amazing. The eye to detail from staff members was spot on. Staff made sure we were treated as VVIP for the ocassion. Overall good value for money and will definitely return. Highly recommended to all.,5,2017,11,24
118,Great service and location ,"The room is comfortable with great location. service is more than great, as they apparently had thought through all the details therefore they made everything during my stay convenient. The lack of one star is due to the restaurant service, as they acted like they didn‚Äôt belong to this hotel...",4,2017,11,24
118,"Wonderfully boring restaurant in a vibrant location , thankfully !","Food and venue very good , particularly the restoration.
However this restaurant desperately needs ambiance.
Underworked waiters continually interrupt with best intentions , however , the best food in the world isn't enjoyable in a school hall where you can here a pin drop .
Great potential , rent a crowd .",4,2017,11,23
118,Lovely Boutique Hotel with Excellent Service and beatiful decorations,"We had such a great stay at Lalit London. The hotel is gorgeous, the service amazing, amenities amazing and breakfast just delicious!  I can not say enough great things about this hotel. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in staying on the South Bank!",5,2017,11,21
118,A peaceful haven in a busy city,"We found this hotel on Secret Escapes and what a find - 5 minutes walk from the tube and less than a stones thrown from Tower Bridge. The area is also great for walking and excellent places to eat. To the hotel itself - the building is stunning and whilst sympathetically restored there are some fantastic modern touches and the Indian influences creat a real oasis of peace which is excellent after the hustle and bustle of London. The bedrooms are stunning and fitted to a very high standard. 
The staff are extremely professional and attentive - going above and beyond to deliver fantastic customer service.
The restaurant is stunning but with so many places to eat in London the challenge will be attracting enough clientele to creat an atmosphere. I definitely hope to return but suspect it may be for leisure as a bit out of range for my corporate account budget.

A true high quality boutique hotel that is an hidden gem",5,2017,11,20
118,Lacks Soul,"Hi ok here is our review on a very new hotel, we are only just back from our trip and what can I say..... The hotel was very well located you could walk to the Tower of London in about 7 minutes and get across the other side!.
On checking into the hotel it was all well done a new staff member Lana checked us in and she was totally charming. not so charming however was the breakfast or indeed the staff at this area of the hotel, it seemed disjointed somehow,for a 5 star hotel I did not expect a buffet breakfast and it was rather disappointing after all as a brand I expected lots of lovely cut fruit and some amazing smoothies perhaps, but nothing, a few horrible ingredients to adorned your cereal with and some basically what looked like tin fruit in a bowl! even the  automatic coffee machine made freezing cold cappuccinos, even the waiter agreed on that  They need to remove the buffet get some good management in the restaurant and start some brand recognition training.

The hotel was once a former Grammar school for boys you can sit in the headmaster office and not get told off once! I cant put my finger on it but it did lack personality, the staff need some training and feel that perhaps sending some of them over to India may help with the hotel going forward as it has an identity issue in my mind.

We did however, meet a totally awesome concierge called Tony without Tony I think I would have had given the hotel a lower score but his enthusiasm and indeed explanations of things helped bring this hotel to life, I think if he went on a visit to the hotels brand destination he could be a fabulous ambassador for this new London hotel if he has not been already of course!

Tony had so much information in his head about London and indeed the hotel no APP based equipment could match he has a warm personal touch about him, he is engaging and truly motivated, in my mind the hotel would be lost without him.

We did not dine in the restaurant mainly because of the staff issue at breakfast and really did not want to be disappointed twice.

Would I return yes if they sorted out the breakfast and made the hotel more inviting and warm with everyone singing the same tune.",4,2017,11,16
118,Try the spa,"I visited the spa for a one hour massage with champagne. 
The staff is really qualified and very nice. As you walk throughout the hotel the staff is always smiling and ready to help.
I was treated like a VIP even though I just popped in for a massage and wasn't a staying guest. 
Masseuses are really qualified with kind personalities. 
The decor of the hotel is amazing. 
Will definitely consider coming back for more treatment to the spa, and also will consider staying in the hotel.",5,2017,11,14
118,The Lalit  London,"This hotel has been lovingly restored and has kept the memory of the old grammar school alive, by keeping many features and by naming all areas appertaining to school life, such as junior and senior classrooms.  
Unlike, the noise of a boys school, this old school has now been transformed into a peaceful, calm and relaxing hotel.The decor through out is exquisite.  The attention to detail to please the customer is second to none. All of the staff were very attentive and always happy to please.  The Great Hall, with its beautiful blue chandeliers, is where the Baluchi restaurant is situated and it was great that you could enjoy your meal, with plenty of room around you. The food and the help received in choosing dishes was superb. The terrace bar and surrounding area,looked beautiful (especially at night), with colourful planting and careful lighting. I have  nothing but praise for this lovely hotel and i just hope that we are able to visit again soon. I would highly recommend a visit to The Lalit London.",5,2017,11,14
118,Birthday Celebration,"Just returned from a fabulous 1 night stay at this gorgeous hotel 
Beautiful surroundings - stunningly restored and all the room fabrics and fittings are excellent quality 
Perfectly located -a short walk to Borough Market and Tower Bridge facilities.
The hotel staff went out of their way to make our stay with friends memorable(kept unexpected arrival a secret!) and ensured that the little extra touches such as a birthday cake were a surprise in the room and our rooms located next to each other without us asking. 
The rooms are beautifully appointed, warm and luxurious.
The bathroom facilities so impressive and clean -every time we went back to the room something had been placed to make it special ...new towels ,more toiletries and pillow spray and chocolates for night time -totally fabulous service with a smile always 
The minibar is all with no cost and inclusive including fruit and a thoughtfully placed bottle of prosecco!
We ate in the Baluchi restaurant in the evening and again the service food and advice was superb...our waiter was knowledgeable and so attentive without being intrusive 
Minor points to take note for the management .... are the size of the tables for 4 with all the food drinks and cutlery can seem crowded and cramped.Also the main double door to the Terrace was open intermittently and caused a chilly draught to those tables in the middle of the room.
I was so looking forward to this trip and this exceeded my expectations-I would definitely recommend and would love to plan to visit again.
Well done to the staff and management for their hard work in making every visitor feel special !",5,2017,11,12
118,Excellent option to explore Southwark,"I don't normally stay on the south side of the Thames and in truth did not realise this hotel was across the river from the Tower until dropped there by taxi. The hotel has a distinct Indian Flavour in furnishings and design which is outstanding. Converted from a school the building has lovely high moulded ceilings and grand spaces. Check in and out was relaxed and professional. The room was well appointed with some nice touches such as 'sleep spray' and chocolates. The mini bar of non alcoholic beverages included.
At the medium to top end price wise this hotel does not disappoint.",5,2017,11,09
118,Enjoyed our stay ,"We visited fifth time and had the same amazing experience as before. We had dinner and I must say the service was top class. Elizabeth looked after us and ensured we were taken care again!
The food was delicious and will come again soon!

118,Stunning hotel with very friendly staff,"This hotel was lovely, we had one of the modern rooms and it was a really nice room with all amenities and was spotlessly clean.

 We booked the room because we thought it was reasonably priced. 
Dinner and drinks were lovely overall it was a very comfortable and pleasant stay!!!",5,2017,11,07
118,Amazing,"Stayed for two nights for a short weekend break with my partner. Hotel was perfect.

Lovely place I recommend!!!!!",5,2017,11,06
118,Fantastic hotel,"The refurbishment of this old grammar school is very well done making it a welcome change from other 5 star hotels. Staff are really welcoming and friendly and the rooms well equipped and comfortable. Free mini bar with a range of snacks and non alcoholic drinks! Bathroom with roomy shower and top quality fittings was a joy to use.
The dining room is stunning with four large chandeliers. It's a big room that still feels intimate and we had a great dinner and breakfast here. Short walk from the tube but difficult to drive to ( but so is everywhere in London) looking forward to my next visit!",5,2017,11,06
118,Stunning old grammar school turned luxury hotel & spa,"As soon as I entered the stunning Lalit hotel I was greeted with a warm Namaskar! the gentleman who welcomed me to the hotel showed a genuine interest when I asked for directions to the spa, he wanted to know what treatment I had booked and assured me that I would have a great time. He took me in the lift down to the spa and introduced me to the spa manager, he then wished for me to enjoy myself before heading back upstairs. I instantly felt relaxed there was such a nice ambience in the spa, I was asked to fill in a form then shown to my treatment room, the spa manager directed my attention to the spiritual artwork on the walls on the way. As you can see from my pictures the treatment room was very luxurious and super clean. I was given a welcome drink which was delicious,it was flavoured mineral water. The ambience in the treatment room was just right, lighting, temperature, candles, soft music and aroma. The therapist was super friendly, I had a one hour heavenly Swedish back massage I just didn't want it to end I felt amazing afterwards. I was able to get a shower too which was really nice especially after a long day of shopping in London the luxury body wash was really nice and smelt incredible. After my treatment I was taken to the Teachers room where a glass of champagne and olives were waiting for me, here I was able to unwind in a really comfy chair the staff were so friendly and attentive. It was nice to see all of the original features from the grammar school I think it adds to the charm of this hotel. If I didn't have a train to catch I would have stayed longer as the cocktail menu really appealed to me, I will certainly return to the Lalit in the near future! I felt like I was the most important guest while I was there.!!

Many thanks for the great service",5,2017,11,05
118,a wonderful hotel in London,"My wife and myself were fortunate to stay for 3 nights and we could of easily stayed longer.
All aspects of the hotel were grand and the wonderful staff made life easy.
We had a dinner, afternoon tea and breakfasts in the grand dining room and all were excellent.
The tube station was a sort walk away and Tower Bridge was around the corner. The area had a number of pubs, supermarkets and places to eat.
We would definitely stay again on our next trip",5,2017,11,03
118,Weekend at the Lalit London,"Ended our week in Paris with a few days in London and decided to try the LaLit London.  

Frankly it was a mixed experience.  

On the good side.   

It is a beautiful property.  It was once an elementary school and has been nicely restored.    The main dining room is spectacular.   

It is a stone's throw from Tower Bridge on the south side of the Thames.  

The staff is wonderful.   Attentive.  Helpful and pleasant.  

Our room, a midsized single facing the back of the property, was nicely appointed with a modern bath (but only a shower, no tube). 

On the could be better side

The location was difficult to reach via taxi.   Tooley St was closed eastbound and the diversion was at least 20 extra minutes!    No taxi driver was familiar with the Hotel which is surprising given the luxury positioning.  Those negatives aside,  it is easy to reach via tube since it is a 10 minute walk to London Bridge station. 

The main dining room was a disappointment.   The room itself is spectacular, but the furnishings and the food were subpar.   Laminate tables, funky artwork and so so dishes.  
Not surprising, there was rarely more than a few tables occupied.  

We wish we had chosen a more centrally located boutique property with a more established pedigree.",3,2017,10,30
118,A lovely stay,Really nice place to base our London trip from. Great location. Amazing welcoming feeling. Great car park a 5 min walk away. Would stay again. The room services was so super tasty.. just what we needed at 12.30am.. üòÄ,5,2017,10,27
118,my uncle's old school!,"Intrigued to go here as it is the site of my uncle's old grammar school! Really lovely place, service and location excellent, a little pricey but nice for a treat. Treatments and  restaurant also very good, would be a good present for somebody.",5,2017,10,26
118,"Charming Hotel, Still a little rough around the edges","We had stayed the the Lalit in New Delhi, and were jazzed about this property in London.   It is in an utterly charming location -- a former boarding school, with a sprawling dining room with soaring ceilings.   The rooms are well-equipped and comfortable.   There was a wedding the night we checked in with music blaring, but with one call to reception, we were immediately moved to the tranquility of the the third floor.   Breakfast was included, and it included a variety of English and Indian dishes, as well as a lighter buffet.   The coffee was strong and delicious, and the staff, to a person, were well meaning, if at times clueless.    The waiter at the restaurant couldn't answer basic questions about the menu, and a the concierge seemed befuddled at a question about how to get to Gatwick airport, quoting a taxi rate, that was one-half of the actual cost.   Our shower drain didn't work, and the bathroom flooded, but here again, the maintenance man was there quickly to resolve the problem, and the maid came and soaked up the water promptly.   

So, here's a summary of the property:

*  Located in an absolutely charming building
*  Rooms are not huge, but are comfortable
*  The bathrooms have the latest toilets, with heated seats, and ""spay-your-self-clean"" hygiene feature.
*   The dining room has soaring ceilings.
*   The staff, and there are scores of them, are friendly and do their best
*   The hotel is located a short walk from London Bridge Train station, and you can get to Gatwick airport for just 10 pounds, 30 minute ride, with just one stop.
*  Interesting breakfast menu, but staff don't know what is on the menu.   I asked about one dish, and the waiter responded, ""I have no idea what that is.""   Then left.

With a little staff training, and some time to iron out the rough spots, this will be an absolutely amazing place to stay.   The location, building, rooms, and public spaces are really nice, and it just needs a bit of work to be a wonderful hotel.",4,2017,10,25

Lovely rooms and outstanding service. 
The bathrooms were amazing and they were happy to help in every way possible. I 100% would stay here again and will def recommend this place to people wanting to stay in the area.",5,2017,10,13
118,Stunning ,"I recently attended a function here. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The building is stunning and has been tastefully finished to a very high standard. 
It's access is easily reached from many if the main stations and cabs are readily available

118,"Excellent service, high quality food, newly acquired by Lalit Group of India.","The Hotel hosted a fabulous Reception to celebrate the Indian Festival of Lights, Diwali with Mayor of London. The staff were all dressed in traditional Indian clothes, the candle and flower decorations blew me away. It was worth going to taste their freshly squeezed Mango Lassi (buttermilk). The Lalit Group of India have recently acquired the hotel, their family members mingled with guests and are personally involved in running of the hotel.  Fabulous Evening.",5,2017,10,11
118,Pure Class,"I always think I give a good honest review of my experience, so here‚Äôs  my review for this wonderful boutique hotel.
We stayed here for 1 night for my birthday, I picked this hotel on a Secret Escapes deal and let‚Äôs face it there are hundreds of hotels in London that use this website, but this hotel stood out from all the others mainly from the reviews that others left.  We booked a senior classroom and on entering our first room I was a little disappointed as it looked onto a side wall of another building, I had emailed the hotel prior to arrival to ask if it was possible to have a view of the shard, so I asked if we could be moved, this was done without any fuss and we were given a much bigger, lighter room at the front of the building,  The room amenities are lovely, the room that we had was well thought out, a plug socket by a mirror is a must for any woman, a quality hairdryer, a complimentary mini bar, a well lit bathroom, lots of products to use, and even a heated loo seat, yes heated, and it‚Äôs a wonderful experience.
We booked some treatments via Groupon in the Spa, a massage for my partner and a facial for me, both these treatments were amazing and we received a glass of bubbly afterwards which we drank on the balcony overlooking the great hall.
We dined in the restaurant (the great hall ) in the evening for my birthday, we had a lovely dinner, I ordered the prawn dish and though this dish was a little spicy for me however the prawns were the biggest I have ever eaten and were so beautifully cooked.  We went for after dinner drinks and the bar man was a real joy making me a cocktail that was not on the menu but one that I really enjoy you know .... on the beach, I did feel a little uncomfortable asking for this but he said it would be no problem and produced me a wonderful cocktail, so much so that I ordered another.
Turn down service was one of the best I have experienced in London, complimentary chocolates, a bed that was turndowned, just the right touches.  
We had breakfast which was included in our deal, full English, this was superior tasting, the flavours of all the ingredients just popped in your mouth, and your eggs are cooked to order so these are so fresh and hot.
We had the most amazing stay, one that I am not sure we could afford if it wasn‚Äôt for Secrect Escapes and Groupon, these deals allowed us to experience a top quality hotel at a price that we could afford for a special occasion.
The Great Hall, is a room of beauty, the chandeliers are just mind blowing, the Headmasters room is like nothing I have seen before with its original ceiling and I tell you it‚Äôs a wow factor.  This is all complimented by the respectful, well trained, warm staff that greet you warmly, open doors, lifts, show you around, explain how the room is set up and how things work, book taxis, a real asset to this hotel, this experience for me was a truly wonderful one.
There is nothing negative to report just one comment about the towels in the bathrooms, please maybe think about supplying smaller ones for when ladies wash their hair and dry their hands",5,2017,10,11
118,Happy stay with refurbished facilities & excellent service,"My wife & I were there for 2 weeks ( 11 -24 Sept 17) whilst I attended London Bridge Hospital .  A beautifully refurbished old Grammar school near Tower Bridge it is owned by a prestigious Indian hotel group. Very comfortable rom with en suite, good lounge & bar, gymn & beauty salon. Staff exceptional efficient & keen to please. Dining good with Indian style menu.",5,2017,10,08
118,Bermondsey's best!,"An easy walk from London Bridge station, and just across the river by Tower Bridge to a very comfortable hotel, very convenient for the City. It's a listed building designed by the man who designed New Scotland Yard and has been brought up to date in a  stylish manner with Indian overtones, and a very pleasnt and helpful staff.",5,2017,10,06
118,Needs a little work for a five star,"Nice place, clean, good rooms and good location but needs quite a bit of work. For a five star hotel it needs to be much slicker and would say more organised - lots of people do jump to help/welcome/serve but when something needed to be sorted it was tough to get action/decision. Food was ‚Äòok‚Äô. Was not offered alternative to a nice but unsuitable room and was too tired to wait for someone to sort. Was a shame but the stay was brief so possibly hard to tell but over all those were my impressions. ",3,2017,10,06
118,On the way to perfection,"This is one of the most beautiful hotels I have stayed in. I particularly liked that it was small in size (approx 70 bedrooms) but the building is gorgeous. The former grammar school has been sympathetically converted into a quirky yet classy hotel. The Indian theme running throughout is tasteful with the best being the Great Hall, which houses the restaurant. Every room has something unique from ornate cornice work to original fireplaces - adding that something special.

I can't forget the lovely staff. Special mentions to the concierges (whose services we did not use) but were welcoming and friendly each time we passed. The friendly and knowledgeable bar staff must also get a special mention - we were treated to a gin master class the other evening!

This is the first time we have stayed in this area though we are no strangers to the Borough Market. We normally choose to stay in the West End and I am still not sure which I prefer. As this was a birthday treat for my husband he chose the Lalit, as he liked the look of the hotel and bedrooms. We were lucky enough to be given an upgrade to a beautiful suite complete with a view of the Shard. The receptionist took us up to our room and explained the history behind it and the layout. The room wasn't huge but by London standards it was fairly generous. The hotel offers a complimentary minbar including soft drinks and coconut waters, savoury snacks and chocolate. We were also treated to a bowl of fresh fruit, macarons, small bottle of fizz and lovely sponge birthday cake!

A nice touch is the bottle of mineral water to use to make tea or coffee (Nespresso). Much better than using local London water. There are no carpets in the rooms, which might not suit everyone, but we liked it. This is also easier to keep clean. The levels of cleanliness in our room and public areas were excellent - congratulations to housekeeping.

As the title suggests.... the hotel is very good but once a few teething problems are resolved then it will indeed be perfection. Our room could have done with a couple of comfy chairs to lounge in. The chairs by the table were fine but not for relaxing in. Only 2 bath sheets were provided in the bathroom. We would have preferred having an extra set of towels and definitely hand towels. I asked one day for hand towels, as I needed to wash my hair. I folded the spare towel and left on a shelf but it was taken away when the room was serviced! There were quite a few face cloths so maybe these are supposed to be used to dry hands?

The mini bar wasn't always fully restocked each day but this is a minor issue. Though the staff said we could always ask for more if needed - this wasn't necessary though!

English breakfast was included. This comprises of a buffet style for cold meats, cereals, fruit and pastries. There is also a separate hot food buffet - eggs are made to order. The food was of good quality. Not a huge choice but definitely enough for us. The constructive criticism we would provide is that staff need to be aware when bowls and plates are running low. A number of guests had to ask for more to be brought out. The dinner plates should be kept warm - there is nothing worse than putting hot food on cold plates. The waiting staff often overlooked when plates were to be removed from the table. None of these points will be difficult to resolve and the hotel is still very new having only opened in February this year.

We also booked a facial in the hotel spa, which was lovely and relaxing.

So if like us you have not ventured to a hotel ‚Äòsouth of the river‚Äô then give the Lalit a try. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. This is a grand hotel without being pretentious. Most of the staff who we interacted with were a credit to the hotel. Hopefully we will be back on our next visit to London.

118,Stay at LaLit London,"Positives: Lovely hotel, great decor, nice drink in bar (complimentary popcorn/olives were delicious and bar staff friendly) and was really nice having a view of the Shard from the bar. Room was lovely, spacious and very nicely decorated. Everything felt really luxurious and we loved that some of the original features of the school had been kept. Loved the shower and bathroom. Underfloor heating in the bathroom and heated toilet seat with jet wash was a bonus. Loved the complimentary food/drink in room which was restocked daily.  Hotel easy to find and in a quiet location despite only being 10 mins walk to London Bridge/Tower Hill. Loved the check in service - we felt really welcome and it was nice to have our luggage delivered to the room and be offered a drink. Staff were very friendly whenever we encountered them, pressing the lift button for us, asking us how we were, if we needed anything, etc. Very impressed.

Negatives: Bed ever so slightly uncomfortable (memory foam mattress would have been more comfortable). Blackout blinds would have been useful - first night we were woken by light around curtains in the morning, second night we put items up against curtains to block the light. Breakfast service on the first morning was quite chaotic; buffet kept running out of food which we had to ask for, eggs/toast came up at different times meaning toast was cold by the time all food was on plate. Second day's breakfast not a problem at all so maybe the first day was just a bit of an off-day? The taste of the food/drink at breakfast was very nice both days.

Would definitely recommend the hotel and would go back if staying in London again.  ",5,2017,10,03
118,WOW!,"Stayed two nights in this beautiful and well appointed hotel for a birthday celebration. 
The staff of this hotel are among the very best I have come across, the perfect blend of freindly and efficient. 
Hotel is in a fantastic location with great views of the Shard, it is located very close to the river and the recently renovated area of Hays Galleria which feels affluent and contemporary with some great independent and chain eateries and shops (London Bridge tube station is a 5 min walk away) 
I have stayed in many hotels and this place has really struck a chord - highly recommend.",5,2017,10,01
118,25th wedding anniversary stay,"My wife and I booked the Lalit hotel for 5 days to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary on 14th September.  We stayed from the 11th to the 15th. After seeing all the great reviews we were expectant and on the whole, not disappointed.  The hotel is beautiful and as many reviews point out, was a boys' grammar school (St Olaves) until 1967.
We tried the restaurant for dinner only on our actual anniversary as it is quite expensive.  The Balushi Restaurant is in what was once the grammar school's Great Hall (I assume).  The room is huge and beautiful with four huge chandeliers that you cannot fail to appreciate.The food was equally beautiful - we really enjoyed the Malabar prawns - a real treat to eat prawns so huge - you get three on a regular portion, so (with help from the waiter) we plumped for four - two each and they were sumptuous and the spicy sauce complimented them perfectly.  We had a nice nightcap in the bar and the bartender was really helpful and friendly.  The cheapest whisky is ¬£7.50 so after selecting a gorgeous cask conditioned brand at ¬£11.50 we called it a night.  A lovely anniversary cake had been left in our room - a very nice touch and we did enjoy it! Thank you.
Staff are almost always helpful, friendly and welcoming, opening doors for you and going out of their way to make your stay a happy one.  When we arrived at the hotel, our bedroom was at the back of the hotel with no view - a senior classroom.  Although a nice room, we did not like our window facing a neighbouring apartment window literally yards away from our window, so asked to be moved. The lady from reception (sorry I forget your name now) went out of her way to help us, moving us to a first floor room with a similar problem then to an upgraded room (Prestige room I think she said - room 222) which was much larger and overlooked Toolley Street.  We were more than happy with this room and would like to thank the lady who helped us and the manager for approving our upgrade.  Just a small problem - we lost our complimentary biscuits and bowl of fruit after moving rooms but felt it would be too petty to mention it after being moved twice. The bathrooms are all fitted with heated toilet seats and water jets in the toilets.  Again really nice touches.  Minibars are restocked daily, although for some reason we had problems with housekeeping restocking ours throughout our stay.  We did not like the coconut water but this seemed to grow on our minibar shelf while coke and chocolate were never restocked (coke was restocked once after we sent two reminders to reception).  Housekeeping also fell short on other occasions - we left our room after breakfast one day returning after 1pm and our bed was not made nor was the room cleaned.  We had to call reception to ask for the bed to be made and room cleaned when we left again at 4pm.  We booked full English breakfasts for our stay. Breakfasts are nice, served with fresh toast, and freshly cooked eggs to your liking. It is buffet style so your fill your plate as you wish (no black pudding even though menu states it is included). Unfortunately for my wife, the bacon is streaky and she does not eat streaky bacon, so she settled for an extra sausage.  There are other breakfast menu options (e.g porridge / eggs benedict) but be careful if you have paid up front for full English only - we checked and were informed these are a la carte options and are chargeable (and not cheap). 
Nearby attractions are Tower Bridge, The Tower of London, The Shard, Borough Market and the The Globe Theatre - all within walking distance - we visited them all and thought they were all great (although avoid going to the top of the Shard if you get vertigo!)
To summarise, this is a beautiful hotel with courteous highly trained staff that will make your stay special.  Only housekeeping let it down for us.  If I could give a score of 4.5, I would do so.
PS - the reception lady told me if you want a room with a view of the Shard (which we did not have), please request this at the time of booking.",4,2017,09,24
118,A touch of luxury away from the crowds,"Lalit London is a welcoming calm amongst the crowds of London. Its located in Southwark near to the London Bridge for tourists. Easy to catch public transport either a bus or train. For a short walk its also near some good restaurants, and the Tate Modern with an easy stroll to The Globe Theatre. 
The staff make you feel like a valued guest. 
Rooms are well appointed complete with heated toilet seat (bit of a surprise), and very clean.",5,2017,09,24
118,Get Schooled in the Raj,"This new (opened in 2017) hotel is unusual given its location in an old, red-brick school, which means rooms are not uniform. We booked a ‚Äúsuperior double room‚Äù (not on the hotel‚Äôs website), which we thought would be the equivalent to what the hotel calls a ‚ÄúJunior Classroom,‚Äù but it must have been their smallest category of room (‚ÄúJunior Classroom‚Äù), which is pretty small, with just enough room to walk on both sides of the bed and room for a small desk near the foot of the bed. Helping to open up the room are two windows with a view of the Shard. The bed is very comfortable with a fluffy duvet. The fabric headboard has Indian elements. The temperature and soundproofing are both good. There‚Äôs a no-charge mini bar, a nice touch. The small shower-only bathroom is tiled from floor to ceiling. The hi-tech toilet had a control panel for water jets and heating. Everything was very clean. The hotel‚Äôs service is excellent. The restaurant, Baluchi, is in the school‚Äôs Great Hall. It‚Äôs a stunning space with a high ceiling, dark wood a deep blue walls. Unfortunately, the pricey food is nothing special, surprising for an Indian-owned hotel. The hotel is just around the corner from Tower Bridge and City Hall. The walk to London Bridge Station is less than 15 minutes. There‚Äôs a Sainsbury‚Äôs Local market two buildings away.",5,2017,09,23
118,"Recommend, recommend, recommend","We have just returned from an overnight stay to celebrate a special birthday. We stayed in the senior classrooms and the rooms were gorgeous. Everything is high standard and there are lots of lovely touches in the room. All staff are incredibly helpful, and go the extra mile to make sure that guests enjoy a wonderful experience.  Having said we were celebrating a special birthday we found lovely gifts in the room, which was so kind and made for an extra special evening. We ate in the restaurant which is a stunning dining room and we loved  the food.  Breakfast was great. I cannot recommend this hotel enough and if you're looking for somewhere in London for an overnight stay, don't hesitate to stay here. Thanks Adela for making our stay a special one",5,2017,09,23
118,"A true 5 Star hotel ""experience""","I have traveled around the world and have stayed in many 5 star hotels, but there are very few hotels I would categorize as an ‚Äúexperience‚Äù, and this is one of them. From the moment I walked in the front door to the moment I checked out, I felt taken care of with a level of service that is hard to describe unless you experience it for yourself. The rooms are very comfortable and well appointed with the highest quality finishes and products. There was an problem with wifi in my hotel room, which didn‚Äôt seem to be working correctly. And since I was there on business, this was going to be a big issue for me. But once I brought this to their attention they moved fast to investigate and discovered it wasn‚Äôt something they could fix right away so they moved me to another room which happened to be the next grade up - no complaints from me! Happy to report wifi speed was blazingly fast and I was back on track. 

Although the entire staff went out of their way to always accomodate me, it was a gentlemen by the name of Naz who really stood out and went above and beyond to always make sure I was satisfied with ever aspect of my visit.

The hotel bar is another memorable feature of this hotel, not only because of the wonderful ambiance or extensive spirits selection but because of the perfectly friendly bartender Carlo who designed a very creative cocktail menu that is worth a visit even if you aren‚Äôt staying at the hotel. Speaking of ambience, this hotel has no shortage of that. The building is steep in history, it has been meticulously restored from when it was a boarding school so there‚Äôs plenty of lovely detail.

And ultimately, that is what this hotel is all about‚Ä¶ detail. They obsess about it, as do I. Down to the smallest things you may even miss if you aren‚Äôt looking closely enough (i.e.. the complimentary mini bar and snack tray that is restocked during your entire trip - sans alcohol of course.) If there‚Äôs one downside, and it‚Äôs a small one and may be irrelevant to your stay, is that because it is so new most Uber drivers will have a very hard time finding the entrance. You may have to stand on Tooley street and tell the driver exactly where you are ‚Äî which the staff actually took care of :) 

I couldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel more enough and it will be the only hotel I stay when I travel on business to London. I‚Äôd like to personally thank the entire staff for making my visit so memorable, especially Naz.",5,2017,09,19
118,Good night's stay with afternoon tea,"Overall good experience and staff were very helpful specially Wilson Mendonca who was very helpful from start to finish. 
Booking was easy and we were greeted on entry. 
Building was Amazing.
Location was exceptional with east access from London bridge. ",5,2017,09,19
118,Delightful hotel ,"I don't remember the last time I could describe a hotel as ""delightful"". The outside is quintessential London. Topiary, old brick. Immaculate presentation. Well lit at night. Inside there are staff for every eventuality. Service with a capital S. Decor is decadent. Rooms are impressive. Bathrooms are fabulous. From heated loo-seats to floors and the most impressive breakfast hall I ever experienced. A VERY memorable hotel with admittedly a price tag to match. However, standards this high don't come cheap",5,2017,09,19
118,The new hidden gem of London,"Wow! This treasure has it All and what these people don't know about service, is not worth knowing.
Such an incredible building with such character and charm and the decor has been done to an immaculate standard. 
Fallen in love with this hotel and brand and will highly recommend.
Please don't change, it's hard to find a decent hotel in London these days.",5,2017,09,19
118,Serenity in Central London,"Fabulous hotel, very friendly and welcoming staff.  Retained the character of the Grammar School, rooms tastefully decorated and every modern comfort thought of.  Delicious food and wonderful service provided by Danesh.",5,2017,09,18

The rooms are so clean and the colors of furniture make you feel like you're at home it's so warm and elegant..
High quality in service..",5,2017,09,16
118,LaLit has something to teach ;) ,"I always love the idea of staying in a historical property. But this was different than any other hotels! In the early-19th century, this stately red brick building in central London started life as St. Olave‚Äôs Grammar School.

There was a positive vibe all over, it's a new hotel with a beautiful interior decoration. 

I highly recommend this beautiful proprty, with extremely kind & professional staff. 

",5,2017,09,15
118,Great hotel in a good location and seriously good Indian restaurant,"This new hotel is in a great location just near Tower Bridge and proximate to the Potters Field amazing gardens and City Hall. Service and room quality are excellent and the Indian restaurant serves extremely fine and authentic Indian food.  The classroom rooms are very light and comfortable and the service from all staff, without exception, was first class.  A gem of a hotel, slightly quirky and memorable and a great rejuvenation of an old private grammar school.  You won't be disappointed ",5,2017,09,13
118,Absolutely lovely from start to finish,"My partner and I thought The Lalit was great. The way they have renovated the building gives respect to its previous life as a school, yet it's not limited by it. The cocktails are fantastic and certainly worth checking out prior to heading into town. We were very lucky to get a room facing the Shard - the rooms were well appointed and designed. They include a comprehensive free minibar and snacks. The customer service was also exceptional with staff willing to help out however and whenever needed.

If there was one critique I would give it's that our included breakfast was exceptionally mideocur. Only buffet English and continental options were offered with no additions. We thought that was a bit of a shame given the Indian theme to the hotel. It was only after I enquired with the reception staff about breakfast I was told that additional items were offered on another menu....oh, how it would have been nice for someone to mention that before I ate! 

All in all, great stay but please advertise the other breakfast offerings.",5,2017,09,10
118,Great stay in heart of London Bridge,Stayed here for business as I had meetings nearby. Great hotel. Lovely interiors. Very nice rooms and shower. Good breakfast. Didn't have time to try the gym. Recommended over many of the other hotels in the area. ,5,2017,09,10
118,Spa treatment,"Had such a great experience having a spa treatment here, and drinks in the bar after, and even got shown around the hotel and into a couple of the rooms by one of the fantastic staff they have working there, and every toilet has a heated seat! Will definitely go again",5,2017,09,08
118,Fantastic Stay,Had a fantastic stay at Lalit on Saturday evening- including a free upgrade to the tremendous Lalit Suite- a nice unexpected bonus! Staff are attentive and polite with excellent facilities throughout the building... Paluchi's restaurant inside served brilliant food and being able to eat on the terrace outside on a warm evening is a really nice touch... The building is vast and with several ornaments and pieces from other Lalit Hotels in Asia is different from many hotels which are bland and formulaic-something which Lalit can never be accused of... We are already counting down the days to our next stay,5,2017,09,06
118,Amazing Hotel,"I absolutely loved my stay at this hotel... The rooms are beautifully finished, the staff incredibly helpful and friendly and the dining room... Wow! The spa was fantastic too... I will definitely be returning!",5,2017,09,03
118,"Lovely place, great massage","Visited the Lalit on a Groupon spa deal. It's a new hotel that is in the original buildings of an old Grammar School. It is an Indian chain of hotels and is absolutely charming. 
The massage was amazing (thank you to Maria, my therapist), the whole experience was really lovely. We took our glass of fizz out on the Terrace of the restaurant and will definitely be returning to try a meal in the truly wonderfully decorated dining room. 
The hotel was quiet as its fairly new and tucked away behind the new buildings of No.1 Tower Bridge. It's sure to be a real gem, although no river views, the whole ambience and lovely interiors, I'm sure, will soon be very popular with diners and evening drinkers. All the staff were excellent.
I recommend a visit before it gets too trendy to book. ",5,2017,09,02
118,Paradise,It is a paradise in the sprawling metropolis! You are treated like royalty and as if this is YOUR home. The staff are friendly and we got a free upgrade. The hotel has everything you never even knew you needed ,5,2017,08,31
118,Great hotel,"excellent stay, amazing hospitality.  Excellent staff, always friendly and welcoming, and smiling (big bonus points!) The umbrella are fantastic and lightweight ideal for easy London commuties.  

The rooms are brilliant, and the tea selection is divine.

One of the best luxury hotels in London, and the room mobile phone (which I am using to write this review with) is an excellent idea, more hotels should use it.  Especially with its own concierge service built in, meaning planning an activity is even easier.

",5,2017,08,30
118,A special place,"Beautiful old grammar school building which has been tastefully converted into an upmarket boutique hotel. Has the feeling of being family owned as the attention to detail And service is far more personalised than you'd expect; given it's just off the banks of the Thames, right by Tower Bridge. The breakfast buffet was excellent and again the service; faultless!! We're definitely going to return again and again. A fabulous place to stopover in central London ",5,2017,08,30
118,Amazing stay at Latitude.,"Fantastic 2 night atay at Lalit,  5 years of preparation make this a must stay. Just around corner from Tower Bridge. Had an upgrade to Suite with views of the RiverThames. Will definitely return. Highly recommended.",5,2017,08,23
118,Weekend stay,New hotel. Really friendly and very grand inside. Very different to mainstream hotels. We stayed one night and they could not do enough for us during the stay. Perhaps a little too intrusive at breakfast checking we were ok but they were simply eager to please. Breakfast was also great. We will stay again. ,5,2017,08,23
118,What a FANTASTIC hotel,"We were so pleased to have stayed here.  We actually arrived on the anniversary of India's independence and could not have had a better stay.  Rooms were so clean, quiet and peaceful that nothing could have been better.  We had dinner in the restaurant the second night and had the waiter help us determine the best food for our taste and it was FANTASTIC!!  
I can not say enough.  The location is right at the Tower Bridge so using the London Pass was perfect.  The history of this school turned hotel is awesome and I will absolutely stay here on my return in a few weeks.",5,2017,08,22
118,Amazing stop over.,"We stayed here for one night after a week around Belgium. We were devastated that we only booked the 1 night. 

From the moment we arrived till we left we were treated like family by the staff and nothing was to much trouble. The room we had was outstanding and done to a very high standard with many little extras put in, the management really have thought of everything to make your stay as comfortable as possible. 

We booked a table in the restaurant for a evening meal, all I can say is WOW. It's without doubt the best Indian food I have ever tasted. I can't remember the name of our waiter but he was a young guy from Goa. He is a credit to your hotel, his knowledge and recommendations of dishes and wine to go with it was superb. 

We will definitely be calling in again the next time we are in London. ",5,2017,08,19
118,Fabulous,"I stayed overnight at this crown jewel of an hotel. The room was really good and comfortable. This converted old school offers courtesy that you do not always find.
The breakfast was not as good as I had hoped though. And I did not really understand why I was over debited on my credit card, to be informed that this was the system and that I would be refunded in two days!
Though this place is really worth a stay if you need to be looked after and relax.",5,2017,08,17
118,Value for money,"Location : 5/5
Facilities : 5/5
Hospitality : 5/5
Food : 5/5
I stayed 6 nights with my family for a vacation, and staying at the lalit made the trip a whole level better. They gave more facilities than what we paid for! So, this was my second stay in London, the first time I stayed in a budget hotel ""President Hotel"" and this time we choose lalit. The location is the best possible, the tower bridge is just a 2min walk, and you can have snacks and drinks or a walk to the Thames River seeing the tower bridge fold. Borough market is a 5min walk too, also the shard is visible clearly and beautifully from the hotel entrance which is a 2 min walk as well.

Talking about facilities, the bathroom is the star, with heated flooring, steam free mirror, electronic toilet seat which is heated as well makes you wish never to leave. We also got a *PHONE* which had special tourist attraction ticket rates, Google maps, free calls to India, overall it was a personal Android for the stay which we could take out when we were roaming. The also provided us with water, world adapter, free mini bar(with Coke, diet Coke, chocolates, coconut water, soda, water) and fruits. All these things were complimentary!!

The staff is lovely and makes you feel at home, they also help you make plans for the day and provide cabs.  ",5,2017,08,17
118,Perfect weekend away,"My partner and I stayed at this 5* hotel in London on the 12/8/17 for the weekend and were not let down at all. The hotel is of complete 5 star standard from rooms to service (everything you can expect). The rooms were immaculate and had everything needed, as was the foyer, dinning area, bar etc. The bar staff were attentive, and made excellent cocktails! The pricing was absolutely fine! Remember...you have booked yourself into an opulent 5 star hotel, so will pay slightly more that your standard watering hole (so don't complain)!
The hotel has been superbly overhauled, as this was a former school, with subtle touches to remind you!
The staff from entry to exit were impeccable.
Vlad, our concierge in the evening, booked us into a local (very popular) restaurant at last minute on a very busy Saturday night! On arrival at the restaurant, we had a table waiting for us, with a complimentary glass of champagne from Vlad at The Lalit......., what can you say, first class standard..thank you!
The hotel is situated in a perfect location, and only a short walk to stations and attractions.
There are other 5* hotels in the area, but this is up there with them and should not be over looked at all.

Thank you for a lovely weekend!

118,Stunning hotel,"What an absolute pleasure it was to have spent two nights in this gorgeous old grammar school which has been painstakingly converted into a super luxurious hotel. From the drapes to floor to everything is of very high standard! I loved my massive room with high tech bathroom!  Service is immaculate.

The staff were very attentive and made our visit special as it was our second wedding anniversary. 

We will definitely visit again and highly recommend it-an oasis of calm, with an air of exclusivity. 

Thank you!",5,2017,08,08

118,Beautiful Hotel,"We visited this hotel for a one night stay as it was my partner's old school 50 years ago! It has been redeveloped with great care and love, the result being a thing of beauty. 
Your every need seems to have been thought of and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful.  Lovely stay.",5,2017,08,04
118,Wonderful,"I stayed here with my wife to celebrate an anniversary. The hotel is beautiful, stunning in fact. 
Staff were very friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome. 
For such a busy location the room was very quiet with none of the outside noise getting in. 
Attention to detail was very evident, both in terms of the decor and facilities, but also the service from staff. Nothing too much for the staff to do to make us feel comfortable. 
Will definitely stay here again. 

",5,2017,08,03
118,Wonderful Hotel,"This is an absolutely beautiful hotel with excellent staff. We had a senior classroom which was well equipped and very quiet despite the central location. We were greeted by lovely staff who were friendly and charming throughout our stay. The rooms are well equipped with lovely extra touches ranging from a stocked free mini bar to fresh fruit and magazines. 
We had cocktails in the lovely bar before going out and they were amazing. Delicious and unusual. 
Nothing was too much trouble for the staff at the hotel, they made us feel so welcome. The hotel is in a great location with so many places to eat and easy walking distance of great sight seeing and venues. 
We can't wait to go back! ",5,2017,08,03
118,Anniversary stay to remember ,"Just spent a night at this lovely hotel and still raving about the wonderful Indian food in the Baluchi restaurant and the great cocktails in the Headmaster's room. Beautiful building, well appointed rooms with an Indian style to the decor. The Great Hall where the restaurant is situated is just amazing - an amazing dark blue vaulted ceiling and stunning blue glass chandeliers - all the furniture is from India. The staff are lovely very welcoming - I was given a tour on arrival and was given an umbrella as I was leaving to go out in the pouring rain. Complimentary drinks, biscuits and fruit in the comfortable bedrooms and great bathrooms. Wished we had more time to use more of the facilities. Will definitely return. Well located close to Tower Bridge, a pleasant walk from London Bridge station.",5,2017,08,03
118,Amazing Experience,My boyfriend and I booked this hotel as we were going to Restaurant Story and wanted to spend a night in London. The restaurant was a 2 minute walk away so the location was perfect. The staff could not do enough for you and were professional and friendly throughout our stay. The room we stayed in was too a high standard and everything was modern and clean. The mini fridge was well stocked and a variety of toiletries were provided. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.,5,2017,08,03
118,Excellent hotel,"We have just stayed for one night and we ate in their restaurant. The hotel is lovely, the staff so pleasant and professional. Our room was a junior classroom, spacious enough, large comfy bed, lovely bathroom with nice complimentary items. The fridge was stocked with nice treats again complimentary. I really could not fault the hotel, and its in a good location, just ten minute walk to the tube. 
 
The restaurant was marvellous. We were served by  Zophia, she was perfect, warm and helpful and nothing too much trouble. She brought chef Jo to meet us and we were able to complement him on the best Indian cuisine we have eaten. Breakfast was also well served with a lovely selection of good quality food. 

I would highly recommend this hotel, and plan to visit again in December .",5,2017,08,02
118,Glorious stay experience ,"Partner and I stayed at the Lalit Hotel at Tower Bridge, London last night. It's a glorious riot of Indian loveliness, with sumptuous embroidered fabrics, rich textile art and contemporary Indian style. The staff are simply delightful. Nothing was too much trouble, and we felt spoiled  by their wonderful service. 

Breakfast was in the vast Baluchi restaurant in the hotel, originally the grand vaulted hall of a grammar school. 

Feeling brave, I abandoned my usual toast and oatmeal, and ordered the Indian breakfast (although I was a little dubious about spiciness first thing in the morning as the pale, wilting northern flower that I am). 

The resulting giant dosa, filled with gently spiced potatoes and served with masala and Indian scrambled eggs was a revelation. Crispy and feather light, with a rich and filling potato interior, any concerns I may have had about eating curry for breakfast were soon dispelled. 

I need to wear my big girl pants and be brave with my breakfast choices more often. Definitely. I you get a chance to, please do stay at this hotel. It's absolutely recommended. ",5,2017,08,01
118,The best,"Comfy rooms, great staff, amazing restaurant. Icing on the cake for me was the big kettle for tea and fully stocked fridge with water, sodas. Loved it. Very quiet and staff were courteous and helpful. Felt super safe as female single passenger thanks to security. ",5,2017,07,30
118,Best authentic Indian food outside India!,"......the closest I've come in London to those wonderful delicately spiced dishes and impeccable service I enjoyed for many years in India.  The waiters have tasted and are knowledgeable about the food and wine, the Great Hall is a beautiful setting and the experience will bring me back on a regular basis.  Thank you Lalit.",5,2017,07,29
118,great boutique hotel Home Away Home,"we stayed at hotel The Lalit London it is a good hotel, room & bathroom amenities were excellent staff is very cooperative.Quality of Food is very good specially Indian Food .  Location of the hotel is great only 1 minuet walk from Tower Bridge  great walk of Tower Bridge  around",5,2017,07,29

At the breakfast table also the staff was always there to fulfill allur requirements. 
We are Indias ",4,2017,07,24
118,Beautiful property with great customer service,"My husband and I just spent 10 days at LaLit London and had a wonderful experience.  This property has only been open since February and it's in a great location near the London Bridge tube.  The hotel has many extra touches that make it special, not the least of which is the excellent customer service.  I would recommend it and would absolutely stay there again if in London.",5,2017,07,19
118,Nice hotel - work in progress?,"I stayed at Lalit for a night in May 2017.  I arrived early with the intention of dropping off my bag. It took a while for anyone to be available in reception and one member of staff simply walked past me at one point.  When I did finally get to speak to someone they were very helpful.

When I returned later in the day it again took a long time for anyone to be available to retrieve my bag and my room key.

I was disappointed to given a ground floor room in which the windows looked out on the office entrance next door. 

The room was however very tastefully decorated and clean.  It wasn't luxurious as such but it was nicely furnished and comfortable with all mod cons.

I had a drink at the bar in the evening which was very pleasant.

Overall, my stay at Lalit was reasonably enjoyable however the staff seemed overrun and still learning the ropes.  Perhaps in time they will improve so I wouldn't object to staying at the hotel again.",4,2017,07,19
118,Excellent stay!,"The Lalit is an amazing property, the room was spacious, the decor beautiful and the food at the local restaurant was absolutely delicious. The absolute best part was the extremely attentive staff. Highly recommend!",5,2017,07,18
118,Best Indian food in London,"We went to this hotel only for our  lunch and hence this review is about the restaurant ONLY. The food was so tasty and authentic and well prepared. The decor in the restaurant was outstanding. They have taken an old classy school and converted to this 5 star hotel with each room having a school name like Head Master's room etc,",5,2017,07,18
118,Sumptuous spa!,We had visited the spa at the Lalit on Saturday and were impressed by the hotel and the facilities. The treatment rooms are very high end and luxurious and each treatment room has its own bathroom with shower. The massages are very good and through. I especially liked the use of hot hotels during the treatment. It's a shame that they don't have steam room and sauna facilities as this would have made the experience more complete. Staff are very welcoming and helpful. The offer of champagne / tea and biscuits was a lovely added touch. Will no don‚Äôt return at some point!,4,2017,07,17
118,The best in London,"Will come back! Perfect location, perfect service, the best concierges we've ever met! Free mini bars, coffee, tea and cookies. Especially recommended for those who loves Indian style and Indian cuisine . Very clean rooms. ",5,2017,07,09
118,"Delicious food, fantastic setting!","Our family group of 7 (5 adults, 2 kids) had an amazing lunch at Baluchi, the hotel's restaurant. First, the setting. As many others may have read, the hotel is housed in a building that used to be a grammar school.  The interior has been fully restored (wood paneling, high ceilings, hardwood floors) and updated with beautiful modern touches. The restaurant is housed in what used to be the assembly hall of the grammar school (I think) and is very airy and spacious. If you go, be sure to look up and check out the massive custom chandeliers designed for the space. Next, the food. Chef Arup and his staff took excellent care of us, even to the extent of catering to some particularly picky child eaters who wanted a slightly less spicy experience :-).  Amazing traditional kababs, dals and vegetarian dishes as well as some new dishes that provide an Indian twist on western ingredients.  Excellent overall presentation of the food as well as very attentive service. Will definitely return next time we are in the city.",5,2017,07,08
118,"The most exotic , warm boutique hotel and great staff","The lalit is an exotic property ,the most luxurious rooms ,with a well connected ( tube station and bus station) , convenient and great location near tower bridge. The hotel's hospitality is commendable with a very welcoming  staff. They make you feel at home and are readily available for everything you need. Special mention about miss Malgorzata who is very friendly specially with the kids. This little school -turned -5star hotel  is very warm and makes you comfortable n fall in love with London and makes your trip all the more enjoyable and luxurious !! We are in love with this gorgeous property and suggest the same to our kins who want to visit London ...",5,2017,07,08
118,Sumptuous room and delightful staff,"A first for us but probably not a last! A little bit off piste but handy for our purpose near London Bridge and a wonderful find to rival the best in the west end. A genoursly sized, quiet room with free (non alcoholic) mini bar to save the hassle of buying water and pop. Comfortable and ambient and the staff were first class throughout. Give it a try.",5,2017,07,05
118,Lovely hotel and great staff in a charming old school,The LaLit is a wonderful in a great location right near to Tower Bridge. The building is an old school which has been tastefully restored and retained many of the original features. I particularly liked how the names of the rooms still refer to the building's history as a school. The room was lovely and the bed is extremely comfortable. Also Baluchis restaurant is excellent indian food - trust me and get the lamb chops! There is also a lovely terrace outside if the weather permits to sip a nice gin and tonic. All in all I highly recommend it when staying in London.,5,2017,07,03
118,Overwhelmingly perfect,"From start to finish, everyone at the Lalit was warm, welcoming and went above and beyond the excellent of customer service we hoped to find. The location, decor and atmosphere here is peaceful, sophisticated and welcoming. ",5,2017,07,02
118,Ok but certainly not value for money,"This is a nice hotel. It's ok the rooms are nothing special a standard hotel room. To call it a boutique hotel I'm not so sure. It seemed very much just another hotel room! 

The food was nice but vastly over priced along with the drinks! We had a nice time but better experience and value else where to be had. I doubt we will keep it on our list to visit again. ",3,2017,06,28
118,Incredible Baluchi Restaurant,"The Baluchi Restaurant is one of the very few restaurants in Central London that delicately balances the authentic taste from India and yet is not afraid to experiment with something bold and different. The menu is versatile and well placed to suit all palates. Overall, a brilliant experience with friendly service and unique ambience no other venue in Central London can match.",5,2017,06,19
118,A new gem on the block,"This recently opened boutique hotel, is beautiful in both appearance, staff and service... we dined there for the first time this week.. the food was fabulous, the surroundings impressive... and all the staff were outstanding, no request too big.. all very welcoming..... we actually felt like we were in India in a beautiful high class Indian hotel... Many thanks to everyone for making it a great night for us all, and special thanks to chef Joman ( great chef and excellent people skills ) and to Joshua Lopez, for his genuine and tangible enthusiasm for this new gem in London, Fab night.... we will see you all soon üòâ.  Jeanette and Archie Martin ",5,2017,06,17
118,Very Good,"Had a wonderful stay at the recently opened Lalit. The property, a neo-baroque former grammar school is a fine building & the renovation has been done luxuriously. There are 70 rooms, mine was pretty compact but flooded with natural light, well equipped & nicely stocked with upmarket products. Loos have heated seats & Toto washlet systems!  I enjoyed peaceful sleep & enjoyed the Tooley Street location which is 5 to 10 minutes walk from London Bridge tube. There is no parking at the hotel. The reception team were polished, bar service similarly so. I found the bar/lounges rather hotely, quite formal, not comfy. The Baluchi restaurant (Indian cuisine) the same, the grand hall setting is impressive but it lacks warmth & is somewhat soulless. On the whole though, doing a good job & you can expect a polished stay & good service.",5,2017,06,15
118,STAY HERE - 5* property with all of the charm so many business hotels lack,"I am a very frequent traveler to London (about 1x/month), and have stayed at almost every 5 star hotel in Central London. I will be returning to LaLit with extreme pleasure - this place really makes business travel bearable. In sum, the property has been tastefully and meticulously remodeled - no expenses spared from wooden inlaid ceilings to superb marble work on the floors. The rooms are spacious and unique. The staff bend over backwards to be helpful - especially Anita and Felix! What stars! Really great.

PROS
1. Rooms - quirky, tasteful, technologically hip (Bluetooth speakers and remote control blinds), great toiletries, nice sheets and fantastic light/space ...very high ceilings and big windows. Not your average hotel room boxes!! Loved the free mini bar and big closets! 
2. Staff - again, everyone here should be commended on their attitude from the bell boy, housekeeper to the senior manager. They are helpful and eager to please. I stayed for a long time and felt like it was a second home. Thank you Anita, Felix and everyone else!
3. Facilities - I made ample use of the spa, room service, the gym, the bar and restaurant. I'm very fussy and do not have a single complaint. Very great products/services at reasonable prices. 

Okay so the hotel is brand new and there may have been a few teething problems here and there, but I have found my new go-to London hotel. Also, ask for higher level room if ground noise bothers you. And not all rooms have bathtubs. Those are my only gripes. 

But I love LaLit! Will be back. Thanks guys.

118,Most expensive glass of wine EVER!,I joined a party on the terrace for drinks one evening this week and was presented a bill of over ¬£21 for ONE glass of sauvignon blanc wine (N.B. Not a bottle). I was incredulous but didn't want to cause a scene for my friend's sake so dutifully paid. I will never be going there again and will not recommend to anyone else.,1,2017,06,09
118,Drinks with colleagues ,"Just had the most amazing evening in this fabulous building. Upon a recommendation from a colleague, few of us decided to visit the place for drinks. Upon arrival we were greeted by a very pleasant lady. We were seated in Headmaster's room with original ceilings, gorgeous fireplace and beautiful original ceilings. We were told that the tables and chairs were designed and made in India. The drinks menu had lots of choice of cocktails and spirits. Our party ordered few different cocktails and they were all very nice and strong üòÄ. 

It's unusual to comment on the toilets but I must because they deserve a mention here. The seats are heated with electronic controls and the hand wash/ hand cream are gorgeous. 

This place is worth a visit for exceptional customer service, attention to detail and great cocktails. ",5,2017,06,07
118,Restaurant experience was incredible,"The moment from when we entered the hotel to the moment we left, we were looked after and catered for. 

Upon looking at the menu, we ordered starters based on fish and we all recieved our dishes cooked to perfection with just enough spices to enhance the flavour and not overpower the dish. 

When faced witha difficult choice for the main course, the waiter recommended speaking to Chef Joe, who made his way to our table and gave his two cents on what to order. We ordered a lamb shank for the table, and another couple of dishes. The only shame was that we didn't each order the lamb shank as we wanted to try different things as a group. It was prepared deliciously and Chef Joe explained the process behind preparing it. 

Following that we ordered paan ice cream which brought an already good day to a beautiful end. The paan complimented the ice cream well and put to rest some of my prejudices on mixing paan and ice cream together",5,2017,06,05
118,Beautiful building transformed from an historic old school to a smart modern hotel.,"Great location near Tower Bridge and the Embankment walkway. Large, comfortable rooms extremely well-equipped, quiet and stylish. The public areas use many of the old school features including a stunning dining room where once the whole school assembled. A tasty modern menu of Indian style with some British influences offers something for everyone. Above all else helpful staff make the whole stay a pleasure.",5,2017,06,04
118,"Great Staff, newly opened hotel and needs some fine tuning.","My wife and I stayed in this recently opened hotel and were very impressed with the building and the fittings/d√©cor. ALL of the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly.
Our room was very comfortable and well equipped but there was a major downside in that we were not able to operate the air conditioning as (as we discovered when checking out) the manager had switched the air conditioning to ""Central Control"" to save costs!!!!
The only other disappointment was the breakfast, which was buffet style (with an Indian option) but the options were not of 5* level and the fresh fruit selection quite poor.
We have determined to re-visit later this year to see how things have developed but, currently, we have better options for choice in the capital.",4,2017,05,31
118,great new hotel,"we stayed at this hotel for 3 weeks while awaiting for a new home.
The staff were always happy and always on hand to help with anything.
The food and service is the best we have had from any 5 star london hotel.
A new hotel that i would highly recommend for families or couples.
A must try is the restaurant beautiful food.
Will definitely be returning to this hotel.",5,2017,05,26
118,"Cocktails, Class & Company","Myself and friends were staying locally in an apartment close to Tower Bridge and decided to pop in for a cocktail. I can absolutely say what a fabulous find ! The staff could not have been friendlier - nothing was too much trouble as we were seated and there was a distinct lack of feeling awkward on occasions when you walk into a bar as a group of ladies. The bar was well lit and perfect for our girly gathering, lots of fabulous cocktails and an extensive well stocked bar. Not overpriced considering the class of this establishment either.
We all chose different cocktails - which all came is pretty glasses and were very well made by a very efficient cocktail waiter. Then came delicious small dishes, containing pop corn,  olives and capers - the olives in particular were exceptional.
We were dining elsewhere but pledged to return at some point to try the food - the aromas of which smelled divine.
Following lunch elsewhere and trips to various points across the city - we decided upon a return to our new favourite venue, but now also accompanied by my daughter - who works very locally and had not heard of this place. She was very keen to come along and test it. Another cocktail for us all and again excellent five star service and a great welcome by different staff.
 My daughter chose a light snack form the menu - marsala fries and a spiced roll. She pronounced the food excellent although it was just off the snack menu - we were all suitably impressed by the presentation of the fries in small bicycle baskets !
What a treat and what a find - very very impressed on all levels.",5,2017,05,22
118,Charming New Hotel - chic and comfortable,"The staff was excellent....very eager to please. The rooms are well-appointed and comfortable. Really would give a 4.5 rating. A really nice stay in London. Only suggestion is better lighting for makeup in bathroom. Otherwise, very nicely appointed bathroom with a Toto washlet....nice shower and lots of space. Room was spacious with complimentary mini-bar and wi-fi. Overall a superb place to stay in London!!",4,2017,05,21
118,Fantastic experience. The best of India and England together.,"The Lalit in London is brand new. It just opened February 2017. I have spent 4 days there and the experience has been fantastic. The renovation of this old school has been made very generously. The breakfast/dining room is amazing. The staff is very professional and solution oriented. The rooms are very cosy, and have very comfortable and beautiful bathrooms Andy include complimentary mini bar. The breakfast is wonderful (don't forget to ask for the menu) with a lot of Indian specials like a marvelous sweet Lassi, impressive paragraph and dosa for example but also perfect egg Benedict. At every moment the staff will make sure your experience turns out to be a unique mix from there best of India and best of English welcome know how. I would definitely love to be back!",5,2017,05,21
118,Liam,"Very well appointed, the rooms are very comfortable and the wifi is excellent.  The staff are polit, attentive and create a great first impression. The restaurant attached offers a great dining experience. I would definitely recommend it.",5,2017,05,18
118,Wonderful! Nicola at Rejuve Spa is AMAZING!,"I live literally next door to the La Lit and recently visited Rejuve spa with my mum who came down from Scotland for a visit. I bought two Swedish massages through an online deal and can honestly say, I was not only astonished by how good the massage was but also by the amazing staff in the spa and hotel. From your first 'Namaskar' as you enter, you are treated like the most important visitor there has ever been. The customer service I received from the spa manager, Nicola and her team was second to none. We were escorted to the spa by a member of hotel staff where Nicola met us and made us feel at ease, and showed us to our own private massage rooms. The next hour of treatment was complete bliss! I have had massages in 5 star hotels and spa's worldwide and the La Lit experience ranks as my number 1. When my treatment was over, I was given some beautiful Indian Turmeric Coconut water and was left to relax and shower in my private room. When my mum finally surfaced from her room, she looked 10 years younger!, if not slightly sleepy :-) To quote her '...it was the best massage I have ever had and I can't wait to come back'. We then went to the bar for our glass of Champagne which Nicola had already called ahead to arrange with the bar staff.  We all know that some 5 star hotels and spa's, particularly in London, can be intimidating, but La Lit is not. They have got it right in every way. I really cannot recommend Rejuve spa enough. Nicola and her team will ensure you have a 5 star experience and I for one, cannot wait to go back!",5,2017,05,17
118,My trip,"Great location, excellent accommodation, friendly service only stayed for 1 night  in May but would recommend it but book in advance 

Lovely to be able to stroll along the Thames next to Tower bridge stunning views",4,2017,05,15
118,Superb ,"The hotel is in a great location, inside it is beautiful with real character and the bedrooms are very well appointed. The service was excellent and staff delightful (unfortunately I was unwell during our stay and they could not have been more kind or thoughtful). The Spa treatments too were divine. Thank you to everyone there for a fabulous stay, we will definitely be coming back to LaLit. ",5,2017,05,15
118,Oasis in the City!,"I popped in on the way home with a friend recently for a cocktail or two and was pleasantly surprised by the sympathetic and interesting conversion of this beautiful old building. 

The hotel exudes opulence from the moment you enter, with fabulous decor and friendly staff.

The cocktail menu is detailed and the drinks we had were unusual and perfectly balanced.  

I'd love an excuse to stay here, but for now I'll just pop in to enjoy the bar and ambience! ",5,2017,05,12
118,Anniversary Meal,"We were walking past when suddenly the most amazing aromas hit us.  My wife then decided that this was most definitely the place for us to enjoy our 10th Year Anniversary Meal. We weren't particularly dressed up for going out as we had been out all day, however this was no issue & a warm welcome was offered immediately to us.  To put it simply we both had probably the best Indian cuisine we've ever had! It's not cheap by any means but the quality is perfect.  We were also then given a tour of the whole hotel which was a lovely gesture & to be honest we will most likely stay here the next time we are up in town. Such a warm welcome from everyone makes all the difference & we really hope this new hotel & fabulous restaurant does wellüëåüçæ Highly recommend this experience to anyone  üòâ ",5,2017,05,08
118,"Excellent clean Hotel, owesome Staff , amazing location,","Namaskar!

The Hotel is clean, new and modern room equipped with high tech facility. The bed and pillow very comfortable help to have good sleep. Everything available at the Bathroom, very nice functionality. Even if you forgot to bring your teeth brush it is there and more it is really amazing. 
Free rich mini bar which is unique provided by Lalit hotel very generous and extraordinary.
Restaurant food is very delicious.
Staff, very professional and helpful. To be honest due to the current political situation specially in Middle East I was a bit concerned about how they will treat a lady wearing a vail but to be honest I have been treated in a very humanity and respectful , much better of what I faced in Europe in specific.

I would love to go again to London much more visiting Europe  

The location of the hotel is fantastic.
",5,2017,05,02
118,Charming Indian-British blend,"Very interesting hotel located very near Tower Bridge in a former School - was given an Indian touch by its founder, with great taste, whilst keeping some of the former school elements.
My room was very pleasant - wooden floor (instead of those old-fashioned typical carpets) and modern simple furniture - comfortable bed, nice widows providing natural light. The shower is wide and the heated floor a welcome addition.
The breakfast is rather simple and probably not worth a detour.
We tried dinner at the Indian restaurant - slightly more original dishes than the usual Indian venue, well presented, right amount of spice.
Overall, a pleasant discovery, still requires more practice to be where it wants to be, but a lot of goodwill and plenty of nice ideas and very good room - I will return for the nice blend of british spirit with an Indian taste..",4,2017,05,01
118,Great Spa Experience with fabulous service,"This was the marvellous experience which I can not appreciated more with my partner. I had the fantastic experience in the Spa Lalit hotel, with the extreme friendliness and warm welcome from the spa therapist Orietta Matera. After I explained the reasons for the urgency of my last minute for the reservation in the spa, they stayed for longer in order to make it happen for my boy friend and I, which I could not appreciated more. The atmosphere in the spa was fabulous which fit perfectly with the theme of the hotel, with all the classy and first classes vip rooms and bathroom, which has highlighted my weekend for my partner and me. After the spa, we were offered with glass of champagne by the bar with the most 'delicious' water (apparently it is one of the signature from the hotel by having different flavour by exclusively designed water). To draw the line, this is such a great experience will definitely come back soon!  Thanks for the lovely time!",5,2017,05,01
118,Perfect Experience - Twice in a Row!,"My mother has stayed here twice in the past two weeks and on both occasions it has been absolutely perfect and met all of our very high expectations. 

The hotel opened this year in a listed historic building located within walking distance to several London attractions: Tower Bridge, the lovely riverside area of Shad Thames, Potters Field (where London City Hall is located), Borough Market and London Bridge. 

The property was previously a grammar school dating from the 1800's and much care has been taken to preserve the beautiful and striking historical features of the building. At the same time, the Indian heritage of the Lalit chain has been thoughtfully incorporated into the decoration with breathtaking interior design throughout. 

The customer service is phenomenal. We had a fascinating tour of the building. But more generally, everyone here is extremely eager to help and to make sure your stay is not only comfortable but also truly memorable and special. They have repeadedly taken excellent care of my mother - who has some slight mobility issues. 

Of course, the hotel is immaculately clean, modern and relaxing. Despite its central location in the middle of London, it is very quiet. 

We have enjoyed several meals as room service and the food has been fantastic. We cannot wait to have a meal in the breathtaking main dining room. We saw the spa and gym, which both looked impeccable. 

Fantastic hotel and an impressive and very happy experience from two picky travellers! We could not be more pleased.",5,2017,05,01
118,Disappoitment,"Sunday April 9th 2017, I phoned the LaLit Hotel to book for a High Chai for three people on Thursday 20th April.  I explained it was for a friend's birthday surprise as he had been a pupil at St Olave‚Äôs Grammar School back in the 1950s.   We duly arrived and were given a nice welcome at 1:00 pm for the High Chai starting at 1:30.   Having a little time to spare we asked to be shown round, this was by far the best part of our visit.

We had time to have a drink while waiting for the third person of our party to arrive.   We were the only people in the bar, and during this time the barman decided to use an ice-crushing machine which was so noisy that you could not have a conversation.   Our two over-priced drinks took over 10 minutes to arrive! We were then taken to the Great Hall, not the Balcony where we had been told High Chai would be served.   Apart from the three of us, there were two other people seated at a table near the window who were not there long, plus another table occupied behind carved wooden screens.

The staff were pleasant and but really didn‚Äôt explain the menu properly, although as a birthday plus, a double serving of St Olave‚Äôs Tea was given to my friend, the ex-pupil. The other two of us had the High Chai.  The St Olave‚Äôs sandwiches'  bread was dry and stale and cut very thick, although the crusts were cut off (!); the two scones were incredibly dry and there was no butter to put on, only cream and jam. I learnt later in a phone call that the kitchens were not officially opened until the end of April, and I suspect the food had actually been brought in.   

There were at least seven members of staff congregated at the end of the dining hall, discussing change over; hours are 8 am ‚Äì 2 pm then 2- 8 pm.  Is this really 
the way to give customers continuity or proper service in a top hotel?   

I was very disappointed that I was not given proper information when booking for this special occasion. It would have been helpful if I had been told that the hotel was still in ‚ÄúSoft Opening‚Äù phase, after all, the hotel opened in February! 

It was crazy expensive too, the prices were far too high for the quality of the food.  When I spoke to the food & beverages manager on the phone afterwards, she thanked me for my feedback, but she made no suggestion of a refund. She only wanted me to let them know when I would be in London again and to book so that they could give me better attention! I wonder.

It was all a great pity, as it‚Äôs a nice venue with an interesting history.",1,2017,04,29
118,Great central London hotel,"Have stayed there twice on business trips.   Superb service, spotlessly clean and fair price.  Highly recommend. The architecture of this former schools is very interesting.  For example, the dining room has 40 foot ceilings with beautiful chandeliers.",5,2017,04,29
118,"Great afternoon tea, fantastic hotel","Sampled the afternoon tea, both Indian high chai and classic English. Its a beautiful hotel, lovely people and service, nice classic Indian food but needs to be pushed to bring out authentic Indian flavours as they are in Lalit hotels in India. Well worth visiting, will be trying out the lunch menu next.

118,Great Birthday Experience,"We stayed here for one night for my partners birthday in March. We had the most amazing time, the staff all knew it was a special occasion and as such we received an upgraded room, cake and balloons in the room. Dinner in the hotel restaurant was fantastic as was the cocktails in the bar before. Everyone was extremely attentive and I have no doubt that the hotel will do exceptionally well. The only small disappointment was that breakfast took a considerable time to order in the morning, however this did not spoil our stay at all.",5,2017,04,24
118,The best friendliest most beautiful hotel in London,"My wife took me as a surprise for my birthday, she had asked for a cake and a bottle of champagne to be in the room, we found these both there when we checked in which by the way we were early (12:00) and nothing was a problem, the cake was Devine and the the champagne was amazing both on the house which was a really nice touch, the staff could not have been better, I would say perfect, polite, attentive and friendly, the room was outstanding, especially the toilet......you'll understand when you visit, the hotel that is......the concierge was knowledgable and very very helpful, we had breakfast which was outstanding and substantial, in a nut shell the stay was simply perfect, we are very well travelled and cannot fault anything about this hotel, well done to all staff and management as you have created true fans who will never stay anywhere else when visiting london.",5,2017,04,23

118,The Best Indian Spa in the world,"I was treated to this indulgent luxurious mothers day gift by my Son and my Son in law, they both love the Restaurant Baluchi  here and wanted to get me the mothers day indulgence package which included a glass of complimentary champagne.
The therapist Lucia was truly gifted at the art of Massage and made me feel totally at peace and relaxed, I was able to completely unwind from my daily stresses of my corporate life in the city.
After the massage I was passing through the Lobby on my way out and the reception staff greeted me by all saying 'Namaskar' which is a formal way of greeting in India, the lovely Italian receptionist then proceeded to show me around the hotel and she offered me a show around,  she told me all about the hotels features and the history and I can tell she is very well trained, then after seeing the glorious Blue Room Gallery  I was taken in to the most stunning suite I have ever seen in any 5 Star Hotel in London and believe me I have stayed at The Ritz, The Dorchester and The Mandarin Oriental. The ceiling height and the stunning views from this suite were spectacular. I could see The Thames River, The Shard and the hotel is located next to a beautiful garden and the suites have a very pleasant outlook over this. I was flabbergasted by the most opulent and luxurious bathrooms I have ever seen in London they have Toto toilets (electric) they have heated steam free mirrors and also heated floors. I judge hotels by the quality of the bathrooms an this is One Fine Stay!
I will be back and I will be telling all my friends and family about it this amazing hotel and the beautiful restaurant which has a great outdoor terrace for afternoon tea which is available as either Indian or English.

118,Upmarket hotel by fanous Tower bridge,"Stayed at Lalit for the first time and the experience was really great. The warm reception by the front door person and the ladies at the check-in was first class.
We were taken to the hotel room by the young lady to show us the room and the various functions, very nice touch.
The hotel is a located in a good location and you are not far from tube stations, bus stops and easy walk to nearby places well worth a visit.
We had a pre-dinner drink in the cozy little bar which had the right ambience for a quite drink.

118,Fantastic Bar with fantastic staff! Great new addition to the area ,"Living in Shad Thames it's always exciting to have a new local where you can enjoy a exquisite cocktail. Carlo's menu is full of new and interesting flavour combinations, alternatively he will shake, stir or muddle you a bespoke cocktail to your taste or fix you a classic. Having been a number of times now I always look forward to returning for a pre-dinner cocktail or to enjoy one of the few outside seating areas to enjoy the evening spring sun on the Southbank. Next stop, Rejuve - The Spa :)",5,2017,04,11
118,Hospitality at its best!!!!!!!!,"What an amazing experience we had. Highly recommended. Super efficient staff specially the management in the lobby welcoming the guests which one doesn't see that often in a hotel.

118,A great stay!,"I heard about this hotel from a friend who has stayed in the Lalit hotels in India and recommended I try their new hotel in London as I was coming down for business. I checked in late in the evening and they took me straight to the room for the check in! The receptionists were so nice and welcoming and greeted us with a traditional Indian greeting! Sam who was at the reception gave us a show around and told us all about the history of the hotel. Felix at the concierge recommended some great local Italian restaurants for us. The hotel is very beautiful and atmospheric, and the rooms are so comfortable; the showers are incredible! It is a small hotel but they are big with their hospitality! I'm definitely coming back! ",5,2017,04,08
118,Beautiful!,"I'm lucky to live almost next door to The Lalit London and have watched the restoration of this stunning building. It's our favourite place for a cocktail...we're not talking here about a quick Mohito, these are a true art form. It's almost as much fun watching the guys making them as it is to drink them! And the service? Well, that's divine. Dinner next I think. I'll report back!",5,2017,04,08
118,Lovely Building and wonderful staff,"I visited with my girlfriend to have some drinks in the bar and i was really pleased with the service we received, the waiter knew exactly what to recommend us based on our taste preferences. the drinks were top of the range for sure. Apart from that, the building is absolutely stunning...When you walk into the main entrance you are greeted by the concierge in an indian costume, very unique! love the atmosphere and vibe they are going for. Would highly recommend... and will definitely be back to have a meal in the restaurant.",5,2017,04,06
118,Wonderful week day lunch,"I had an excellent lunch at the hotel which is near my office in the City of London, just a short walk over the river, the manager Arun and his team including Dominique and Arup stopped by to say hello as I had my lunch and I was very impressed with the decor, the food, wine, service and good atmosphere. Will return! David",5,2017,04,06
118,Friends reunion,"The primary reason for choosing this hotel was that it is situated in the building originally housing my old school. This building has been sensitively converted for its current use, maintaining and enhancing some of the original features.
Service was good and food excellent, however some work is required in providing appropriate background music and managing the acoustics in the bar area and restaurant.",4,2017,04,05
118,Trying hard,"Great experience with this fairly new hotel.  Still some details to improve, but in overall a great experience. Staff extra nice.  Well located. Indian flavor not only in the food, but rooms, and the whole package. Good value for money.",5,2017,04,05
118,Pretty but a little overpriced.,"Beautiful and slightly quirky place in a great location. The room was very serene and loved the attention to detail and thoughtful bits and bobs.
Room wasn't too pricey but I think it'll go up as it'd just opened - food and drinks were overpriced. ",4,2017,04,02
118,FINE DINING,"Had lunch at the Baluchi Restaurant in the LALIT HOTEL. The food was excellent, staff very polite and courteous and the service was spot on. 
The Hotel is walking distance  to Tower Bridge on the South bank",4,2017,04,01
118,New hotel!,"This hotel has only been open a month or so and was impeccable. The staff were perfect. Bit tricky with parking (there isn't any) so you'll have to arrange something upfront, and the surrounding road access is a little confusing if you don't approach from the London Bridge end, but apart from that a great location for the Shard (and it's attractions), Borough Market, London Bridge Station and Tower Bridge sightseeing.",5,2017,03,30
118,Outstanding new hotel - just need to to work out a couple of kinks,"Stayed here for 4 nights on business.  Wonderful location, right next to Tower Bridge on the South Bank, short walk to London Bridge tube.  A converted school with very spacious and comfortable rooms (complementary minibar with soft drinks, heated bathroom floor, spectacular dining room in the old school hall).  Service was outstanding.  Just two minor quibbles --  the high speed internet never worked properly and service at breakfast was a little slow despite me bing the only guest in the restaurant.  Notwithstanding I will be back ",5,2017,03,27
118,Back to school,"It is rare to be able to go back to school which i left 60 years ago and stay in a 5 star hotel, always a beautiful building but the alteations inside to turn it into a hotel are really stunning.
I was invited to stay as a previous pupil of St Olives Grammer School, the school moved to Orpington, Kent in 1968, so my room was free but i paid for dining ,bar etc
We were in a Junior Classroom but having touredthe Hotel all of the rooms are outfitted to the same standard, comfortable bed, extremely good shower with the usual soaps and shampoos. Flowers in the room with a bowl of fruit.
The restaurant in the hall is a superb place to eat, not like it used to be when i had lunch every day, and the food is Indian cuisine at its best, my wife does not like hot spicy food but she was advised and the food cooked to her taste which she enjoyed.
An enjoyable anniversary for us in an exceptional hotel with attentive and friendly staff and we will go again. While i was at the school I was a local Bermondsey boy but now live in Staffordshire.",5,2017,03,27
118,Ultimate luxury and customer service,"From the minute I entered The LaLit, the customer service experience was outstanding! All staff were considerate, highly trained and attentive. My room was stunning - clean, high design and views of the Shard. 
I had wanted to book in to Baluchi, and as a vegan, the chef came to meet me and prepared a number of bespoke dishes. Also, the bar staff recommended perfect cocktails based on our tastes. 
Again, the breakfast chef cooked a special dish, always going the extra mile! Spa was beautiful and treatments tailored to individual needs.
On a design note, the building is a converted grammar school, with beautiful references throughout. 
Special thanks to Arun, Andrea, Josh and the spa staff. Would love to come again!",5,2017,03,27
118,Gorgeous boutique property,"Stayed here for the official launch of the property in January.  The hotel is conveniently located about 500m from the London Bridge underground station and even tower bridge is just around the corner.  Gorgeous old grammar school that has been lovingly restored and converted into a charming little hotel.  As this was a launch had a chance to see a lot of the rooms - large by London standards with spacious bathrooms,  the hotel was still in the final phase of getting ready for their launch so understandably a lot of extra staff and a lot of movement getting ready for the event.  We stayed in a suite overlooking Tooley street - but the room was well insulated so not much noise from the road - great sunshine to wake up to - the blackouts were very effective.  Lovely freestanding bath in the bathroom with a separate shower.  No real reception just a couple of tables of the main foyer where you are received before checkin formalities are completed in the room.  Super comfy beds, speedy wifi and enough plugs for all your devices.
The bar with Joshua at the helm is amazing with some really creative cocktails - but the star of the hotel is the great hall - the main restaurant that provides all day dining as well as the hotel's specialty restaurant is housed here along with its bread bar ""the nan-ary"" is housed here.  Spectacular space which only serves to amplify the quality food available here.  An overlooking balcony is used for tea service.
Lovely stay with great hospitality - things were a little manic given the launch but look forward to my next visit and a chance to truly experience this spot as a regular guest!

118,Big comfy beds,"This place is fantastic, it will become my regular London hotel. 
It is so close to Mayors office and great for business trips and romantic weekends I liked the old building as it is grade two listed and it is very boutique, the service was exceptional and Shilpi told me that hotel used to be St Olaves boys school so it has a lot of history which is much nicer than all the other new hotels in the area",5,2017,03,25
118,Jennifer b,"Wonderful hotel! My husband and I have stayed at The Lalit three times since the opening of this lovely hotel and will definitely stay again when we return to London later this year. The staff are friendly and attentive and the hotel itself is beautiful. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and well equipped. 

Many  thanks to executive chef, Arup Kumar Dasgupta, for the great meal we enjoyed in the beautiful Baluchi restaurant. 

A lovely place to stay in London. ",5,2017,03,22
118,Wonderful New Hotel,"I visited this hotel just after the opening and was blown away by the building (a renovated school with a wonderful history) and as for the staff...Extraordinary hospitality. Rooms are beautifully appointed with lots of practical touches and the main hall available for breakfast lunch and dinner was magnificent. The school theme is continued throughout so you are allocated classrooms. 

Everyone is eager to please and the location between Tower Bridge and London Bridge station is ideal for a walk to offices in the city over the bridge or to London Bridge tube station.

Great job.",5,2017,03,15
118,Excellent  lunch experience,"My wife and I enjoyed an excellent lunch on the Saturday just after the Hotel had opened. We we the only people eating and were outnumbered by the staff who were attentive and friendly without  being intrusive. I am a lover of Indian Cuisine and our biggest  problem was deciding what to choose from the  exciting dishes on the menu. In the end I opted for the Kashmiri Roganjosh - Romney Marsh lamb cooked in the Kashmiri way. My wife chose the Awadhi Murgh Biriani - free range Norfolk black leg chichen cooked in the Lucknow fashion. Both were first class examples of using the best of British ingredients cooked in an Indian way, Our starters and deserts were equally good.
 I had eaten in restaurant over 50 years previously when it was the dining Hall of St Olave's Grammar School. The lunch we enjoyed in the Baluchi was infinitey better than the school dinners of old! We hope to return",5,2017,03,13
118,Beautiful venue,"We went for a glass of champagne at Lalit,  We were very impressed by the Decor of the Hotel, and the staff were exceptionally friendly and accommodating.  A beautiful hotel worth a visit just to see the dining room and bar - lovely experience.",5,2017,03,11
118,Fabulous ,"Will begin this by complementing Sohaib, the unobtrusive waiter who looked after us with such diligence and care . Well done 

The tea selecting process was like a chemistry lab experiment . Then came the outstanding savoury bites and our favourites were katti roll, samosas, bhel and lassi to go with it . This was followed by to die for shreekhand, ghajar halwa in a cone, cashew burfi , mini ladoos, and an interesting scone . Loved the cutting chai that went with it .

Wish all of you the very best and we will be back to stay and savour the other delicacies and enjoy the hospitality ",5,2017,03,11
118,"Most amazing Decor, Grade 2 listed building by the thames.","On arrival we had the best ""bloody Mary"" cocktail and a comprehensive wine list with wines from India. Very interesting menu, A French based with an Asian twist.

118,Luxuriously Hospitable,"When I say, ""luxury befitting a queen,"" it doesn't remain a phrase with The Lalit London. It is a fact. 

The effort put into every single detail during my stay was astounding, to say the least. I know of this level of hospitality in India, but to carry the tone across to an international destination, speaks volumes on the commitment of The Lalit Hotels.

I don't use adjectives like ""stupendous"" ""enthralled"" or ""speechless"" easily, but between the service, the food, and the grandly restored property, these words seem appropriate for The Lalit London.

For me, the luxury is in the detail. The glorious dining hall with the majestic Indian blue chandeliers, the phenomenal Indian dinner, to the international day menu, the lounge and the bar with perfect cocktails and champagne, the fine silk embroidered tapestry in the rooms, the heated floors, the divine spa treatment, all in the backdrop of Victorian, meets contemporary yet Indian luxury boutique chicness, tied together with the signature of their warm greeting- Namaskar. I was spoilt over the 4-day stay and it was a splendid! I cannot wait to go back.",5,2017,03,06
118,Great Stay & Hospitality,"I stayed at Lalit for about 5 nights - overall the hotel was great in every sense, starting from the food @ Baluchi - which has some really interesting contemporary India dishes.. Going on the the Gym which is just the perfect size with the right equiptment for a quick work out while on business. 

The rooms itself were spacious and well kitted specially the expresso machine, loved the bathroom in particular with the fancy TOTO fittings :)

Indian hospitality at its best.. Keep up the great work.",5,2017,02,27
118,'It stands alone' is the only way I can describe The Lalit London,"Superb boutique hotel. They pamper you from the minute you arrive. Great location and they have amazingly restored this heritage property. And I was absolutely blown away with their restaurant Baluchi, 
Can't recommend more highly.",5,2017,02,26
118,40th anniversary celebration,"When your about to celebrate 40 years of marriage you want somewhere special to stay and to eat, what a great decision it was that we picked the new Lalit Hotel in London. We received a traditional Namaste welcome from all of the staff who are at the top of their game, our room was impeccable with such a brilliant attention to detail.

Awesome.",5,2017,02,20
118,Great hotel in that area of London,"Wonderful room, solid amenities, good staff.  Located near to Tower of London across the Thames, but reasonably easy to get around London,  The building is beautiful, the rooms are generous, and the services at good.  The restaurant is also quite nice.",5,2017,02,19
118,Stunning Boutique Hotel with the best hospitality,"I had the pleasure of spending a week at The Lalit London. I can't begin to describe how beautiful this boutique hotel is. It is definitely one of my favourite hotels in London. 

Conveniently located from Tower Bridge station and a 5 min walk to Borough Market! This hotel has excellent hospitality from the minute you walk in. The rooms are nice and spacious and bathroom is amazing! 

Considering I'm not one to eat Indian food outside of India, the food at Baluchi was excellent. Especially the different types of Naans from the Naanery. They have the nicest bar with the best wine and cocktail selection.

The entire hotel is so warm and it gives you feel of home.",5,2017,02,18
118,Classic Top End Boutique personalised feel,Food is amazing and delectable. Rooms are large with all modern facilities. The view of Potters Field Park and City Hall was amazing. The Bar and Spa is unique. Yoga facilities are also available. There is so much to do with local markets buzzing all year around.,5,2017,02,16
118,"A great mix of excellent location, Indian hospitality, British heritage and Modern amenities.","I just got back from my London holiday and my stay at The lalit London was simply amazing.
The hotel is 5 mins walk from Tower Bridge and 2 mins away from London bridge Tube Station making it super convenient for both work and pleasure.
The hotel is in a building which housed a school and the owners have ensured that all that old heritage including original ceiling work is maintained and has been carefully restored.
Check in was smooth and one can even get airport transfers at an additional price. They even do fast track immigration if one is taking their bigger suites and staying for long. For non EU Passport holders, that could be a great advantage. 
My room was on 2nd floor and it was super cosy, noise free and comfortable. The interiors are a reflection of Indian culture. Lalit group has ensured that ""Indian culture"" isn't forgotten anywhere in the hotel. Be it rooms, food, decor, restaurants to even greetings by staff where a ""Namaskaar"" welcomes you everywhere you go. 
What I loved was the heated floor of bathroom along with heated WC and no fog mirrors. They really do make London winters bearable.
Food at Baluchi was outstanding as always. That has also become a hallmark of The Lalit. Be it Delhi, Bangalore and now even London... The restaurant in this hotel is an amazing experience in itself. High blue ceilings along with blue chandeliers and huge windows make all meals pleasurable. The restaurant is so pretty that ""One can just keep on staring at the ceiling"". 
The bar is very English and the men behind the counter make some lethal cocktails. Both gym and spa added the much needed rejuv element to my stay. 
The whole experience of staying at The Lalit was simply wonderful and something that will keep on bringing me back to London. I just didn't want to leave.",5,2017,02,15
118,The best of India in London,"The location first, is perfect: Tower Bridge, 5 minute walk from Borough Market and The Shard, 15 minutes drive from St Pancras and the Eurostar, 5 stations from Mayfair. The hotel is splendid, it was a former school, and is still very beautiful: the original staircase, the restaurant room all repainted in royal blue with this magnificent chandeliers (one ton each!), the indian works of arts on the walls. The rooms are comfortable and cosy and full of light: the bed is fantastic, and the bathroom is great too, with the heated floor and mirror (and the japanese toilet..) Also, there is a naan bar, and who doesn't love naans? There are delicious pancakes for breakfast, and traditional indian meals too. I felt so good and comfortable during my stay there.",5,2017,01,30
118,simply perfect,"our stay was a complete delight. We  stayed in a very beautiful suite, with an amazing view on the Thames and the City. We will come back in this hotel for sure.

Small and very nice. Away from the hustle and bustle of the big city. You feel very welcome and appreciated.

The staff was very kind and helpful in explaining and recommending the dishes which turned out to be excellent! We had never eaten Indian here and found a wonderful combination of flavours!
I thank Gayathre and Gusuder (to whom I apologize if I spelled the name wrong) for their kindness and for being able to understand our needs and recommend excellent dishes! We also thank Rasel who proved to be quick and with a solution ready for the most demanding needs!
Super recommended!!",5,2023,12,16
118,Romantische Unterkunft direkt an der Tower Bridge,"Super Lage und romantisches Schulgeb√§ude mit seeeehr nettem Personal, insbesondere im Rezeptionsbereich. Und einem tollen Restaurant! Mega! Und die Betten waren ausgesprochen bequem. Das Bad hatte ein high light; die Toilette war beheizt!  Alles very british und passend zum historischen Geb√§ude. 
Die Tower Bridge ( 5 Minuten entfernt )und Metro Station lagen in der N√§he. Zudem hielt der sight seeing Bus direkt gegen√ºber. Borough market und Tate modern waren ebenso zu Fu√ü super zu erreichen. 

Jederzeit wieder!!! ",5,2023,06,05
118,Bello ma non bellissimo,"Tre notti in questo bell‚Äôhotel vicino la London Bridge e alla passeggiata sul fiume sono state una bella esperienza. Il personale √® stato gentile e hanno prontamente risolto un problema di rumore in camera. La nostra camera era una senior room, quindi molto spaziosa. L‚Äôisolamento acustico dall‚Äôesterno nn √® buono, si sentiva gente in corridoio. Nn √® buono neanche l‚Äôisolamento verso il palazzo accanto perch√© avevamo il balcone del dirimpettaio a 1 metro e un tizio che era 24h sul balcone (v. Foto). Per avere privacy abbiamo dovuto chiudere le tende che quindi ci hanno costretto ad accendere la luce. Consigliamo vivamente di aggiungere delle tende bianche che facciano filtrare la luce, cos√¨ si pu√≤ avere privacy e luce. I mobili erano un po‚Äô rovinati purtroppo. Ho molto apprezzato la doccia senza barriere architettoniche! Un po‚Äô difficile capire come pulire il wc senza spazzolino.. colazione buona ma personale discontinuo. Il primo giorno poco attento, e siamo andati via senza aspettare i piatti ordinati. I due giorni successivi molto meglio. Direi pi√π un 4 stelle che in 5 stelle, per√≤. Almeno per queste piccole defiances.",4,2023,04,25
118,"Ruhig, Exklusiv und sehr sauber","Fantastisches kleines Hotel, sehr freundliches Personal. Sehr angenehmes Klientel. Mitten im Zentrum London's und dennoch sehr ruhig gelegen in einer ehemaligen Schule. Verwinkelte Gaenge und  spannende Deko-Accessoirs in allen Ecken.",5,2023,03,07

Zimmer ist sehr sch√∂n eingerichtet und ger√§umig.  Bad sehr stilvoll. Im ganzen Haus ist es sehr ruhig und der Service,  wenn man etwas braucht,  ist super schnell und hilfsbereit.  Die Lage ist perfekt.  Keine 5 Minuten bis zur Tower Bridge. Jederzeit wieder!",5,2022,08,02
118,Hervorragender Aufenthalt,Wer historische Geb√§ude mit einzigartiger Atmosph√§re sch√§tzt ist hier genau richtig. Dazu liegt das LaLit nur wenige Meter von der Tower Bridge entfernt und auch Restaurants / Pubs / London Bridge Station / Haltestelle des HopOnOff Busses ist fussl√§ufig schnell zu erreichen. Zudem konnten wir Englisches oder auf Wunsch auch Indisches Fr√ºhst√ºck genie√üen. Die Zimmer waren sehr sauber und die Getr√§nke in der Mini Bar Inklusive.  Insgesamt ein hervorragender Aufenthalt - auch wegen der Freundlichkeit der Mitarbeiter an der Rezeption und beim Fr√ºhst√ºck.,5,2022,04,25
118,Indien in London,"Namaskar! Hochwertiges Hotel mit sehr freundlichem Personal in der N√§he der Tower Bridge.  Sch√∂n eingerichtet im indischen Stil. Neben britischem Fr√ºhst√ºck ist auch indisches oder B√ºffet m√∂glich.

118,Wundersch√∂ner vorweihnachtlicher Aufenthalt!,Wir haben mehrere N√§chte in diesem wundersch√∂nen Hotel verbracht. Das Personal ist sehr sehr aufmerksam und hilfsbereit. Merci beaucoup au concierge Fabrice pour tout! Die Zimmer sind wundersch√∂n eingerichtet und nach und nach erkennt man den tollen Luxus des Bades und des Zimmers...es hat wirklich an nichts gefehlt! Das indische Abendessen im wundersch√∂nen Ambiente dieses einzigartigen Speisesaals war super lecker! Die Lage ist hervorragend. Das LaLit hat sehr zu einem unvergesslichen Aufenthalt im vorweihnachtlichen London beigetragen! NAMASKAR!,5,2019,12,16
118,Da consigliare,"Si sa che le categorie degli hotel inglesi, a Londra particolarmente, non sono paragonabili a quelle italiane. e spesso la delusione delle aspettative e dietro l'angolo. Per una due giorni londinese sono andato sul sicuro e ho scelto questo cinque stelle si una rinomata catena indiana. Devo dire che sono rimasto pienamente soddisfatto: accoglienza impeccabile, servizio di alta classe, pulizia, comodit√†, attenzione quasi maniacale ai particolari. Magari avrei preferito una stampa pi√π grande, ma complessivamente ci tornerei senza dubbi L'ambiente √® una ex scuola vittoriana, a pochi passi dal Tower Bridge: la ristrutturazione √® riuscita perfettamente nel coniugare il comfort moderno con l'atmosfera del passato. Ottima anche la prima colazione. I prezzi sono commisurati al livello, alla posizione, e allo standard londinese, ma il rapporto qualit√†/prezzo √® sicuramente positivo.",5,2019,12,11
118,"Gute Lage, kein f√ºnf Sterne Hotel!","Zuerst das Positive: sehr gute Lage zur Tower Brigde, Verkehrsanbindung (bes. zum Flughafen London City), indische Art incl. Fr√ºhst√ºck/Dinner
Negative (wir sprechen von einen angeblichen F√ºnf Sterne Hotel): gelangweilte, unfreundliche Rezeption; am ersten Abend funktionierte keine Heizung, Zimmerservice kommt ohne zu klopfen od. zu klingeln ins Zimmer, viel zu wenig Regenschime, die man ausleihnen kann. Auf berechtigte Beschwerde wird nicht eingegangen. Insgesamt entt√§uschend!",2,2019,10,01
118,la migliore scelta per questa area di londra,"Peccato esserci stata solo una notte. Albergo scovato per caso, con un servizio eccellente e buon rapporto qualit√† prezzo. Il ristorante indiano all'interno √® fantastico ed √® considerato uno dei migliori di londra. Mille coccole ti attendono in camera, dai cioccolatini superlativi ai profumati prodotti da bagno, al frigo bar ben rifornito e gratuito.",5,2019,05,07
118,Perfekt bis ins allerletzte Detail !,"Die Buchung war ein Zufall wenngleich die Bilder schon enorm verlockend waren. Dort Zuhause sein zu d√ºrfen war noch viel sch√∂ner. Man ist stets darum bem√ºht gewesen, den Aufenthalt so angenehm wie m√∂glich zu gestalten und das fiel uns nicht schwer. 

Als Deutsche meckert man ja immer gerne und findet jedes Haar in der Suppe, ABER......hier nicht. Es war Perfekt.

DAS ist kein Allerweltshotel, sondern, wie ich finde, ein Ort, an dem ich mich erholen konnte, schlafen wie ein Baby (die Betten sind sensationell!!!!) und nachdem ich das Fr√ºhst√ºck verpennt habe und feststellen d√ºrfte dass ich zu fr√ºh fertig war und Checkout erst um 12 ist, noch einen unglaublich delikaten Brunch aufs Zimmer bestellen k√∂nnte.

Beine hoch, TV an und die Fenster auf......""Life as it should be !""

Was ich besonders angenehm empfand war, dass ich sehr sp√§t ankam und Sebastian uns noch das Hotel gezeigt  und die Geschichte der 'former boarding school' eindr√ºcklich erkl√§rt hat.

Wann immer es mein Portemonnaie zul√§sst nach London reisen zu d√ºrfen,....ich weiss wo ich definitiv mein 'Zuhause' aufschlagen werde. 

Definitely LaLit ! ",5,2019,04,14
118,Hotel nahe The Shard & Tower Bridge ,Das Hotel liegt direkt neben der Tower Bridge und zirka 5-7 Minuten neben the Shard. Es ist wirklich ein sch√∂nes Boutiquehotel ins zentraler Lage. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und kompetent. Die Zimmer f√ºr London recht gro√ü und das Fr√ºhst√ºck gut. Der Fr√ºhst√ºckssaal ist sensationell!,5,2019,03,01
118,Fin de semana en Londres,Fant√°stico hotel de 5 estrellas muy bien situado y con excelentes servicios. La habitaci√≥n digna de un hotel de lujo. Calidad/Precio perfecto para la categoria del hotel. Seguro que volveremos ya que fue nuestra primera visita a Londres y nos gusto el hotel.,5,2018,10,29
118,Sehr gutes indisches Essen,Zum ersten Mal haben wir vier Freundinnen Indisch gegessen und es war super lecker. Der Chefkoch hat uns pers√∂nlich begr√ºsst und noch weitere Tips gegeben und diese zus√§tzlich und gratis (Reis und Beluga-Linsen-Sauce) an unseren Tisch bringen lassen. ,5,2018,10,15
118,Familienausflug London,"TOP-Hotel in toller Lage zur Tower Bridge und absolut verkehrsg√ºnstig zu Bus und Underground. Super Zimmerausstattung (2x Junior Classrooms), komfortabel ausgestattet und sehr ruhig, Minibar inclusive! 
Personal in allen Bereichen sehr, sehr freundlich, kompetent und hilfsbereit. Das Restaurant (greathall) ist einmalig (Ausstattung, Design, Gr√∂√üe...). Wir hatten incl. Fr√ºhst√ºck gebucht und wurden nicht entt√§uscht. Alle Speisen und Getr√§nke waren super und frisch und der Service stets freundlich und aufmerksam.
Unser Aufenthalt im The LaLit wurde somit zu einem Erlebnis.
Wir kommen sehr gerne wieder.",5,2018,10,09
118,Kurztrip nach London,"Das Hotel liegt wunderbar an der Themse , nahe der Tower Bridge. 
Die Zimmer sind ger√§umig und hell, das Badezimmer luxori√∂s. Der Service
 ist sehr aufmerksam und freundlich. Die Minibar kann kostenlos genutzt werden .",5,2018,08,19
118,Detalles cuidados en la habitaci√≥n ,"El hotel brinda una excelente relaci√≥n valor precio. Est√° ubicado a unos pasos del Tower Bridge y a la estaci√≥n de trenes. El barrio es un sitio en naciente vibraci√≥n, lleno de nuevos restaurantes de moda. El hotel sol√≠a ser un antiguo colegio, lo cual incluye un hermoso comedor. Los detalles en las habitaciones est√°n cuidados al major detalles y las convierten en unas de las mejores habitaciones en las que me he hospedado. El servicio es excelente en general pero lo √∫nico ha mejorar ser√≠a el restaurante el cual no lo recomiendo. Es preferible salir a comer. Hay por cierto un mini s√∫per cercano con buenos precios y calidad a tres minutos caminando.

Sin duda este hotel ser√° mi primera opci√≥n en Londres",5,2018,07,08
118,Nett aber nicht 5*,"Nettes Hotel in einem alten klassischen Geb√§ude. Zimmer sch√∂ner, sehr sauber und sehr guter Standard. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war allerdings leider nicht 5*. Der an den Tisch gebrachten Kaffe und Eggs Benedikt waren nur mittel und die indischen Gerichte gab es nicht ;-(
Personal wiederum super nett und zuvorkommend. Also: zum ruhigen √ºbernachten f√ºr Business gut geeignet, zum Essen was anderes w√§hlen ",4,2018,02,03
118,Luxus pur,"Ich war im Sommer mit einem Freund im Lalit. Schon beim Check-In sp√ºrt man den Luxus als einem die Koffer ins Zimmer getragen werden. 
Sehr modernes Hotel in einem super sch√∂nen altem Schulgeb√§ude. Der Service ist ausgezeichnet und alle sind super freundlich.
Die Lage ist optimal direkt an der Tower Bridge. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist sehr lecker und mit sehr viel Auswahl.

Sehr zu empfehlen",5,2017,10,31
118,Fantastisch!,"Tolles Luxushotel, ein St√ºckchen Indien mitten in London. Sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet, perfekter Service und sehr sch√∂ne Lage links der Themse in der N√§he der Tower Bridge. Meine besondere Empfehlung ist ein indischer High Tea.",5,2017,10,16
118,Tolles Hotel,"Super Hotel mit hervorragendem Service , au√üergew√∂hnlichen Zimmern , 
gepflegter Atmosph√§re in toller Lage , man erreicht zu Fu√ü und mit der U-Bahn fast alle wichtigen Orte.Die Fahrt zum Flughafen ist leider sehr lang und sehr kostspielig ! 
Das Hotel ist relativ teuer aber seinen Preis auch wert. Die Getr√§nkepreise sind extrem hoch .
Aber ich werde wieder kommen !

118,Ein Service-Juwel in perfekter Lage - das bezahlt werden will ,"Wir hatten ein 30 qm-Zimmer (Deluxe) im ersten Stock, das alles hatte, was man in einem solchen, √ºbrigens ganz neuen  Haus erwarten kann. Highlight waren Bett, WC und  Dusche. 
Die Lage ist vortrefflich, direkt an der Tower Bridge, nur ein paar Schritte zur Themse. Zentraler geht's eigentlich nicht, jedenfalls f√ºr Touristen wie uns.
Das komplette Personal ist sehr kompetent, von gro√üem Engagement und beeindruckender Zuvorkommenheit. Der Gast ist absolut K√∂nig und es hat wirklich Spa√ü gemacht, da Gast zu sein!
Im Restaurant waren wir nur zum Fr√ºhst√ºck, das besondere sind da die auch angebotenen indischen Varianten, ansonsten klassisches Angebot auf hohem Niveau, aber ohne √úberraschungen.
Die hier von einigen kritisierten Preise sind tats√§chlich verdammt hoch. Bei den Zimmern gehen sie mit Blick auf Lage, Standard und Personal aber in Ordnung. Wir hatten auch ein Glas Wein (ein ganz normaler, offener  Chardonnay) f√ºr 23 Pfund + Service- Charge. Das ist selbst in London wirklich jenseits von Gut und B√∂se und nicht zu rechtfertigen, auch wenn der Manager das anders zu sehen scheint. 
Das √§ndert aber an unserer sehr guten Gesamtwertung nichts. Wenn man es wei√ü, muss man ja nicht unbedingt im Hotel Essen und Trinken. Die Restaurantempfehlungen des Concierge ( alle unter 5 Minuten zu Fu√ü entfernt) waren jedenfalls alle sehr gut.
Wir w√ºrden beim n√§chsten Mal in London sehr gerne wieder in diesem Hotel absteigen.
