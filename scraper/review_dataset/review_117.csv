117,Best GF afternoon tea I’ve ever had!,"Amazing afternoon tea celebrating my 40th birthday, good options for GF, Vegan etc, nothing was too much trouble for staff and Nayan was an amazing host and fantastic photographer!  Would definitely recommend and will certainly be back!!",5,2024,10,19
117,Excellent and Perfectly Located,"We had an excellent stay at The Dilly celebrating my wife's birthday. From the moment we arrived we felt well looked after and the service from all we met was first rate. The room was clean and spacious and had that old world feel to it which was excellent.

The piano bar and breakfast were also perfect little treats with a relaxed atmosphere. ",5,2024,10,19
117,Perfect afternoon tea!,"Me and my mother had a delicious  afternoon tea and Hazel our waitress was very lovely, attentive and friendly. The London theme was really quirky and the pastries in the shape of London landmarks are as so much fun. A great afternoon tea thank you!",5,2024,10,19
117,Shabby not Chic,"Although very central the hotel itself is very tired ! Needs a good upgrade .  Scaffolding across the front of the hotel didn’t make for a good entry . 
The first room we were given smelt of cigarette smoke . We asked to be moved ! It was tiny and no space for suitcases ! 
We must have been given an upgrade because the next room was huge with a walk in  robe and very spacious and clean . However the room was shabby with mismatching bedside tables and even mismatching bedside lights, chipped paint on dark walls 
 !  We did get complimentary goodies on the third day not sure what that was first 
The pool was ok but dark  snd not inviting .
Staff were great and friendly ! 
For the price would expect more from a  room ! 
Almost opposite Fortnum and Mason  do that was a bonus and a great part of London ! Bus outside takes you to Mayfair and Harrods ! 
Would I stay again ? Maybe if it was refurbished !",3,2024,10,19
117,Fabulous hotel,"Currently staying at this lovely hotel, checkin was quick and the lady at the desk could not of been any more helpful or friendly.

117,Excellent stay at the Dilly,"Our stay at the Dilly was excellent. From the minute we arrived we felt welcome. 
Amo booked us in and was very attentive throughout our stay.
Our room had been beautifully decorated for my husband’s birthday. 
The rooms are very clean and comfortable. Breakfast had a great choice and very enjoyable. 
The location of the hotel is perfect for getting to the theatres.

117,Unforgettably fantastic experience.,"Absolutely fabulous hotel. The hotel itself is top quality and the room we stayed in was large and tastefully decorated to a high standard. It was my birthday during our stay and the staff made it extra special with room decorations, wine and gift. Also there is a great basement swimming pool. The staff were so very friendly. Location wise it must be the best in central London.  We normally stay in the Thistle Trafalgar but from now on it's the Dilly.",5,2024,10,18

117,"Amazing location, Friendly helpful staff","Checkin was quick and Raquel was very friendly and helpful with all my questions about my first stay here.  My room was clean and breakfast buffet had a huge selection. At the end, Hussein was very helpful to store my luggage and send me off to the right place for shopping. The location of this hotel was so perfect - there are many dining and drinking options so close, shopping for anybody, and bonus it was close to the office I was visiting. Will stay here again 100% thanks to friendly staff.",5,2024,10,17
117,Interesting afternoon tea,"We tried the afternoon tea set which is cool, you always get similar food when ordering the afternoon tea set and the one in Dilly has made it much more interesting and definitely a good choice for tourists to try in London. 
Gabriela and all other staff are very friendly and really responsible to make sure we feel good during the experience.
It’s hard to find out such place though as we only recognised Dilly has the afternoon tea from the poster outside the building when we walked pass, so people might ignore it when walking.

*their menu got choices for people with preferences such as vegan, gluten free, etc",5,2024,10,16
117,Great experience,The afternoon tea was lovely. Lots of offerings and the presentation was very fun! Brijal was a wonderful server and kept tea and coffee coming all afternoon. The Dilly is a beautiful hotel with a lovely tea room. Highly recommend this experience!,5,2024,10,16
117,Lovely experience,"The experience was amazing, the staff were lovely and attentive to guest's requests. The atmosphere of the restaurant is cozy and stylish. Brijal was the staff member assisting me and she was very efficient. I would definitely recommend the experience and go again myself.",5,2024,10,15
117,Extra mile,"The hotel had asked if I was visiting for a special reason, it was my mother’s 83rd birthday. They decorated the room and put in some very cute treats for her. The staff were absolutely lovely. I am looking forward to returning it was really lovely experience.  That extra mile makes such a huge difference my mother was so happy",5,2024,10,15
117,Prime location with a great gym,This place has an amazing location and an absolutely top-notch gym. (The Eliko bars and weights are in notably good condition and their Lifefittness machines are too) The other amenities are great. The rooms are comfortable. There’s an old-school luxury feel with enough modern touches to fell fun. I loved it. I would definitely stay here again.,5,2024,10,14
117,Wonderful Stay 5 stars!!,"My Mum and I have just returned from the most fantastic stay at The Dilly. We were there celebrating my mums 80th Birthdat and all of the staff went above and beyond to make this the most special over night stay for both myself and my Mother.
Selim was such a wonderful person to speak to and went out of his way to iron out some of the issues we previously encountered. He upgraded our room to an executive room and it was the most glorious room we had ever stayed in.
A huge huge thank you to Lord Henry who had decorated the bed and decorated the mirrors! We were so excited to see a tray of glorious hand made cakes and a delightful fruit platter, along with a lovely bottle of fizz for us to enjoy!
The lady on the front desk was such a lovely person to speak to and was really friendly and bubbly. She was a delight to speak to.
We are at Madu’s and the food was honestly the best meal we have eaten in a long while. We had the set pre theatre menu and it was presented in the most wonderful way and tasted delicious. A huge thank you to our host at the table Darshan, he is a real credit to the restaurant. Nothing was too much trouble for him and he  was so incredibly friendly, professional and was able to tell us all about the history and culture of the dishes we were eating. What an absolutely wonderful gentleman he was. 
We spent the Sunday morning relaxing in the wonderful pool at the Dilly. It was the biggest indoor pool we had seen in a hotel before and we thoroughly enjoyed our early morning dip!
We cannot honestly fault this hotel and we felt the staff went over and above to make this such a memorable time for my Mother and I.
We cannot wait to return for our next theatre trip to London!
Thank you once again! 
Dawn and Sheila.",5,2024,10,14
117,Awful hotel,"The worst afternoon tea ever. The sandwiches were really stale, ours came up on a bus stand which was fun.The children got a plate with the most un child friendly sandwiches, Ham and cheese would have been better. The hotel was so very understaffed, we spent more time watching and waiting rather than eating. The hotel bar gave us very stale pretzels with slow served drinks. 
The Indian restaurant was another matter, no one seemed to be communicating, the food was nice, but the orders were wrong. We couldn’t be bothered to argue. When you pay for a rather expensive room you expect a better deal, the premier inn at the London eye was far better.",2,2024,10,12
117,Great afternoon tea,"The afternoon tea was really good the whole experience is amazing. We recommend it 100%. Brija was really nice and kind. We enjoyed the environment and the menu, all the teas and the experience in general. It is really great for celebrations, and when you visit London it is also a recommended experience",5,2024,10,12
117,Enjoy afternoon tea elsewhere!! ,"Where do I start? The   London afternoon tea is the  most unappealing meal I have ever eaten .Firstly my coffee was lukewarm at best, and outrageously I had to pay  for a glass of water which came in a dirty glass. Sandwiches were made of extremely stale bread and the fillings were tasteless. Scones were heavy, but probably  the most edible part of this 'afternoon tea'.  As for the cake  offers,   they were really sweet with very little flavour. The red bus was just a mess of cream filling, and the StPauls and the other cake just a soggy  tasteless  mess. Big Ben was a caramel block of chocolate served on a soft biscuit The chocolate in this as well as the chocolate for St Pauls   and the other monument  were really hard, suggesting they are made of cheap chocolate.  Imagine my shock to find my  that my  final bill  had an extra 12  pounds added on.  I would recommend you look for a  different place to have  a delicious afternoon tea in London, because you wont find it  at The Dilly!!! ",1,2024,10,11
117,No 5-star feeling,"It will be hard to find a better location in central London: The hotel is close to trains, restaurants, sights and shopping - everything is literally just around the corner.
It is my experience that UK hotels are 1 star worse than what they advertise, and this is also the case with The Dilly, which in all other countries would ""only"" be a 4-star hotel.
It has everything you expect from an older hotel - but NOT from a 5-star hotel: Walls and doors are paper thin, so you are bothered by noise from the hallway, noise from flushing toilets, etc.
Our room was small but with great beds, the toilet is diminutive and stupidly arranged, you literally sit with the toilet roll on your thigh, and though trying we never succeeded in regulating the heat (the room was too hot).
Breakfast is good with big variation e.g. you have the possibility of ordering freshly made omelet, making pancakes, etc., but it is a bit special, e.g. the cheese is not sliced, so you have to slice the cubes yourself, if you want cheese on your bread, why?
The staff is extremely friendly, helpful and professional.",4,2024,10,11
117,Dilly my love,"Our experience at The Dilly was exceptional from start to finish. Nayan at the restaurant took extraordinary care of us, serving the best afternoon tea I’ve ever had. Additionally, the red-haired lady in the restaurant was an absolute delight, making our time there even more special with her warmth.

At the door, Tiago and Luke were a pleasure to interact with. They provided excellent recommendations for sushi restaurants and luxury cocktail bars. Their knowledge of hidden gastronomic gems and refined taste truly elevated our experience.

The highlight of our stay, however, was the impeccable service provided by Eleni and Selim. From communicating with us prior to our trip to ensuring that our room was beautifully decorated with balloons and roses, they went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. The thoughtful mirror message from Eleni, as well as their warm greeting upon arrival, made us feel genuinely welcomed and cared for.

Henri was a nice guy he gave us access to the lounge!",5,2024,10,11
117,Best experience hotel in london,"We traveled to celebrate my mother Hava’s 60th birthday, and I have to say the experience exceeded all our expectations. From the moment we entered the hotel, we were greeted with professionalism, warmth, and kindness. When we arrived at our room, we were met with a delightful surprise—balloons, cakes, flower petals, and a lovely birthday message from the staff. It was incredibly touching!

The room was comfortable, clean, and beautifully designed. The hotel’s location, right next to Piccadilly Circus, is simply perfect—everything is within walking distance.

Unfortunately, during the second night, my father, Doron, fell out of bed and injured himself. The staff was amazing—they checked on him constantly, sent us everything we needed, and even brought a doctor to the room to care for him. They even offered to move us to a different room for more comfort. The level of care and attention they provided was truly impressive.

Breakfast was also a real treat, especially on my mom’s birthday when we were given special attention with balloons and a celebratory cake. Huge thanks to Amo, the Duty Manager, for his concern and assistance after the accident, to Canido for the perfect coffee and lovely balloon decorations, and to Nayan who saved the birthday by organizing an afternoon tea at the hotel’s lounge with champagne and cakes after we missed our original reservation. Special thanks also to Christin, the concierge, who worked miracles by rescheduling our theater tickets with only two hours’ notice.

All in all, the entire hotel staff, especially Selim Atias, the Senior Guest Relations Manager, ensured our stay was unforgettable. A heartfelt thank you to everyone!",5,2024,10,11
117,Afternoon tea fun for adults and kids!,"Afternoon Tea at The Dilly is such a fun and amazing experience! Perfect location, easily accessible near Picadilly Circus.
The London bus tray was super cute and everything was tasty. Dishang was our waiter and he took great care of us! 
Highly recommend adding this to your itinerary, you won’t be disappointed!",5,2024,10,10
117,Enjoyable Stay,"I’ve been a regular guest at The Dilly for a number of years and enjoy Selims work, and the porter who constantly offers his help with my bags. I must say Eleni has quickly made a positive impression as a new addition to the guest relations team. Her warm, attentive approach and dedication to making each stay special truly elevates the overall experience. Eleni’s hard work and genuine care for the guests is clear as she takes pride in ensuring everyone feels welcome.",5,2024,10,10
117,Good experience,Amazing afternoon tea! It’s just a shame you don’t get refills of the sandwiches or scones!! For that price I would have thought they would be refillable!! The best part was the waitress serving us!! Brijal was absolutely amazing!!! So lovely and the best service!! Just the best!!! She should get a promotion!!!,5,2024,10,09
117,Piano bar -downstairs,The hotel was amazing. Our bartender Vincent in the piano bar was an absolute gem. He gave us great service and amazing suggestions. I would recommend this location to anyone visiting London. Great location along with 5 star service. Would stay here again,5,2024,10,09
117,Piano Bar - downstairs - come see Vincent,"We stayed at the Dilly in London and it was very conveniently located! At the end of our day we visited their Piano Bar downstairs and our bartender Vincent provided incredible service! Very personable, remembers what you like and had lots of good tips for our trip. Great place!",5,2024,10,09
117,Great staff and wonderful facilities,"Fantastic facilities very clean room and friendly staff always willing to go the extra step to assist great food in the Indian Cuisine restaurant at ground floor level with good selection of wine to offer 
Close to many attractions in central London and a quiet and relaxing room",5,2024,10,09
117,Best of the best,"This hotel is fantastic. The rooms are spacious and beds are so comfortable. The service from all members of staff is  amazing
It has the best management. Nothing was too much trouble,they were all very attentive in making your stay the best.
We were there for our golden wedding anniversary and felt truly spoiled by the staff. In all the years going to London, no other hotel has ever asked if we were celebrating anything.
The manager Salim did and was lovely and made sure our weekend was truly special.
Top marks to this well run special hotel. We will be staying there on our future visits",5,2024,10,08
117,She said „YES“,"we had a wonderful and unforgettable time in The Dilly, many thanks to Nayan and his team for the excellent hospitality, they read our wishes from our eyes and a special thank you to Richard Henry who made this day unforgettable for us, 
Mr. A.P. Dilly",5,2024,10,07

117,Three star tops,This place lives on this location. The room was boring old and felt depressing. Can’t understand how it is a five star hotel. Was waiting forever to check in because the guest before me seemed to know to employees. After 15 min I intervened and said I can’t wait any longer I have to check in and get on with my life. Was not really welcomed. There is a lot of good hotels in London. Avoid.,2,2024,10,07
117,The best place in the very heart of London,Super warm welcome for the lovely Heather made my stay and my son birthday unforgettable. Outstanding breakfast room combined from a very professional and well dressed staff great smile and know how to make your day start with charm and smile. View and quality is there waiting for you every morning.,5,2024,10,06
117,"Location, location, location ","Group of 6 of us are just back from a lovely weekend at The Dilly to celebrate some roundy birthdays. We got a great rate card on booking dot com. Check in was very easy. 2 of the 3 rooms were very generous in size. Unfortunately, one of the rooms (the smallest) was very damp smelling with a saturated carpet, a quick call to reception had them moved to a much larger room on a different floor. Rooms were decorated for the birthdays and Guest Relations had arranged for some complimentary prosecco and birthday plates in the rooms. It was a lovely touch. Definitely looking forward to a return visit to this amazingly central located hotel.",5,2024,10,06
117,Fab service,Went to ‘The Dilly’ experience for a small family reunion and was impressed by how attentive their staff were. Most especially by Nayan who remembered the occasion and surprised us with a spot of bubbly with the lovely afternoon tea spread. Service 10/10 !,5,2024,10,06

The hotel itself was really friendly, actually one of the nicest experiences of attentiveness with no snobbery! Would definitely come back. Mayan was fantastic during our busy breakfast service.",5,2024,10,06
117,Best location hotel,Great hotel. Amazing location. Close to all things. Great for tourists and great access to the subway system. The terrace has a great breakfast buffet and we were given great service by Brijal. I cannot recommend enough! Can’t wait to be back!,5,2024,10,06
117,Afternoon Tea @ The Dilly,"We went for afternoon tea served in the terrace bar. There was scaffolding around the front which was a shame but the inside was spotless.  All
Staff very helpful.   Service was exceptional,  our waiter Dishung was very attentive and explained what all the the afternoon teas were.   The afternoon tea came out served on a double decker platter, the cakes were in the shape of Big Ben Tower bridge St Paul’s and a London bus.  Looked fab however they were all chocolate would have been nice to see a macaroon or a different choice of cake,  the scones were served with jam and cream and there was 4 small finger sandwiches   Would have liked a few more sandwich fingers but overall £50 was good value for the quirkiness of the food.",5,2024,10,05

117,Wonderful Stay in Prime Location,"We had a lovely stay at The Dilly! The hotel is in prime location, and the customer service was the best we have ever experienced! 

We were travelling for a birthday and they made every effort to make it special… including a complimentary breakfast and room upgrade! Breakfast was gorgeous, with a wide selection and even a pancake machine! 

The only negative would be the rooms are a little tired in places, but that is more than compensated by the cleanliness, staff and standard of service! 

A special mention to Eleni for personalising our stay, and to Nayan for a lovely breakfast experience. We will certainly be returning.",5,2024,10,05
117,Great stay for all travelers,"Staff was very friendly and accommodating. The concierge service was knowledgeable and always made time for a nice chat about what we had planned for the day. We had a miscommunication about the rate of the all inclusive breakfast, but Nayan helped us get that sorted out - the breakfast buffet was extensive and very tasty",5,2024,10,05
117,The cutest afternoon tea,"I visited The Terrace for Afternoon Tea. Great service. Especially Jazvita is so friendly. The London bus as a tiered stand is so lovely!

Raquel was a delight in Reception and all staff were friendly, helpful and accommodating.  Thank you all.  🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",5,2024,10,01
117,Great,"It’s our second stay at this hotel. We were surprised by room upgrade we received from the hotel on check in. The room we got was very spacious and warm. It felt like we came into flat, not the hotel. Also it was quiet. The breakfast has a big variety to choose from. Also, the premises where it’s served very spacious and cosy. I would like to highlight the staff member Nayan, who i remembered from the previous visit a few months ago. This person is really very pleasant and polite. You can expect to get any help from him, happened you needed it. 
As a real coffee lover, I would add that coffee is really great here. My option was double espresso.",5,2024,10,01

From the brilliant location to the size of the room, the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff to the overall service level in the hotel, we had such an amazing stay. We had breakfast included and I’m so glad we did as the variety and freshness was honestly fantastic. Everything was topped up, well presented and delicious. 

Our room was spacious which was great although quite warm. We requested a fan at reception and this was sorted immediately. We also used the pool and steam room which was great to recharge the tired muscles. 

A shout out to Eleni in guest relations for all the lovely little touches in our room and also the concierge services staff who looked after us really well. I would definitely recommend The Dilly and I plan to stay again when I’m next in London!",5,2024,09,30

   Although we are just a couple of senior citizens, The staff Treated us like royalty.
   Our  room was spacious, the beds were very comfortable and The amenities and special touches were beyond what we could have even expected to celebrate our time there.
   Be sure to include breakfast in your stay as the food and staff in the café were top-notch
    Also recommend having a nightcap in the piano bar with the friendliest bartenders and the most comfortable environment, it’ll make you feel like you’re at your own home.
  Special thanks to Don with the Reception Team Who I spoke to a couple of times before we arrived and made sure Everything Was perfect for us.
   That was not my last trip to London and I would not even consider another hotel. The Dilly Exceeded my expectations in every area.",5,2024,09,28
117,Very satisfactory,Your colleague Abdul Hameed has been very helpful in finding us a room in meeting our requirement. He has arranged to send us a mobile EC which helped a lot in cooling down from a hot weather outside. The gym and swimming pool are run well and we enjoy working out there.,4,2024,09,28
117,Incredible hotel! Thank you Heather,Heather was incredible as was Christian the concierge. The hotel is gorgeous and comfortable. The location is beyond ideal and the staff is impeccable. Would stay many many more times. Everyone was so friendly and happy to help. The recommendations and explanations were clear and easy.,5,2024,09,27
117,Great breakfast,"Great location and lovely breakfast experience. Canido and the terrace team made me feel welcome and attended to all my needs. Will come back.
Nice and clean room, very quiet. Price is rather high, but so is the rest of London. Keep up the good work.",5,2024,09,27
117,Thank you,"A heartfelt thank you to Sailm for the outstanding hospitality and for ensuring our stay at The Dilly Hotel, London, was so comfortable. You're a wonderful man, and we truly appreciate how you helped us enjoy all the amenities, especially for our group of young individuals with special needs, including those with Down syndrome. Your kindness and attentiveness made our experience unforgettable!",5,2024,09,26
117,Fantastic Hotel,"It was a fantastic location and the hotel was super clean. 

I will highly recommended this hotel as everything near by and you can walk to Oxford street, Soho, Coved Garden, Mayfair, Piccadilly

Thanks Hossein as he made our stayed useful and happy",5,2024,09,25
117,"Lumpy bed, and incredibly noisy!",I'm typing this review at midnight having so far failed to get to sleep despite being utterly exhausted. The bed is a lumpy spring mattress and the pillows are lumpy too. The room is stuffy and the air con is doing nothing. But the absolute WORST part about this room is the street noise. My room overlooks some sort of business that has been continuously emptying large quantities of glass into a bin or something. Honestly sounds like I'm at the back of a glass recycling plant. Why is this going on at midnight still? Feeling desperate and angry. I've had far better nights at the premier Inn,1,2024,09,24
117,Delightful stay at the Dilly.,"Everything was delightful! I was taking my daughter on her first London trip and wanted a nice centrally located hotel. 

From check-in to check-out, the whole Dilly staff were all wonderful including bell, doormen, housekeeping, front desk and restaurants. 

I wish I could call out every employee by name but the whole staff was really nice. I will give a shout out to Daniel, the manager at check-in went out of his way to get us into a room earlier than expected which was an extra bonus! 

Loved loved the breakfast each morning too.",5,2024,09,24
117,Excellent,"First I want to thank Mr.Salim Atias for the kind words and assistance from the first day we arrived till the time we left.
The room was  clean, the breakfast was excellent the service from the reception and the bell boys.
I definitely will come again.

117,Great central and warm experience in London !,"Went to a family vacation on London and stayed at The Dilly for the first time.
It’s located in the most central place you’ll find, but most important - the staff !
All of them are amazing and above all - Selim !
Words can’t to describe the warm welcome and all that he’d done for us.",5,2024,09,24
117,"A hotel in the heart of London with a swimming pool, spoilt by an intransigent to fix room problems","A hotel in the heart of London with a swimming pool, spoilt by an intransigent to either repair the bathroom door or move us to a different room. 
Although the door could be closed by slamming to do this in the middle of the night was not something I was wanting to do for either waking my wife or other hotel guests.
Yes they setup the room with balloons to welcome me for my birthday but it was marred by the bathroom door. Even complained to the manager who did not give satisfaction and he just wanted to give free drinks some money off the bill for this problem was not an option he was able to give, which seems rather limiting to him. 
I could mention that although the hotel did have decaf tea the staff were not aware of this and could not supply it on request. I've got this very easily at a premier inn.
It's certainly not a 5 star hotel for service",3,2024,09,23
117,"The manager Amo is a game changer,","My wife and I are traveling from Paris to the UK on a well deserved vacation. I will say this our stay in Paris was subpar compared to our stay in the UK. The Dilly is located in a vintage building but updated to luxury standards, and the manager we had the pleasure of meeting with, named Amo is the reason our stay was absolutely amazing. I will say this, we had a concern that he not only resolved,but went above and beyond expectations to make our stay a memorable one, you can't go wrong with Amo on your side. Thanks Amo, you're the best.",5,2024,09,23
117,Good stuff and environment,"Very good experience and good stuff recommendation. The balcon view is nice. Food price is very rational. 

Tea decoration is needed to improve however the tea is really tasty and with very local and authentic. 

Close at 17h so be cautious about the time if arrive late",5,2024,09,23
117,Amazing afternoon tea!,"Afternoon tea on the Terrace at The Dilly was lovely. Our waitress Brijal listened to all our requirements and nothing was too much to accommodate.  She made it a special afternoon. The food was great, chocolates were amazing and the vanilla tea is highly recommended by me!",5,2024,09,22
117,Honest review,"Stayed here as a couple visiting London for a boxing event. Only stayed the one night so never experienced all the facilities but what was on offer looked good.
The welcome and foyer were lovely, complimentary fruit and water a nice touch. The Indian restaurant was aesthetically pleasing too.
We had a superior room with a view...disappointing. I am not sure what was superior to be honest. It was an average size room and average size bathroom nothing to make it superior.
The view was of a brick wall with other people's bedroom windows facing, no view at all.
The bed was comfy but the aircon never worked and windows only opened slightly...it was so so hot!
Location was brilliant to sightsee and commute around London.
We woke up at 7am Sunday morning but the recycling truck reversing outside our room with it's alarms going and then the sound of hundreds of glass bottles being emptied in it several times. By 7.20am we were wide awake if not a little startled!
Overall, this hotel is not 5 star. The room was basic, nothing special. The location was good but I'm sure there will be other hotels in the same location better value.
",4,2024,09,22
117,great location with  rare personal care and  superb breakfast,"in Hotels-it all about  how u are being taken care of .hospitality is the main issue once u get the minimum standard u wished to pay for.
the hotel needs a renoveation but the  basic luxury standard can be found in some rooms-at a reasonable price and we were lucky to have been served by  Selim Atias a Senior PR manager who helped to sort all usuall isuues that pops and  made our stay a magnificent one!
the breakfast is superb and worth a visit -even if you are not a guest- as  its is overlooking Picadilly street  plentu of natural light with sumptous buffet and superb service- a great start for a busy  day. we will certainly return to this Hotel.",4,2024,09,20
117,London feelings!,"TUTTO. I loved that old english fashion style but still modern touch. Staff is passionate, patient and professionale. I am really thankful to Mr Don welcoming us at check-in and check-out: no efforts to find out reservation, warmly communicative and emphatetic! We will keep a great souvenir of Dilly (for friends as it is on Piccadilly street - still visible flashing light of Circus at entrance!) even thanks to staff and Mr Don. Please do not refrain to have breakfast here, it worth the offer, the service, the view! it exceeded my expectations!",5,2024,09,20
117,Daughters 18th birthday celebration,We had the best time celebrating our daughter’s 18th birthday weekend in London and stayed over at the fabulous Dilly hotel. The staff at the hotel could not do enough for us and the facilities were so amazing! The breakfast was so good to so much variety and again really friendly staff. We will definitely be coming back again thank you all again !!,5,2024,09,19
117,Fantastic stay,"Me and my daughter stayed and had a fab time. Staff were amazing and nothing was too much trouble. Also the best location I’ve stayed in London so will 100% use in the future.

The concierge gave us some great ideas of things to do also that my daughter loved ❤️",5,2024,09,19
117,Perfect London Base,"Fabulous stay again at this lovely hotel -wonderful staff who are so helpful and have advice for any requests-loved our gorgeous room and such a terrific position for shopping ,galleries ,theatre and restaurants …we can’t wait to go back!",5,2024,09,19
117,Great central and secure location with great staff!,"The location for this hotel is unbeatable!  I am so pleased we chose to stay in Picadilly Square!   I also am so grateful we were able to have a suite and A/C in London!  My husband and I did a lot of self catering travel and having the extra assistance from concierge was especially helpful to us and allowed us to make the most of our time in London with a very ambitious schedule for the 3 nights we were there.  My only criticism is that we arrived late on Thursday and the concierge was already gone by 8 pm which had me a bit stressed about how tto plan for the next day but as soon as we went to the concierge in the morning thet were very helpful and put us right on track.  Critical was their ability to get some tickets and print things out and send us off to the correct trains.  The time it saved was critical!  My other reason for 4 stars insteadof 5 is just that the room was a bit outdated and a need for greater overhead lighting as room felt dark.  That said, the location ws unbeatable and the staff were lovely and I know these are hard times to get good staffing etc and I think the Dilly is doing its best to cater to so many travelers in a busy season.  In particular I would like to recognize the staff that assisted us with all manner of things including quick transfer to London Heathrow Airport.  I would like to recognize Don, Dimitri, Cem and the lovely Scottish gentleman who worked concierge whose name escapes me.  I also was impressed with the security with a card required to get in and out of the building as well as use of elevators. I recommend this hotel and would say it's greatest asset is its staff, security and location!",4,2024,09,18
117,Very good!!,"Salim from the hotel arranged us beautiful room and helped us with everything. Very clean room , very good breakfast. It was very good place at night. It is on the Piccadilly square. 1 min from bus station or the metro. A lot of restaurant nearby.",5,2024,09,17
117,5 night's at the The Dilly,"The Hotel is very nice and very quiet, 
Also very clean, we had 5 excellent nights.
The location is very good and has all the necessary needed.
I want to emphasize the outstanding service we got from Salim, which is by far, away from what you can expect!!
Thank you very much, Salim, it was a pure pleasure.",5,2024,09,17

We received excellent service and an upgrade to our reservation by the hotel's service manager Mr. Salim Atias. 
The breakfast is just wonderful
The hotel is excellently located, next to Piccadilly Square and the subway
We highly recommend the hotel, clean and tidy, excellent service from the counter and everything we wanted was very much available by the staff and especially by the manager Mr. Salim Atias!",5,2024,09,17
117,Beautiful London themed afternoon tea,"We enjoyed a wonderful afternoon tea complete with beautifully made London themed treats. They are so cleverly made. The staff were so attentive, friendly and welcoming. Beautiful location and highly recommended. We had a fabulous time, thank you",5,2024,09,17
117,In need of some love,"The 4 out of 5 is for location. 

Our room was small, a bit cramped and dark. The walls were painted dark blue which is probably much easier to live with in a bigger space. We were in a standard twin room and it was a bit shoddy, there were crumbs at the carpet edges in the room and the stair carpets are threadbare in some areas.

The location of The Dilly is excellent, probably one of the best locations in London I’ve stayed in. The staff are friendly, welcoming and helpful and in the main the public areas are okay but in need of a lick of paint. There are just things that could be kept on top of which would make this hotel feel more Premium. The Concierge booth needs painting. The coat hook on the back of the ladies toilet door is loose and the screws need to be tightened. They’re only little things but it just makes the hotel, which charges a premium rate, feel a bit shabby.
Would I stay again, yes I would because the location is so central, but the hotel itself was a bit disappointing as I’ve wanted to stay there for many years.",4,2024,09,15
117,London Home,"Another fabulous stay at The Dilly, always warm welcome from George, Christian, Mark and Harry, very spoilt again, feels like home.  Best location, excellent breakfast in beautiful surrounds on The Terrace, wouldn’t stay anywhere else. Looking forward to our next stay already.",5,2024,09,13
117,Stay at The Dilly!,"Loved this beautiful hotel! Great location and very nice amenities. Especially loved Elvis, the night manager. We arrived after a long difficult day of travel and he turned our day around with his smile and welcoming demeanor. He gave us great recommendations and even a goodie bag of snacks! Will definitely be staying at The Dilly again!",5,2024,09,07
117,Absolutely perfect 🥰,"What a perfect hotel and stay! Met with a warm welcome and the staff were kind enough to dress the room with balloons, rose petals, teddy bears, chocolates and if that wasn’t enough a beautiful fruit platter with chocolate patisserie and chocolate dipped fresh strawberries! Such a wonderful surprise and made our arrival so special for our family reunion after many many years. The staff are just lovely, super friendly, and so very helpful. Big shout out to the staff at breakfast, and a very very special thank you to Diego, who greeted us every morning with a smile and warm wishes. This set the tone for the perfect days we had at the Dilly! Highly recommend The Dilly! The rooms are spacious, comfortable beds, and it has all the facilities you may not expect, a 24 hour gym, a swimming pool. Amazing breakfast. You will not regret your stay here 😊",5,2024,09,05
117,Memorable Stay at The Dilly,"Frequent travelers, first time staying at The Dilly piccadilly in London. We were there two weeks ago for my husband’s birthday. The hotel is welcoming, Great customer service, staffs are very professional and helpful especially Don, making sure we have a pleasant stay, he added complimentary breakfast to the room for our entire stay. Eleana from guest relation custom decorated our room with birthday theme. A bottle of champagne on ice, and a tray of chocolate strawberries with delicious chocolate cake with a handwritten note was waiting for us in our room. The room was specious, clean, bed was very comfortable, remodeled bathroom, good shower pressure, Breakfast was great and severed in a beautiful room with high celling glass solarium.  We had a chance to eat at the restaurant as well, food is delirious, and service is great. Thank you, Don, for making it a memorable stay.",5,2024,09,04

117,Great stay,"Great location for hotel. Staff was friendly and rooms were big and good. Perfect getaway for a stay in London.  There could be a bigger offer of cocktails in the bar.
Gym only had a couple of weights, could be improved. Didn't use the swimming pool but it looked nice.",4,2024,09,03
117,Dilly -- Incredible Service by Mr Selim Atias,"I am looking back ONE YEAR to my last stay at the Dilly (Sept 2023), and reviewing my photos, I recall how Incredible the Duty Manager Mr Selim Atias was. He provided a complimentary breakfast on my final day (on top of access to the all-day lounge), and one evening, complimentary strawberries, cookies & macaroon (with a handwritten note by himself) appeared too. What a warm, touching & personable experience that was in an alien city far from home. The Dilly is a gorgeous hotel in a great location, and Mr Atias just makes it Over-the-Top, Thank You!!",5,2024,09,03
117,Other than sleeping rooms - Fabulous!!!,"Rating 4 out of 5 for everything but sleeping room. 
Disappointed with our room - dark, drab, musty, & hot. “Room with a view” promised on our booking but was actually our 1st visual bust; quite the opposite. Dark paint, which wouldn’t be an issue but we only had one floor lamp (by the tv) & one small desk lamp, in the entire room - nothing near the bed or entrance of the room. We asked the front desk twice to check the temp in our room because it was either warm or hot, hot while we were sleeping, but left with no resolution or updates. 
Room aside….. GREAT location, kind staff (unless asking for help with room temp), fabulous breakfast, & unmatched basement bar drinks!",4,2024,09,02
117,Very good location,Very good location and friendly staff. Special thanks to Abdul Hameed for all his helps to make our stay more comfortable. Foods and lounge are also fine. Quite big gym and swimming pool area. We will consider staying there again for our next trip to London.,5,2024,09,02
117,Brilliant stay every time!,"Keep coming back for almost 20 years. It had different owners, different names and different looks but it reminds our favourite! Friendly staff, clean and comfy rooms in the heart of Piccadilly! Also, one of the best breakfasts we had in hotels!",5,2024,09,01
117,"Upscale, but needs some work","Excellent location, just steps from Piccadilly Circus, attentive service from all employees, and clean and spacious rooms. But the place does need some serious upgrading to justify prices and its 5 star status.
Breakfast was a disappointment, A/C worked hard to overcome the August weather, and room decor and furnishing looked somewhat tired (and in the 21st century one expects USB power outlets in a  star hotel.
I understand that renovation work is planned for 2025, so hopefully that will improve matters.",4,2024,09,01
117,Cleaning assistant should be sacked,"We came to eat at Madhu’s and it was a special occasion.
When visiting the female toilets, the cleaning assistant (polish/Romanian) was on her mobile, swearing and shouting whilst the toilet was full of ladies. 
She was throwing her materials and equipment around and shouting, 
When exiting the toilet, whilst opening the door nearly hit her as she came out of a door which was not visible right on the corner of it. (She might have gone into it to get something. Maybe a storage room or something). The cleaning assistant, even though the door did not touch her, she shouted f@@@ing hell, f@@@ing nearly hit me. She was rude, and for such an establishment it was embarrassing to have someone like her working for your brand. Terrible experience and for that reason we would not visit again. Date visited: 10/08 1830hrs.",1,2024,08,30
117,Henry and staff were excellent!,"The Dilly was a 5 star experience for my family.  We have 2 little girls, and we were welcomed with open arms to our rooms with teddy bears for my little ladies!  They gave us fruits and chocolates as welcoming gifts.  The Room was clean and a great size for our family of 4; 2 full size beds.  Location was great for us.  We are a walking family, and everything was pretty much in a 20min walk or less.  Picadilly square has energy with people, stores, and restaurants, I strongly believe its a great spot for first time vistiors and returners.  The tube is 2min walk as well.  

Service is how they won my family.  An excellent experience for the whole family.  First a friendly welcome from a man who I call my friend now, Henry.  Henry approached us with a warm welcome, immediately felt as if we knew each other already; he's an ACE for the Dilly.  I cant forget my friend Paul at the door, he helped save us half a day to advise ticketing requirements for certain attractions, and not to forget the concierge service.  Mark and his colleagues set our dinner reservations and booked all our outings; excellent staffing.  My family had a great time, and of course, we'll be back.  Thanks again friends at the Dilly!",5,2024,08,29
117,"Wonderful Stay at The Dilly, London","Our team recently stayed at The Dilly Hotel during a business trip to London. Ideally located in the heart of Piccadilly, the hotel offers easy access to Mayfair's high-end boutiques and offices. The business lounge was perfectly suited for quick meetings. The staff were lovely and very helpful, especially the Chief Concierge, George Cosgrove, who was exceptional. He went above and beyond by preparing a comprehensive list of must visit places and businesses, and absolute plus for our team as they were on a tight schedule.",5,2024,08,27
117,Bedroom more like a store room than a Bedroom.,"The Room we were given, was more like a converted storeroon.  The Bathroom was up a step of the bedroom and the room really needed some attention. 
The food was good in the Hotel but the accomodation really spoiled the visit. 
The Conceriege was very helpful.",1,2024,08,27
117,St James Stay with an invigorating pool a hop skip and a jump from leicester square,"Cem was excellent at reception!
they made it really special for my wife and helped us celebrate her birthday really well..they wrote to us before wanting to know the names of our kids really nice touch...never had a view of the shard and regent st before...",5,2024,08,26
117,Wasted 800£ a night. Not going back.,"For £800 a night, I was expecting a lot more. Instead, we got an old run-down suite that smelled so bad. (Please see photos so you know what I mean)

PROS:

-very kind and accommodating concierge team. 
-excellent location (all the great attractions / restaurants are within a 1km radius)
-thoughtful welcome amenities
-housekeeping were very courteous and accommodating
-breakfasts at the terrace were lovely. 
-room service food was delicious. Staff who delivered were kind, but the lady who took orders over the phone was very cold.

CONS:

-our Suite was old and almost run down
-when we’d checked in and first entered our room, the carpet was wet in some spots. 
-The Dilly Suite (room 311)  a horrid smell, upon entering, it smelt of mold and old.

-One front office personnel was rude and condescending. Here was our exchange. It was a Friday afternoon, 15th of August:

Me: hello. Where can I find the balcony?
Front office: (in a rather condescending look and tone) You mean the Terrace? 

Me: no, i mean the balcony. Your website said you have an exclusive lounge for the suite guests—

FO: that is only for our guests who are staying at the Suites. 

Me: I AM staying in the Dilly Suite: I've been here 5 days. 

Until someone from concierge was kind enough to take me and show me *NICELY* how to get to the Balcony. 

Thanks for a rather awful experience, The Dilly.",2,2024,08,25
117,Best location in London,"It’s one of the most beautiful Hotels you can experience ! It reminds you of London old time and the luxury living , reception very friendly live to help will give you an upgrade if possible and a 2 hours late check out if the hotel is not full، umbrellas for 48h for 2 pounds only from the hotel .

The room was spacious and service was delightful and amazing.
He made our trip to be fantastic in our anniversary. They did more than our expectations . Thankyou thankyou Selim",5,2024,08,22
117,Amazing Care and Attention!,"I recently went on a trip with my friend and had a wonderful experience. In particular, Don really saved the day. I had a problem with my booking (through a third party booking company - not the Dilly's fault at all!) and Don made sure that not only my room was booked correctly, but he went above and beyond to make sure that we had a wonderful experience. Our room was perfect and spacious. We especially loved the robes which made it feel very luxurious. The breakfast was delicious and the hotel is located centrally, making all of our London exploring very convenient! I also really liked that the television in the room allows for streaming, so I could watch all of my favorite shows! Couldn't recommend this hotel more!",5,2024,08,21
117,Clean and convenient location,Not a 5 star hotel. Location superb. Room clean   Only one outlet at the desk nor near the bed to charge electronics. Breakfast buffet adequate and worth the price. Special thanks to our house keeper Natalia for her superb service and hospitality. She efficiently prepared the room and provided comfort during our stay   Front desk helpful but the concierge’s were not. For the price it is a good value with an excellent tourist location,3,2024,08,21
117,You must stay here ,"We stayed at The Dilly for  my grandaugters birthday.  The staff at the dilly made it so special for her. I'm not going to go into detail as don't want to spoil the surprise. If you ever go there and are celebrating a special occasion. Let them know you won't be let down at all. 
    We were given some useful information from a staff member about visiting the oldest book shop in the UK . We didn't know we had one in the UK .So this was a surprise for us . Again the staff member didn't need to tell us this . But was very assertive as he seen us go into Waterstones. 
 We would like to thank all the staff at The Dilly you made our stay so memorable we will be returning next year for definite. Thankyou all again . 😁",5,2024,08,20
117,Great experience!! Thanks Don!,"The dilly was nice! Don Singh was so helpful in our booking and so accommodating and nice in person!  It was easy to book and easy to  check in and out. The food was good too! It was a nice time, i went with a friend and would go there again next time i head to London!",4,2024,08,19
117,No way this is a 5 star hotel. I’d struggle to call it a 3 star!,"I had stayed at this hotel many years ago when it was the Le Meriden and all I can say is that it has gone down hill.  Staring from the checkin process, the disappointments began.  They couldn’t find my reservation even though it was prepaid for 8 nights, I had a confirmation number AND I had exchanged messages with the staff over email before arrival.  We had reserved a suite since we were spending 8 days in London.  
From the moment you step into the room, you realize that it is in desperate need for updates and renovations. The plaster was peeling off the wall and it was literally duct taped and painted over.  2 room suite with zero dressers, zero shelves and a closet that could only fit 5 or 6 hangers without any storage.  
Called the front desk and asked for some towels.  It took 4 calls and 90 minutes before they showed up.  When they did, I asked if all their rooms lacked any place to unpack and the answer was “not all but most”!!!   Really? Just live out of your bags is the approach?

Usually didn’t get rooms cleaned till between 5 and 6 pm.  Any request that you had took over an hour.  Asked for ice and was told that the hotel doesn’t have ice machine anywhere but they would send some up.  Never arrived! 

They have mini fridges in the rooms but was told that none of them are operational.  Carpeting in the rooms are old and stained. Service is slow and non-existent.  I’d never stay here again!",2,2024,08,19
117,A Gem of a hotel right near all of the action,"We chose to stay at The Dilly to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary. It was wonderful from the moment we arrived- we were allowed to check in early which was a bonus and the rooms had been decorated for our special occasion- we were so touched. The hotel is located in a wonderful position right in the heart of Piccadilly so we could walk everywhere . The staff were friendly and attentive , the hotel decor was fab and the breakfast the next morning was perfect. We didn't have time to experience the pool and other facilities but we will definitely be going back",5,2024,08,19
117,Underwhelming for a 5 star hotel,"This hotel is an amazing building and gives a sense of grandeur when you enter the lobby. The staff were all very helpful, friendly and professional. Nice touches like proving water and sweets in the foyer. After check in we went to use the lift which was painfully slow. Unfortunately one of the lifts was broken which compounded the issue. We were on the 7th floor and therefore had not real other options. This continued through the weekend where we had to wait for a lengthy time when using the lifts. The room was spacious and clean and well appointed. Unfortunately the bathroom did not match the rest of the room. For a 5 star hotel it was well below expectations. The pressure of the shower was weak and the water temp was not hot enough although approved the next morning. The drain cover was loose and was not the correct cover for the drain and therefore just sat and could create  health and safety issue if stepped on. The left had water tap came off in the hand was just loosely placed on the tap. There was mould in the shower grouting and the bathroom door did not close as it got stuck on the skirting board/tile. We had a drink in the bar and received good service and enjoyed the atmosphere. The breakfast was again very disappointing for a 5 star hotel. The orange juice was not fresh and run of the mill frozen juice, the bread was stale, the coffee was self service and from a machine, not good quality. Some of the condiments were in plastic pouches, limited fruit options, hash browns soggy and in general expected more for a 5 star hotel and £50 cost for 2 people.

117,Fantastic location and staff,Stayed here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and my husband’s birthday! Fantastic location and would thoroughly recommend.  We had such a wonderful welcome from Eleni and the team….it really made our mini break ultra special so thank you so much and can’t wait to see you all again soon!,5,2024,08,18
117,Great place to stay,"Fantastic hotel. Very comfortable rooms and great facilities. Staff very helpful. Best breakfast I have had in a long time. Looking forward to our next visit. Used the swimming pool most mornings, great way to start the dY. The Dilly adds to the London experience ⭐️",5,2024,08,16
117,Excellent Celebration Beginnings,"My wife and I began our 30th anniversary celebration at the London Dilly. We chose the Dilly because of its ratings and location to the theater district. Excellent choice!  We arrived from an early morning arrival from Boston; as such, no room was available for an early checkin. The staff at this hotel are outstanding at the registration and held our luggage whilst we walked the area and had a late breakfast nearby. We were also given complimentary access to the lounge for any waiting period. We had matinee tickets for Moulin Rouge which should not be missed! 

After a pleasant day of theatre and early dinner we checked into our room. We received a  quiet 7th floor room. What a delightful surprise! Our room was decorated with helium balloons, heart shaped floral accents on the bed, and accompanied by chocolates and champagne!  They really made our stay a delight! We have reservations here for our return flight from Nigeria.

The only drawback, is the charging facilities for iPad’s, iPhones left a little to be desired. Nevertheless, nothing we weren’t able to adjust.

We’ll be back,

117,A stay with my Mum,"My Mum & I returned to The Dilly for our 19th stay at the hotel!
We had an amazing 3 night stay here. All the staff were incredibly helpful, welcoming & went beyond expectations. We were welcomed like old friends returning to our second home in London! The housekeeping team did an incredible job with our room each day & worked incredibly hard! The buffet breakfast was delicious with a good variety of food to suit all tastes! Well done to all the team at The Dilly & keep up the good work!",5,2024,08,16
117,Great experience ! ,"I came up to London to visit my daughter and thought I would stay in The Dilly as it is so wonderfully located. 
I had a great experience from arrival to departure and felt very well looked after by a very professional team. Special mention to Elona in the lounge who was absolutely brilliant. ",5,2024,08,15
117,Another Great Stay,"From the greeting at the front desk to the cheerful staff in the breakfast room, once again I'm overwhelmed by the customer service which has always been stellar.  The decor is abit old world, classic British which I prefer. This hotel is perfectly located for anyone who wants to shop, go to theater, hit a few museums or visit Buckingham Palace.  The rooms are spacious, well appointed, and despite being in the heart of Piccadilly, they're quiet.  I've stayed here four times and will definitely be back.  Carry on as you do and keep up the good work welcoming visitors to your hotel.",5,2024,08,15
117,"Overpriced, disapointing and old.",Came on business trip. The hotel is extremely noisy. I received a room in front of the elevators and they would not change it. Impossible to sleep. This is not a 5 stars hotel!! The rooms are unkept and bathroom was dirty. Service was poor at frontdesk😪👎,1,2024,08,13
117,Lovely Hotel - Great Location in Central London,"We stayed with the Dilly for my mum's 50th birthday and can honestly say it was a wonderful hotel experience. The hotel is in the heart of Piccadilly and a 10 minute walk to Covent Garden, SoHo, and Mayfair which made it really accessible for us for theatre shows and a number of outstanding restaurants.

A special thanks to Henry at guest relations who had decorated the room which included a lovely hand written message on the wardrobe mirrors, faux rose petals on the beds with a heart and a 50, and Happy Birthday banner as well. We had only been in the room 10 minutes before two people from guest services came with a bottle of Bottega and chocolate strawberries and a little gateau cake as an extra special surprise. Absolutely blown away with how the staff went above and beyond for the birthday element of our stay which was a lovely surprise. 

We stayed in a twin room which was really nice and clean, comfy beds, and lovely White Company toiletries provided. And as with Leonardo hotels, you have a Nespresso machine in your room and complimentary water. The room was showing some small signs of wear and tear such as parts of the carpets that were threadbare from possibly moving the furniture, and chips and scuffs on parts of the skirting boards or the bottom of the doors. But the small was ample, room was always clean when we came back in the afternoon. We didn't have breakfast as we went elsewhere, but overheard others saying in their Terrace was really good. 

The hotel has a nice large pool, gym, etc. But again, the hotel is showing some signs of wear and tear such as missing tiles, broken doors in the changing rooms, and the hall entrance to the pool being quite dated. They have a lovely piano bar downstairs where they have live piano music at the weekend which we really enjoyed. Personally, we felt the cocktails were over priced at an average of £17 as this was the same price as many well established 5* bars and clubs in London as opposed to a relatively smaller bar in the Dilly. Our only other negative comment was that no one helped us with our really heavy bags when checking in or out of the hotel, which proved difficult as the room levels are carpeted and we struggled to get our cases to the room and again when we left. 

All in all, the hotel is really nice and a great location, and guest relations were absolutely fantastic and went above and beyond to make my mum's birthday special.",5,2024,08,13
117,Best hotel in London best hospitality,"Amazing selim atias make us a touching beautiful welcoming

117,Avoid The Dilly London Until Management and Staff Improve Their Service Standards,"I have had the pleasure of staying at many excellent hotels around the world and have no issue paying for premium quality. I have stayed multiple times at hotels such as The Adlon in Berlin, The Ritz in London, and The Carlton in Cannes. This time, my 20-year-old son and I decided to visit London for a weekend to watch a highly anticipated football match (Wembley – Manchester City vs. Manchester United). Given our standards, we chose to stay at a well-located hotel that promised high quality. We came across The Dilly, which is advertised as a 5-star hotel, and booked two nights in a room with two double beds.

Before our stay, I contacted the hotel to ask if the room was equipped with Chromecast, as we wanted to watch some of the Danish participants in the Paris Olympics. The hotel confirmed this feature, which was crucial for us as it would allow us to watch the specific TV content we didn’t want to miss. Therefore, the hotel was selected based on its star rating, geographic location, and the ability to use Chromecast in the room.

We checked in on Friday, August 9th, 2024, at 3:00 PM, and the process was smooth. The receptionist who checked us in asked if he should charge the card I had provided during the booking process (which I booked directly on the hotel’s website).
Upon arriving at our room, we immediately checked if the Chromecast was working – it was not. I contacted the front desk, who promised to send someone up to check it out. As we planned to spend the afternoon sightseeing, we left the room trusting that the issue would be resolved in our absence. Just as we were leaving, we encountered a maintenance staff member whom we asked to assist. He kindly came to the room and confirmed that the Chromecast wasn’t functioning. He assured us that it would be taken care of while we were out.

However, when we returned around 7:00 PM, the Chromecast still wasn’t working, and there was no note or communication regarding the issue. I had hoped they had resolved it or at least left a note saying they were moving us to a room where it worked – but no, there was absolutely no communication. This lack of follow-up is entirely unacceptable at a 5-star hotel.

The next day, before heading out to Wembley for our football match, I informed the receptionist about our disappointing experience the previous day and the lack of communication. The receptionist said he would personally go up and check the issue.

When we returned to our room (#349) after the match, our key card wouldn’t open the door. We thought perhaps they had moved us to a room where the Chromecast worked – but no, when we went down to the reception, the receptionist immediately informed us that they had blocked our card because we hadn’t paid for the room. I said that wasn’t a problem and paid immediately. She also mentioned that her colleague who checked us in must have made a mistake. We returned to our room, hoping that we could finally enjoy an evening with Chromecast TV and room service food. But once again, the TV was on, and the Chromecast still couldn’t connect (I’ve attached a photo showing this). And yet again, there was no communication whatsoever that they had given up trying to fix it.

We had purchased breakfast, which is served on the terrace on the 2nd floor. This was pleasant, and the staff working there did a good job. The selection was what one would expect at a 5-star hotel.

We also used the health club, and it is indeed a unique experience to say that you’ve swum in a pool at Piccadilly Circus. However, the health club staff barely looked up when we arrived. The attendant continued to look at his phone and simply said, “just sign in.” There was no greeting, no directions – nothing that made us feel welcome or valued as guests.

The room itself was spacious and welcoming, albeit somewhat worn. Despite the overall decent maintenance, signs of wear were apparent. I the the bathroom, which is clad in granite and makes a good first impression. However, there was clear evidence of inadequate attention to detail – paint had been spilled in the bath during a previous job, and this had clearly been overlooked by housekeeping on numerous occasions. This is something that should have been caught by daily cleaning and could have been easily removed with a razor blade in just two minutes. It appears that the cleaning staff routinely ignored this issue, and there is no sign that a room inspector ever caught it either. This is not the level of quality one expects from a hotel that markets itself as 5-star.

Upon checkout, the receptionist asked if everything had been okay. I expressed my disappointment with the lack of follow-up and communication regarding the Chromecast issue. She said, “I will write a note to my colleagues.” I hope she does, but the attitude we encountered suggests that this is more of a systemic issue, and nothing will likely change.

I believe The Dilly could be a lovely hotel – a bit worn but still okay. The pricing would be appropriate for a 5-star hotel that actually delivers on service and follows up on guest concerns, but as it stands, it fails to do so.

I strongly recommend avoiding this hotel until the staff and management understand the importance of working together to ensure a consistently positive experience for their guests. And this is not done in one single morning staff meeting - it will take a longe time",2,2024,08,11
117,No Time to Dally At The Dilly!,"Great hotel in the heart of London within walking distance of numerous tourist pubs, tourist attractions, and the tube. I would be happy to stay here again, the staff were attentive and friendly. I was shocked that they also had a full spa and gym that guests could use at their convenience. Its not often that you find a hotel that has platforms and free weights.",5,2024,08,11
117,Amazing experience.,"We treated ourselves to a 2 night stay at The Dilly for our wedding anniversary. The staff were absolutely amazing from the minute we arrived to the day we left.  Before our arrival we received a lovely welcome letter offering to upgrade our room, we didn't think it could get any better but they decorated our room and gave us a bottle of champagne, I won't go into the details so not to ruin it for others who are celebrating events but we've never experienced such great customer service in a  hotel .  The Dilly is so unique in it's customer service for each guest to ensure you have the best possible stay.  A massive big thanks to them all!  It's central to everything, you can't go wrong with staying here.",5,2024,08,10
117,Family stay with great experiences.,"It is our 3rd stay with my family. We preferred The Dilly because of its location and building architecture. Later on, we have seen that it is more than this.

117,"Girly theatre trip, shopping, eating and a bit of luxury","The Dilly has become my favourite place to stay when I come for regular theatre trips to London. Selim the Senior guest relations Manager goes out of his way to arrange everything for us for a perfect stay. We had a warm welcome from Dom on reception and were offered a complimentary breakfast in the morning.We had a lovely lunch in the rooftop restaurant with Bridget looking after us. A very short walk to the theatre and we were kindly advised by the lovely doorman Paul to be careful as there were some protests happening locally which we appreciated knowing about. Our room was fabulous with a bottle of red wine, canapes, fruit and rose petals & balloons in our room. Downstairs to the bar for lovely cocktails before we dined at the Inhouse Indian restaurant Madhus of Mayfair which has a beautiful ambience  with the biggest  crystal chandeliers ie ever seen and we were impressed that every dish was checked with the chef for my friends cream allergy. It is just pure luxury and attentive service all the way at The Dilly and I would highly recommend a stay here...did I mention the super comfy beds? I cant wait to come back in Oct for another fabulous treat!",5,2024,08,09
117,Fabulous from start to finish!,"Selim Atias and all of the staff at the Dilly are wonderful!
Nothing is too much trouble. The breakfast was very good eggs cooked to order and a lot of choice.The location is excellent you have everything you need on the doorstep.
The  facilities are fabulous!!
The pool, steam room and spa are very nice. There is a very nice atmosphere.
I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel having stayed in many London hotels over the years.
Well done. I can’t thank you enough!",5,2024,08,08
117,"Great Stay, excellent location","We had a great stay in The Dilly. Staff were very attentive and the outside room we had had views of the street. The room was clean and well laid out with a separate area for our child to sleep. We had some lovely treats in the room and my child loved the teddy. The mezzanine lounge is great for getting refreshments on your way in or out of thr hotel and lounging in! The location is excellent being in the heart of London near major attractions, a minites walk to Picadilly Circus, you couldn't really get a better location!
The buffet breakfast was great and you can order food to the table if you have particular dietary needs. Really enjoyed breakfast, sets you up for the day. It would be great if the downstairs restaurant did room service you could order online or via the room TV. 
When booking you will have certain preferences so make sure if you want an outside facing window you ask for it otherwise you may not get it. If you're sensitive to noise ask for a room where it might be quieter (possibly outside upper floors)?
My child rated breakfast as ""Yum!"" and overall they scored the hotel ""1000%"" so it must be good! If they're happy I'm happy!  I would recommend and would stay again.",4,2024,08,08

117,"Avoid! You can do much, much better!","The Dilly is supposedly a 5* hotel so you can imagine our surprise when we opened our door to a very ordinary room with an old en suite bathroom which had mismatched tiles, a stained bath and plastic shower curtain. The bed was made up with a duvet which had to be tucked under the mattress on one side as it didn’t fit the bed. There was no view from the room and the first night there we were woken twice by the sound of banging, possibly bins being filled and/or emptied. The air conditioning was effective, but noisy and difficult to control.
The breakfast was good and the staff friendly and efficient. The common parts, reception area, bar, etc, were also well presented and the staff also friendly and cooperative, but the prices jarred as they were at complete odds to the 3* (or worse) bedroom we had been given. It felt inappropriate and greedy. The leisure facilities and pool were decent. 
Getting around the hotel soon became irritating. One of only three small lifts was permanently out of action during our stay and the waits to get up and down the building seemed interminable at times. Despite our age (which might explain our being given such a shabby room) we found ourselves using the stairs quite a bit. 
The worst aspect to our stay was the servicing of the room. This was done the first morning of our stay at four o’clock in the afternoon, after two requests (which didn’t seem to make any difference). A request to ensure the room was serviced in the morning of the second day of our stay, as due to the heat and a busy morning we wished to have a siesta in the afternoon, was ignored. We rejected an attempt to service the room after four in the afternoon as we were getting ready to go out for the evening.
We have been regular visitors to London over the last 10 years and this stay has been our worst experience to date. I can confidently say we’ll not be entering the door of this hotel ever again! There are so many other, better, (and at the same time often less expensive), places to say.",2,2024,08,06
117,Lovely Memories,"Super comfortable stay in this vintage 5- stars hotel. Every small detail was great. I would like to mention mr. Abdul, mr. Don and the lovely lady Clanda in the reception… Thank you guys. ‏​The breakfast was varied and located in a big and nice terrace. No need to mention the location, in the heart of Picadilly street.",5,2024,08,04
117,Outdated and overpriced,"Cons
Slow elevators (including room service/staff using the tiny elevators)
Outdated rooms - carpet looks 100 years old and the furniture definitely has not been upkept or updated since the hotel was opened
Stuffy rooms - AC doesn't work, air feels humid and air quality in the room is horrible
Unnecessary stairs throughout, making the hotel uncomfortable to travel through
Bathrooms need an update, including the plumbing. Water doesn't come out or drain propery
Central location for tourists

Pros
Friendly staff....?? Although the man downstairs accused me of not having a room and wanted to check my room key yesterday (as if anyone would want to sneak into this disgusting hotel)",1,2024,08,03
117,Wonderful stay at the Dilly,"Wonderful stay at the Dilly.  Best sized family room in London.  Staff were so friendly and welcoming and in particular Selim who arranged extra personal touches which made our stay so memorable and special - thank you Selim and all your staff.
 
My nieces were in awe at the room on our arrival, having been decorated with balloons and a happy birthday message on the mirror  as well as a chocolate bar for each of them.  A new experience for them to have such an exciting welcome.
 
And then arriving back that evening to find a lovely personal note accompanying some treats was a real surprise and very touching which again delighted us all - thank you so much for making our stay ever so special.

Location is superb and breakfast is a must for at least one morning - such a variety of great food and my nieces loved making their own pancakes!
 
We would certainly come back to the Dilly.",5,2024,07,31
117,Tired,"Very tired, rooms, or at least my room old tired and in desperate need of renovation , only two lifts and one was broken so chaos at busy times, would have walked but we were on ninth floor. Good location but unfortunately not much else, can do a lot better for the money.",3,2024,07,29

117,A fantastic hotel,"Good morning

I’d like to send my heartfelt thanks to everyone at The Dilly for making our stay at your hotel on Wednesday 24th July such a lovely experience

The staff were all amazing and so attentive throughout, your hotel is simply stunning, everything about it is perfect, the rooms, the bar, the gym and the swimming pool amazing.

I had asked before about having a bottle of champagne in our room on arrival which you kindly arranged however you went above and beyond. The balloons, roses and even a hand written note on the glass mirror was absolutely first class.

Without doubt we will return and stay in your beautiful hotel, for longer than just the 1 night next time

117,If you want Air conditioning go to another hotel!,"Lovely room but air conditioning would not work, moved twice but never had working air the entire time. Kept reaching out to staff in person and by phone. Ignored much of the time. Every day made attempts to get it fixed. The maintenance staff came many times and never could get it working. Finally on night 5 of 6 they let us have a room air unit. If they’d only done this sooner, I wouldn’t be so upset. But I couldn’t sleep 4 out of the 6 nights because the temperature was 28 C.  Stayed here a year ago and did not have this problem and 21 years ago. After this frustrating time, I would not again. The one time we ordered room service, they did not bring items, I requested and the food was mediocre trying to masquerade as gourmet.",2,2024,07,27

117,Dilly break,"After returning from a three day break at the Dilly to celebrate a birthday , I just wanted to express how lovely the staff were and  how they made our stay truly rememberable.
When last stayed at the Dilly we had a lovely room and we certainly wasn’t disappointed this time with the upgraded executive room we had. Plus the wonderful birthday decorated room and treats that greeted us when entering! Wow, Amazing! We were truly spoilt.
The hotel is located right in the heart of central London Within easy reach of everything .The facilities that the hotel offers excellent. Beds are so comfortable and the breakfast has a good selection to choose from.
The only negative thing I can say about our stay is the unfortunate thing of having to go home after the three days lol. We loved everything about it and made use of the swimming pool and steam room too. Cannot wait to return. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel. It’s a delight go treat yourself you won’t be disappointed. 
Kind regards Jane x",5,2024,07,22
117,First class service and location,"Stayed for one night at The Dilly for my birthday.  I received a lovely message before our arrival asking if we were celebrating an occasion or travelling with children so they could prepare.  Even though this seemed a standard message, it was still more than most hotels bother doing.  We arrived early, our room wasn't ready so we left our bags and headed out, but not before being given a bag of snacks and a teddy for my son.  When we made it to our room it had been decorated for my birthday which I really loved.  

A little later there was knock at the door and I was given sparkling wine and chocolates, with a card from Selim Atias, the manager, who had gone to the effort of writing it in Turkish when he noticed the name on the booking.  I absolutely loved the effort and the thought and think very highly of any hotel that goes that extra mile for their guests.

The room was quite tired and in desperate need of a revamp - noisy air conditioning as has been noted by many reviews, shabby rooms and very dated bathrooms.  The wall are very thin so all noise can be heard, but overall it was clean.

Every member of staff we encountered was professional, courteous, and polite with plenty of smiles.  Aside from one gentleman at breakfast who let a rather pampered guest breeze past the queue despite us waiting patiently to be seated, and he actually started to entertain her request, rather than say sorry there is a queue, wait your turn.  I piped up and got a cold apology from him, while he let the guest throw comments at me.  But that was only one out of many lovely people.

The breakfast was one of the best I've had with plenty on offer, including an omelette station where you can order freshly cooked eggs your way, served in the stunning Terrace.

I didn't get to visit the spa, but they have a large indoor pool and spa therapies. 

The hotel is super conveniently located seconds from the tube station so access is spot on.

Yes the rooms need attention, yes not every room can possibly have an outstanding view (you're in built up Piccadilly Circus for heavens sake!!) BUT... the staff and service were outstanding, as was breakfast.  You can repair a hotel, you can refurbish the rooms, but you are ultimately only as good as your staff.  Because of this I would never hesitate to stay at The Dilly again (if finances allow!!).

Thank you for such a wonderful birthday break - my son and I had a fantastic time.",5,2024,07,22

Additionally, during the stay we had a minor inconvenience regarding our room key. Don handled the issue quickly and professionally and even gave us a gift for our inconvenience.
Everyone at The Dilly was delightful! We enjoyed our stay so much that we are already talking about our return. When visiting London we will always stay at the Dilly, and we have already begun to recommend it to family and friends.

117,Dilly is great! ,Excellent stay! Staff wanting to make your experience the best. Hotel close to Piccadilly and the temptations there. Also situated near New Bond Street. My favourite among shopping greats. And not forgetting Fortnum & Mason for those delicate nibbles and treats.  Well done Dilly!!  ,5,2024,07,19
117,Great hotel,"Best hotel and best location. Ask for Selim Atias, the best host ever. He really can make you feel welcome. We enjoyed our stay, the breakfast is very good, clean rooms, team is very kind and helpful, the hotel location is very good, highly recommended.",5,2024,07,18
117,The Dilly is wonderfully located and has an excellent staff!,"Wonderful location and excellent staff. We were a family of 10 visiting London to celebrate a special birthday, and choose The Dilly for proximity to the West End and proximity to other Landmarks. The staff, particularly reception were exceptional!",5,2024,07,18
117,The amazing Dilly,If I could give 10 stars I would - amazing welcome at this iconic Hotel - stayed 6 nights in an executive suite - and treated like royalty with welcome messages and balloons . Selim has been incredible I can’t thank him enough. Paul @ the door always ready to give great friendly advice on touring London - Highly recommend staying @ The Dilly,5,2024,07,17
117,Wonderfull :),"First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Selim Atias very much, even though it was our first time in London, he made us feel as if we were in our own home and in our own city. When we saw the surprises that greeted us when we first entered the room, we realized that we made the right decision in choosing the hotel :) Our room was very clean and beautiful. The staff are also very friendly and helpful.
The location is amazing, right in the center of the city, within walking distance to everywhere.
From now on, our hotel (house) in London :)",5,2024,07,16
117,Feel at home in London,"Excellent & Best Location. Very good Concierge. Good Staff. Hotel is a bit old but refurbished rooms was satisfying. Good Breakfast. Special thanks & gratitute to guest relation manager Mr.Selim Atias, he made us feel at home. We will come again for sure.",5,2024,07,16
117,A good hotel in the center of Piccadilly.,"Recently stayed at The Dilly with 5 people (with  two  grandpartents over 75 years old)  in two rooms. 

Two things makes this hotel great;
1-Location: in the middle of Piccadilly. Major shopping areas Regent and Oxford streets, Covent  Garden, are all in short walking  distance even for elderly. 

2- The team: guest relations and consierge team was excellent. 
Special thanks to Selim, he solved  our problem with a genuine and friendly care and kindly offered us complimentary services.

Dimitri and Ali arranged a airport picup service and carry our laguages 500 m to reach out to our van. ( there was s road closure on Piccadilly) 

Rooms were dated and needs an uplift but beds were comfortable. Room size is good. Breakfast is also rich. There is a famous indian restaurant in the hotel.",5,2024,07,15
117,"Perfect accommodation, luxury.","Everything was accommodated perfectly.
The room is comfortable.
The staff are friendly.
Breakfast room is very fancy and the buffet is tasty. Although some more halal meat options would be appreciated.
The location is also perfect for basically any purpose of visit.
Special thanks to Mr. Selim.",5,2024,07,15
117,Best Location,"We love The Dilly Hotel, perfect location, perfect atmosphere of the breakfast place, perfect hospitality. But The Dilly's rooms need some renovations
 Thanks guest relation manager Mr Selim and all team. I always recommend to everyone's.",5,2024,07,15
117,Lovely stay in the heart of Piccadilly,"The Dilly was lovely (though in the middle of Pride but that was fun and it was good to feel that positive energy).  Just around the corner was one of my London favourites:  Cording's of Piccadilly (I bought a linen shirt during my stay) and it was convenient in terms of locales (short walk to Chinatown/Soho and easy access to the Tube).  Amenities were lovely and thoughtful.  The Terrace was a lovely hotel restaurant and served a Parisian themed afternoon tea (a seasonal thing, as you can imagine, for the Olympics) and I enjoyed myself!

I would definitely stay here again as the staff were thoughtful and courteous.",5,2024,07,15
117,Cracking good stay at the Dilly during Wimbledon!,"We stayed at the Dilly for my wife’s birthday and Wimbledon and theater. The Dilly is the perfect location for both with such easy access to the tube to get to and from airport and all the hot spots.
The Dilly staff was over the top with service and provided some incredible amenities to greet my Wife for her birthday. 
In addition great amenities  for relaxing in the pool and spa area to relax from all the touring.
In addition, the views from the room are perfect as we had a full panorama of all the big sites of London. Provided a picture but does not do it justice.
Finally  the bar and restaurant areas are wonderful places and provide a nice respite  from the hustle and bustle right out side the front door.
Perfect location and services.",5,2024,07,14
117,French fancy afternoon tea,A delightful Paris afternoon tea - loved the cute nod to Paris with the little cakes! A really relaxed ambience and loved sitting on the terrace! A truly premium hotel in central london. Even catered to my dad’s dietary requirements too! Thoroughly enjoyed,5,2024,07,14
117,A great stay and brilliant value for money.,"Having read a couple of recent poor reviews I was slightly worried about my booking at the The Dilly, but I was happy to be proven completely wrong. The hotel exceeded our expectations entirely. The reception staff were very friendly and efficient and gave us a room upgrade, which is always a great way to start your stay! The room was a really good size, decorated nicely and with a huge bathroom. The bed was enormous and really comfortable with lovely bedding. The location of the hotel was wonderful, close to Hyde Park, Coventry Garden, Bond Street. We went down to the bar in the evening and stayed for a couple of reasonably (for Mayfair!) priced cocktails and really enjoyed listening to the piano player. All in all, we had a great stay and will definitely book The Dilly again.",5,2024,07,14
117,Good central location,"This is the second time we have stayed here as a good central location and 50 yards from Piccadilly Tube Stn.  Decent room price for the location of the hotel.  Good selection at breakfast.  Staff friendly & helpful.  The room had everything that was needed for a stay, hairdryer, iron, bottle of water given..  Beds & pillows were comfortable. Powerful shower and immediate hot water.  Soft towels.  
The only downside on this visit was how small the room was, despite booking a Superior double.  Also  due to the size of the room & too darkly coloured walls,  the room  felt very dull.  Room lighting too was dull.
We should have requested a change of room but we were in a rush to make an appointment, however, we would stay here again and request a room change if needed.",4,2024,07,14
117,Great,"Very good service. All staff were extremely friendly, nice and respectful towards all guests. Prime location in the centre of London near tourist attractions as well as train and bus stations. The brekkie buffet has loads of variety and are all high quality food definitely worth the money.",5,2024,07,13
117,Second stay was more disappointing,"This was my second stay at this hotel. It has not improved. I chose it for the location and availability .Reception had us wait again past check in time, once again.  The beds were very uncomfortable and the room was much smaller then expected. It has not been updated since my last stay.  I do not recommend this hotel.",2,2024,07,10
117,5 star reviews are fake,"Location great and that’s where it ends. 
Apparently gone through new ownership but as you will see from other reviews it is still awful.
Rooms are VERY dated, over priced. You get better service at a budget hotel. 
The influencers that share this hotel are obviously given their best room as my experience was very much lacking. Had to go through 3 room changes due to issues with noise (roof ac units) and then electrics not working. Avoid and go to a proper 5 star hotel!",2,2024,07,10
117,"Fantastic, home from home","Fantastic experience, from start to finish.  The staff were so helpful and knowledgeable. It’s pretty rare, as often I stay at hotels where helpfulness is taught and comes across as false or trained, but the people who worked here were individuals who helped me and my family in a lovely and friendly manner. I felt very welcome.",5,2024,07,08
117,Amazing!!!,We just spent 4 nights at this amazing hotel the staff were really amazing this hotel us situated in a superb location sure we will be back as everything was up to the standard we expected the rooms were big and extreme clean breakfast was impeccable,5,2024,07,08
117,Very pleasant stay at The Dilly,"You can beat the location of this hotel. On arrival the flowers in the centre of the foyer were stunning. All staff on arrival were smiling and made you feel welcome. The rooms are a little bit tired but the service of the staff the facilities soon makes up for that. In particular Cem was very accommodating on my departure, I had an unexpected work issue that I needed to address and he gave me access to the Mezzanine to conduct my work in a very nice environment, I really appreciated this above and beyond service from Cem. Looking forward to my next stay at The Dilly.",4,2024,07,08
117,a great 2 weeks,"just spent 2 weeks in a family room at the dilly for the second year running. What can i say we love this place , a real quirky old hotel with magnificent location and very helpful staff, totally recommend the dilly , we'll be back next year. Thanks for a great stay.",5,2024,07,05
117,Book it! Get breakfast buffet included. Do the Rock Star Tour with Steve!,"We LOVED this hotel. From the minute we arrived at the hotel, the staff worked to get us into our room early.  The staff are superb. We will return and we will stay here. 

The positives; 

*The doorman is always cheerful. He will get you a cab in no time. He is dressed in full London attire typical of a doorman giving the London experience. He has great tips on how to spend the day and will help with tips. He is a delight! 
*The beds are perfect. We had a king with four large pillows and soft bedding. The mattress level was perfect for my husband who prefers firm and for me who prefers a softer mattress. I had the best sleep of my life at the hotel. 
*We arrived during a heat wave. The AC was great and kept us super cool. 
*The room is spacious with TV, desk, and refrigerator. 
*Room service was great. The fish and chips and penne pasta was a favorite. 
*The restaurant in the hotel has a great bar with superb service. 
*The breakfast buffet is not entirely European. It is more like an American buffet. Omelet bar and anything you can think of. Much like an all inclusive resort finding. I was pleasantly surprised. Don’t miss it! 
*LOCATION is right in the center of everything you want to see. You are literally walking distance to the best restaurants and loads of fun. 
*The price is unbelievable. We pay much more for similar accommodations in the US. 

The Negatives;
*I can’t think of anything.",5,2024,07,03
117,Great location for theatres,"We’ve just returned from a couple of night stay at the hotel.
Location is fantastic, was gutted as lots of scaffolding up, but this didn’t affect our stay.
Checking in was quite straight forward, although when we arrived at our room, we were booked in a connecting room with 2 single beds! 
We went to reception and this was sorted out quickly, and a new room given.
The room itself was very comfy, beds were large and everything you needed was in the room.
The room wasn’t clean to my standards, dirt marks on floor in bathroom, marks on walls and lampshades. 
There is a fridge in the room, and coffee and tea facilities.
The breakfast was fantastic, a great selection for everyone, everything from hot selection, omelette station, fruits, pastries, meats and cheese, the choice was endless. 
I would recommend the hotel and would return.",3,2024,07,02
117,"Apparently 5 Star, more 3 Star with pretty trimmings. More style over substance.","Stayed 3 nights, board only, £900, apparently 5 Star hotel, more like 3 Star with lovely trimmings. Definitely style over substance. Not value for money IMO. 
Negatives: 50 minutes delay to Check In, we were told on arrival that our room was ready but Housekeeping had not signed it off, and that we could go and have a drink or wait in the Foyer for 10 minutes. We went to the bar and bought 2 glasses of wine £37.00, after 15 minutes we returned to Reception, room still not signed off. We were then offered to wait and have a self-service complimentary drink offered in a very claustrophobic mezzanine and waited another 30 minutes. We were not the only guests waiting to check in. We then returned to Reception as we had appointments followed by an early dinner based on a 3pm Check In. Another 5 minutes and we finally got our room keys. Air conditioning was blowing hot air (23 degrees outside/end of June) and no matter which way it was altered, same result. As we went out, I went to Reception and mentioned it, we got a large dehumidifying fan sent to our room, which did cool the room however it was very noisy during the night, we had to wear earplugs to sleep. Bathroom definitely needed an update. We didn't order but had a disabled Wet room, the water from the shower went everywhere as no option of a screen and it was a wall nozzle at an odd angle. Health & Safety should look at this as the tiled floor was very dangerous after having a shower. Had to use 2 hand towels as a dam to stop the water going too far out.
Positives: Great location. Staff are very friendly throughout, hostess in the Cocktail Bar downstairs had excellent customer service. Beautiful décor in public areas. Shame about the Scaffolding.",3,2024,07,02
117,Disappointing Stay at The Dilly,"I stayed at The Dilly with a family member for a 5-day trip. We booked through American Express and were upgraded to a suite. At approximately £600 per night, our expectations were high. Unfortunately, it turned out to be one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had. It seems the investors are leveraging the prime location without making necessary renovation and investments. The photos on their website were misleading. Additionally, many of the 5-star online reviews for The Dilly appear to be fake.

After two days, we left and chose another hotel in London, which was a vastly better experience in every way. The receptionist was kind enough to let us check out early after we mentioned our negative experience. However, the hotel manager refused to speak with us and simply gave his colleague approval for our early departure.

Pros:
- Location
- Beautiful from the outside

Cons:

Room:
- The suite should have been renovated 15 years ago
- Outdated and broken furniture
- Dirty rooms (hair, stains, dust)
- Cheap and loose toilet seat
- Faulty shower head/hose (1-star hotels have better bathrooms)
- Minimal natural light
- Low-quality towels
- Loud ventilation, making it hard to sleep
- Thin walls; noise from the hallway is easily heard
- Overheated room with no way to open windows
- No wall sockets near the bed for charging devices
- A £5 welcome bottle of wine for a suite at this price is insulting
- Loose objects in corners from previous guests
- Mold between double glazing windows

Breakfast:
- Below average food quality for a 5-star hotel
- Undercooked omelet
- Cheap furniture
- ""Some"" employees lacked motivation, reflecting poorly on the service
- Needs renovation

Bar:
- Not the luxurious bar you'd expect from a 5-star hotel in London
- Cheap furniture
- Average drinks

Overall, The Dilly did not meet the standards of a 4-star, let alone a 5-star hotel. Our decision to switch hotels saved our vacation.",1,2024,07,01
117,The best hotel in London,"The hotel was really clean, the location is amazing, the staff were really nice and friendly, the facilities are amazing, as indoor pool, gym etc. and the breakfast was extraordinarily!
Best location in London! Of course, we will book it again.",5,2024,06,30
117,Wonderful stay at a beautiful hotel,"I stayed at The Dilly for my birthday weekend in London. Have to say this is one of the best hotels I have stayed at in London. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome and the staff were wonderful. 
We were given a complimentary room upgrade and on entering the beautiful room our stay was made even more special by the happy birthday message laid out on the bed in petals, the selection of amazing cakes and bottle of sparkling wine along with a hand written birthday message. 
Thank you so much to the staff at this beautiful hotel for making my stay so special. I would definitely recommend and stay again.
Amazing!!",5,2024,06,30
117,Birthday celebrations,"We were staying at The Dilly for a girls trip away to celebrate a birthday. The staff went above and beyond to don the room with decorations, chocolates, fizz and vip amenities. An amazing time we spent at the dilly, staff were firefly professional and polite would definitely recommend to stay at The Dilly and definitely return for any future trips away to London.",5,2024,06,29
117,Taylor swift London stay,"Arrived at 12.30 and surprised to find room ready and complimentary upgrade given. Reception staff extremely welcoming and interior reception area beautiful. However, the entire exterior is covered in scaffolding which we were not aware of and somewhat detracts from the hotel’s presence. 
Location of the dilly is excellent though with most attractions within walking distance and excellent tube connections to everywhere else. 
Although rated 5 star the bathroom in our room was a little tired and definitely not at 5 star standard. 
Overall though the room was of a good size and standard. 
The Indian restaurant in-house is incredible in decor, service and the quality of the food. If you stay in or near the dilly it is the place to go to for dinner, cannot recommend it enough. The food was exceptional and staff were so professional and attentive. 
If you’re coming to London this is the place to stay and Madhus of Mayfair is the place to eat.
Thanks for a wonderful stay",4,2024,06,29
117,It was an amazing experience. It is in the heart of London loved the service specially they were person thomas abdul,"Loved the hotel and service specially the guy named abdul always helping and with a smiling face. The hotel is in the heart of london. Rooms were very neat and clean. Mr abdul , thomas were always on toes to help. They maid the experience of the stay amazing",5,2024,06,29
117,Superb,"We had a fantastic stay! Selim (Guest Relations) and Carolina (reservations) went above and beyond to ensure that the booking process and stay were seamless.
The room was spacious and clean and the facilities were excellent.
Thanks so much!",5,2024,06,27
117,Stay way horrible experience,"Horrible experience with the service, we arrived for4 nights. It  began with the TV not working and no soaps in the room when we arrived. The next day again no Tv, and when room service tell me all is ok, they changed our TV and it automatically opened in the Middle of the night. When I complained they just laughed. Two days in a row we arrived back in the room and it wasn't cleaned, for a five star hotel The service is barely a two Star hotel. Stay away, they charge so much and you don't get the service either from the Stafford manager.",1,2024,06,26
117,Wonderful hotel,"Decor throughout the hotel is superb - very grand and very comfortable (fresh flowers, drinking water in lobby). 
Exceptionally clean throughout. 
Excellent quality linen/towels/bedding.
Spacious room - plenty of storage, tea/coffee, iron&board, large TV, fridge, safe, bottled water every morning. 
Perfect location - 2min from Piccadilly tube & 7mins from Green Park tube - bus stop right outside. 
The staff were phenomenal- so professional yet friendly & relaxed and greeted/spoke every time you passed them (even met one of the staff in a cafe & he recognised us, and came to say hello). 

One small drawback - shower wasn’t powerful

But the overall 9.5 out of 10 - and would absolutely stay here again 🤗",5,2024,06,25
117,a very nice holiday,"Perfect location. Centrally located, walking distance to everywhere. the staff was very helpfull. the room was very clean. The hotel's facilities were very good. The price was very good considering the location of the hotel and the facilities it offered. I recommend it to everyone going to London.",5,2024,06,23
117,Fabulous Stay,"My friend and I had the most fabulous stay at this gorgeous hotel and will absolutely be returning. The room was so beautiful and I was unbelievably touched by the surprises the hotel staff left for us, after letting them know that our visit was to celebrate my birthday! There were rose petals on the bed, a happy birthday message written in colourful letters on the bathroom mirror, and a bottle of champagne and cake selection left for us to enjoy! These unexpected touches made an our trip so special and one to remember.

I will most certainly be recommending this stunning hotel to my network of Assistants, as it’s the perfect venue for personal and professional visits!

Thank you once again to Selim, Elena, Rebecca and Clanda for looking after us. I look forward to seeing you all again in the future.",5,2024,06,18
117,Wonderful Staff and Location,"Wonderful stay, and attentive staff. Your concierge team provided excellent recommendations and were exceptionally helpful and thoughtful. We enjoyed all aspects of the hotel. Would recommend investing in your pool and spa area. The gym is great.",5,2024,06,18
117,Rooms need updating. Avoid 501,"Avoid room 501 at all costs. This isn’t a cheap hotel and on the whole, the hotel itself isn’t too bad. It has a good location and breakfast, although expensive, is well catered. We have stayed in the worst room ever though. It’s small but I don’t mind that, but the shower over the bath that barely gets warm and doesn’t produce nearly enough water from its tiny shower head, is very outdated. The room is so small that when one person wants to go to the bathroom in the night and puts on the light, it wakes anyone else in the room as it’s so bright. This room is also directly outside the lifts and you can hear every movement of everyone getting in and out of the lift all through the night and day. This also means they can hear everything you do which is annoying at best and intrusive at worst. So I have nothing good to say about my recent stay in this hotel but avoid room 501 or any room directly outside a lift space with no noise insulation. This hotel is in desperate need of room updates for the price it charges",2,2024,06,16
117,"Good location, experience bar","Firstly, this hotel is situated in a great central location in the heart of London.

We were suitably impressed with the room; it felt like a suite. I think we may have obtained an upgrade through booking.com.

For me, the bar was very exploitative in excessively over charging for the drinks. The piano bar was poor in comparison. 

Stay here, yes, find entertainment elsewhere.",3,2024,06,15
117,This place Rocks,"This is a turn of the century hotel, and the modern flair and old-world flair made it a very enjoyable stay. 

My wife and I wanted a large room. We got a large room with a walk in closet and full bathroom. There is a pool, gym and a mini spa for body treatments (which my wife enjoyed) another hidden bonus we had a piano lounge inside the hotel it was a great way to close the night with a night cap. 

From the moment you walked in, the adventure started. Fresh cut flowers a signature scent and a front desk staff that was professional and courteous. They told us everything we needed to know about our stay.  

The bed was comfortable, the air conditioning system was great, there were snack and coffee. When we woke up in the morning we have a great breakfast in the hotel. It was eclosed desk and it was great. The selection of food was never-ending. The restaurant staff was professional on so many levels.  

Another plus about this hotel is...........it is centrally located to all major attractions within walking distance. Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square, Museums, The Cavalry Guard, Leicester Square, (just to name a few) and most of all it was between 2 major underground stops. 
 
My wife enjoyed major shopping around the corner from the hotel on Regents Row. If you are a David Bowie fan, there is a street dedicated to the Ziggy Stardust days.  

You will not be disappointed with your stay at The Dilly. This was our 2nd time in London and this hotel will be a mainstay for my wife and I when we come back.",5,2024,06,14
117,Superb stay,"Dilly starts with the location !
Then moving on to the reception and breakfast service is incredible.
Stop by  the steam room for relaxation.
Special thanks to Selim that helped our entire delegation feel welcome
I forgot to bring small stuff and the room service covered all I needed 😉",5,2024,06,14
117,I really enjoyed my stay,"I had a great stay at the Dilly for business. My room was comfortable, the location was fantastic, the breakfast was amazing and all of my needs were taken care of. Special thanks to Selim who took care of everything! I had a very seamless experience.",5,2024,06,14
117,"I will definitely come back to stay at the dilly, it answered all I wished for.","Hospitality was above expected, the hotel is located in the heart of London right next to Piccadilly Circus and close to all the big attractions. The room was super clean, breakfast is amazing.
the hotel has a swimming pool and a Sauna which are an added value to the high level of hospitality.",5,2024,06,14
117,Fantastic experience,"I stayed at The Dilly and had a fantastic experience. The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating, making me feel welcomed from the moment I arrived - especially Selim. Additionally, the location was perfect, with easy access to nearby attractions and dining option. Thanks!!",5,2024,06,14
117,Good London hotel,"For central London, this was a very nice surprise. Rooms are spacious with good beds and a decent bathroom : the staff are lovely and couldn't have been more helpful. It was my partner's 75th birthday and they provided her will all sorts of ""goodies"" to make her stay more special - this was very thoughtful. The location is perfect for the West End, Covent Garden etc and, somewhat surprisingly, the noise levels were fine.",5,2024,06,13
117,Perfect,"Perefect from all aspects!
The room was big and comfortable, spectacular breakfest and amazing spa area with pool and steams. The hotel team are nice and gave very good service that made the experience to be perfect. I will definitely come back again!",5,2024,06,11
117,Great romantic weekend in the beautiful Dilly Hotel,"Amazing huge room in this historic hotel. We had hard a great romantic experience in the Dilly. Great and warm stuff. Nice and rich breakfast 
And the location was just WOW!! 5 min walk from all London center attraction like the beautiful SoHo, Mayfair neighborhood and more",5,2024,06,11
117,Unforgettable experience at The Dilly,"At the beginning of June, we arrived at the hotel {a group of over 20 rooms}.
I have no words to describe how much we enjoyed the experience, how amazing the service was, and how unforgettable it was.

It's all thanks to Selim, a senior manager who just did everything to make it a dream come true!
Selim helped us all the way, took care of us, and helped us make the right connections in hotel management so that we could have dreamy days.

The hotel is beautiful and clean, located in the best place in London. The pool is dreamy, and the breakfast is perfect — simply wow.

From this standard - it is impossible to go down..
From now on, I only come to The Dilly.
Selim - Thank you for everything; you are amazing.",5,2024,06,11
117,Broken promises,"So disappointed with The Dilly. I spent 2 nights there in April. Unfortunately our room wasn’t ready when we arrived (I’m disabled and had requested a mobility friendly room). After traveling for several hours, I was exhausted when we got to the hotel and I was looking forward to a rest before dinner, but had to wait almost 3 hours to get into my room. 
The hotel manager promised me a free night bed and breakfast for two, as compensation and I though this was a lovely gesture. 
However, despite leaving my details, and emailing the hotel, they have failed to uphold their promise. I have heard nothing from them.
I feel I have been fobbed off, they obviously didn’t want me making any fuss on the day, which I wouldn’t have done even though it spoilt the start to of holiday.
Very, very disappointed that I would be treated this way. My experience means I can’t recommend The Dilly to anyone with a disability or additional needs.",3,2024,06,10
117,Nice hotel,"My favorite hotel 😍 is very wonderful.
 I will return to it. The location is good, Behind the hotel, Regent Street close to everything. The Dilly team was very helpful and     kind I thank Abdul Hamid for changing the room for us, and also Adam.

thaank you alllll🙏🏼",5,2024,06,10
117,Travelodge Rooms and suspicious staff,"The bar and restaurant areas of this hotel are phenomenal but the rooms are a massive let down.I was shocked to find the standard of our room being akin to that of a Travelodge.Fixtures and fitting were either squint or hanging off the wall, windows hadn’t been cleaned in eons and my bed hadn’t even been made properly (see photo).The one saving grace was that the toiletries were brilliant!
Staff wouldn’t make us a cocktail in the bar as they had to save their time for an event although it hadn’t even started yet and the bar was vvvv quiet.Further,when we went to put the drinks on the room we were eyed with complete suspicion and the bar man said we couldn’t do it until he checked with reception that we had given the correct room number.For this to be done so blatantly and in front of my children was absolutely mortifying.Not the type of behaviour I expect from staff in an establishment if this calibre.
I would suggests that you are better off upping your budget and staying a wee bit further down the road at The Ritz.",1,2024,06,09
117,Superb,"Fabulous stay, they couldn’t have made our stay anymore special. My granddaughter was so happy when she saw the bed had her name in rose petals. Upgraded to a suite, can’t thank the hotel enough. Great swimming pool area. Breakfast was superb.",5,2024,06,07
117,"""Unexpectedly Poor Service and uncompetitive Rates at The Dilly""","I had a deeply disappointing experience with The Dilly while trying to make a group reservation. Despite providing clear information and being questioned multiple times to prove my details, I was met with unhelpful responses and a lack of autonomy to offer competitive rates. This back-and-forth spanned over six emails, only to end with an unsatisfactory resolution.

I felt surprised and let down by the level of service and communication. Additionally, I found that all online rates, whether non-refundable or pay-at-stay, were significantly better than the rates offered directly by the hotel. 

This is not what I expected from a hotel of such reputation. I hope others have a better experience, but I felt compelled to share my ordeal here.",1,2024,06,07
117,"Old style glam, with modern comfort and attitude.","Great location right in the centre of London. A very comfortable stay, with well equipped rooms. The terrace restaurant on the second floor had great views and a huge array of food with chef on hand to cook personal orders. The low lit swimming pool in the basement was so relaxing, with steam room too.  Best of all the staff are really helpful. Abdul, a team leader on reception, cheerfully  sorted out our complicated family booking and made our stay very happy and problem free",5,2024,06,06
117,Incredible Venue for our Wedding!,"Weeks later we are still absolutely overwhelmed by The Dilly hotel, it was the perfect wedding venue. They had it all, from phenomenal staff to incredible food to the most beautiful room we had to celebrate our wedding in; The Terrace. We could not have asked for better. Sara from the events team was outstanding, she was so attentive and made sure that everything we wanted for our day was achieved. Nothing was too much trouble for Sara and we cannot thank her enough for her amazing service that helped our day become memorable. Neil & Jake from the banqueting team were on hand all day to ensure the reception ran smoothly and all their hard work and dedication made this possible with all our guests complementing how great the day went. Also The Dilly do the best Tiramisu in the world! 
Thanks so much again to Sara and her team for making our wedding day incredible.",5,2024,06,06
117,"Superb location, VIP treatment","The location of the hotel is in the 
Middle of west end. Convenient for a late night show. It is also walkable to the regent street and oxford circus and mayfair shopping areas, Soho and chinatown for dining/ drinks and Covent garden, Hyde park as well as other main attractions. The service was amazing, we came for special anniversary occasion and we were treated like VIPs with access to executive lounge and amazing room decors. Loom for Salim if you come here, he is the best guest relations manager.",5,2024,06,05
117,The Dilly - A very good hotel for the price!,"The Dilly is a great hotel for the room I had and the price payed. I had a superior twin on the fifth floor of the building. Checking in was simple as I had booked online and the staff were fine, they weren't overly friendly however they seemed perfectly happy accommodating any need I would of had and I didn't feel as if I wouldn't be able to ask for assistance. I was given my room cards in a small holder (something to note when using the lift, the scanner inside can be temperamental if you have multiple cards in the holder). Upon entering the room there was a strong smell of bleach or some other cleaning product similar, this did not bother me and reassured me the room had been cleaned recently but I can understand how this could be something that could be an issue for others. The room was cool which is brilliant during the summer however the A/C unit was a little loud and the control panel seemed to be either outdated or damaged in some way having certain dials that would not turn to the correct marked positions. 

The room was spacious and the facilities were clean (hence the bleach smell) however I did notice some marking on the chromed hardware in the bathroom especially on the plugs and some general wear and tear on skirting boards and furniture items. The room came with a Nespresso coffee maker and four complimentary pods along with glasses and a glass bottle of mineral water. The wardrobe was spacious for two people and came with a safe which I had some issue locking, a hairdryer and an iron. There were picture lights in the room above the pictures however these didn't seem to work and if they did they were too loose so just sat on the glass of the frame. 

The beds were comfortable and were neither too soft or too hard and the mattresses were soft with no signs of springs wearing through. The pillows were pleasant if not a little soft for my taste. There were no additional pillows in the room however I'm sure you could of asked for additional ones at reception. 

I had a late train for departure the following day and checkout was at 12 o'clock however I wanted to spend my day at Battersea, wandering around the city and maybe do some shopping. The hotel is very centrally located so getting anywhere was a breeze and the hotel was able to store my bags for the day so I was able to leave my bags there after checkout and later pick them up when I was ready to leave for the train station where several staff did ask if I would need a taxi. I would say the service here is attentive with a neutral face which I do appreciate greatly. 

Overall the service here was great and the location is perfect for a city break to explore any part of London from the West end to Chelsea. The room was great however there is still 'room' for improvement to create a truly perfect experience with some closer attention to detail with the maintenance of appliances and maybe some polishing of plugs in the bathrooms. The hotel clearly has some great facilities too though I was not interested in them for this trip if I was to stay here again I would probably take advantage of their presence.",4,2024,06,05
117,Fell short of expectations,"After reading a lot of positive reviews, we were surprisingly disappointed in our stay at The Dilly.

To kick things off, we had requested an early checkin (where available) a couple of times over booking.com as we were due to arrive in London around 9am from an overnight flight to NYC. Upon arriving at The Dilly (around 11am), we were advised that our room was not ready but we would receive a text message if it was available before the standard checkin time of 3pm. After wandering around London for a couple of hours, we arrived back around 1.45pm and advised our room was still not ready. This was disappointing as despite the earlier requests via booking.com as well as our request in person, it was clear that they made no effort to prioritize our room to be cleaned. They provided us access to the lounge while we waited however no one came to tell us when our room was ready. We eventually checked in around 3.15pm after following up.

Upon entering our room we were disappointed that there was no bathtub as illustrated in the pictures for our room type (Executive King Room) on booking.com. Further, there were no power points in the bathroom so in order to use the hairdryer, etc, you must do it beside the TV in the bedroom (very strange).

Lastly, we soon realised our room’s electricity was not working properly and we were even unable to use the hairdryer or coffee machine provided. This was resolved in approx one hour by the building’s engineer. Shortly after, the bedside table lamp stopped working and so did anything plugged into the ‘old’ power points.

Overall, this was definitely not a ‘5 star’ hotel experience.",3,2024,06,05
117,Wonderful service with an excellent location,"I have stayed at the Dilly last month, for a short vacation.

Upon arrival I was welcomed by Mr. Salim Atias, at reception, who helped me with all my questions and needs. I received great tips for my visit from him, and he made my stay much more enjoyable.

I’ll definitely return.",5,2024,06,03
117,Amazing hotel in the heart of London,"All the beauty of the hotel, the meticulous service, the rooms, the dining room and the facilities would have had no value without Salim Atias who made sure that our experience was enjoyable, successful and unforgettable. We and our friends thank you from the bottom of our hearts and will of course recommend Dilli Hotel to everyone",5,2024,06,02
117,Excellent Suprise in the heart of Piccadilly!,"We are pleased to let you know of our views on the Dilly. We were greeted with news of a room upgrade which was a pleasant and welcomed surprise. Upon entering the room there was a complimentary welcome gift along with a bottle of wine. Another welcome surprise. The room , by European standards was quite large and very comfortable. Also, it was quiet for restful sleep. The included breakfast was plentiful and superb. Staff members were kind, pleasant and helpful.

Should we get back to London, we will certainly book again.",5,2024,06,01
117,Extra special,"Just checked out after a lovely few days, perfect central location to explore the sights.

We will definitely be returning.",5,2024,05,29
117,I'm moving in!!!,"I'm sitting on my hotel bed whilst writing this review as I don't want to leave. To say I've had an absolutely amazing time, the most perfect time, it would be an understatement. This is my first stay in a 5-star London hotel and we have been pampered to the hilt.
I booked the hotel as a 30th-anniversary surprise for my husband. It was to be date night! From the moment we entered, we were greeted by the lovely Concierge team and welcomed beautifully by the supreme Guest Relations department. (Huge shout out to Don, Moushakhe and Kateryna, who greeted us with kindness and smiles and were just as excited as we were for our Anniversary. Thank you for beginning our visit in the most wonderful way.)
We were treated to the most exquisite room -  spacious, comfortable and charming, with thoughtful details and touches. The bed was so big I had to phone my husband just to ask him what the weather was like on his side!
The next morning, we opted for the buffet breakfast. It was a hive of organised activity fantastically run by Miguel, who took the time to show us the different buffet areas. (There's a pancake machine and a chef at an Egg Station! An Egg Station people!!) A thank you to the forever cheerful Oscar who looked after us.
And so it's 11.59 and check out is at 12.00. I shall now drag my heartbroken feet out of this fine establishment and back to reality. Rest assured I shall be back The Dilly Hotel, I shall be back!
Would wholeheartedly recommend The Dilly? Don't be daft, I'm moving in!!",5,2024,05,29

117,Amazing stay - as always everyone went the extra mile!,"Our usual hotel choice in London never fails to impress and for us to having an amazing time. As every year we'd go to London for my birthday. And the Dilly team went again the extra mile, not only with the room decoration, but also with the presents and even having a special cake incl. Bday song at the night of my party, held downstairs at the bar. Loved the decoration at the bar, too!
I would like to thank all our fantastic friends & family at the Dilly for looking after us: The best of course to begin with: George, Mark & Selim!! THANK YOU! Especially when we had to come back for one night after our flight cancellation, you made that so easy and straight forward, despite a fully boked hotel (Easter weekend!).

117,Good hotel in central  position,"Nice hotel in a central position. Staff very friendly. Good choice at breakfast, room clean, quiet and spacious. 
No hairdryer in room, a few people at breakfast ( including myself) had wet hair as a result, I didn’t bring my own as i wrongly thought there would be one. Also, no air conditioning in room which resulted in trying to cool down by opening windows as far as we could, but  it didn’t make much difference, it was still too hot. However we enjoyed the one night we spent there, so thank you.",4,2024,05,25
117,Birthday Surprise!,"We stayed at The Dilly for two nights to celebrate my husband’s 60th birthday. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by friendly staff at reception, who wished my husband a ‘Happy Birthday’, gave him a lovely gift and informed us of a room upgrade. 
I would especially like to thank Elena Malageac,  from the Guest Relations Team, for pulling out all the stops to make our stay very special and memorable.   
She had our room beautifully decorated with balloons and gifts, including a chocolate platter and Prosecco!  There was even a birthday message on the bathroom mirror! We were blown away by the effort that had gone into making our stay so special.
I can thoroughly recommend The Dilly for celebrating a special event, right in the heart of London!

Would recommend",4,2024,05,20
117,Exceptionally nice stay,"We traveled as a family of 5 to this tasteful and high-quality hotel with very nice staff.  Our two nice rooms and a generously proportioned suite were  cozy and nicely furnished.

I got an upgrade to a huge suite, which they decorated with balloons and gifts, and a bottle of bubbles. I was speechless and really touched.  Felt like a princess 👸. Made my trip to my favourite city a truly special experience. Putting all this aside, I chose the hotel because it’s in an amazing location. It’s slap in the middle of the city, with all the fun, glamour and energy that is London. And inside the hotel it has a massive pool, a great gym and spa, plus restaurant and bar - which i didn’t use but had live music on Friday evening and was buzzing.

I would definitely recommend this hotel and I’ll be back, knowing I won’t get the special treatment, but because it has everything to make a great visit to London.",5,2024,05,04
117,5 star stay,"The Dilly is a great 5star hotel to stay in. Heather on reception was lovely, very friendly and helpful. The doorman (I did not get his name) but he was lovely as well. Very polite and knowledgeable of the local area.

If you are going as a couple have a drink in the speakeasy bar.",5,2024,05,03
117,Location is a 10! Staff is a 10!,"We loved The Dilly! You can not get a better location than this hotel. We had tickets to the Phantom of the Opera and the theater was only a 7 minute walk away. 
The staff was very welcoming and friendly and worked to get us in early to one of our two rooms. 
There was always snacks out in the lobby - fresh fruit, packaged cookies or hard candies. 
We had drinks in the bar one night and Marina went above and beyond to make our evening special.  We would 100% stay here again. I've already recommended it to family who will be in London in July.",5,2024,05,03

117,Front desk staff are fantastic,Abdul at the front desk was so patient and kind to me and my daughter. We had some trouble with our reservation at first because of how we booked it. Abdul worked to come up with a solution. The location is fantastic and the hotel is beautiful.,5,2024,04,27
117,A good choice,This is a very nice central hotel in a prime london neighbourhood— Soho. It is five stars and when you walk inside it seems so. I was booked in the suite for business on the 5th floor. It was very spacious and accommodating! The absolutely best parts of the hotel is first the super comfortable and spacious California king size bed but also the service provided to us by Abdul at the front desk. He was the absolute loveliest person and really helped us resolve any issues we had.,5,2024,04,26
117,4 nights in London,"We stayed at The Dilly Hotel for 4 nights and were extremely happy we picked this hotel while staying in London.

PROS:

- very huge room, one of the best rooms I’ve ever stayed in. 
- friendly staff.
- breakfast is good.
- indoor pool",5,2024,04,25
117,Will probably cancel at this rate…,"Booked an afternoon tea here. Want to add on another person. However, emails are unanswered, messenger is unanswered and no one at ‘the terrace’ picks up the phone. 
Thinking of cancelling and finding elsewhere as need to book train tickets and unable to with communication from the hotel.",1,2024,04,24
117,Amazing Concierges,The concierges at the Dilly were very helpful and accommodating especially the one with the golden keys! They went above and beyond to answer every question I had and help me find the perfect tours with Evan Evans Tours. Additionally their recommendations and knowledge of the area was amazing.,5,2024,04,24
117,The Dilly - a real birthday delight!,"Talk about pulling out all the stops! This was my second stay at The Dilly - both have been excellent. 
From the lovely warm welcome from Hossein who was front of desk and helped make some special arrangements, to the amazing birthday decorations in our bedroom (balloons, champagne, chocolates, rose petals!!!) that were a complete surprise and had my twin sister and I jumping up and down and making video calls left right and centre - we couldn’t have been more touched. The busy breakfast team also deserve a mention - they work so hard, without pause and manage to smile throughout. The housekeeping throughout the hotel is impeccable. The Dilly is an old building with a lot of history, and parts of the bedroom and bathroom show their age but it was a super comfortable stay. Having stayed at another Leonardo hotel over Christmas in Cheltenham it’s clear who ever looks after their customer service programme is doing a great job. And final mention, to the lovely doormen. All ever so helpful and great banter to boot!",5,2024,04,22
117,Disappointing !!,"I don’t understand why this place is a 5-star hotel. To start with, the woman at the reception was so unpleasant, not helpful and condescending. Also, the room was nice and large, but you could feel it had not been refreshed since a long time : there was rust in the bath, and no mixing valve. The breakfast was nice but not breathtaking , I’ve experienced way better ones. To make it short, I’m glad I was on a business trip and it was not my money !",2,2024,04,21
117,WEEKEND IN LONDON,"Very well located, in the heart of London, perfect for a weekend trip. Old styled with very kind workers. We have been very well attended by the Front Desk Team Leader, Mr. Abdul Hamed.
We do recommend this place as the swimming pool is tremendous, the british breakfast is great and the rooms very comfortable.",4,2024,04,20
117,Beautiful location,"Very nice hotel, one of the best location possibel in London. Clean and specious rooms. Good breakfast at a beautifull room.  If you plan to visit London and be at a central location wirh walking distance to the big ben hyde soho and much other space then this is the best option.",5,2024,04,19
117,"Everything was incredibly enjoyable, everyone working was helpful and very friendly. I would like to thank especially Mr","Hello. Everything was incredibly enjoyable, everyone working was helpful and very friendly. I would especially like to thank Mr. Selim. He made us feel comfortable like at home and took care of our every need. See you again as soon as possible.",5,2024,04,19
117,An oasis of calm and luxury,"On the whole I would say that our stay was definitely one of the best we've had in London. The location was absolutely perfect as we were coming to London for a theatre trip but coming through the doors of The Dilly and we were in an oasis of calm and comfort. 
The only issue we had was regarding payment where it wasn't properly communicated that the full amount was taken with pre-authorisatiion. I have no issue with this but the desk agent tried to take the payment 5 times and then saying that the payment had been declined. This was embarrassing and untrue as I had paid but further training on this matter would be a good idea. 
One of our highlights, aside from the breakfast which was insanely good, was the service and care we received from Marina and Edwin in the hotel bar when we stopped in for a nightcap. Marina couldn't have been any more friendly and professional and our drinks were unique and delicious and obviously made with knowledge and care, so thank you to Marina and Edwin for looking after us with such care.
I also let the staff know that my husband was celebrating his birthday and the cake, balloons and prosecco in the room was a perfect touch and greatly appreciated 
Was definitely worth the money and we look forward to staying again",5,2024,04,18
117,Absolutely fantastic stay,"This hotel is the best in Mayfair thanks to the warm and professional service from Selim Atias. Perfect service, caring, attention to details, always available. He cares for the clients and for the staff. The atmosphere really changed in this hotel since Selim arrived.",5,2024,04,17
117,"Perfect Hotel, Outstanding Personnel","We have stayed at many hotels and airbnb's in the last few years in London. The Dilly is far most the best hotel ever. The location could not be any better. Rooms are very nice & clean and pretty big compared to other London hotel rooms. Breakfast is outstanding, everyone should try it. But what makes the hotel so unique for us is the personnel. Very helpful, always smiley. Special thanks to Mr. Selim who had always done his best for our outstanding holiday. Looking forward to come again.",5,2024,04,15
117,Perfect hotel in central London,"We stayed for one night and were treated like royalty. We had been upgraded to a suite which was a lovely surprise and every member of staff couldn’t do enough for us.

 Can’t wait to go back!",5,2024,04,13
117,Our new home in London,"We really had a perfect holiday. At the hotel, breakfast is served in a wonderful winter garden. All staff are very caring and helpful. The location is great. Walking distance to all attractions. The fact that taxis, buses and hop-on hop-offs are constantly passing in front of the hotel really makes everything easier. The hotel is spotless and very well maintained. We would like to thank Selim Bey, who took great care of us. This is the reason why we will definitely choose this place when we come again. We highly recommend it.",5,2024,04,12

ホテルからバッキンガム宮殿に歩いていけます。
ホテルの周りにお店もたくさんあり便利でした。

またロンドンに行く時にはぜひ泊まりたいです。

All the people at the hotel were kind and kind. 
The room was clean and very comfortable.

You can walk to Buckingham Palace from the hotel. 
There were many shops around the hotel and it was convenient.

I really want to stay when I go to London again.",5,2024,04,07
117,Perfect place to stay.,"Excellence and professionalism. Outstanding place to be. After a sightseeing a cool swim in the pool, followed by a sip in the outrageous barroom. Located directly at Piccadilly, all places are easy to reach. The building itself is a monument, the people working there have a huge identity with a special sense of hospitality.",5,2024,04,06
117,Amazing stay,"Stayed at The Dilly Tuesday 2nd April for my husbands birthday. Did contact them to say it was my husbands birthday and could they put a banner in the room. Arrived to the hotel about 3,15 to book in, lovely welcoming smile as we entered the building. Reception staff were very nice and chatty. Our room was 705, lovely large room, full of balloons, happy birthday messages written on the mirrors. Red petals on the bed saying happy birthday. My husband had a huge smile on his face. The Dilly really went above and beyond. The room was very clean, bathroom was very large with everything one needed. We went out to the theatre in the evening.
We returned to the hotel about 10.30pm and had a drink at the bar. Staff were great wishing my husband a happy birthday.
Had a great night sleep, bed was very comfortable and the room was very quiet. Went down for breakfast about 9.45am. We received a very warm welcome and shown where everything was. Absolutely lots to choose from. Was very busy, but well organised.
The hotel was in a brilliant location. Staff were brilliant. Had a wonderful stay and really can't thank the Dilly enough for such an enjoyable stay ",5,2024,04,06
117,Very good hotel!,"Very good hotel in central London. Very polite and responsive staff. The managers Abdul and Latika helped me upgrade my room and were very kind, friendly and efficient!

The hotel has its own swimming pool, steam room and cool gym. A good restaurant for breakfast, where there is no smell of food and clothes will remain fresh. There is also a restaurant for dinner. The location is the best in London.

I think this place has the best value for money. The rooms are good, clean. You feel safe. This hotel is very suitable for those traveling with families. But it is also good for business people.",5,2024,04,06
117,excellent,"I came with my mother for my birthday trip in London from the moment we met Selim Atias, I had an amazing experience when we got to the room there were many gifts, balloons and decorations waiting for me. The room was very large, a large shower. Breakfast was excellent, the pool at the hotel is excellent and it's fun to pamper yourself after a day of sightseeing.
The location of the hotel is great, I highly recommend the hotel.",5,2024,04,04
117,"Perfect location, great hotel and amazing staff!","Booked The Dilly for a 2 night stay in London for my partner’s birthday. I contacted the hotel in advance of our trip to request a room on a higher floor and to advise of our celebrations. The Dilly exceeded our expectations and helped make my our celebrations so memorable. We had an upgraded room on the 8th floor with excellent views of London and the room was decorated for my partner’s birthday with complimentary Prosecco, cakes and gifts to take home. The staff were incredibly polite, welcoming, efficient and friendly and a real credit to this hotel. The breakfast was, without doubt, the best breakfast we have had, having travelled all over Europe - such quality and a lovely ambience in the restaurant. There were a couple of small snags, a blocked bathroom tap, a weak pressure shower and general cosmetic issues however these are minor remarks and did not spoil our stay in the slightest. Excellent hotel, perfect central location and we cannot wait to return when we are next in London. Thank you very much to all at The Dilly!",5,2024,04,03
117,recommended,"The hotel has a perfect location. My room was cosy, clean and spacious with a confortable bed. I experienced a welcoming staff. As well as great services including the restaurant, bar and spa. It is really a good value for money, I can recommend to stay at Dilly.",5,2024,04,02
117,Great family room in central location,"Outstanding location about a minute walk from picadilly circus station.  Perfect hub to get anywhere.  Walk to Big Ben, Trafalgar, Carnaby, Buckingham, Regent St. Spacious junior suite with couch bed. Pool and steam room were lovely.  Great family trip.",5,2024,04,02
117,Great Central Hotel for shows.,"We stayed here for 2 nights. Great experience.  Our room was on 6th floor looking out to the front of hotel.   Check-in was fast and efficient.  We were greater at the doors by a great doorman named Paul. He proved to be a gold star pot of information. When we got to room they had decorated our room as I was celebrating my 60th and my husband had told them this. Balloons, bed room all decorated beautifully and complimentary bubbles, cake, chocolates were an amazing surprise. There was a card saying who had done it so big thankyou to Chenlyn who had arranged it all.  Room was spotlessly clean, spacious. Plenty of storage. Only criticism was plug for kettle/ coffee machine was situated too far from table behind net curtain to plug in which meant you had to rearrange furniture to accommodate this. Bathroom good size, overbath shower, heated towel rail, space round sink for your washbags. Small wall shower was a bit silly as you had to stoop to use and put your head against wall which realistically made it pointless.Plenty hangers, a safe, fridge, ironing board, iron, etc. 
All in all room was perfect. Beds comfortable,  pillows good. 
We didn't have breakfast as had already made other arrangements but Di use both bars and they were very good.",5,2024,04,01

117,Our new favourite hotel!,"We are just home after a one night stay at The Dilly. We were two couples celebrating a birthday and The Dilly was perfect in every way. I emailed ahead of our stay asking if there was an extra touch they could arrange for our friend’s room to wish him happy birthday. Chenlyn from guest relations emailed back promptly and said they would be happy to…they really pulled out all the stops! Balloons, fizz and some desserts and even a bottle of wine and treats in our room. The rooms were lovely, we enjoyed fabulous cocktails in the piano bar and the location of the hotel is perfect.

117,Wedding Anniversary trip,The Dilly is definitely the best hotel in London! We went there for our 60th wedding anniversary with our daughter and son in law and were thoroughly spoilt. Not only did they upgrade our room (which lacked for nothing) they did the same for our daughters room too. Our room was beautifully decorated with rose petals and balloons and chocolates and champagne. Even our daughter and son in law got chocolates and wine! The bed and pillows were  sooooo comfortable. All the staff were happy and very helpful and Abdul on reception made us feel like we were so important and nothing was too much trouble. The hotel restaurant was brilliant and breakfast too was excellent with plenty of choice. Would we stay at this hotel again? You bet your life we would!!,5,2024,03,23
117,Wonderful 60th Wedding Anniversary,"Our stay ant The Dilly was absolutely amazing! It was my parents 60th wedding anniversary and the hotel had made the room so lovely with balloons and rose petals and a personalised message on the mirror. Both rooms were upgraded and a lovely gift of bubbles/wine and cakes were left in the rooms. All of the staff were friendly and polite, but Abdul Hammeed was especially attentive and made us feel like nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were very spacious with fantastic air conditioning and the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in. All in all, they made a special occasion even more special and extremely memorable. We will definitely be back!",5,2024,03,22

117,A Grand Old **DOG FREINDLY** Hotel & A Shout Out to Nora & Sophie!,"The Dilly is the Grand Old Lady of Piccadilly in terms of hotels, its location for Central London is perfect.

When you walk into the reception hall you can’t help but be impressed by the building but what really stand out is the friendliness of the staff. Warm greetings and smiles were always the order of the day whenever we came into contact with the staff in Reception, with the Housekeeping staff in the corridors and at breakfast.

Everyone was so helpful, and nothing was too much trouble.

We had our 2-year-old Australian Labradoodle with us and she had a huge fuss made of her by all the staff and indeed fellow guests.

Breakfast at the Dilly is fantastic and not to be missed. Even at the busiest times the food display looked fresh and there was a fantastic choice. Eggs cooked to order which is so often not the case these days.

And to top our breakfast off we were looked after each morning by Nora. The first morning we went for breakfast we chose the busiest time so had to queue for a few minutes which was fine. We were then given a really warm welcom and a beaming smile by Nora. She ask if we had dined at the Dilly before and when we said no she took the time to explain everything and make sure we had everything we needed plus she kept checking we were ok throughout her breakfast. Nora was a real credit to The Dilly.

And then there was Sophie one of the Dilly managers who seemed to pop up all over the place and went out of her way to make out stay very special",5,2024,03,20
117,Fabulous ❤️,"Thankyou so much to Carolina and all the staff at the Dilly for making our special occasion even more special and such a memorable experience. 
The Dilly is ideally located and is extra special. The room was lovely and the treats that Carolina and the staff treated us to were amazing! Thankyou so much 💓 
The hotel is perfect for a London trip!",5,2024,03,20
117,AWFUL,"Possibly up there with the worst hotels Ive paid for. how this has a 5 star rating baffles me.  The hotel apparently had a refurb in 2019 . I  guarantee this was not a full refurb throughout  . my room at 354 pounds a night without breakfast( which was an additional  30 pounds)  was shocking.  tiny room wit damaged furniture and really outdated style..  , really small bathroom with a disgusting shower curtain circa 1954  .  just awful and uninviting.   the bed was awful and ive returned home with bites all over me so no idea what has caused that,  but by the state of the room im guessing its from the bed.  really disappointed and i would avoid.  there are so many better hotels near by   dont get caught in the trap of location because that is clearly all it has going for them...  a total rip off.",1,2024,03,20
117,Ar one word saliem atias,"The hotel Located in a central and excellent area, but I note from the moment we entered the hotel and met the relations manager, Saliem Atias, the experience at the hotel is a good revolution and an experience I have never encountered, in terms of service and generosity. I will definitely return to this hotel. The hotel won this employee, saliem.",5,2024,03,19

One of my best experiences in hotels , this guy make the hotel like 7 stars hotel with the amazing service and hospitality, was there for every needs and also thought of things outside the box this guy is amazing and for sure I will come to this hotel become of Selim Atias. 
When we came to the check in we thought to change hotels but then we meet him and our vacation change in a second.",5,2024,03,19
117,Noisy,"Location brilliant
Dreadful noise came through the interconnecting door from the next room. Up at 430 when there were 4 or 5 people partying in the next room. Up several more times due to the noise. 
Also private functions meant the restaurant was closed the first night and the bar was overrun with conference goers the second. 
Finally hotel asked in advance by email if we were celebrating anything - we were - my 50th - then nothing. Don’t ask if you caring going to leave a little card or cake or wine.",3,2024,03,18
117,3-Star Hotel at best,Horrible experience! Only the pictures look good. The hotel room was very out dated with worn out furniture and bathroom. The breakfast place was not as organized as comparable places and the staff were not wearing a uniform. Food was ok. It was simply a rip off. They are taking advantage of the location. I would not recommend this place to anyone.,1,2024,03,17
117,Another wonderful stay at The Dilly,"Fortunate to have just returned from another amazing stay at The Dilly.  Our stay began with afternoon tea: homemade scones and cakes served with a selection of teas, coffees and other drinks.  Another welcoming bedroom with the most comfortable bed.  Fantastic breakfast with a huge selection of food.  Our waitress was Nora who was friendly, fun and excellent at her job.
Can’t wait to visit The Dilly again as soon as we can.",5,2024,03,16
117,Just perfect!,"Currently relaxing in our room after the most wonderful breakfast before checking out. Came here for my 40th birthday and it has been the most perfect stay. From check in we were greeted warmly, and then our room was made even more special by the decorations then little cakes and fizz that were left for us. 
Breakfast was just perfect. We love a breakfast buffet, and this one has it all including an omelette station! Our first trip, but definitely not our last. Thank you to all the staff for making this so special for us both.",5,2024,03,16
117,Great hotel in great location,"What a lovely hotel! Breakfast was beautiful, location is 2 minutes from tube and walking distance to many of main sites. The staff went above and beyond for my son’s 9th birthday and made him feel very special! Staff all very friendly. Pool is a wonderful and rare extra in London! Definitely recommend!",5,2024,03,15
117,CLEAN YOUR ROOMS,"So dirty… Why? 
The duvet cover covered with hairs, 100% not changed since last stay. 
Noisy towards the street. 
Not worth it all. 
Old shabby and dusty. If you want a clean stay don’t stay here. 
On top of that its noisy between the floors so zero good nights sleep",1,2024,03,15
117,Fabulous stay,"Stayed for my husband's birthday due to its great location just off Picadilly Circus. Wonderful surprise to find the room had balloons, petals, fizz, cake and a personalised birthday message on the mirror! The hotel was great. Really helpful staff especially Latika, lovely quiet room with a big comfy bed, a view over the rooftops (we were in room 810) and nice amenities in the room. The swimming pool was fantastic- we had it to ourselves and felt really classy. Breakfast was really delicious too!",5,2024,03,15
117,Excellent stay,"This hotel was excellent. The staff were lovely and helpful. The breakfast was good. Our room was really nice and a good size. However I’m glad I was sharing with my husband and not a friend as there was no wall between the bedroom area and the bathroom! Very strange. But I could at least shower and watch the tv.
I haven’t seen any mention in the booking or photos on their website of this strange room setup so adding them here.",4,2024,03,13
117,Simply Amazing,"Well what can I say, from the moment we booked and stepped in to this magnificent hotel, we were both made to feel so welcome. We booked though booking.com and once confirmed we were contacted personally from the hotel via email asking for any special requests, I mentioned it was my daughters birthday hence the booking and I had a wonderful reply saying “leave it with us”.

On arrival to the hotel we were welcomed with a very friendly team of staff. The lady on reception was extremely lovely whilst talking us through all the fantastic hotel facilities (she also told us we had been given an upgrade on our room!). 
We were on the 9th floor room 904, and my daughter was the first to see the room, and oh my goodness we were presented with balloons flowers bubbles and cake, it was absolutely magical and a wonderful start for my daughter’s birthday celebration. 

On our way out I mentioned to reception how I appreciated this and met with the manager Henry, he was simply welcoming kind and very professional what an asset for your company! You have chosen your staff so well as you certainly cannot get better, this hotel offers everything they say they can offer and more! The location, facilities, food and drinking lounges are all of high standard with a choice of different moods, you have a wonderful piano bar with a calming ambiance too! 
The Dilly you have certainly fulfilled my every expectation and you have a customer for life! 
This is definitely my new London home! We will be back soon!",5,2024,03,11
117,A beautiful week at The Dilly,"An outstanding experience of a prefect hotel. I stayed at The Dilly for 7 nights, and throughout my stay I received the best treatment possible. It has a lot to do with the Mr. Selim Atias who is in charge, he did everything possible to give me and who ever enters the hotel, the best London can offer. 
My room at the 1st floor certainly felt like home.",5,2024,03,11
117,Great from start to finish,"From check in to leaving, service was excellent.
Breakfast was amazing everything you could want.
Although Moushakhe Das had just started and was learning, her customer skills where exactly what you would want when checking into a Hotel of this quality.
She will be a great asset to the Dilly",5,2024,03,08
117,Review the Dilly Hotel,"During my recent stay at the Dilly Hotel, I found myself disappointed by several aspects of the accommodation. Firstly, the room I was allocated felt outdated and lacked any noise-canceling features, making it difficult to escape the disturbances from neighboring rooms. Throughout my six-night stay, the noise from adjacent guests greatly impacted my ability to sleep, leaving me feeling unrested and fatigued.

Additionally, I found the housekeeping service to be lacking, particularly in regards to replenishing amenities. The frequent absence of essential items left me feeling inconvenienced and disappointed with the overall standard of cleanliness and upkeep.

Another drawback was the consistently cold water supply, which made showering an uncomfortable experience. Despite attempts to adjust the temperature, the issue persisted throughout my stay, adding to my dissatisfaction with the hotel's facilities.

On a more positive note, I did appreciate the well-equipped gym facilities offered by the hotel. The gym provided a welcome opportunity to maintain my fitness routine during my travels, and I found the range of equipment to be sufficient for my needs.

Furthermore, the hotel's location proved to be advantageous, situated conveniently within reach of local attractions and amenities. This aspect of the Dilly Hotel enhanced the overall convenience of my stay and provided easy access to nearby points of interest.

In summary, while the Dilly Hotel offers a convenient location and satisfactory gym facilities, the outdated rooms, lack of noise cancellation, poor housekeeping standards, and issues with water temperature significantly detracted from the overall quality of my experience. Mind you i have been upgraded but its a downgrade since they have VIP guests and they want to assure their satisfaction rather than us.",2,2024,03,07
117,A lasting memory,"On arrival we were met with a courteous doorman who we would learn was a very knowledgeable man in food, wine, and places of interest, the reception desk area is set in 1930s decor and very efficient. We were celebrating a 70th birthday and they were wonderful in decorating the suite we were given,  it was really fantastic with rose petals and balloons on the ceiling. We thought it a very thoughtful, and again to our astonishment were delivered champagne and chocolates.  Thank you chenlyn for the card accompanying this gift. Breakfast was a pleasure with varied food to please all tastes. Abdul hasseem on reception was thoughtful, and helped us on more than one occasion. Though i have mentioning these members,  we can but praise, all who work there in the hotel, the furniture is in keeping with the building, and gives the nostalgia of the hotel  thanks again for a wonderful trip and were sorry to leave.",5,2024,03,05
117,Best birthday trip,"Best birthday trip ever thanks to The Dilly, they surprised me with flowers all over the bed and a cute message on the mirror. Also the bubbles and sweets were waiting for us on the table :) 

The beds are very comfortable, I haven’t slept so deep in a long time. Very big room also, we were staying comfortably with the four of us. Thank you Mr Selim for arranging everything and making our stay perfect!!",5,2024,03,05
117,Amazing,"Our stay at the hotel was absolutely amazing! From the moment we arrived, the staff was incredibly welcoming and attentive. The room was spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated, with stunning views of the city. We were also blown away by the delicious breakfast served at the hotel's restaurant. Overall, our experience was nothing short of exceptional, and we can't wait to return!",5,2024,03,05
117,Service Below Expectation,"The hotel is lovely, location is perfect - I stayed in an exec room which was really spacious but a little tired, bathroom was particularly tired and quite small in comparison to the room, I can echo the comments RE minimal plug sockets. Was also a little surprised that the mini bar was completely empty! 

On the second night I ordered from room service as worked quite late and was too tired to go out - the food took a while to arrive and when it was delivered unfortunately it was completely the wrong order, I was too tired and hungry to send it back so ate it! 

The next morning I realised there were no breakfast tea, tea bags, it was 5am so I messaged room service via WhatsApp to ask if I could have some tea bags and sugar - the reply I received was quite terse! Exact words were that I’d get it after 6:30! 

I didn’t leave the room til 8am and unfortunately no sign of any tea bags!! I left a note asking for breakfast tea, tea bags and sugar however it wasn’t replenished when I got back from the office at 7pm though the note had been disposed of! 

Appreciate these are reasonably small gripes but not quite what I’d expect from a 5 star hotel",3,2024,03,05
117,Unforgettable,"The BEST stay with the sweetest staff and credits to the manager, Selim Atias, for helping us make the best birthday-trip ever come true. The location of the hotel is amazing, our room was so much bigger than expected, and they decorated it very beautifully for our friends birthday. Breakfast was also tasty, with various options and a beautiful terrace view. The Dilly will be my second home away from home. Everything was 1000/10!!",5,2024,03,05
117,A good stay with a few niggles.,"Booked a deal with Secret Escapes for a weekend break in an executive king size room. The room was spacious and clean with a huge bed. Everything was in the room that you would expect from a hotel of this standard including slippers, robes, tea and coffee etc.
The bathroom was massive with a walk in shower. There was a heated towel rail, which wasn't on, and no other form of heating. The tiled floor made the room very cold. The hot tap worked but was broken and came off in my hand.
There was a serious lack of plug sockets in the bedroom and it was a good job we had brought an extension lead. The lighting was also very poor 
Breakfast was very good and there was a good selection of hot and cold food available.
Most of the staff were very friendly helpful and professional.
A good stay with a few niggles.",4,2024,03,03
117,Great location.,"All the staff team were extremely helpful, polite and efficient.
The hotel is in a super location and only a few minutes walk to two underground stations.  We had bed a breakfast.  The room was spacious, clean and well appointed.  The reason for four stars and not five is that the bathroom, although clean, could do with being updated.",4,2024,02,29
117,An experience!,"Fantastic experience from start to finish with Hussain booking us in on arrival. We were there to see Plaza Suite at the Savoy and were upgraded to a suite which absolutely made our visit memorable. The suite was amazing and we felt so special and like it was a real occasion! We tried to use all the other facilities e.g. room service, the pool. All were 5 star experiences and we were not disappointed.  I would definitely recommend staying at the Dilly for anybody wishing to have a hotel experience like this.",5,2024,02,28
117,Do not like refunded your money!!,"Stay was fine been many times ashamed this time has ruined my experience. We wanted to eat at the in house restaurant and was told to reserve a table for the Saturday night as it can get busy. We went out sightseeing all day, came back with the intention staying in the hotel and eating in the restaurant, only to be told there was a private function and we could not use the restaurant. This was very annoying but we accepted it and ordered room service, after waiting nearly 2 hours the food was cold, inedible and very poor value for money.   I complained and was promised a refund this was the 4th Feb, still waiting end of Feb. . Absolutely no customer service, the check out guy said it had been actioned and paid back onto my card which was a lie. I have called only to have the calls terminated after waiting on hold for approx 10-15 mins, emails are ignored and this is only for a small amount, imagine if they owed you a great sum!! 
What a shame as had nice previous experiences they obviously dont want to part with any money for refunds.",1,2024,02,26
117,Excellent stay,"Excellent stay at The Dilly, felt really spoiled. The lobby and restaurant are stunning and staff were visible and helpful. Check in with Ryan was great, he was so considerate and made my stay with my daughter very special. The swimming pool and steam room were a brilliant addition which I have never experienced in a London hotel. It meant my daughter got a long lie while I went for a swim. I noticed a well equipped gym, which I managed to avoid. The hotel is so central with Piccadilly station visible from the front door. The location is perfect for a theatre and shopping break, couldn’t have asked for better. Thanks for a great stay.",5,2024,02,24
117,Helpful staff and great location,"Helpful staff great facilities and location great hotel my daughter and I enjoyed our stay here definitely would stay again so close to theatres and shops , staff helped us with every query and request for a bath in the room , we didn’t use the pool or gym but they looked good",5,2024,02,24

117,Best location and staff,"We had a truly fantastic stay!
The staff are all so friendly and kind, special mention to Don on reception who was fantastic, friendly and attentive.
It was my sisters birthday and they went above and beyond to ensure she had the best time from wine, cakes, balloons and rose petals. Bed was comfy, breakfast also fantastic.
Close to theatres, bars, restaurants 
Honestly can’t  recommend this hotel enough great location but the staffs care & professionalism are what made it!

The extensive range of dining options catered to various preferences, ensuring a satisfying culinary experience. Notably, Abdul's exceptional service stood out, contributing significantly to the overall enjoyment of my visit. His attentiveness and professionalism added a personal touch that elevated the entire dining experience. The welcoming ambiance, coupled with the diverse menu choices, made for a memorable outing.

117,Tired with glimmers of hope!,"Positives
- Breakfast, the staff at breakfast and Guest Relations. Great team! 
- Brilliant location 

Negatives
- Very tired and in desperate need of a refurbishment, in particular the bedrooms 
- Reception staff were unhelpful. I was charged twice by mistake at check in. My partner and I upgraded to have access to the Club Lounge. We visited it at around 6pm to find stale food and no alcohol. I walked to reception to ask if there was anyone serving or bringing extra drinks and the lady responded ‘No, once it’s gone it’s gone’. At 6pm…! Very bizarre and I found her extremely unhelpful - her two colleagues just stood there quietly
- There was lipstick on the glassware in the Club Lounge",2,2024,02,20
117,Very Disappointing Dilly,"We were really looking forward to our stay in this 5 start hotel in Piccadilly but were left very dissatisfied.  

We paid £550 for two nights in  a “superior room” however the experience was far from superior.  

One of the lifts was out of order and the two remaining lifts were very slow and didn’t seem to know where they were going ….. very frustrating.

The room was “nice enough”  being a good size (bathroom was a little small tho) but on arrival the room was literally like a sauna and the TV didn’t work. 

The TV turned out to be an easy fix (loose cable) but we were advised that the hotel did not have air conditioning system  but a “central heating” system and if the room was too hot the best thing to do would be to turn off the system and open a window,  only thing was the windows were locked and we weren’t allowed to open them as we were on the 7th floor.

The in-house restaurant, bar and gym were all of a good standard.

Overall a very un enjoyable stay and we will not be using the dilly again. ….4 out of 10.",2,2024,02,19
117,Amazing valentines weekend,"The location and facilities are fantastic. I came on Valentine’s Day weekend with my girlfriend and the set up they provided was straight out of a movie: rose pedals, chocolates, wine, the works. The staff was also incredibly friendly. Hope to be back soon!",5,2024,02,19
117,A wonderful London experience,"Stayed for a birthday and anniversary celebration. The staff went above and beyond to make it a special stay. The hotel is the best located, being walkable to both Green Park and Piccadilly Circus tube stations. Was also just down the road from The Ritz where we had afternoon tea. The cocktail bar was nice and relaxing with a nice ambience. Also the pool was really good. The evening reception staff (Saka and Elvis) were really helpful when we had some questions. The breakfast was great as well. We hope to stay again in the future.",5,2024,02,19
117,Never again,"My recent stay became one of the most unpleasant stay ever. I was at the piano bar and they refused to serve me a bottle of procecco, as I was an unaccompanied lady. I'm not sure why I had to be. Then they served me two more glasses. Then they said I had to have it in my room. I was on my own and looking at the phone and wasn't even speaking to anyone around me or loud. I find it very sexist. I am an adult and don't need anyone with me to have a drink at any bar. Other guests around me were shocked and also told me that they wonder if they have treat me the same if I was a male drinking on his own.
Or was it the fact I was an Asian?
I left around 1am on my own and nearly got bargled by some homeless person sitting around the hotel.
While the bar staff went on about how I was young pretty lady and they need to look after me which again none of their business and again I was not bothering anyone, they were completely fine with me checking out few drinks later as I was very unhappy and find the service sexist and racist, after midnight in Picadilly. Only thing they checked is outstanding payment and never offered to arrange taxi or whatsoever.

I requested an explanation on this matter from the  general manager and the copy of CCTV images at the bar but they have not responded.",1,2024,02,18
117,An oasis of peace in a busy place,"Excellent stay, service and atmosphere.
Very clean and comfortable, good location and one of the best breakfast buffets I've had in a hotel.
Sadly we didnt have time to use the pool, but will definitely be back for another stay so will try again next time 😊",5,2024,02,17
117,Great location that’s about it,Location is brilliant great access to city and tube station. We stayed for 3 nights in an executive room had a large bed which was comfortable and a walk in shower. The room was very warm when we entered we were on the 7th floor room 715. I rang reception and asked where the air condition controls were to be told the hotel didn’t have air conditioning but there was a knob on wall which had two settings heat and cold and an air vent in wall that a small bit of air came through. You cannot open window as there is a screen in front of original windows so air cannot circulate so room was very stuffy we spent most of time out of room. Hotel has an Indian restaurant as main restaurant didn’t eat there. Breakfast was 25 pound per day per person so ate out was cheaper. Hotel pool is not that heated quite cold. Hotel bar below nice setup nice waiters drinks were good but not a good selection. The bathroom hot water was an issue no hot water in shower second morning so advised concierge who said would tell receptionist but didn’t so as we were going home the next morning didn’t want the hassle of trying to sort this out mentioned it to receptionist’s on checkout. Not a 5 star hotel  there are better leonardo hotels out there so won’t be coming back to this one squeaky floors in rooms and very dark as well did not use executive lounge as no one told us how to access this and can see same from reception but never anyone up there. I know if hotel replies to this will say they are due to be refurbished but from the reviews this is being stated for over a year. Too expensive for what you get.,3,2024,02,16
117,Not 5 star - rooms need a facelift and more care,"We stayed here for 2 nights recently and we were so excited to stay after reading so many great reviews. The hotel is supposed to be 5 star but it definitely is not. In our superior room, there were broken fixtures, marks all over the walls, cobwebs, creaky floors etc. We have stayed in 5 star hotels all over, and we were expecting a higher level of attention to detail, and it just wasn't there. The bed was massive but the mattress was so uncomfortable, you could feel the springs through it. The lobby is beautiful and smells lovely but other parts are in need of restoration.
The location is the best part about this hotel, you are slap bang in the middle of London and everything is so accessible. Also when we were checking out and leaving our bags at reception, we were told that when we came to collect them, we could use the health club facilities in the hotel to shower and change if we needed before we went to the airport - I thought this was amazing, and not something you'd get in other hotels in London.
",3,2024,02,16
117,Best location for shopping and theatres,"Just a view steps away from Piccadilly Circus underground station (Piccadilly line leads you directly to Heathrow Airport Terminals 1 to 5) The Dilly is perfectly located for shopping sprees and many sights are within walking distance. The staff is extremely friendly and I would particularly like to thank Selim Atias, Senior Guest Relations Manager, and Malageae Elena, Guest Relations, for the efforts they put in to make my stay so much more enjoyable.",4,2024,02,14
117,Simply the best,"We have just arrived back from a wonderful stay at The Dilly, this was a one day/night trip to London for personal reasons . It was also Valentine's evening and I have to say a big thank you to the whole concierge team especially Chenlyn Constantino and Selim Atias. Our bedroom was beautifully decorated with balloons, rose petals, chocolate hearts, messages on the mirror and much much more. They definitely went above and beyond what we expected and it made our stay a memorable one . The hotel is lovely and clean, in a perfect spot for sightseeing, friendly and helpful staff, the swimming pool is great too.
What more can I say, than Thank you to everyone, we would definitely stay here again. 10 star recommended!",5,2024,02,14
117,I will be coming again,"All the staff were absolutely great nothing was too much trouble. My name is Dilly and the staff gave me pens with my name on and one of the guys came out with a little red bus which was the icing on the cake. The bed was super comfy, the pool was luscious and the golf simulator was a great touch as I get to have my golf fix. Thank you to everyone. Dilly",5,2024,02,13
117,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,We have to thank first and foremost Chenlyn Costantino from Guest Relations. From the moment she discovered that I was on  a trip to celebrate my daughter she took care of everything in such a dedicated and attentive manner! the reception and breakfast staff were also very kind and this resulted in a wonderful stay in the heart of London. We will surely be going back!,5,2024,02,08
117,Realy enjoyed a one of a kind hotel in the heart of London,"Amazing service, realy great breakfast on the most beautiful terrace in the city. The facilities at the hotel are AAA. We came for 4 nights and everything was amazing, the cleaning of the room, the food, the staff, the service and the facilities.",5,2024,02,08
117,Quick stop in London,"Really nicely situated hotel. The room was cozy albeit a little small. A little noisy in the morning too. 

Great breakfast in a beautiful hall. 
Loved the approach of Latika at the reception. So friendly and so efficient. 
Will definitely come back next time I’m in London.",5,2024,02,08
117,Can’t wait to stay - the contact I’ve had already is worth a massive mention!,"I went in at lunchtime to check that my reservation for Friday was in place and even though I haven’t stayed there yet, I met two delightful concierge, a très professional doorman and the loveliest and most helpful reception staff - they all could not have smiled and welcomed me any more outstandingly than they did. A special mention to Daniella who could not have been more efficient, knowledgable or friendly. Thank you Daniella! From just this one 15 minute visit I don’t think there is anywhere else I will EVER want to stay in London!",5,2024,02,07
117,Lovely hotel definitely more 4* but worth a stay!,"Lovely hotel clean & friendly on entrance. Smells wonderful
Locations brilliant & little extra touches made It nice service
Couple of points which I compare to other 5* hotels we have stayed in however wouldn't put me off booking again
1. The room service was high chargeable per trolly/delivery when enquiring seems to be a changing amount dependant on who we spoke to as we queried different meal options at different times 
2. Was told no breakfast in bed option, which was disappointing for a 5* relaxing break 
3. Rooms a little dated/not up to 5* standard 

Even with my negative points it's not enough to put us off we would definitely stay again at the offer price though wouldn't pay the full room rate",4,2024,02,07
117,Thank you,"We had an enjoyable vacation thanks to your kind service, I would like to thank Salim Attias from the bottom of my heart.
For the attitude, care and service.
Thank you so much for being available for us at any hour. You made our stay pleasant and good.",5,2024,02,06
117,Thank you Salim!,"I would like to recommend Salim, who from the first moment gave us a feeling of home and belonging and was available for any problem or claim we had.
Salim behaved with kindness and sensitivity to each of us and was available every hour and day.
Thanks Slim!",5,2024,02,05
117,Wonderful stay,"What a gem of a hotel.
Daniella checked us in and gave the most warm, friendly welcome. We had a free upgrade on our room which was a pleasant surprise.
The room itself was clean, spacious and had everything you could need.
We made use of the pool which was very welcomed after long days walking the city.
We ended our evenings in the cocktail bar, lovely calm ambience to unwind to.
We had breakfast here on one of our mornings, plenty of choice and good quality.
Would have liked to try Madris but unfortunately never had the opportunity within our schedule.
The location is perfect, so much  within walking distance and failing that, a tube stop 2 mins walk away.
This is a wonderful hotel and if I am ever back in London I would love to stay here again.",5,2024,02,05
117,Recommendation,"Perfect hotel, service and location but I want to thank to Selim Atias about his service. 
He helped us and was available for any questions! 
We had a very good and pleasant experience thanks to him
Thank you very much for your service for sure we will be back!",5,2024,02,05
117,A great experience,"The location is great. The hotel is great. But the most amazing feature is Mr. Salim Atias the guest relations manager. Wow, what a person, what a service, what an exceptional man who made it look as if we are the most important guests ever to have been in he Dilly. 
I sure will always stay in the Dilly or whichever hotel he works in.
Thank you Salim.",5,2024,02,05
117,Absolutely amazing exoerience,"Since the moment my family and I checked into our executive suite we were treated like royalty. We brought our 10 year old daughter for her birthday and we had an amazing time. I had stayed her once before on a business trip and I thought she would love it. It is an exquisite hotel and we stayed in a fabulous suite. Henry and Milan on the front desk really made our stay magical. The teddy and the model black cab the gave Hannah made her stay. We were lucky to have access to the private lounge too were refreshments were complimentary. I would rate this as one of the best stays I have had in any hotel, and I will definitely stay here from now on when I come to London.",5,2024,02,04
117,Not the best,"The good points are the fab location, comfy beds, and a great breakfast....However, the bar service was diabolical! The staff in the bar were rude and very ignorant!  For this reason we would not return, and definitely would not recommend this to family and friends",3,2024,02,04
117,Can’t wait to return!,"What an amazing hotel.
From the moment you enter it’s just perfection. 
We were lucky enough to given an early check in and given our welcome hamper. 
The room was beautiful, a huge bed and very clean.
The location is superb, everything was walkable and we took full advantage of exploring. 
We also used the facilities, the gym, golf course experience and swimming pool aswel as ending our evenings in the piano bar. We also had breakfast on one of the mornings in the hotel conservatory, there was plenty of choice and very relaxing with all the light and spacey feel to the room. 
We can’t wait to come back already.",5,2024,02,04
117,The dilly hotel,"I would like to thank the hotel staff who helped us in every way from the moment we entered the hotel. Hotel manager Selim Atias takes care of every customer at the hotel one by one. She helps us in every way. Our hotel room was very large and comfortable. We especially loved the breakfast. The location is within walking distance to everywhere, the metro stop is 2 minutes walking distance.",5,2024,02,02
117,Great experience,"We were very pleased with the hotel, its location and cleanliness were perfect, the hotel manager Mr Selim and all the staff were very helpful in everything, thank you for everything.

The hotel manager Selim Atias is incredibly attentive and helps us in every way. He made us feel like we were at home. In short, we can say it was a wonderful stay.",5,2024,02,02
117,A special thanks to Abdul.,"Fabulous building located conveniently to the West End theatres.
The foyer feels dark but at the same time comfortable and welcoming. We stayed in a suite which was very comfortable with a decent view of street below.
We ate out at one of the hundreds of local restaurants so I can only comment on the breakfast which was okay.
The thing that set the Dilly apart from other hotels was the staff, especially Abdul Hameed who did everything to make our stay that little bit special.
We will definitely stay at the Dilly during our next trip to the city.",4,2024,02,02
117,Great guest relations!,"Selim, the senior guest relations manager is making the difference at the Dilly. His personal touch is noticed everywhere. The location in Piccadilly circus is simply perfect. Walking distance to anywhere. Loved it. Great hotel and gray staff.",5,2024,02,01
117,Amazing hotel with best service,"Great hotel, very nice big rooms, great breakfast, best location and facilities but much more important, we came for business and Selim Atias, amazing guest relations manager helped and support us in everything needed. Will come again for sure! Thank you the Dilly and thank you Selim!!",5,2024,02,01
117,Impeccable service and beautiful hotel,"I’ve stayed at the Dilly hotel for a number of days during the month of January 2024. Upon arrival at check-in I was greeted with an infectious and very warm smile from a blond lady whose name is Sophie . The check-in was seamless quick and easy.

I was informed of the hotel facilities including the beautiful swimming pool, as well as the the gym opening hours (open 24 hours). 

I was pleasantly surprised by the spacious room, which is arguably in one of the best areas in London . The television is large, and now there are ample facilities including espresso pods. I thought for a privilege to be in such an institution of a hotel. During my stay, I frequently use the swimming pool which was nearly always empty which was a plus . There is a delicious Indian restaurant at the hotel called Maddhus that Henry ( another friendly face at reception) had recommended and actually went out of his way to show me the beautiful oak room. I’ve got to know a couple of the staff members as I was staying for a few days and Heather was super kind and chatty and frequently asked how my day was which was really nice. 

The service at the Dilly is absolutely impeccable and puts all the all large shiny stars in this five star hotel . 

Having breakfast in the Terrace restaurant was an absolute pleasure because it is beautifully designed with so much natural light with views over Piccadilly.

Travelling often I am in many different hotels, but the Dilly definitely stands out for its wonderful service. Amazing location and great amenities.  

Recommended to the fullest extent.",5,2024,01,31
117,GREAT STAY AT THE DILLY NEAR THE PICCADILLY!,"EXCELLENT 5 STAR HOTEL IN THE HEART OF LONDON! 
VERY CLEAN AND COMFORT ROOMS!
GREAT PEOPLE DID EVERYTHING TO SERVE US!
THE SWIMMING POOL WAS VERY NICE!
WE EVEN PLAYED SQUASH!
WE HAD AN EXCEPTIONAL BREAKFAST AT TERRACE!
THE BEST VALUE FOR MONEY HOTEL IN LONDON!",5,2024,01,30
117,Warm and welcoming staff ever…,"The hotel staff are the most welcoming, they smile, they are friendly and very engaging. We went to celebrate my daughter’s birthday, she was suffering a broken heart from a relationship break up. The hotel went over and beyond to help her heart heal. They looked after us beautifully. Big thank you to everyone. 🙏🏼🌟",5,2024,01,30
117,Tip your hat to The Dilly,"This lovely hotel is full of character, and delightful characters! The rooms are very generous, the amenities are all there and the people are very keen to please. There are just enough modern features to ensure you can charge your phone, keep your drink cold or make yourself a coffee, but these do not detract from the ageless charm of the sweeping staircases, intricate ceilings and authentic furnishings. The pool area has a Middle-eastern opulence about it, and how many other hotels have squash courts and a golf simulator? 
The doormen and reception staff were first class and highly knowledgeable, though you do not need a guide to stumble across Piccadilly Circus, The Ritz, Hatchards, Fortnum and Mason or Pall Mall, all only a few hundred metres away. 
Breakfast was very nice, and the piano bar was vibrant, had an extensive wine list and produced lovely cocktails. Some rooms have access via unavoidable stairs, but the value for money is excellent.",5,2024,01,29
117,We just loved The Dilly,"The Dilly is an extremely beautiful hotel full of classic english color. Our room was huge the beds super comfortable with warm duvets.
The stuff at the hotel is lovely, very polite and eager to help. We had delicious drinks at the bar of the restaurant which is stunning. 
The rooms are well equipped and very clean with all the amenities even soft and comfy bath robes. 
We loved that they have espresso and tea in our room so we could enjoy a cup after our long walks during the day. 
The Dilly is also so perfectly situated that makes it ideal. Everything is a short walking distance.
While on Picadilly it is super quiet. We will definitely come back.",5,2024,01,29
117,10/10 FANTASTIC,"10/10 fantastic from start to finish .Even before we checked in,we had great communication from Carolina F ,guests relations about our stay for a special occasion and she went above and beyond for us and did not disappoint.The Dilly Hotel is beautifully decorated and all the staff we came across was welcoming and happy to help with any enquiries.Our room was upgraded and we couldn’t have been more happier especially with the extra touches what had been made for a birthday celebration and wonderfully decorated.The room itself was spacious.The bathroom was a lovely size with toiletries.Mini fridge also in the room whats great to keep a few things chilled .Bathrobes and slippers ,coffee/machine etc.The breakfast was fantastic with everything you could need .its buffet service and there was the items for cooked  breakfast ,continental,lots of fruits,pastries,salmon,yogurts and  much more.I would recommend paying for the breakfast .We didn’t eat in the evening as we had already made reservations else where but we did have drinks in the Indian restaurant what was very popular.There was also the lounge/bar on the lower ground with piano what we will definitely try next time .The Dilly is in a fantastic location and we used the Green park tube station which was only a short walk away.We had a speedy check in and  checkout with no problems and again all the staff very helpful  .i will definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends and we will definitely be looking forward to more stays at this wonderful hotel.",5,2024,01,28

Beds really comfortable, room exceptionally clean and staff were just fantastic.

Thankyou for making it a really lovely special weekend ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,2024,01,28
117,"Perfect location, facilities and hospitality","I had stayed several times in the past when it was Le Meridien Piccadilly. Now it is The Dilly and the experience is equally wonderful like in the past. The location is perfect. The lounge on mezzanine floor is very nice, as always. The staff always professional and helpful. Many thanks to a superb staff at checking-in, Chen. She was very kind and I appreciate the very kind courtesy extended to me during my stay at the hotel. All staff are great, and checking out was also very smooth, thanks to Hussain. I highly recommend this hotel, and I hope to stay there again this Spring.",5,2024,01,27
117,Superb,"It was a wonderful stay. We were greeted warmly during our swift check in.  The staff were all smiles and helpful.

We will definitely be returning to explore more of this beautiful hotel 🤩🥂🍾",5,2024,01,26

117,Amazing,"I'm just back from a 2 night stay at the Dilly... I took my mam and my daughter for both their birthdays and we had such an amazing stay.

Staff were so helpful and so friendly they went above and beyond. Breakfast was unbelievable and the room was hugeeeee 

Will definitely be booking again in June for my own birthday 

Thanks again for a lovely stay",5,2024,01,26
117,A great stay.,"It was a great experience. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, especially Mr. Salim Sammy. He made my stay extra comfortable and efficient. All the hotel facilities were great, from my room to breakfast. Thank you again to everybody, I will definitely keep coming back.",5,2024,01,26
117,A hidden gem in place sight,"Working our way around the hotel afternoon teas of London and done all the obvious ones, we visited The Terrace at The Dilly this afternoon and were not disappointed. I’ve never noticed this hotel before and although it was very quiet at 4pm on a Tuesday it was a really lovely experience. The background music was not overpowering and the staff very pleasant and attentive. The cakes had a novel London theme and were extremely tasty, the sandwiches excellent with the right amount of filling and the scones perfect. For me, the star of the show was the Earl Grey tea, one of the best if not the best I’ve ever had. The teapots were a little small, however the tea was replenished and the second pot as good as the first. The cute London scene cup and saucers were a talking point so it was a bit of a shame the plates didn’t match. But that’s just a really small niggle on my part. The cost was very reasonable compared to other hotel offerings, almost half price. So if you are looking for an affordable good quality afternoon tea in nice surroundings, you can’t go wrong with The Dilly’s  London Afternoon Tea.",4,2024,01,25
117,The Perfect Location in London!,"My husband and I stayed at the Dilly in November 2022 as part of my 40th Birthday celebrations. The first thing you need to know about The Dilly is the amazing location. Right on Piccadilly it's near to just about everything. The tube is a few meters from the hotel so you can hop on at will - as easy as pie. It's near to amazing shops on Oxford Street and right by the theatre where we saw The Moulin Rouge (which was sensational). The Dilly is extremely comfortable and has amazing toiletries for your use. The beds and cushions were comfy and we had a great view of the London Eye from our room. The breakfasts were also more than satisfactory. We received great attention from the concierge and staff behind the welcome desk. A truly fabulous stay.  When visiting London again, I will most definitely be staying at The Dilly. That should speak volumes.",5,2024,01,25
117,For work,"İt was so nice hotel, the hotel locariin was very east that walk every where by the walk.the hotel is very clean and smell nice. Our room is so clean and i can able to look to the street The breakfast was so delicious. i love all staff. All was kind and polite ",5,2024,01,25
117,No heating until 5m due to hotel policy!!,I checked in at 3pm to do some work in my tired room which was freezing. I left my coat on and put the heating on. At 445pm I tried to call reception as the room was so Cold but the room phone didn’t work. I called off my mobile to reception but was stunned to find that the whole hotel heating doesn’t come on until 5pm due to hotel policy. It takes ages to warm up and then is switched off at 10pm everyday. It’s not mentioned on their website. They offered me another freezing room  as an alternative and wouldn’t give me HQs complaint email address so I then checked out and went to another hotel. Shocking to be treated like this at such expense when every room has its own heating control. The staff hid behind the policy. Avoid there are so many better hotels.,1,2024,01,24
117,Amazing stay!,"I had a lovely stay at the hotel, all the staff were amazing, especially Chen at Reception who was so helpful and really made check in special!! 
The whole stay was great and the location was perfect. Breakfast was great and service there was brilliant too!",5,2024,01,24
117,The best adress in London,"Second stay at Dilly (preceding it last April) We are accompanied by our son and his fiancée. The welcome is always warm and we are treated like VIPs: upgrade for the 2 rooms and a welcome gift. Our rooms were superb and very large. Only detail, ours (519 from memory) is located in the corner of the building and I think, difficult to heat. So it was a little cool there. That being said, it was particularly cold in London in mid-January. The room occupied by our son and his fiancée (on the same floor) was very pleasant and warm. We stayed 2 nights so we didn't want to ask to change and yet I know that this would not have posed any problem as the staff at the Dilly are always on top and attentive with their guests. The breakfast buffet is really excellent, varied and here too the staff is very present, available and pleasant. We took advantage of our stay to dine at Madhu's...magnificent room! Fabulous cocktails and perfect Indian cuisine. A wonderful evening for this family dinner. As I wrote in my previous comment, the Dilly is now our address in London and we can't wait to come back!",5,2024,01,24
117,Brilliant!!,"I usually don’t do reviews but I have to say that the hotel is very central and convenient to be honest. I had many requests when I checked in and they were spontaneous. However, hats off to Clanda at reception who really accommodated my  itch and was very transparent when it came to how everything works. The golf sim was interesting and fun to play with a friend of mine :) A nice stay indeed",3,2024,01,23
117,Weekend in London,"From the moment we walked through the door until we left we were given excellent customer service. Stayed in room 512 which was clean and comfortable although a little dated. The bed was very comfortable. Excellent location on Piccadilly. Easy walking distance everywhere.
We were given excellent customer service from Nancy whom we met at reception. We will definitely be staying again.",5,2024,01,23
117,Great staff.,"Just back from a lovely stay at the Dilly. José on reception made us feel very welcome, check in was friendly,  quick and efficient. The room was warm, cosy and very clean. I can highly recommend the breakfast, the choice was amazing.
Only wish we’d had more than one night! Will definitely stay again.",5,2024,01,23
117,Wonderfull Hotel,"It is very nice hotel. Location is perfect, service is excellent and Mr. Selim is very nice man. His hand always on his guests, whenever you need assistance he is right besides you to help. Oh also breakfast place and buffet are fantastic. Next time will not look any other place, The Dilly is my only address from now on.",5,2024,01,23
117,Exceptional Experience,"I had to book this hotel ten minutes before I left on my London trip as the hotel I'd booked in September had unilaterally changed my twin room to a double, which was no use to me.  The original hotel were indifferent to my phone call to rectify the situation and hung up on me.  This left me with no option but to book another hotel last minute.  I booked three nights at The Dilly and I'm so glad I did.  The staff are all exceptional, the rooms are beautiful and the beds are so comfy.  We had breakfast each day, there was an extraordinary selection of hot and cold options.   The lady at reception (sorry I didn't get her name) was a stand out for us, she was so kind and patient - she is a real asset to this hotel.  I can safely say I will be staying here again.",5,2024,01,22
117,Central London hotel offering quality accommodation close to all major theatres.,"Just returned from an excellent 2 night stay at the Dilly. Great position close to all West End theatres and bus stops. Staff were super friendly and helpful. Breakfast was very varied from fresh salmon to fresh omelettes cooked whilst you watch. Evening meal is now in an  Indian restaurant attached to the hotel called Madhu’s. We ate there and it was one of the best curries we had eaten. Plus fresh coconut drink direct from the coconut. 
Room was clean and warm and our reception was perfect. Allowed us to check in early too. Overall a faultless visit to a very well run hotel. Management should be very proud and deserve a mention on superb leadership.",5,2024,01,20
117,Great location and facilities,"Perfect location and great facilities. Heather was particularly helpful during checkout in providing a space for me to work during my stay. Thanks Heather!
The pool is fantastic and the gym is well equipped for a hotel facility. Wish I had a longer staff than one night to make the most of it. The late checkout was also very helpful",5,2024,01,20
117,Brilliant hotel and staff,"What a fantastic hotel and members of staff
One particular member of staff from Housekeeping whose name is Linda was fabulous
She heard my mum coughing walking into the bar and came to see if she was ok and if she needed anything
All bar staff were brilliant as well
Room was super clean and very luxurious and Breakfast on the Terrace was amazing with so much choice 
Would stay again",5,2024,01,16
117,AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ATTEMTION TO DETAIL.,We booked the Dilly for our sons 30th birthday . I contacted Guest Relations with some questions and minor requests which were immediately replied too. Selim the Head of Guest relations then upgraded our rooms and also offered free breakfast for all 4 of us . When we arrived they had also dressed the room with balloons and petals on the beds. A bottle of wine and selection of desserts were also left in the room for us . We felt like royalty and every single member of the staff were very attentive and obviously well trained and they were also plentiful in number also. Even when we left the concierge team stood outside for 10 mins to get us a taxi. Now this sort of attention to detail you rarely see in a reasonably priced Hotel in London unless you are paying top dollar. Hats off to the Dilly team and would recommened to all .,5,2024,01,15
117,Simply exceptional,"Simply perfection. 

I booked this hotel for my partners birthday. We were seeing a show in London and decided to stay overnight. From entering the hotel, the staff were welcoming and made us feel comfortable. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful! 

We stayed on the 8th floor in a beautiful double room. Guest relations went the extra mile to add special additions to the room including balloons, a personalised mirror message, rose petals and a bottle of Prosecco. We can’t thank you enough for this kind gesture!!! Not many hotels provide such service. 

The concierge service were excellent, taking in our luggage before check in and after we had checked out so that we could explore hands free.

Highly highly recommend this hotel and will most definitely be staying again",5,2024,01,15
117,Perfect loaction in the heart of London,"The breakfast, the location, the friendly personnel, meeting room and the gym was perfect. The room temperature was maybe a little to warm.

Have no problem in recommending the Hotel. The location is perfect for a weekend in London. Short distances to what you need in London.",5,2024,01,14
117,5⭐️ Receptionist Heather,"Our first time visiting London and I was so glad hubby picked The Dilly.  I’m a wheelchair user so I was a little irked that the door staff didn’t help my husband to open the door. Any who we were greeted by a lovely welcoming receptionist called Heather. Because of the chair people talk to my husband and completely forget about me, she didn’t. She came from around the desk so she could talk to us both. The room we were allocated was beautiful, and according to our daughter it was “big”. You had to go down some steps to get to the room so it wasn’t ideal. We spoke to Heather and on the second night we were upgraded to a room that gave me the independence to get about on my own. 
We had breakfast on both mornings and the food was hot and delicious. All in all our stay at The Dolly was fantastic and we will definitely be back",5,2024,01,13
117,The best and recommended hotel in London,"An exceptional experience, the best location in London, excellent room, cleanliness, facilities.

117,Perfect location,"Perfect location for shopping in Oxford street. 
We were upgraded on arrival which was a lovely surprise ! Plus we had a free  bottle of wine, cakes and a teddy in our room. Really nice touches which make a break special. 
The room was really nice and we loved the decor of London maps as wallpaper. 
The hotel was busy but we didn’t hear any noise from other guests. 
Our room was at the front of the hotel so you could hear the traffic through the night (if you’re a light sleep!) 
The hotel seems very modern and its location was perfect for us for shopping and eating out. 
The bar was good, busy and lively and nice cocktails. 
Overall very enjoyable and would recommend.",5,2024,01,13
117,Relax and tasty stay,"Lovely hotel perfectly positioned. We had a lovely, genuinely friendly welcome. A nice toom with a huge bed, and a swim and sauna before the most amazing pre-theatre indian meal in the restaurant.  Each dish was really tasty and such a lovely idea to try several smaller dishes. The prawns, salmon and lamb chops particularly tasty.",4,2024,01,12
117,Fabulous Hotel in the heart of London,I took my Aunt there for her 80th birthday and we weren't disappointed.  The receptionist was lovely on arrival and we appreciated the complimentary wine and chocolates.  The room was large and very comfortable and surprisingly quite considering the location.  We took advantage of the gorgeous basement pool and steam room and found the location excellent.,5,2024,01,12
117,Overnight stay,"A beautiful welcoming hotel in the heart of London! It has stunning decor from the beautiful moulded ceilings to the stained glass domed windows. 
The rooms are excellent we stayed in a junior suite which comprised of a sitting room with WC and a separate bedroom with on suite bathroom. Free bottled water, tea and coffee making facilities in the room. Rooms are clean and well stocked with towels, ironing board and iron, toiletries ( not toothpaste) TV and hairdryer. 
Breakfast was in the terrace room on the second floor. Stunning glass ceiling with views. Breakfast was self service from full English to continental with cereals and fruit. Excellent staff across the board.",5,2024,01,10
117,Customer Service was the cherry on top! ,"My husband booked this hotel as a surprise for my 30th birthday and it did not disappoint!

117,Amazing experience at the Dilly Hotel ,"It was a great experience! We had a lovely time in the hotel. The location is the best you can get in London. The location provided a fast access to some of London’s most known attractions and fun locations such as cinemas, restaurants, etc. The hotel is extremely beautiful and the service was superb! Mr Selim Atias provided us with an amazing experience along with the rest of the staff. The amenities such as the pool and gym were also very useful. Overall our family had an unforgettable stay at this amazing hotel. ",5,2024,01,07
117,Great Hotel. Perfect Location,"The Dilly is a perfect choice for exploring London. Very helpful and friendly staff. Reception, Concierge and Housekeeping all went out of their way to assist and make us feel very welcome. Our room was immaculate and very spacious. I wouldn't hesitate wo book again. ",5,2024,01,05
117,Absolutely brilliant stay!,"Without hesitation our stay was 5 stars! The hotel itself is beautiful, both inside and out. I read some reviews complaining about the rooms. We loved ours, the character, colors, decor, and bathroom were wonderful. The bed was extremely comfy for our week stay! The buffet breakfast in the Terrace was perfect. The gym is an actual gym with top of the line equipment. The pool is amazing. As you can see, we loved The Dilly. It also happens to have the best location in all of London. If we come back to London we are staying here again without hesitation!!",5,2024,01,04
117,Most disappointing hotel experience ,"I rarely write reviews, but the unwelcoming and unpleasant staff have driven me to do so, the concierge was very unhelpful constantly asking me to google it, leading me to ask why he’s there anyway?? Beyond the truly annoying staff, the hotel is old and wasn’t cleaned well and many necessities weren’t available in the room, such as shampoo and conditioner. Extending on the staff situation, they couldn’t find my room upon checking in and put NO EFFORT in helping me navigate my issues, they made us very uncomfortable in asking the most simple questions. The elevator doesn’t work and the ones that do work the elevator might randomly stop and the buttons in the elevator don’t evens work!!! Besides its great location, please avoid this hotel!!",2,2024,01,01
117,Long Live Lord Henry,"Richard, fondly known as ""Lord Henry,"" truly stands out as the crown jewel of The Dilly. His exceptional skills and ability to work wonders are nothing short of miraculous, and he accomplishes it all with an infectious smile that lights up the entire property. Richard's unwavering dedication and proficiency make him an invaluable asset to The Dilly, ensuring that every guest is under the watchful and caring gaze of a true hospitality maestro. Staying anywhere under his guidance is not just an option but a guarantee of an elevated and memorable experience.",5,2023,12,31
117,Amazing Hotel,"A Truly wonderful hotel. We strongly recommend you stay at this hotel if you are visiting London.  Placed right in the very heart of  London, excellently located with the benefit of close proximity to most of London's local attractions whilst boasting luxury en-suite rooms which were impeccably clean with superb breathtaking views overlooking Piccadilly Circus. The customer service was second to none with a very professional service making us feel most welcomed and catered for. The breakfast was delicious with lots of options to choose from and the swimming pool was wonderful. A Truly brilliant hotel with so much to offer they made our Christmas break for my family very special and it was a wonderful experience. We will definitely be returning next year. Thank you to all the great staff at the Dilly hotel.",5,2023,12,30
117,We booked for a shopping trip in the city from the minute we arrived to when we left the service was amazing,We arrived to a warm welcome from Abdul waheed on the front desk and from start to finish our experience was great with great staff and service highly recommend the onsite restaurant is amazing and our room was very nice clean and comfortable,5,2023,12,27
117,Disappointed ,"Don’t let the grandeur of this historic building fool you. Whilst it may be a 5 star hotel. It’s as though the entire staff have been plucked from a budget hotel and placed in The Dilly.  

The entrance is enticing and well presented but it stops there. Moving into the bar area, there lots of distractions in the decor however the bar stools are tired, rickety and falling apart, it took me 20 mins to be served at the empty bar to be told “the bartender is not in, we can only open bottles” 

The breakfast wasn’t included in my rate, so I forked out the £25 per person for what was a very disappointing breakfast. Complete buffet with poor quality of food, pastries weren’t fresh, the ‘hot’ food was cold. There was no menu to order a plate of food, just the mass buffet. Not what I expected of a hotel like this.

The room was spacious but tired, clean but a shoddy painted finish. TV was very basic, kettle on the floor. Lack of sockets supplemented with extension leads.  We were in an upper floor where the bathroom window couldn’t be locked shut and was accessible from the rooftop which was a concern. 

Annoyed that housekeeping were knocking on the door at 08:30 wanting to know what time I was checking out. Again not what I was expecting whilst having a lay in after a late night.

I did enjoy use of the pool in the morning. Really large pool which was nice, however the changing rooms were tired with limited facilities. The railings / handles round the pool were rusted and loose. 

I did get my room pre-booked at attractive rate which made the dissatisfaction slightly more palatable. I would’ve been very upset to pay full price for my experience. 

In summary, it’s a nice hotel in a great location.  However don’t be deceived by the 5 stars. If you’re used to other 5 star hotels in this area I feel you will be let down by staying here.

117,Nice hotel with a brilliant service,"We booked the Dilly for our Xmas festive  directly with your reservations team. 

The day before our arrival , I called the hotel and as per our conversation the hotel agreed to provide us a fruit bowl which was very important for my son, however after our arrival we received some amenities but not the fruit platter as we agreed. After speaking to Carolina from guest relations she brought us a lovely fruit bowl in 10minutes. 

We loved the upgraded room and the service especially from Carolina. We enjoyed our our Christmas getaway in the city centre and had a lovely time. 

We will definitely be returning!",5,2023,12,17
117,"Overpriced,  disappointing ","Our executive room had no view and was very blandly decorated, no character.  
The bed was squeaky and shabby. 
We couldn't have a coffee in the ground floor restaurant at 11am . 
The room had no Floris toiletries as advised on the website. 
At this price one should feel comfortable and satisfied.  
We will definitely not come back.

117,My favourite hotel in London - by far the best one around!,"Really.. the Dilly Hotel is something very special! I have been staying there 9 times in a row and I come to London frequently for business trips.

The service is amazing! I have to give a special mention to Selim Atias who is managing the relationship of the hotel and much more - he is amazing!

The rooms - very clean, modern, really spacious, it feels like home abroad.
The indoor pool -  I go to there every morning, such an amazing pool with a sauna and hot showers.
You won't find a better breakfast anywhere else in the UK.
The hotel in general - very luxurious, located in the best location that London has to offer.

There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best hotel you will choose, and it is definitely  my favorite!",5,2023,12,17
117,Thank you The Dilly Hotel!,"We had a unique experience at Dilly Hotel! Traveling as a couple for a romantic trip, the staff had an incredible welcome, very personalized!

117,Lovely Stay,"Amazing hotel in central London.  2 minutes walk from Piccadilly Circus station.  Easy access to everything and everywhere in London.

117,Highly Recommend ,"Absolutely love The Dilly, stayed here several times and it never disappoints, the moment you walk through the door George, Mark and Christian make you feel so welcome, very attentive and will do everything they possibly can to make your stay enjoyable, however they are let down by their housekeeping team who need to have more attention to detail, we didn’t have a clean glass or cup the whole weekend and had to ask few times for things that should have been replenished in the room and  clearly under the bed is a forgotten area.

Still without doubt fabulous  hotel, best location,  great  breakfasts and nice bar for late night drink, definitely highly recommend and will be returning very soon.

Prior to our arrival we received a lovely message from the manager Selim Atias asking for our purpose of visit which was a great touch. Upon our arrival we were very impressed that our room was upgraded into Executive room and it was beautifully decorated with rose petals and helium balloons which made our special occasion unforgettable.

117,Amazing experience 50th birthday celebration.,What an amazing hotel. From the moment we arrived everyone was so welcoming and pleasant. The reception looked amazing and Christmassy. Our room overlooked the lights on Regent street and amazingly they decorated it beautifully! Took my friend here for her 50th birthday and they really made her feel special. On entering our room we were met with a bottle of sparkly and a cake. Was certainly special and I definitely will be coming back. Amazing experience.,5,2023,12,09
117,Disappointing experience ,"Such a stunning building in an extremely central position. The beauty however, stopped there. The service and warmth expected, was clearly lacking. Far too many ‘computer said no’ moments. We asked for something simple and quick to eat in the lobby area which is now a rather lovely Indian restaurant. The only suggestion made was that we could order room service. Seeing as we were going to the theatre then we had no time for this, even though we were residing there overnight. This felt wrong, awkward and disjointed. When we returned from the theatre, we popped downstairs for a night cap. Here we were met with what felt like a team of people waiting to go home. It was soulless, unwelcoming and lacked style. We asked for crisps to accompany our drinks …… interestingly the computer said no again. Horrid flies flying around us too. Having said all of this, the room was quite nice but that’s as far as I’d take it. Such a shame. Something needs to change",2,2023,12,08
117,Xmas night away,"I would rate our experience a 4 rating for location, friendliness and breakfast great.  On arrival we were given a free upgrade, plus a free bottle of wine, chocolate snd nibbles. A lively gesture as we have never dodged before. 

The only slight downside was the room was slightly dated. The rest of hotel was lovely and food area really lovely .",4,2023,12,03

The location was excellent right in the heart of Piccadilly Circus and regent street which was very convenient for late night strolls to enjoy the Christmas lights! The rooms were clean and spacious and breakfast was amazing, definitely recommend and I will be back! ",5,2023,12,01
117,Outstanding service from the doorman daily! ,"What an amazing stay at The Dilly. We utilized this hotel for the second part of our London trip after making our way to Brussels. Upon check in at 3, our room was not ready, we had another hour to wait. We were immediately given lounge access to relax while we waited for the room to be complete. The Christmas décor and atmosphere is very desirable. 
The room is very spacious compared to the other junior suites we stayed in, in other parts of London. Room service I would say is mediocre in timing.
The hotel itself is in a prime location for walking to Regent and Bond street.
The best part about the Dilly was the our interactions with the doorman. What a warm, welcoming and helpful person he was. He gave us tips, walking directions and history lessons prior to seeing the sights, my 9 year loved hearing about the city before we were off on our way.   I would certainly return because of his hospitality, what a gem of an employee to have. 

Overall The Dilly is a great place to rest your head in the city of London. ",5,2023,11,30
117,Please change the music!,"Breakfast was excellent, including the staff but......downhill from there. Food options were limitied. The terrace restaurant was great for breakfast but closed at 4.0pm. (Afternoon tea needed to be booked in advance as far as I could tell) Evening dining in the hotel was therefore limited. In fact the choice was room service or an Indian Restaurant. The food was really good if you like Indian, however the hotel had a swing/jazz version of Christmas carols (plus Auld Lang Syne thrown in for good measure) on a 12 minute loop...loudly! By the time you've finished your meal, you do get very tired of the 12 days of Christmas! 
The lifts were a bit erratic. One lift sulked and didn't like recognising the hotel room cards. Air conditioning didn't work and windows in some rooms were screwed almost shut. (We changed room after the first night as we were 7 floors above the loading bay and hour after hour of hotel goods going in and out exhausted us) If you could open the windows for cool air, you then had the barrage of noise from Piccadilly Circus. 
The pool was good and so was the steam room and gym.
Bear in mind that you're on the edge of theatre land so find a restaurant and book in advance.
Overall not  a 5 star hotel or even close in my opinion. Location is hard to beat though for the theatres.",3,2023,11,27
117,Fantastic experience well worth it! ,"Great location, exceptional staff, they went out of their way to make our stay special.

117,Disappointing,"I had wanted to stay at the Dilly for some time and unfortunately it didn't live up to expectations. The two things I hoped to get from my stay were a good nights sleep, which I didn't get, and a nice breakfast, which I did get.

When I first arrived in my room (room 114) I noticed how uncomfortably hot it was, the air conditioning wasn't switched on so I hoped that might help resolve the problem before I went to sleep but the first thing I did was open the window to get some fresh air in. This cooled the room slightly but not as much as I was hoping. I then put the air conditioning on before heading out for the evening. When I returned the room was still unbearably hot so I went down to reception. The gentleman behind the desk was very nice, however, he said there wasn't another room they could move me to but he could send up a portable air conditioning unit. He also advised that at this time of year the air conditioner in the room only blows out hot air so switching it on would actually make the room hotter!! The portable unit was brought up very quickly and whilst it did provide some cold air it did nothing to cool the room itself and was very noisy so I didn't have a particularly pleasant night.

Another couple of issues I experienced were that the hot tap in the bathroom wasn't fitted properly or has become loose and when I went to use the toilet it seemed that someone had got there before me (I was staying alone in the room!) the water was yellow, clearly someone had used it and not flushed. I am very disappointed that this must have been missed by housekeeping. I would expect better from a 5 star hotel.

On a more positive note, all the staff I spoke with during my stay were really lovely, particularly the breakfast staff. The breakfast itself was delicious with loads of choice and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The location of the hotel is also excellent.

As a lot of people seem to be having issues with the temperature of the rooms (judging by the recent reviews) I think this really needs to be addressed. From my perspective it would have been helpful to have a note which advised that the air conditioner would only produce hot air so I could have kept it switched off and just left the window open instead while I was out. I think this would have resulted in me having a more comfortable night.

117,Cute Sweets ,"Afternoon Tea at The Dilly Hotel was OK. The staff were very pleasant, the tea and the sweets were ok but the savories were more dry bread than anything else. At the price point I expected a little better food but the service and atmosphere were nice. Aside from the mediocre sandwiches it was warm in the restaurant and absolutely boiling in the restrooms.",3,2023,11,20

Blinds were broken in my room. I asked for these to be fixed before I went to bed. They were semi fixed. When I returned to my room in early hours they were still broken. I asked the night staff to fix. They had to come up twice with gaffer tape. I wasn't best pleased having to ask 2 hotel staff in my room in the early hours.  Again the blinds broke in the night.  This was an internal room looking out into the Breakfast area. The broken blinds let all the light in from the breakfast area and afforded little privacy in my room.

Why the windows did not have curtains when opening up to a public area I do not know.

I did not expect this from a £250 room.",2,2023,11,20
117,Uncomfortably hot room!! ,"The room that we stayed in was insanely hot. We were unable to open the window in our room (sealed shut) and there was no option to reduce the heating. It was really unpleasant and the worst nights sleep I’ve had in ages. Considering the price point this was really disappointing. When we spoke to the concierge they did not offer any solutions to help us. I felt like we slept inside a sauna and if you turn on the air-con, ironically it further increases the heat of the rooms as it blows hot air into the room. A complete nightmare ",2,2023,11,20
117,Overpriced and boiling hot rooms,"Rooms did not have air conditioning that was working and the heating was turned on for Winter. This meant the rooms were unbearably hot and not even an open window could remedy this. As well as this, my partner and I tried to arrange an early check in due to attending a wedding at the hotel. We were told several different things and were never given the early check in causing a lot of stress. 
For the money paid for one night, I expected so much more. I cannot recommend The Dilly at all, I’m afraid. Massively overpriced and had better service at chain hotels.",2,2023,11,19
117,Wonderful Hotel in Piccadilly,"From the moment we arrived until the morning we departed, we received amazing service and true  enjoyment at The Dilly,

We have been going to this hotel for over 20 years, and this was our best experience ever. Much has been done recently to improve both operations and the facilities. 

George Cosgrove is the Head Concierge, and his service, friendliness, and helpfulness was absolutely tops. 

He introduced us to the General Manager (Daniel Loosely) who was also extremely warm and welcoming. It’s obvious that this new GM takes his job very seriously. You can see it everywhere you look. 

Every time we saw George in the lobby, he was constantly introducing us to his team including his assistant Concierge, Cristian, the front office manager, Sophie, the  VIP Manager, Selim, the reception leader Katrina, the doorman, Paul, and many others. It was hard to keep up with the number of great team members we met. Selim was constantly surprising us with treats. 

Our room was lovely, the breakfast was overwhelming, and our every need was handled. 

The Gym has been completely upgraded, and the manager, Genc was also very welcoming and helpful. The pool was clean and warm. 

We could go on and on, but you get the message. If you want a truly wonderful experience in a great hotel with impeccable service, go to the Dilly and meet George and his team. You won’t regret it!!

We will return again next year for another amazing time in London at this hotel.

117,Exceptional hard to beat,"Hello to all the staff at this wonderful hotel,

 

I will fill in the online review form, but I absolutely had to write to say a massive thank you following our one-night stay on Friday 10th of November for my husband’s 49th birthday.

 

We traveled from Guernsey and were really looking forward to some time alone as have an 8 year old at home so this was to be a really super treat.

 

However, what would have been a great weekend was made absolutely exceptional by our stay at your hotel.

 

Firstly, on arrival the location was exactly as expected and the greeting from the doorman to check in was warm and welcoming. I had made a note when I booked back in August that the trip was to celebrate my Husband’s birthday, but did not expect the hotel to acknowledge the occasion in such a special way. At check in the lady wished my husband a happy birthday and presented us with a bag. A lovely bottle of Chilean red and some snacks. We both thought that this was a lovely and unexpected touch.

 

Our room was ready before 3pm and when we arrived (room 633) we were totally blown away. We have both stayed in hotels around the world and this room was absolutely lovely. The suite we were in was so unique, with the quirks of an upper reading area, lounge and two bathrooms! To top this off when we walked into the bedroom, we had petals saying happy birthday and some writing in the same manner on our mirrors. So beautifully done by your staff. The teddy and chocolates on the bed were the icing on the cake😊 My daughter loved the Dilly teddy and has already named it ‘Milly from the Dilly’ and has requested a stay at the hotel for her birthday in July!

 

Anyway, thanks to your amazing efforts and touches I am now stuck with a challenge – how on earth do I top this for his 50th! When I asked him he said he would love to do the same thing again - so I think my only way to top things is TWO nights at the Dilly!

Thank you so much again, you helped us create some magical memories.

Jess and Mark Mauger x

What caught me by surprise is the excellent customer service and that everyone went the extra mile to make our stay amazing.
All the staff provided excellent customer service, including George the head conceige, and his amazing team Like, Tiago, Jawed and Taylor.
And finally thank you to Lisa who upgraded us and decorated our room with flower petals and ballons!

117,"Comfortable, relaxing and enjoyable ","Loved our recent stay at the Dilly Hotel. I think the price we got our rooms for was well worth the money. 
Amazing location, can’t beat that, really comfortable beds, and the hotel itself is quiet at night. Attractive hotel with lots of period features and every member of staff was friendly and polite and made you feel welcome. We had our room upgraded for free and even got a free gift only because we had to wait just 10 minutes more for the upgraded room to be ready. 
The fitness centre and pool are really well appointed and easy to use. 
Over all really good value for money, the best location and a comfortable stay. What more could you want. ",5,2023,11,13
117,Average!,"A large group of us stayed at the Dilly together this weekend as a treat, having stayed at many 5* London hotels, I can safely say this is not the best!

Reception staff although polite, were not confident with the computer system and took a long time to find and allocate our rooms, not all were ready (which was fine as we were early) but when we returned at 10.30pm, they still struggled and we waited a long while, despite believing we would just need to return and collect the final key.

Not all the bars in the hotel were open and it was difficult to get a table, staff were not overly obliging.

There were no food options available at the hotel when we returned so we ordered Deliveroo before bed, always with the intention of taking it to our rooms, as we shared boxes out the night doorman (on the desk in reception) told us  “Pardon my language but don’t leave your s@*t here, it’s not a kitchen”. We told him we wouldn’t dream of doing so or even trying to eat it in a communal area and he left but we were shocked and disappointed to be spoken to in such a way, anywhere, let alone in a 5* hotel.

Rooms are large with good blackout curtains and beds are very comfortable but they are tired and in need of an update. The bathrooms especially need some TLC, there is missing and stained grout and lumpy, patchy walls. There was no bath mat and the towel rail was so far away from the bath, you had to drip across the floor. The shower was below par and the shower curtain was something from the 80’s!!

Heating was temperamental, some rooms were boiling, others cold. Our bathroom had a very old, mouldy window in that didn’t fully close which gave us the wonderful opportunity of listening to the bottle bins being emptied at 6am!!

The TV was very old and the picture grainy.

We used this hotel as a base and spent most of our stay out in the city but if we had spent longer it would have been a bigger disappointment, there are much better hotels to consider if you are looking to spend £3-400 a night!

Really appreciated the location, cleanliness, excellent breakfast in a very pretty room but above all the customer service from reception, concierge to the serving staff in the restaurant.

117,Worst hotel and experience ever!,"Most horrid hotel iv ever stayed in in London! It’s run down and filthy! One can’t put one’s feet on the carpet because it’s sticky. Small rooms and even smaller run down toilets! The rooms have not been renovated in 20 years minimum. The windows don’t open. Inspite of repeated requests at the time of booking 2 months in advance about higher floors and rooms that hv opening windows because of a health condition, it was not honoured. 
The reception area looks ok but the rooms n floors upstairs are horrid. I pre poned my trip by a day and had to pay extra airline charges because could not stand living there. 
Went down to the bar at 4.30 pm to have tea as they serve it there, but was caught at the door by a screeching woman who was running out and said not to go in as she’d just seen a rat! I went to the reception to inform the reception and was actually told by the receptionist that “this was common in London”! Seriously? A hotel like that maintains such low quality of just about everything. Shudder to think what goes on in their kitchen if rats are running around in their bars!
Will  NEVER stay there and fr the price they charge one can find hundred decent places!",1,2023,11,04
117,Terrible experience second time wont be a third,"The location of the Hotel is the only great thing about .

It is not a 3 star hotel the rooms are old, dirty and unacceptable for the price. 

We stayed last 5 years at this hotel the managements changed but nothing change for good even most of the services like house keeping get much worst in the years. 

The house keeping is far from the hygene and the sleepers shampoo and usual products that you expect to receive at a hotel room of 300 pounds per night you don’t find them in the room. 

When you book a room don’t bother to write them a message about your needs cause they don’t care about your needs… I will add the room’s video please check before you book a room in this hotel. I can’t say all but most of the staff they are trying to manipulate you to get angry to them and playing they don’t get why you are angry. There is a lot to say",2,2023,11,01

117,WOW!!,"WOW!!

I have never stayed in a hotel in any location without some negatives or something they could change.

This is the first time I have I have no negatives.

The location was amazing! 

The hotel is lovely and grand. With an amazing large basement pool where you would never think you are in the middle of London.

We ate in the Terrace where people were eating a London theme afternoon tea. I wish I had booked this. It looked really lovely.

Our suite Was amazing!
This was for my daughters 9th birthday. We could not believe the size of the room. We definitely would not be getting under each others feet, which happens a lot when staying in some of the other hotels in London with their smaller rooms.

They’re were balloons, birthday cakes, teddy’s and personalised birthday message on the mirror in the hall. 

The staff could not have done more. It was a perfect stay in a perfect hotel!

The only negative I can think of, is that we only stayed for one night only. 

It really was a beautiful hotel with lovely staff and amazing bedroom.

We can not wait to come back!

Thank you for everything.",5,2023,10,23
117,Letdown 3 star at best,"Celebrating our anniversary at the Dilly Hotel London fell short of expectations. Check-in was prolonged due to a queue, and the lobby's cold ambiance didn't match a 5-star experience. Exploring London while waiting for our room, we returned with anticipation only to find a disappointing reality. The room, frankly, resembled a 3-star hotel—dated decor, hair in the sink, no bath, and zero view. Quite dissatisfied; I've experienced better in travel lodges. The silver lining is the excellent location, and a check-in staff member displayed professionalism. Overall, not the anticipated anniversary retreat. Only been here an hour, and the letdown is palpable. #DillyHotelExperience",2,2023,10,22
117,A gem in a great location,"Wonderful location with even more wonderful service. 

We stayed in this charming hotel while celebrating my mum’s 70th birthday and wow did the team make an effort to make her feel so special! Birthday flower petal message, balloons and sweet treats. 

From the moment we arrived the check in was welcoming, quick and seamless; the room was perfect and spotlessly clean; and the breakfast of a high quality with a vast option of delicious food. 

Great location just a stone’s throw from the tube and a short walk from Regent St and Oxford Street. 

Highly recommended. Thank you to all the wonderful staff who made our stay so special.",5,2023,10,22
117,Good Location But Underwhelmed Service and Amenities,"I'll start with the positives. The hotel has probably the best location in London. It is within walking distance to the National Gallery, Chinatown, many theatres, Hyde Park, Regent Street, and Bond Street. 

Now the negatives. First, our large suite was not heated so the in-room temperature was about 18-20C. The housekeep sent us two portable heaters which were probably made in the 1950s. Even when we turned them on around the clock, the suite never warmed up. Second, because we booked a large suite, we were told we could use the VIP lounge. However, our card keys to the VIP lounge floor were not activated, so we never got to use the lounge. Third, the Terrace Restaurant was supposed to open at 7:00 a.m. for breakfast, but when I went there at 7:00 a.m., it was not ready. The staff were still busy bringing the food out from the kitchen. They were smileless as if I came too early to disturb them. Last, as the main entrance of the hotel faces directly a busy street, Piccadilly, it was impossible to book a taxi to wait outside the hotel. Consequently, guests had to carry their pieces of luggage out to the street to flag down a taxi. It was especially inconvenient during rainy days!

Considering that we paid 2,350 pounds for 4 nights, we did not really have a pleasant experience at The Dilly!",2,2023,10,22
117,Terrible rooms,"Stayed here for only 1 night fortunately.

For the price one of the worst hotels we have stayed in. The breakfast was nice and the staff do there best everything else was sub standard. The room was dirty and tired, no fridge in the room and we needed one for medication so they took one from another guests room which still had the guests yogurts in. I was told they had locked fridges in rooms that didn’t work any longer. The fridge that had been taken from another guests room looked like something you would take camping.

The heating/AC controls in the room did not work so the room was too warm the whole duration we where there. We reported this so the staff said they would bring us an AC unit, we got a fan that just blew warm air round the room.

The bathrooms look like something from the 1980’s, taps covered in limescale and again just very tired.

Our windows overlooked what can only be described as a mucky pit containing ducting and extraction units for the hotel, the windows had secondary glazing again very dated and had safety chains on so they could not be opened. 

This hotel requires major investment.

",2,2023,10,22
117,Love this hotel!,"We just got back from London and loved this hotel.  The room was large, the bed very comfortable and the towels were so fluffy and large.  We’ve never had such nice towels anywhere.  We loved the little thoughtful touches such as fresh fruit in the lobby for you to take for your day and the candies set out nicely in glass jars. We didn’t eat at the restaurant but it was busy and pretty.  They also have a bar with music, a pool and a gym.   It’s got a boutique feeling but offers everything.  I must also say the jolly doorman was so helpful in giving us directions and suggestions. This hotel is right at Piccadilly Circus and convenient to everything. ",5,2023,10,19
117,"Abysmal, unsafe and unclean. Room door opened whilst out!","We stayed in a suite, went out of the day and upon our return, one of the double doors was open. We were stunned.

We went to report this matter around 11.30-12am and the staff at reception did not care. They were unhelpful, one elderly raggedy looking man was smirking whilst we reported the incident. They wouldn't check the CCTV cameras and refused to investigate the incident. Told us to let them know if anything was stolen. I'm still shocked. Needless to say we felt unsafe and unsure what happened and who was involved.

Apart from this horrific experience, the rooms were visibly dirty with stains on the walls and ceilings (yuck), dated furniture, awful carpets and decor. I had to wipe the furnishings that we had to touch with anti bac wipes. 

The floor we stayed on had a sewage like smell coming from the corridor. 

We stayed 2 nights. I think the reception was the only clean place and would have rather slept there or on the streets. 

Never again, book at your own risk. 1 star at best.",1,2023,10,17
117,Poor spa facilities ,"Great location. 
Good breakfast. 
Underwhelming room “with a view”. 
The “spa” facilities are not that of a 5 star hotel which was quite disappointing, especially considering spending £150 on an hour long massage. Unlike other 5 star hotels where I have used the spa facilities there is no relaxation room. It very much feels like an afterthought and like walking into a gym facility which is not overly relaxing! ",3,2023,10,15
117,Simply WOW,My family and I had the most fabulous stay at the Dilly! It was our first time visiting London and we can’t wait to come back. The entire staff was absolutely amazing! Accommodating and simply service oriented to the max. Upon checking into to our beautiful room we were delighted and surprised to see our room full of balloons and hearts on the bed. Amenity in the room for the kids and a bottle of wine for us! After a long journey this was simply perfect. All of this is because of a special team member by the name of Saleem at guest relations. You made our stay and we will be back because of your efforts and kindness! Simply wow!,5,2023,10,13

117,"Great staff, awful pool facilities ","I must say the staff were amazing and especially the manager, very attentive and remembered the little things! The room and hotel is very nice, the food was great!
The only thing that let the place down was the facilities, the gym looked good however the pool was cold, no sauna, no Jacuzzi, only a steam room and for the price of the hotel I would have thought it would have all these, very outdated in the pool area as well, floor is sinking as well!",3,2023,10,10
117,Disappointing visit,"Just spent six days at The Dolly for business. I called beforehand requesting an early check-in. When I arrived they told me if I upgraded to the Executive King room they could accommodate me. This would be an additional $50 per day. I agreed and they put in a room on the first floor right above the entrance to the hotel. It was loud to say the least from the street noise but you could also hear everything from lobby below. The windows were so dirty you could barely see outside. I requested a change of room and they said they couldn’t accommodate me until 3PM and since I already agreed to the upgrade they couldn’t honor my original reservation. 
I waited until 3PM where they put me on the 6th floor but this room hasn’t been touched since 1980. The room was a decent size but the window faced another wall. The refrigerator was broken and when I complained about that they brought another one up that just sat in the middle of the room. The bathroom sink leaked when you turned it on. Didn’t feel like an Executive King room whatsoever. 

You are clearly paying for the location because the building and rooms are very depressing. ",2,2023,10,07
117,My Fab Birthday Memory at The Dilly,"Upon arrival, I was assisted by Selim on a smooth check in and gave a tour on the hotel’s facilities. He was very pleasant and kind and knew it that I will be having a great stay during my birthday week. The staffs were accomodating, asking if I needed something or if everything was okay. The room was immaculately clean, bed was comfortable and the view was scenic. Given that the hotel was centrally located, there was a good sound proofing around. The room was well lit. Undeniably, it was a birthday week to remember and already planning for my next trip here in London.

117,Wonderful,Salim Atias did his best for us to have a wonderful time. Salim helped us with everything we needed and made sure we had everything we needed. We will come back for sure in The Dilly which is in the center of everything ,5,2023,09,25
117,Amazing ,"I had a wonderful time with my family and Salim Atias made our experience the best as possible.
The hotel was very welcoming and it was nice that it was located in the middle of London.
Thank you for your help with everything.",5,2023,09,25
117,Fantastic Anniversary Stay,"Perfect stay for our anniversary, excellent location and close to the Piccadilly Circus underground. We were lucky enough to have our room upgraded to the Junior Suite which was a lovely surprise and a large room with a very comfortable bed. Henry especially made us feel very welcome and went the extra mile to ensure we were looked after. We are looking forward to our next stay at The Dilly already!",5,2023,09,25
117,Birthday break ,Received amazing service. Staff couldn't be nicer. When i arrived  in my room it had been decorated with rose petals and a complimentary bottle.of processo also with a mini birthday cake. Great location would defo recommend for a nice break in London. ,5,2023,09,25
117,Great hotel. Highly recommended!!!,"The hotel is located at the heart of London near the Picadilly circus. Rooms and large and spacious and highly maintained. The bed was very comfortable and the service was above our expectations. Breakfast is rich and tasty. I would especially like to mention the manager Salim, who guided us through our stay and made it even more pleasant. Will come back again. This hotel is highly recommended.",5,2023,09,25
117,"Rude staff, rooms need refurbishment, great location.","Staff: Upon checking into a double room, we found the bathtub had stains. Went to the reception to request a different room. The receptionist I was talking to completely ignored us and muttered something under his breath. Rude? Racist? I’m not sure but we were shocked at his behavior because we’ve never been treated like that at a hotel. The young lady at the reception was quick to jump in to help and gave us a different room. The manager at Madhu’s was nice. 

Rooms: rooms look like they need refurbishment, with carpets coming off from sides. We needed an infant crib in our new room but that was never delivered despite specifically asking for it. We didn’t ask again because we didn’t want to deal with Dilly’s rude staff. 

Location: great location if you want to be around Piccadilly and have easy access to central London. 

Overall: we got to know from some of the staff that the manager at the reception can be rude and several guests have complained about his behavior. Overall, an unpleasant stay. Not returning or recommending this hotel.",1,2023,09,24
117,Good Location,"On arrival, we were checked in quickly.

We had two rooms, one superior double and one superior twin.  The twin was twice the size of the double! The rooms we’re comfortable and clean but one thing I noticed is that this hotel are not doing anything for sustainability, which was disappointing.

My husband and I went to the bar for a drink but left after about 15 minutes because we were completely ignored by staff.  

The location is great as there is a walkway through to Regent Street at the side of the hotel.  

Other than the location, I’d say the hotel was underwhelming.",3,2023,09,23
117,High Chai Madhu’s of Mayfair,"Highly recommend 
Excellent service 
Excellent food 
Service with a smile 
The manager and waiter Felix made sure they made my daughters birthday special 
We are vegetarian and don’t eat eggs, and the staff were so helpful to ensure that all our expectations were met.",5,2023,09,23
117,Incompetent and deceiving staff with pathetic rooms are the jewels of the dilly 'hotel',"Terrible experience. Had to wait for 30 mins to just check in because the front desk was a tad bit judgemental and shrugged off the booking status twice and was later able to magically find it when I mentioned about the corporate bookings and reviews that might follow. Hint of racism from the staff. Also they mentioned a list of services they offer and when requested the same, the team first gave the wrong items. I highlighted the same and even followed up twice within 70-80 mins. To which they came and offered me champagne instead of the requested items. 

I would recommend going for this if it's the end of the world and there's nothing else left. ",1,2023,09,20
117,Good choice,It had a wonderful location. I've stayed here before and liked it very much. The room has almost everything we need. I had a very clean room. I can recommend for everyone. Locations was amazing. You can walk from hotel to everywhere. Good choice,5,2023,09,20
117,Excellent Customer Service,"It's an excellent hotel.

I stayed at this hotel at the end of last month, and I'm returning for another trip in a few days. It's all because of the service.

During my last visit I got to know Selim Atias at the front desk. He found for me, after getting to know me, the perfect room. When I entered the room I got a warm welcome note, that helped me feel right at home. Every question I had was answered by him, and he helped me with all my vacation needs and planning.

As you can understand, I'm returning to the hotel, and I find it a great choice, right in the middle of everywhere.",5,2023,09,20
117,Great hotel location,"I started my visity at this hotel with a superb welcome from the fron desk staff. Amazing service, that answered every need and question I had. I especially felt welcomed by Selim Atias, who was there every time I needed something.

The rooms were surprisingly big, clean and the bed was very comfortable. I also enjoyed the big and rich breakfast.

And, of course (I should have started with this), a perfect location, a few meters from Piccadily Circus.

I'll absolutely visit again.",5,2023,09,20
117,The location is worth everything,"If there is one reason worth giving this hotel a five stars review, it’s the location. The hotel is located practically a stone’s throw from Piccadilly Circus, and I almost never used the underground. I walked everywhere. There is nothing better than starting your day with a morning run at Hyde Park, and than just walking back to the hotel.

And to top the location, I found the service at the front desk impeccable. I met Selim Atias, who outdid himself with listening to and answering every question that I had. If you need any advice or help, he is your go to man.

Definitely will consider this hotel for a future visit.",5,2023,09,20
117,"Unforgettable Experience in the Heart of London, Thanks to Tarek","My recent stay at the hotel in Piccadilly, London, was truly exceptional, and much of it was thanks to the outstanding service provided by the staff member, Tarek. From the moment we arrived, Tarek went above and beyond to ensure our stay was unforgettable.",5,2023,09,18
117,Excellent staff & service Good Location,"We chose The Dilly because the hotel has a great location and accessible by walking to everything. Of cause we shopped until the last minute.

My family were a bit early for check in and we were in a hurry because our rental car parked at the loading zone. The lady at the reception (lovely, friendly and kind and I forgot to ask her name) upgraded our room to a bigger one. 

Luckily, we accidently ran into the hotel manager Mr. Selim Atias. He was very professional and helpful and took care of every details of all guests. Surprisingly, we met him all over the hotel.  It was good to have an active manager like him at The Dilly.

The concierge team was excellent, especially Tarek. They took care of our belongings and managed the taxi to LHR.

Breakfast was delicious and quality of foods was superb.  

We will definitely be back to The Dilly and it's highly recommended.

117,Delightful Dilly ,"Location is perfect with a sightseeing bus stop right outside the door, Piccadilly circus over the road and Buckingham Palace just a short walk away.  The staff were really nice, helpful and friendly with special mention to Linda in housekeeping who went above and beyond, there's a lovely family vibe from all the staff actually.

117,Great location.,"The location of this hotel is superb and its biggest plus factor. The bedrooms however, totally let it down. The bathroom needed a complete refurbishment and the bedroom could have done with decorating and we were given an upgraded room! The concierge staff were really friendly and helpful but the reception staff were a bit miserable with no attempt to engage in a friendly manner. ",3,2023,09,08
117,Elegant hotel in London,"The staff are nice.
The bathroom is very large with a bath tub. 
The location is convenient which is next to Piccadilly station exit 2.
The room is equiped with iron facilities and it is neat and tidy. ",4,2023,09,05
117,Fabulous hotel great location,Another fabulous stay at the Dilly! Great hotel in a great location. This time we made full use of their beautiful swimming pool and steam room. Selim and his team made our stay celebrating a birthday very special and memorable! Thank you so much and look forward to coming back soon. ,5,2023,09,04
117,Excellent experience and superb service,"We were a bit early for checkin; the staff were very helpful and our luggage were stored in a safe room until we returned. Our son was treated to a complentary lollie as they had a freezer in the lobby for children to enjoy a treat. This was a nice touch indeed.

Our room was spacious, clean and very comfortable.  The room had a welcome bottle of wine which was a lovely gesture.  We enjoyed the location of The Dilly as its mere steps to the main Square and many places of interests. The breakfast buffet at The Terrace restaurant was wonderful with a wide variety of various items and a live cooking station where you could request any style of eggs. The ambience was relaxing with an array of beautiful flowers and the staff was very friendly.

Although we couldn't indulge in the pool we did check it out as well as the gym and spa facilities.  Maybe on our next stay! I had read in previous reviews about The Dilly having a signature teddy bear but when I enquired about purchasing it for my son as a keepsake I was told that its usually given out to children if they have any at hand. Unfortunately, they didn't but after my departure, I was contacted by The Dilly's Senior Guest Relations Manager, Selim Atias about our overall experience and he graciously offered to send my son The Dilly bear!  This was indeed service way beyond our expectations.  

Overall, we were impressed with the level of service and would stay here again when next we visit London. Would highly recommend the hotel to visitors. ",5,2023,09,03
117,Two nights at the Dilly.  ,"Great hotel.  Room was spotlessly clean.  We were upgraded due to my friends birthday and we also received lots of birthday goodies which was fantastic .  Great location and breakfast was excellent, you could virtually have anything.  ",5,2023,09,03
117,3rd stay and the best one! ,"This is my 3rd stay at The Dilly and the best! My first time wasnt the best if i am honest put they have certainly turned it around! This time Selim handled my reservation and I was blown away.  It was my birthday on Sunday and I was given a gorgeous squirrel and a bottle of red wine plus an upgrade.  The personal touches and notes left where just lovely.   I will always stay the The Dilly from now on.  There are also lots of other great aspects.  Breakfast is gorgeous, everything you can think of ln the buffet and then anything freshly cooked.  The refurbished rooms are very nice and the gorgeous bedding.  If i was to be critical on minor detail I would say i really wish conditioner was provided but its not just The Dilly that dont provide conditioner!  Thanks to all who made my stay a very comfortable.  Thanks for managing this Selim ",5,2023,09,01
117,We love The Dilly,"I took my 9 & 5 year old here for a 2 night stay. We had a brilliant experience with The Dilly.

117,Exceptional service,"I can't praise the whole Dilly team enough for how special they all made my daughter on her 15th birthday visit to London. Not only did they upgrade her to a suite, but decorated it with balloons, a fluffy squirrel, soft drinks, chocolate, cake and hand written messages, which were all such fabulous & unexpected details. She was absolutely thrilled and I appreciate it so much. Sterling service from Dilly, they were truly amazing 🤩",5,2023,08,30
117,Great stay,Great hotel. We were very well taken care of by a very attentive staff and the room was wonderful. The Dilly has everything it needs to be one of the best in London. With a new crew at the helm it has a great future. We will definitely be back.,5,2023,08,29

We'll be sure to book it again next time we come to London :)

117,Rooms rather tired.,"Stayed at the Dilly over the recent bank holiday, figured the location was great for theatre land and always appreciated the style of this characterful building. 

Booked a superior room with breakfast. 

The lobby area is lovely but check in took approximately 20 mins due to a queue, this was likely just due to the time of day so I wouldn’t recommend booking in around 3. 

Reaching the room initial impressions were that the room looked relatively clean, was a good size
But looked quite tired and worn. The bed was nice, and everything looked and smelled clean, but only one of the lamps in the room actually worked and I was very disappointed with the bathroom, the side of the bath appeared to be missing it’s side panel or it has just been very badly painted, and the shower lacked any form of water pressure, being barely the equal of a tap switcher system, the grouting was also disgusting in the bath room, their were knobs on the wall in the bathroom that just came off in my hand as well and I still have no idea what it did. 

I did sleep well and the TV was good allowing me to cast my phone image to the tv which is something more hotels should offer. 

Heading down to breakfast the service was quite fast and the English breakfast was overall ok, great hash browns but terrible scrambled eggs.

Overall I was unimpressed with the superior room provided and the room was dark, poorly finished and just looked very tidy. Had I been staying longer then one night I would have complained about the situation.",3,2023,08,29
117,Great memorable stay,"We booked The Dilly hotel for our 4 years wedding anniversary. 

I emailed the hotel and senior guest relations manager Mr Selim Atias and he responded in seconds and made me sure that it will be  the most amazing memorable stay and it was.

 Upon our arrival to the hotel we met Selim and he greeted us with great smile. Our room was decorated beautifully and my wife was very touched .
 Our room was upgraded with rose petals and we had the most amazing experience in the heart of the london. Thank you Dilly.",5,2023,08,28
117,Good location,"We stayed one night at the hotel.
Hotel had lovely swimming pool and gym facilities bars and restaurants. very nice staff.our room was very clean but needed some TLC .would recommend for location to piccadilly circus station would stay again",4,2023,08,27
117,Faded Glory,"We had been looking forward to our stay at The Dilly but, to be frank, we've stayed in quite a few better hotels around London over the years.

First, the plus points. Obviously, it's a brilliant location in the heart of the West End within easy reach of shops, the main tourist attractions and theatres. Second, breakfast up on the terrace is first class and the lobby bar is an elegant place to spend time, if a tad expensive. The basement pool is a bonus in central London.

But it has its downsides. On a personal level, we had to wait for two hours for our room to be sorted out. Apparently someone had been there for a month and there were clear signs that a deep clean had taken place. The room must have been one of the older ones in the hotel, and bore no resemblance to the modern-looking rooms pictured on the hotel website. 

The bathroom was particularly tired and grubby and the air conditioning made plenty of noise but no appreciable difference to the warm temperature of the room. As a last straw, the TV remote was missing.

There are signs throughout the hotel, particularly in the area we were staying, that it could do with a spot of investment. Think we'll stay somewhere else next time.

",3,2023,08,26
117,Great service with a smile,Thank you to the friendly Customer Service Manager at the Dilly Hotel for the kind hospitality and help in the hidden comforts of the Executive Lounge and also showing us the magical secret garden………..,5,2023,08,24
117,Wonderful Stay,"We had the pleasure of staying at The Dilly to celebrate my husband’s birthday. The Dilly truly went above and beyond to make our stay special, with thoughtful surprises in our room and wonderful attention to detail. 

I would 100% stay again in the future and would recommend to all.
",5,2023,08,24
117,A breath of fresh air in busy central London,"I've stayed in many hotels in London, and The Dilly seriously impressed me. Nothing was too much trouble - from early check-in to late check-out, free ice lollies, friendly staff, and comfortable rooms. The pool was a lovely added bonus; there was plenty of room for a decent swim before breakfast. I found the staff warm and accommodating, and The Dilly ended up being a calm and peaceful stay despite the incredibly central location.",5,2023,08,24
117,Excellent staff & service!,"Our 18th visit here! Excellent, welcoming, helpful staff! Buffet breakfast AMAZING, afternoon tea delicious, room clean & comfortable! It felt like hone from home for us & convenient location for everything you need to enjoy central London & it's lovely to have the concierge to ask for any directions needed if we were unsure!",5,2023,08,24
117,"Great rooms, breakfast and location","Great rooms, great breakfast. Located directly at Piccadilly Circus (1 minute walk). We just stayed for one night, but everything was fine. Very friendly staff. They have a pool and a fitness area we didn't use.",5,2023,08,23
117,"Great experience , will come back again","We stayed at the Dilly over the weekend, enjoyed the view on the terrace, but one of the waitress Gabriela was rude to me when I asked a few questions. I went to address this with the manager Selim, who apologised to us and offered free drinks in Madhus instead. Overall it was a great experience. ",5,2023,08,23
117,Had a great stay in the heart of london,"Had a very nice stay at the dilly.
Great location, right next to the center of london.
Room was very very nice (even got upgraded), comfortable and well equipped.
Breakfast was really nice and rich.
The staff was rally friendly, I’d like to specially thank Selim Atias, the guest relations manager, who took care of us and went the extra mile with our stay",5,2023,08,23

The breakfast is outstanding.
The rooms are clean and spacious.
The bathroom is large and luxurious.
There are bathrobes in the room.
The location is excellent - very central and close to everything and there is a metro station next to the hotel.
There is a very pampering lounge.
The hotel manager Salim Atias helped us in everything and they upgraded our room to two rooms with a connecting door so that we would be comfortable and spacious. Salim is charming and made sure we had a great experience during our entire stay. There is no doubt that we will return to the hotel again",5,2023,08,23
117,300 breakfasts at once: a well-oiled machine,"It's a big centre london hotel with up to 500 here-today gone-tomorrow tourists. What do you expect? When I get back home, I realise that the hotel and staff will have to repeat the whole thing again for another 500 guests. They do a good job here, and all gave lovely smiles through, I could see, a lot of hard work and effciency. 

Well, its location at Piccadilly Circus is superb for Soho and theatreland to the east, Mayfair's back street street life to west and the River and South Bank to the south. 

It has a sort of Edwardian charm I guess; I never did spot where all the facilities were, but was only there a night. Room, well, a room, comfy beds, etc. what else do you need?

But the breakfast! I was mesmerised by the staff everywhere, each knowing what was to be done. How do they keep their smiles and helfpfulness. It is a buffet for everything; you'd be forgiven to think that could be chaos in a full 9am time. Not a bit of it, an amazing well-oiled machine, staff like ants scurrying everywhere to keep the food coming, to seat everyone, to clear the tables. This is a hotel that knows what it has to do and does it well. It's all we needed, so great.

Well not quite. Wife Julia has Alzheimer's and went wandering early in the morning. Panic. Almost. Julia was found by an extremely kind and engaging room staff Linda, who showed great caring. Thanks Linda, we were proud of you and I'm sure the Dilly is too.

So, if you're up to town in London, don't be silly, stay at the Dilly.",5,2023,08,21
117,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE !!!!,"There is two type of rooms at the hotel. 

We use to stay at room 105, I ask specially at the booking which  was the worth of this hotel but this time they gaved me the two rooms 543- 447  which was disaster… the outfits are death and smells, dirty, the carpet is not cleanable anymore the wardrobe is so dirty can not discribe we stayed 4 nights at these disgusting rooms…. 

I paid the same amount for these disgusting rooms. And plus the housekeeping was terrible too like we stayed in another hotel…1 bottle of water for two persons. The boucle sets aren’t full and the same quality.

When we enter to the rooms the refrigerators were locked. I ask them to open while we are out when I am back I saw the last clients moldy leftovers in the refrigerator leaved as it is. We couldn’t use the room’s utilities and the boucle set of the rooms were very poor than before…

Unfortunately this experience was terrible and we paid the same amount per room per night for this terrible experience…. as we stayed in the good quality rooms which is unacceptable..",1,2023,08,19
117,Lovely stay in heart of London,"Lovely hotel right in the heart of London. Staff were helpful and always got an extra check in later in the day from housekeeping if you needed anything else. Turn down at night with chocolates on the pillows was a lovely touch. 
It was our Anniversary and the room had been dressed with some special touches  thanks to Carolina from customer relations. Will definitely be back. ",5,2023,08,14
117,Perfect!,"We had the best experience at the Dilly hotel!

It was the best time ever. Thanks you ! ",5,2023,08,14
117,Amazing,"We just left the Dilly hotel. It was amazing. The room, the best location, the food and the atmosphere - all was just perfect. The staff was polite and friendly. Above all I shall mention Mr. Selim Atias who was helping, caring and made our stay nice and fun. He is amazing! Thank you Selim. Thank you London. ",5,2023,08,14
117,3 star masquerading as a 5 star,"Definitely not 5 star hotel, arrived with luggage and bellboys and concierge stood around chatting, never offered to help, Checked in and we had a suite, room was tired and stains on carpet, there was 3 of us so I went down and told them the room was only set up for 2 so we needed extra towels, robes, coffee cup etc and the fridge was locked for some reason, reception said no problem we will sort it, that was Friday, we asked 3 times Saturday and still no extra towels or anything else. When we checked out we informed them again that we never received the appropriate things and she just shrugged her shoulders! Throughout the stay I got the impression the staff thought they were better than the guests and we were just in the way! Location is great and breakfast was good as long as you don’t want an egg, the hardest working person was the chef on the omelette/egg station, 1 guy, 2 small pans trying his best to keep up with the waiters throwing orders at him, 30 min wait for a fried egg! Everything has a 12.5% svc charge and the staff aren’t worth a penny of it! If you can get somewhere else I would!",3,2023,08,13
117,Wonderful stay at the Dilly Hotel,"So happy with our stay at the Dilly Hotel, central London. So close to everything, walk distance to Soho, China town, Leister sq. Bedroom very clean, fab breakfast. Staff, Hossain at reception, Victor the ops manager and Tarek in guest relations/concierge were so helpful with any question or query we had. Loads of facilities, spa, pool, a golf screen, gym, afternoon tea, award winning restaurant, piano bar and relaxing balcony lounge with complimentary coffee/tea snacks. Highly recommend this Hotel.",5,2023,08,13
117,I would love to return to this hotel.,"The hotel was clean and tidy with excellent service led by Selim Atias. Every request we made was gladly accepted.
Every day they changed sheets and towels and put a bottle of water and chocolates on the pillows.
Just a great hotel.",5,2023,08,13
117,Stay away,"Stayed for one night at the beginning of July,I paid in advance for my stay  when I booked it ,since the stay the dilly have taken payment for the stay a further twice,after a bit of a showdown with the unhelpful weekend DM&reception staff I got the first extra payment cancelled,they took the second extra payment out of my account almost 3 weeks after my stay without any notification to me,leaving me with very little in my account to pay my monthly bills, they have stopped replying to my emails regarding the second extra payment and have taken no responsibility for the mistakes they made.Also the room was dark& unclean,the main part of the room hadn’t been hoovered&we found quite a lot of dirt&hairs in the bathroom, in my opinion definitely not 5 star,I ‘ve stayed in much nicer,cleaner hotels for a fraction of the cost",1,2023,08,12
117,"One Night, Solo Trip, GREAT! ","I walked into the room and the bed was completely decorated with rose petals and chocolates and even a couple keepsakes, but then I looked out the window at the view right at Picadilly Circus and I knew I had picked right. Selim Atias outshined anything I could of imagined. I walked into the hotel was greeted by him and then the room became a bonus. 
The best part about this hotel is that I felt safe and at home every time I walked in, it was just for one night but multiple of the members knew my name (because I had stayed there before), and REMEMBERED! 
I am so grateful for this hotel, in fact, when I come back to London, I will stay at the same hotel again and again for the outstanding service and especially Selim. ",5,2023,08,11
117,"Perfect location, great service","We stayed at The Dilly for 15 nights in July. We had a great time. The location is great. We were able to walk to many restaurants and several Theaters. There are two tube stations nearby so getting around London was easy. The hotel was very nice and the staff was friendly and helpful. Any time we had a request, it was fulfilled promptly. We would stay here again.",5,2023,08,07
117,A home in the heart of London! ,"We had an absolutely wonderful time at The Dilly Hotel! 
It’s a place where the traditionally best British experience meets an excellent modern concept of hospitality. Super comfortable rooms, great mezzanine lounge, gym, terrace restaurant and very good location in the heart of London. 
But, the best surprise for us was how friendly the staff are, especially the relationship guest director Mr. Salim Athias who made the all difference with his professionalism and a very warm welcome in our room! We can’t thank him enough and the all team for the unforgettable experience!!!",5,2023,08,05
117,Definitely recommend this hotel ,"A wonderful hotel in the hub of Piccadilly. The hotel lobby, reception and seating area with its fresh flowers, fruit, coffee and sweets was very welcoming and the hotel buffet breakfast in the Terrace restaurant was one of the best buffet breakfasts we had for a while in terms of layout, organisation, food variety and quality. All staff were very friendly and welcoming.

We had a small problem in our first night of our stay but cannot praise Selim Atias ( Senior Guest Relations Manager ) enough for dealing with the issue promptly and professionally by upgrading us which made us feel like valued guests. He also arranged a surprise cake for our friends 50th birthday which was a lovely gesture. 
We will definitely return and hope the planned refurbishment gets the go ahead - the plans sound amazing. ",5,2023,08,03
117,Will definitely be back,"We booked The Dilly for our 40th Wedding Anniversary. It was an amazing experience, the staff are all extremely welcoming & pleasant. Thank you very much to Abdul & Selim for going above and beyond in making us feel so special with all the extraordinary and thoughtful personal touches.",5,2023,08,03
117,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"On Saturday I attended an afternoon tea with some friends and WOW what a wonderful afternoon tea it was! 

From arriving at the hotel to leaving we where treated so well, the food was AMAZING and being able to ask for additional sandwiches really adds to the experience.",5,2023,07,31
117,Grand Lady - great place to stay.,"The Dilly is a grand old lady in a fabulous location. Whilst the rooms are needing some updating it is still extremely comfortable full of old world charm. The lobby, restaurant, breakfast area are magnificent. At The Dilly, Selim Atias the Senior guest relations manager is the consummate professional, most welcoming, entertaining, sensational personality that made the stay extremely enjoyable for the whole family. Selim was brilliant, perfect for hospitality always willing to assist with total focus on his guests, considerate of their opinions and always looking for improvement. The Dilly is a few minutes walking distance to many of London's major attractions, which is a must in my view as a tourist. Everything on your doorstep, I highly recommend the Dilly that will be next level, a very special place after the proposed renovations shortly. In the meantime still brilliant.
I have been to London several times, The Dilly is the place. Thanks Selim.",5,2023,07,30
117,Wonderful choice,"The hotel is amazing!  There is very  comfortable rooms, soft mattress, good shower, excellent staff.  The amenities in the room were great, with Nespresso, some teas, sweet biscuits, fresh sparkling water every day.
The breakfast was in a terrace, with a great view, and a numerous options of breads, fruits, cakes, and others delicious food.

The wifi is not so good. ",5,2023,07,30
117,Proposal in the heart of London,"If you plan to propose in London, You should look no further!. The Dilly understands elegance, service,food and rooms are TOP-NOTCH. I communicated with Guest relations manager Mr. Attics a month ago and he took care of everything. We upgraded into refurbished Junior Suite which was amazing. The suite was decorated beautifully and there was chapel down champagne with vet delicious celebration cake in our room. And She said YES!!!! 
Thank you for making  thus special occasion very memorable. We will return!",5,2023,07,30
117,Excellent - so much better than expected,"After reading a number of negative reviews, particularly regarding old and tired-looking rooms, I was worried. I emailed the hotel ahead of our stay to ask whether they could allocate us some of their refurbished rooms as pictured on the website. I was travelling with my Mother and as this visit was for her birthday, I did not want her to be disappointed. Selim Attias responded promptly to my email and assured me he would put us in some of the newly refurbished rooms. I can honestly say we were delighted with everything about our stay at the Dilly. Our rooms (105 and 106) were lovely. They were exactly as pictured on the website - the decor was contemporary, they were clean and very comfortable (excellent beds) and they had lovely bathrooms with large walk-in showers. What’s more, the hotel had gone to great effort to acknowledge my Mother’s birthday, with decorations, cakes and Prosecco in the rooms. We were not expecting anything like this, so it was a lovely surprise. 

The doormen deserve a particular shout out, as they were always friendly and attentive throughout our stay, even helping us out with public transport advice to ensure we found the easiest routes to see the sights. The bus stop right outside the hotel was ideal for our trip to Kensington Palace.

I understand that the guest rooms are undergoing a refurbishment process, so perhaps if you are allocated an unrefurbished room your experience is rather different, but as far as we were concerned our stay at The Dilly was excellent.",5,2023,07,29
117,Lovely stay at The Dilly,"Chose this central located hotel for a trip to London to celebrate my son’s 18th & my 50th. In our room when we arrived were cakes, Prosecco, balloons & soft toys! Our room was lovely, breakfast had a good selection and the staff were very helpful & friendly. ",5,2023,07,29
117,Visit at the dilly,"Great location, great facility, extra ordinary service especially from the Selim Atias who took care for every request we had!
The breakfast was great and full, fully equipped Gym including a 25m indoor pool. 
My room was specious and had a very nice welcome gift.
You can tell the team is thinking about you.",5,2023,07,28
117,20th wedding anniversary stay in london,"Great stay in a great location, breakfast was the best I've ever had, this hotel made our 20th wedding anniversary truly memorable by decorating up our room ,I will  stay here again for sure.we had use of the pool and steam room,bedroom was massive along with the bed had such a good night's sleep I found nothing negative at all room was in excellent order as was the rest of the hotel,breakfast in the terrace had so much choice alot more than in other hotels I've been it's honestly worth the 5 stars I have given it",5,2023,07,27
117,Great hotel,"We had a great stay at The Dilly, it’s a beautiful hotel. The staff were amazing, really friendly and welcoming. On arrival we were given a little gift bag with some snacks. There is also a table with sweets, biscuits and water for guests to help themselves. 

We particularly enjoyed breakfast on the terrace. It is buffet style with lots of options to chose from, cooked to perfection and of great quality. 

We enjoyed the piano bar in the evening, again the staff were very welcoming. It was a lovely, relaxing atmosphere. 

Our room wasn’t as modern as you’d expect, particularly the bathroom. There aren’t enough extra plug sockets, had to unplug lamp for be able to charge phone. The bed was comfy enough, would be nice for extra pillows to be kept in the room. 

Overall we enjoyed our stay and would definitely book again.",4,2023,07,27
117,Great location and good value.,"Really good location with friendly welcoming staff. Good facilities in the hotel and really clean. Fabulous staff in the terrace bar and restaurant overlooking Piccadilly. Overall , good value for money. Would definitely recommend for a comfortable stay in the capital.",5,2023,07,26
117,The Dilly London,It was an amazing experience. Salim Atias made us feel at home and I never felt unsafe. I could not have asked for a better guest relations manager. Our stay would have not been as good without him! Love the Dilly!,5,2023,07,26
117,"One persons caring hospitality, made all the difference","My experience started off on the wrong foot. I was double charged and couldn’t reach out to the hotel because of time zones, open hours, and other factors. 
However, they rectified my card and also sent a bottle of Rose to the room. 

That was more than enough for me, however upon checking in Selim Atais, Guest Relations Manager, greeted us on at the desk, had our room ready earlier, and even gave me his information to help me make the best of my journey over. 

I have been in hospitality for 10+ years, I currently run cruise ships, so I understand guest recovery and how hard the service industry could be. Selim, not only became a friend, but I would gladly work for him. His attention to detail, caring personality, and dedication to my experience was unmatchable. 

We had a couple hiccups in the trip and Selim, fixed them, helped us find things to do in London, helped with Tube/train, even during the strike. I cannot say enough good things about him. 

If I come back to London, I originally chose the Dilly for the location (which is perfect, walkable to everything), but I would come back for Selim. ",5,2023,07,26
117,Fur Coat No Knickers,"This hotel epitomises the old adage ‘over promise and under deliver’- I have been fortunate enough to have been a guest in many of the world’s finest hotels and consequently I have experienced and expect, honest true service and luxury and I am prepared to pay accordingly. 
5* this most definitely is not. The Dilly makes all the right noises, the location is brilliant,  the lobby is impressive, but when you look past the ‘fur coat’, you get to the bare arsed truth. Rude staff, tired rooms and an executive lounge with not an ounce of personality, no staff and no alcohol! 
Shockingly - or not - the staff were indifferent and my group of friends experienced a catalogue of errors which were not rectified and we were actually made to feel like we were an inconvenience. My recommendation would be save your money and stay somewhere where the staff actually give a damn.",2,2023,07,25
117,"Great Central London Hotel, poor room decor.","The Dilly is a great centrally located hotel in London and has a superb restaurant. The staff were polite and courteous and did their best to help when asked. The problem is the rooms are not so good. 
We found a curtain detached from the curtain rail and were told that this would be rectified when we returned after a night out, it wasn't. We were asked if a new room would help so moved rooms after midnight, not ideal. The rooms had a lot of round pin plugs, why? Some plugs didn't work. The taps gave a weak stream of water both hot and cold and the TV didn't work properly. The rooms were spacious and the bed comfy but none of the furniture matched, it looked odd. Overall it was a bit disappointing, staff worked hard to help and did their best to help. Staff 4.5 stars, restaurant 4.5 stars and room less stars. Hotel rooms really needs an update.",3,2023,07,24
117,a great stay june 2023,"Myself my wife and daughter spent 16 nights here from june16th ..
room great , staff great ,breakfast great ,location great ,facilties great, whats not to like.Of course its expensive and its not a plush modern hotel,, but this is slap bang in the centre of town, we loved it!",4,2023,07,24
117,HORRIBLE SCAM - AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"Avoid at all costs. This hotel is A SCAM. It has literally NOTHING of a 5 star hotel. The room is dirty, small, the bathroom can barely fit one person. The furniture is disgusting. There is mold in the bathtub. 
They let everyone in the hotel and a crazy person managed to get into the elevator with me and threatened me. 
The safe broke down with my valuables inside and it took hours for them to come and open it.
I had specifically requested TWICE a double room, they had confirmed it in writing, I had doubled check two weeks before my arrival and they re-confirmed it: when I arrived they told me no double bed room was available. I showed all the email exchange and only after I shouted and asked to speak with the manager (who finally showed up) they gave me the room
(Which was unavailable according to them).
This hotel really was the worst experience of my life.",1,2023,07,22
117,Great  stay at the London dilly  hotel,We just visited the Dilly hotel in London and it was a great experience for me and for all my family . We arrived in order to do a family Bar Mizva tour and the dilly tured out to be the perfect choice Great location wonderfull rich breakfast super kind service and most of all may i say as a hotelier as well  a kind and very professional staff from the very pro concierge George that gave us the best advise regarding locations and restaurants to the reception that sent us in the middle of the night local electricity adopters and last not leats  the Pr Manger Celin that made sure we got our lost phone back after we left it on the Taxi . Bottom line we enjoyed every moment of our stay and got the best value for our money. ,5,2023,07,22
117,This is not your typical 4 star bland hotel. More 5 star in terms of  splendour excellent breakfast and helpful staff,"If you want a quirky hotel in terms of comfort, friendly helpful staff and excellent breakfast this is it. We were told at reception that the hotel was due for refurbishment  but we loved its tired splendour, from the chandeliers to the amazing swimming pool . 

Our room was not ready due to a maintenance issue so we were immediately upgraded to a wonderful junior suite. Selim Atias, the relations manager was most helpful throughout our stay. 
Although the garden restaurant was temporarily closed just for that day the carpeted restaurant on  the second floor was an acceptable substitute. Loads of free papers and I’m afraid the breakfast was too good as I kept going back for more. 
We had wanted a hotel close to the Royal Academy that had a swimming pool, that didn’t feel crowded and wouldn’t cost an arm and a leg. What we got exceeded our expectations and we will be back. ",5,2023,07,20
117,Good central location ,"The room was basic, okay as a base, could have been cleaned to a better standard.
There was an option to pay additional cost to include the use of the mezzanine area with unlimited drinks and afternoon snacks. Don't waste your money, it was poorly stocked and there was no attempt by the staff to look after this area.",4,2023,07,18
117,Wonderful hotel in the heart of London where staff goes out of their way to make your stay perfect!!!,"My husband and I, along with my son and 3 young grandchildren had the pleasure of staying at your awesome hotel!  We have been to London many times but first time at the Dilly.  From the moment of our arrival, everyone was wonderful.  DJ was the best.  Professional, friendly and went out of his way to make sure we had the best stay.  Rooms were large and so comfortable.  Buffet is beautiful.  Staff just couldn’t be nicer.  Location is perfect.  My family enjoyed staying here and will definitely be our new favorite hotel in London! ",5,2023,07,18
117,Excellent ,"Hotel in an excellent location, walking distance from all the main places. The service is amazing Salim Atias, the customer relations manager received us in a warm and cordial way. The hotel is clean, tidy, air-conditioned, with elevators and the highest level of service. We will get back to you soon! We have really enjoyed !",5,2023,07,18
117,Fair at best,"
My latest stay at the Dilly made me sad.  It is a wonderful location, and a grand stately old building with lots of potential.   The front staff was quick to assist and welcome very professional, but beyond this, the current management are poor custodians of this landmark property.   I appreciate old world charm, ill fittings windows, showers that you need to lean to use, etc. but this should not be an excuse for neglect.  Our room cried out for half a day with a qualified contractor, and cleaner.  Hot tap not functioning, artwork light slumped against art for want of an allen wrench, caulking hanging and discolored, tiles painted over by slapdash workmanship, no shower curtain when we arrived, peeling painted over wallpaper, etc. I let out flats to college students,  and I would never rent a unit with a tub that was that poorly cleaned.  True enameled cast iron like these can always be cleaned to a shine with an abrasive cleanser and a bit of elbow grease.  No excuse for a high end hotel in Central London to have gray tacky tubs floors sticky under foot.  There is needlessly little attention to the rooms, and I would challenge the owners to spend a night and see the customer facing experience of your product that could be easily addressed with just a day of work from a qualified contractor and some management attention.

117,Dilly  Hotel My home in London',"Excellent hotel, perfect location in the center of London, walking distance from all the recommended places.
I celebrated my wife's birthday and it was and was very perfect thanks to the help of customer relations manager Salim Atias who helped organize and made us feel at home during the entire vacation.",5,2023,07,17
117,Great stay and location - highly recommended,"Amazing customer service from the team, fantastic location and facilities. A special mention has to go to the Guest Relation Manager, Selim who was a fantastic host and looked after us for the duration of our stay.",5,2023,07,17
117,Weekend break in London,"Excellent location to explore London. Hotel very clean . Breakfast very good, although did not offer decaf coffee, but on the second day I was offered one from the bar. Staff very friendly and efficient, when next in London I will definitely stay there. Although I do see that prices have increased. ",5,2023,07,16
117,Don’t listen to the bad reviews this place is a really great find in the heart of Piccadilly ,"After reading the other trip advisor reviews we were a little concerned whether we had made the right choice , we actually called the hotel to see what they had to say and they reassured us to still come and see what we thought , 
It’s not a cheap hotel so obviously we wanted it to be of a good standard , I can honestly say we had no reason to worry , we were greeted by Abdul who gave us access to the mezzanine where we’re able to have snacks and drinks a lovely glass of chapel down rose to set us off , the room an executive King was ready early so we went to see what awaited us , the large room , clean the most comfy beds perfect , the only thing I would say (and I think it’s is where people are complaining) was the bathroom was a bit dated could do with modernising 
The hotel location was perfect for us as we went to see Les miserables a 5 minute walk a way and went to Heddon street Gordon Ramsay for food , Madhu’s dining in Dilly’s looked amazing though we would defo try this next time .
The breakfast served in the terrace was great , the staff coped well as it was really busy , the egg station you can order eggs but otherwise there’s a huge selection of pastries , fruit , yoghurts , meats cheese and a hot breakfast option 
For anyone considering this hotel I wouldn’t hesitate the building is amazing it has a huge pool , gym , spa downstairs which my son and husband are using as I type , all staff seemed super friendly and helpful , we would return x",5,2023,07,14
117,Excellent experience!,"The Hotel was beyond our expectations. Everything about the hotel was great, beautiful and clean room and perfect location just 2 minutes from picadilly station and close to tourist attractions. Awesome breakfast with lots of choices for adults and kids.
During our stay, i saw the manager Mr. Selim Atias walking around the hotel everyday and checking if everything is okay with every guest in the hotel. we enjoyed much our stay and will definitely come back...",5,2023,07,14
117,Selim Guest Relations,My experience was amazing and what stood out was the guest services. Selim was a superb help and executed and exceeded all levels of my expectations. Customer service was more than 5 stars!  Highly recommend staying at this hotel in London.,5,2023,07,12
117,Sadly disappointing,"We booked The Dilly as it was classed as 5 star and very well located in the centre of Picadilly.

We have stayed in hotels such as The Langham and The Grosvenor Hotel Park Lane and was looking forward to staying at a different establishment.

Unfortunately, the hotel was rather tired. The bedroom was clean, however lacking natural light due to black curtains, the lamps didn't work, and it was missing a bedside table. The bedding also felt rather damp. I had to place my water glass and book etc on the floor next to the bed as there was only one bedside table in the room.

We went to have a drink at The Terrace in the afternoon, it was very quiet and we were firmly told we were not allowed a drink as we hadn't made a booking? We said we were hotel guests but the gentlemen said we couldn't have a drink without a booking. We didn't argue, and went out to Marlybone instead.

At 9pm we returned to the hotel and tried The Terrace once more. We were lead onto the terrace outside area which was great, however no one ever came to take a drinks order. We had to go to the bar several times. Unfortunately the red wine was off. The service was too slow to mention this, so we went back to our room.

The hotel has a large amount of potential, with the location and the beauty of the actual building. The check in and welcome staff were lovely, however the bar staff didn't make us feel welcome which was sad. ",3,2023,07,10
117,More 3star than 5. ,"This hotel should not be rated 5star! Upon arrival we were greeted with smiles and the reception staff were very friendly.  It was my husbands birthday so we cheekily asked if there was an upgrade available. At first we were told no because they were at full capacity. Then after a few minutes we were told that yes, there was a  nicer room available. 
Well, if our room was a nicer room, I dread to think what our original room was like! 
The carpets were thinning, stained and dirty. The bathroom was filthy with mouldy tiles and the air on unit looked like it had been there since the 60’s. 
So we went back down to reception to complain. 
Once again the staff were friendly & helpful offering us access to the vip lounge while they sorted another room. 
Our 2nd ( or 3rd, however you want to look at it) room was much cleaner and better, but what we didn’t notice when we were shown the room was the noise. 
We returned about midnight after seeing a concert. And the noice of what we can only assume was a huge air con unit or extraction fan for the whole hotel was so loud I felt like I was sleeping in a jet engine! Luckily I was so tired I managed to fall asleep but had I not been that tired, there is no way I could have slept. And thank goodness I didn’t have my children as they certainly wouldn’t have. 
In general upon arrival it was very nice and staff were helpful and friendly, but I’ve stayed in nicer premier inns for half the price. 
",2,2023,07,09
117,"Great room, service and facilities","The guest relations team, specifically Selim, was extremely helpful, dilligient and went above and beyond to help me with my stay post my engagement. He decorated the room beautifully and provided me with additional services that made my stay wonderful. 5 stars for him.

The gym only has steam room and a pool but the facilities were nice. The executivee suite is a lovely room.

However it was extremely difficult to get hold of reception, the restaurant and the gym on their phone line. After a number of calls I still could not get through. Hence the lower rating.",4,2023,07,08
117,Not worth the 5 star price tag,Upon arrival we were greeted with a warm bar fridge and a cold shoulder. This being the warmest period in Londons history. So we requested ice to cool our drinks on 3 separate occasions which never arrived. The bathroom was grotty and the carpets worn threw. Overall not impressed. On the upside a great location plus pool/gym facilities. ,2,2023,07,06
117,Amazing Hotel & Staff. Special thanks to Selim Atias,An amazing hotel with an even more amazing staff. Mr. Selim Atias from Guest Relations listen to our family request as we look to surprise our son & graduating daughter In-Law at check-in. Mr. Atias took the extra steps and care to make sure that our son's  wife special graduation memory as well as their very delayed Covid wedding honeymoon trip became extra special. If you need to stay and ensure you have an amazing-memorable stay in London I suggest everyone to consider the Dilly London. The staff will for sure make it your home away from home. Thank you The Dilly Staff and specially Mr. Atias you are amazing.,5,2023,07,05
117,Horrible Avoid Like the Plague,"Avoid like the plague 

Reception unfriendly and seemed to not give a hoot about much, got to hotel early obviously couldn't check in but they ""said they would ring as soon as ready"" came back well after check in with still no call the response on why they didn't call was non existent.

Bell boy made me go and collect my own bags from the luggage room WTF??!!!  seriously he was more interested in joking with his work mates...

Room extremely dated and warn, chair all torn, aircon sounds like a jet engine, stairs everywhere including the hallways be ware if you are elderly..

Way better hotels in London, never again for myself our any of my 300+ staff.

117,A wonderful birthday stay!,"I wanted to write to say a huge Thank You for making our stay on Friday night so lovely.  I'm referring to the extra effort made for my partner's 50th birthday.  The room was amazing with a fabulous view.  The balloons, the wine, the chocolate cake, the Dilly teddy, the little birthday note and rose petals.    He really did appreciate that so very much.

The worst thing though is the staff. Appalling. They messed up our booking, did very little to fix it. Told us we could use the Executive Lounge (PS nothing executive about it), then said we couldn't, then we could. Some staff members were threatening and prejudice. Its was atrocious. Room service took 2 hours and was cold. Not enough towels. Smelly toilets and spa area.

117,"Nice, but definitely not 5 stars! Not even close!","Nice looking hotel in Piccadilly Circus. It’s walking distance to many tourist attractions. 
We had a junior suite, which was very spacious. It had two full bathrooms and a large sitting dining area with an oval dining table for six. 
Nice TVs with  Chromecast. 
It’s advertised as a 5 star hotel. That, it’s not! 
One of the lifts wouldn’t stop in the lobby, so you’d have to go to the lower floor and climb back up. Every time we asked the concierge for assistance, we were told that we’d have better chances doing it ourselves online! 
Our friends visited us and we went to the piano lounge. My friends ordered a screwdriver and a Pinot Noir, and they didn’t know how to make the first, and didn’t have the second! The telephones in the room didn’t work and they said they’d been having problems with their phones all week!!! There’s no minibar. 
The breakfast was pretty decent with a buffet and an omelette station. The employees don’t have any knowledge of the surrounding area.
For $500 a night, it’s not a bad deal for the area. We were expecting 5 star treatment, so we were a little disappointed.",2,2023,06,26

117,Terrible,"Having spent a couple of days in Abu Dhabi where the hotel was excellent, myself and family arrived at the Dilly in London - probably one of the worst hotels I have stayed in. Checking in was terrible- Saturday pm and only one person at the desk. The two rooms we stayed in (twin beds) were run down and small. Looked like a hostel. Spent 35 mins trying to get through to room service and front desk before phoning the hotel from my cell. Location- great- but hotel not.",1,2023,06,24

We were nervous after reading some of the reviews.

Our experience was very different and we couldn’t have been looked after better.
From check in with lovely friendly staff to our room all was great.
The kindness and generosity of the staff , 
especially Selim Atios , ( thank you Selim) made us feel very welcome.

Our splendid room ( booked through secret escapes) was perfect, clean and spacious. ( it had been refurbished) .
Breakfast on the terrace was abundant and excellent. 
Yes a bit chaotic but it was a busy time. There was plenty of everything.

Location also brilliant and if you don’t want to walk there are buses outside the door.
We will definitely return next trip to London",5,2023,06,22
117,Wonderful Family Hotel,I had booked this hotel last minute and wasn’t really sure what it would be like. But it was so much better then I expected the staff were so friendly and helpful from the moment we checked in the friendly reception staff Deejay made the stay by going the extra mile and acknowledging my daughter and making her stay really memorable.,5,2023,06,19
117,Refurb Desperately Needed,"Room was large, bed comfortable and clean. But the room and the bathroom in particular are in desperate need of a complete refurb. I found the bathroom to be small, grubby, and not even close to being fitting for a 5 star establishment. 

Breakfast was frustrating. There is no shortage of waiting staff which is usually a plus, but on this occasion it definitely wasn’t. I was a solo guest and every time I moved from my table to go to the buffet members of the waiting staff cleared my table and I had to keep asking for it to be reset. Coffee, toast, condiments, napkin and cutlery taken away every time. After the 3rd  time of this happening I gave up.  Not the best service.",3,2023,06,16

Mr. Selim's exceptional service and attention to detail made us feel right at home. The hotel's delightful breakfast offered a wide selection of high-quality dishes, ensuring a satisfying start to our days.

The hotel's central location was a major advantage, allowing us easy access to iconic landmarks and maximizing our time exploring the city.

We cannot recommend The Dilly Hotel enough. It truly stands out in London's hospitality scene.

117,Memorable stay,"We had an excellent one night stay at The Dilly to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary. We were so impressed by the hotel and all the friendly and efficient staff we met throughout our stay.
The team went to a lot of trouble to decorate our room and make our stay really memorable.
The Dilly's central location made it a great base for us to explore London. We will definitely go back.",5,2023,06,13
117,Amazing hotel in a fantastic location,"Fantastic hotel. Fantastic location. Literally a minutes walk from Piccadilly Circus.
Room was spotless and they went the extra mile for my husband’s 50th, decorating with balloons, rose petals, card, cake & wine. It was a lovely touch. The restaurant was fantastic and breakfast was great, lots of choice. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,06,12
117,Superb customer service!,"This hotel was an absolute gem of a find and the experience was superb. I had booked the hotel as a last-minute option for my hubby's 50th as we were seeing Phantom at His Majesty's Theatre.
On arrival, we were greeted by a lovely smiling receptionist and Selim Atias, the Senior Guest Relations Manager. Both were wonderfully friendly and once we'd introduced ourselves, Selim offered us an upgrade as a treat for hubby's bday. And what a treat it was. Gorgeous suite with fabulous decor and a bed to get lost in and the best pillows, plus, we had access to the guest lounge which made for the perfect pre-drinks theatre area.
Thank you, Selim. You really did look after us and we had the best stay in your beautiful hotel. We will be back!

117,Great location dog friendly hotel,"Great dog friendly hotel in a central location. Although dogs aren’t allowed everywhere in the hotel the reception staff and communal areas were very accommodating of my dog who is a very large breed (80kg Leonberger). Room was clean, staff were fab and I would definitely go back",5,2023,06,11
117,Perfect location a great stay ,"The hotel is in a perfect location right by Piccadilly Station. Very easy to get around London. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The hotel smells amazing when you walk in. We had breakfast which was really good. Lots of choice served in the beautiful Terrace. We used the pool, which was an added bonus. Our room was a twin in a quiet part of the hotel (room 811). Would definitely stay again if I get the chance. Couldn’t fault it. ",5,2023,06,11
117,A really lovely 5 day stay at The Dilly,"Our stay was lovely!

My husband and I really enjoyed our room, the breakfast in the Terrace and Paul the doorman during the week was absolutely fantastic.

His suggestions on what to see and where to shop were great and he made our stay even better. 

 All the staff were very helpful and the room was always clean. We really enjoyed our stay and the close proximately to everything!

Definitely 5 stars from us.",5,2023,06,11
117,Excellent experience 😊,"Chose The Dilly because of its great location, easy walking distance to so many sites, restaurants, shopping and of course pubs.

Another reason for the choice was the gym/pool, which was great to have, as it is very well equipped.

Met a few of the staff, including the guest relations manager Selim, who was very helpful and was nice enough to give me tour of the property including various rooms (it’s a big, historic property, with many room types) which will be nice to know for my next stay.

Would recommend and stay there again for sure 😊",5,2023,06,10
117,Old and tired 3* at best ,"Staff great —but the hotel very very disappointing never a 5* more 3*
The room was old and tired , cracked tile on bathroom floor also floor sticky , the plug in wash basin did not work tapes corroded , shower just a trickle of water.
Would I stay here again never would I recommend to a friend NO even a £100 a night is to much ",1,2023,06,09
117,It could never be a 5-star hotel,"I was really disappointed by this hotel…it could NEVER be a 5-star hotel.

The room was dirty and smelly and the bathroom was also dirty, nasty and very dated.
I couldn’t sleep well in the weekend with loud music from the bar and also other days with moaning noise from the next room.

This 5 star hotel made me a bad memories and ruined my trip after pandemic.
The Worst 5 star hotel ever.

If this is the standard of a 5-star Hotel in London, I would Never stay in London again!!!!
And I will never trust any travel website that gave this hotel a high rating.",1,2023,06,08
117,Mid week trip to central London to catch up with friends,"Booked last minute via Trip advisor this very central lovely friendly and most comfortable hotel. On arrival a cold drink of water and some cake during check in. Check-in took no time and once in the room it was so relaxing, clean and invitingly comfortable. Brilliant white soft sheets and pillows to relax on too. Later a lovely relaxing Pre dinner drinks in the ground bar. However unfortunately our friends had booked a restaurant close by. The atmosphere was lovely in the hotel and conscierge team very helpful and polite. I certain have to highly recommend this hotel for the discerning traveller as well priced, very good quality accommodation close to the theatres, art galleries  sight seeing locations and nightlife.",5,2023,06,07
117,Great experience at the Dilly hotel,"The hotel was great!   Room was big, clean and included cafe machine, Tee, bottle of water every day, refrigerator, and great view to the Big-Ben.    The location of the hotel is very good, close to many attractions and very close to the Underground.   Bus stop in front of the hotel.    Breakfast is something I would recommend to include in your stay as it was rich, staff was helpful and the view to the street was very nice.     We stayed for 4 nights, and Mr. Selim Atias from the hotel staff, was very helpful.     As far as I know some of the rooms in the hotel didn't go through renovation, so if you get one that didn't, try to ask for another one.",5,2023,06,07
117,The Dilly ,"The location of this hotel is perfect. Right on Piccadilly circus. The front desk is great specially Barkha. 
If anyone made our stay special in The Dilly is was Selim Atias... He made our booking , took special care during our stay in London.
Selim Atias gets 5* as the perfect relationship manager at The Dilly.
The only point they improve in room service. ",4,2023,06,05
117,Good Value Striving for a 5* Star Rating,"The Dilly is in an excellent location steps from the tube and within walking distance of most things. The staff are the friendliest we have ever encountered anywhere!
As soon as you walk into the foyer you can tell the hotel is really trying to live up to its rating however a few minor things are needed to make it a real 5*
The bedrooms need a bit more thought, light fixtures, chairs and a sticky desk that didn’t match the rest of the furniture just doesn’t cut it. The bathroom is terrible and really lets the whole place down. Rip it out and start again but keep the Floris toiletries! 
Breakfast was exceptional, honestly an amazing selection but perhaps a booking system for busy times would help to keep the service tip top.
Saying all this, the hotel offers good value for money when other 5* locations like The Savoy and Sofitel St James are double the price!  I would definitely stay here again when visiting London",4,2023,06,05
117,All is not well at the Dilly.,"In the Leisure Centre, the paintwork everywhere is dirty.
There was debris over the floor in the Ladies toilets, suggesting the floor had not even been swept for some days.
There was a disgusting smell coming from one of the toilets suggesting that someone had failed to flush some days ago and no cleaner had been in since.
Plenty of staff around not looking too busy.
Things are not right.",2,2023,06,03
117,Family 5 nights ,"Five night Family vacation in London, we stayed at the Dilly due to convenience and location to the main part of the city.

Bed and pillows are first class. 
Breakfast is perfect is a huge buffet, a man even stands up fleeing to cook you omelettes.
Service is responsive and courteous by all members of staff.
Hotel room was fine, nothing fancy but perfect acceptable pre refurbishment, 
Would definitely stay again. 
Have stayed in many London hotels and this was best IMO. ",5,2023,06,02
117,"Perfect Location, great hotel!","We stayed as a family over the Coronation weekend, it was perfect! From the ease at check-in, through the our departure. 
Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, the bed was enormous and very comfortable! 
The pool lovely, if a little on the chilly side, but perfect for relaxing after exploring all day! 
One of the highlights was the breakfast, exceptional- more or less, anything you could wish for! 

Nice touch with the complimentary bottle of wine on arrival- thank you, to All at The Dilly, we will be back, an absolutely PERFECT central location.",5,2023,06,02
117,A ‘Splendid’ Room?! I don’t think so…,"The hotel facilities and location are really good, that’s why it’s such a shame that the room lets it down so badly. 

The room was tired and badly in need of refurbishment. I could tolerate that if it seemed clean; this one did not. Describing a room as ‘splendid’ raises expectations and it didn’t come close to delivering - tired, dirty, rundown are all more fitting adjectives. 

The communal areas of the hotel were lovely and staff at check in and breakfast were great. The Terrace restaurant and bar was a lovely space and the breakfast selection was excellent. 

It is clear that the management have invested heavily in the restaurant/bar areas and these are excellent. I just hope they can bring the rooms up to the same standard.",2,2023,06,01
117,DISAPPOINTING ,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!! WAS HERE 2 DAYS AGO, AWFUL, DIRTY, MOULDY AND TIERED.
ENTRANCE STUNNING ANYTHING BEOND WAS A LET DOWN. HOW THIS IS RATED AS 5 ⭐️ IS BEYOND ME. THE FIRST TIME WE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE SEWER SMELL, THEY SENT HOUSE KEEPING TO SPRAY AIR FRESHENER. THE SECOND TIME WE COMPLAINED THEY SAID WE WILL MOVE YOU. WE PAID FOR A JUNIOR SUIT, THEY TRIED GETTING AWAY WITH MOVING US TO A STANDARD ROOM, NO OFFER OF A REFUND OR REDUCTION. I WENT TO LOOK AT THE ROOM AS I COULDN’T STAND THE SMELL ANY LONGER. WELL MOULD EVERYWHERE IN THE BATHROOM IT WAS ROUGH. THE STAFF ON THE EVENING WE COMPLAINED WAS RUDE  AND JUST WANTED TO SHUT US UP, BUT THE LADY ON RECEPTION IN THE MORNING WAS VERY HELPFUL. SHE SORTED US HALF REFUND FOR THE FIRST NIGHT AND FULL FOR THE SECOND NIGHT AS WE LEFT AND WILL NOT RETURN.
I THINK 4  ⭐️  HAVE DROPPED OFF SOMEWHERE ",1,2023,05,30
117,Very memorable stay,"Perfect place to stay! The hotel location is fantastic in the heart of London. The tube station is only 1 minute away. There are many restaurants and cafes around the hotel.  Staff was super helpful and friendly especially the manager Selim Atias is an asset for the hotel. Upon our arrival Selim met us at the entrance and escorted us to our room. He is very service orientated person and we mentioned him that we are celebrating our 35th wedding anniversary and in seconds we received bottle of champagne, cake and lovely note from him and we were blown away with his service.   Our room was quiet, and breakfasts were great too. We will be back!!!",5,2023,05,30
117,Shocked about the 5 star rating. ,"Stayed in a ‘splendid room’. Low end quality room. Old battered furniture. Carpets stained. Kettle wire was too short to plug into wall socket. I can see why the bathroom pictures are not on any of the sites. Appalling that this hotel has a five star rating. 
Location was very good. That’s all I enjoyed and couldn’t wait to leave ",1,2023,05,29

117,Service above expectations,"This is the third time during the year that we stay at the hotel.  and receive exceptional service, from Mr. Salim Atias, Guest Service Manager.  Salim makes sure to make our vacation enjoyable, handles every request with dedication... and every day is interested in whether we are satisfied with the hotel and the service.  The hotel is clean, excellent breakfast.  Spacious rooms, central location.  warmly recommended!  You don't have baskets",5,2023,05,29
117,Great stay,"Recently we stayed here for a few nights and really  enjoyed it. At the beginning we were worried about the reviews on TripAdvisor but in tge end we were glad that we booked this hotel. 
We received a great welcome from Selim Atias the Senior guest relations Manager, we were upgraded to a lovely junior suite and Selim.gave us the breakfast complementary because of my birthday and made my day. Selim did meet us every morning to make sure that we are enjoying our stay.
Also we received bottle of wine with yummy birthday cake in our room,  nice touch. The room was large, clean and bathroom spacious with a nice shower and nice toiletries! Bed really confi, AC worked well (this is very imp for us) Even.tho the room.was facing the street it was quiet at night. The pool clean, very enjoyable.
Great location, for the first time ever we didn't have to take the metro. This was our second time in London but we will make sure to book the Dilly hotel  next time again.
We will retun!",5,2023,05,28
117,BEST VENUE! EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS,"I have no words to express my happiness. My sisters wedding was made perfect by the help of Sara who was the best person to deal with during the stressful planning time. She was helpful, patience and understanding. The manager Kitti and Marian was so helpful on the day of the wedding. They looked after us like family. I would highly highly recommend the venue for wedding. The vibe of Piccadilly and The Dilly is extraordinary. Thank you so much for a memorable experience.",5,2023,05,26
117,Fabulous London Hotel.,"Great rooms, fabulous staff and service. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff. Breakfast was very good - quality of the food was excellent. Staff were very happy to keep our luggage until later that day. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. ",5,2023,05,26
117,Great centrally located hotel,"Stayed for a few days to visit Chelsea Flower Show and a few shows. Nice hotel - staff very attentive. Doorman Paul particularly very knowledgeable. Restaurant staff at breakfast were great and happy to help. Good breakfast selection with an egg station. 
Stayed in a superior room- needs a little tlc as some furniture worn and bathroom needed a refurbish however bed was comfy and clean.",4,2023,05,25
117,Excellent Choice,"Excellent location with great hosting at the heart of London, Picadilly.

117,Would definitely come here again!,"Excellent food, lovely service. Beautiful ascetics 

We very helpful staff, and werr able to cater to my nut allergy needs. Food was very flavoursome and reasonably priced. Would go again! Celebrated my best friend's birthday and they even came out with a birthday dessert for her!",4,2023,05,25
117,Disappointing,"Reception and staff couldn’t be faulted but room was so dated, pool area was found through dingy corridors reminiscent of a 1980s school basement.  Gym equipment good and pool itself looked ok.   I’m not a minimalist or expecting everything to be modern in a building of this age but furniture, carpets, etc are very  tired and we appeared to be squeezed into a converted corridor overlooking the restaurant counter. There are much better hotels for the same money, even in a similar  central location.",2,2023,05,23
117,5 Star? Depends on the room you get....,"We booked The Dilly in September last year (2022) for a birthday treat for myself and hubby this year. We saw it as we were walking along Piccadilly and managed to get a good advanced rate. 
Fast forward to May 2023 and expectations are high as it is billed as 5 star. 
the Foyer is stunning, modern and we were greeted by a very friendly lady who I think was called Assumpta. She asked how we were, why we were visiting and explained when breakfast was etc. 
We were given room 901 on the top floor. We had booked a 'Splendid City view' room which was to have views of London City. The room was kind of oval shaped and the windows can only be described as 'portholes' like on a boat and you had to bend down to see out of them. This we could cope with. What we couldn't cope with was the extremely large noise that sounded like and engine jet penetrating the walls, floor & ceiling. My husband switched the air con off and it was still just as bad. He called reception who sent up the maintenance man who told us 'that is the noise from the units on the roof and down the side of the building and that it wont go off at all. 
Being quite a light sleeper anyway, my husband went down to reception who arranged for us to see two other rooms. 
We chose room 814 which was not a city view room but was quiet so bonus. Other reviews have stated the room are tired and mis matched and I would agree. None of the furniture really matches and not in a quirky way either - just not thought out. Only sockets on one side of the bed and even then the socket does allow for example an IPhone plug to fit as there's not enough room between the cupboard and the plug for the wire to fit. 
On the side table, which has a kettle and coffee machine, they have rectified this by turning the sockets upside-down...
The toilet also had to 'pumped' at least 10 times to get it to flush. There was no working air con or working mini fridge in this room. 
After a day sightseeing we returned to find the TV would not work and upon further investigation none of the plug sockets would work at all. We worked out that the cleaner may have tripped the electric so called reception. They advised that we would have to move room AGAIN!
This time we were moved to a Junior suite room 716. This room was lovely and had working air con and a flushing toilet - shame we only had it for one night. After a night at the theatre we returned to a bottle of wine and a card in the room from Assumpta wishing me a happy birthday which was a nice touch. 
With regards to breakfast - first day we went at 9:30 am and it was bedlam - very noisy, people everywhere getting food and whilst the piano player is a nice touch, it just makes it even noisier as people talk over it. Much quieter on the second day at 8;30. A good selection of food but one downside was no tea! only a coffee machine and no sign of tea anywhere and they also weren't offered when the buffet was explained. 
So overall the staff were friendly and helpful but surely you shouldn't have to go through three  room changes at a 5 star hotel?!
From other reviews it seems that you either get a great room or a below average room and this is why the reviews are so up and down for this place. 
Location is great but we will not return. The manager needs to address the maintenance issues and also the reviews on here ",2,2023,05,22
117,Great location,"Great location to walk 
Hotel is a 3+ 4 star not a 5 star 
Evening / Night front staff are not the most helpful.
Concierge need improving . 
But there were two lovely gents doing the day the was very helpful
Great area to walk to the shows the tub/ underground subway is a 2 min walk .",4,2023,05,22
117,"Great location, Tiny Box room. “All frills, no knickers”","Fantastic location and lovely hotel. However one important thing. The actual hotel room was so small it was claustrophobic. Literally wardrobe door hit into the bed, no room for drawers to put things in. Very rare I moan but it was tiny and we were there for a long weekend. So I advise getting an upgrade to a bigger room if you can afford it. ",2,2023,05,22
117,Disappointing! Had such high hopes for such a gorgeous place but it’s drab sadly.,"Disappointing for such a beautiful building. We had afternoon tea here. Had high hopes because of the location and setting, but was left really hungry and it didn’t my expectations for £67! 

The sandwiches ( all four fingers ) were tasty, but the rose champagne was average, not cold enough the tea was too strong and cold the scones were rock hard and doughy and the other biscuits and cake were awful.

I didn’t bother complaining because the service from staff was nonexistent and my friend was too embarrassed and uncomfortable with me doing so, so I didn’t want to ruin our day together. 

For £67 it’s got to be more than ok. The building itself is gorgeous but it feels drab inside and in need of a revamp. The staff need to up their game too. However we had wonderful cocktails in the downstairs bar.",2,2023,05,21
117,Just plain okay. ,"This is a five star hotel or at least it says that but it isn't really I'm afraid!
We got a good deal but the normal rate.... 
There was noise outside the room with some sort of air con fan or kitchen extractor fan, I got told ""management would be informed"". 

The staff generally were okay. I requested some milk though for the room when we came back from our evening out only to have to ask three separate people if I could have some. The final guy took some convincing to give me some- not like I'm asking for a free gourmet steak guys, just a small cup of milk!!

The breakfast was average. I've had better quality bacon and sausages in spoons... 
It was a nice room aside from the noise. The paint decor is a little odd and attracts dust or shows up the lack of cleaning, I think they need to replace their designer!

The doorman was amazing and a great guy.  The Breakfast guy was super as well. 

We come to London fairly often for theatre and other stuff. Its a good location, but I think we'll be looking elsewhere for our next stay I'm sorry to say. I did feedback some of this but have had no reply so far.

117,Piccadilly Pitstop,"Just a couple of details missing at The Dilly.

We popped into The Dilly for a pot of tea and a coffee to take a break from the hustle and bustle of Piccadilly Circus. 

The decor in the bar is lovely and the chair set up for the perfect Insta picture will appeal to a younger audience.

We enjoyed a very welcome pit stop. However we were disappointed with the waitress who was sitting at the welcome desk, constantly on her charging phone. Sadly tables were not cleared when customers left and most disappointedly she could not have been more disinterested when we asked for the bill.",4,2023,05,19
117,Horrible experience with the team of dilly absolutely arogant,The most horrible hospitality and service by the team and staff of dilly. Specially the lady duty manager named Agnese she did not have the basic curtseys.room are badly kept with mites all over. They do not even provide you with adequate amount of drinking water.,1,2023,05,18
117,Gem in Central London,"With competition fierce in Central London for quality hotels, our experience thoroughly deserves 5 stars.
Position is simply brilliant. We never used public transport once during our stay, from Covent Garden to Buckingham Palace, Theatres and quality restaurants, we were never more than 20 minutes walk away.
The hotel itself was brilliant,  room very good, breakfast outstanding served in conservatory with the lovely background of a piano being played. However what stood out for us was the staff, they were simply brilliant,  very helpful,  very friendly,  and made us feel so welcome.
If you are looking for stuffed shirts and formality this is not for you. If you are looking for professional caring helpful staff then I highly recommend giving this hotel a try.
Well done to all concerned. We will be back!",5,2023,05,18
117,Brilliant Hotel & Location ,"Stayed here as was going to the theatre which a a very short walk away. Hotel extremely accommodating, from reception, concierge to guest services. They knew was our anniversary and put a bottle of champagne in our room , chocolates, flower petals and a card , very nice thing to do. Piano bar really lovely and relaxing. Breakfast was amazing, fresh and good quality products, lots on offer . We could not fault one thing here , will go again and do recommend ",5,2023,05,18
117,Very tired and disappointing,"The location, foyer and bar were amazing but sadly the rooms were very tired and dated.  The furniture was dented and mismatched. The the bathroom was shocking and the curtain didn’t even reach the top of the bath.  Shaver mirror positioned very low.  For a 5 star hotel it was shoddy.  Also the room was ridiculously hot with no thermostat or control",2,2023,05,17
117,Stunning hotel in the centre of the action,"Wonderful stay at a beautiful, centrally located hotel right in the centre of everything. We enjoyed the pool and steam room very much especially as we had the whole place to ourselves.
Breakfast was a joy with fresh fruit in abundance and the wonderful tinkering of a piano.
Amazing vegan cooked breakfast prepared to order. We will definitely be back!",5,2023,05,09
117,Terrific location comfy bed great value.,"The Dilly has a fantastic location-right near Picadilly Square, St James, Buckingham Palace, Mayfair, Green Park Tube etc.  Lobby is hip/cool space.  Room was large by London standards. At first glance room/bathroom were 'tired' and wood furniture was old, however the AC worked great, the bed (mattress and duvet) was amongst the most comfortable I've ever had in a hotel, TV easy to use, good pillows, huge fluffy towels, good robes water in room, cookies, and turndown service with chocolates at night.  Hot water took a while to come up but its there!  Location close to Pret and Boots for conveniences.  Multiple tube and bus stops right there.  Highly recommend for city break.",4,2023,05,09
117,Fantastic,Stayed at the Dilly may 2nd -5th 2023 absolutely fabulous the service from Lisa on reception to Nora at breakfast could not do enough for my Husband & myself we said we were staying for our Anniversary cake and wine arrived in our room 728 James GM was so helpful also nothing to much trouble!!! We will definitely will be returning thanks again from Jackie & Paul . ,5,2023,05,08
117,Kings Coronation stay,"This is going to be a 100% honest review. 
We went for the Kings Coronation. So was expecting to pay a little bit more. We originally booked the Waldorf Hilton, but swapped at last minute as this came up cheaper. Next time I will stay at the Waldorf. 

First impression was wow!! Perfect location, just down from Fortnum and Mason. Next to Piccadilly Circus and 10 minutes walk to Trafalgar Square. Brilliant for location.

Reception area - smells amazing - I think it’s Jo Malone perfume they use. The entrance was lovely and we were greeted with a glass of champagne. We were given an upgrade from a lovely man on reception and he gave myself and my daughter some souvenirs. Which was so lovely. His service was impeccable and  I was very impressed. 

The lifts are operated with your key card. We got stuck in one for a few minutes and I felt panicked. Because we didn’t know you had to tap the card inside. 

The room and view on 8th floor were great. But after a while I noticed a lot of things are tired and definitely not 5 star. Windows there were gaps and paint peeling. The shower was  huge but no bath. The shower although powerful was just on a hose. I was expecting a rain shower or something a bit more classy. The bathroom door, when you opened it, it would swing back and hit the wall loudly. Bit annoying during the night. No mini bar at all in the room. No Wi-Fi or information for the code etc anywhere. No information pack just a room service menu.Nepresso coffee machine was great and plenty selection of tea and milk. I felt a bit isolated without an information pack. Or being able to get hold of front desk.We didn’t have breakfast as we went earlier to the kings coronation.

Some of the staff were amazing and very helpful. But two Asian men who were on reception at 6.45am on the 6th May. We’re not helpful and one of them didn’t even acknowledge me when I asked him a direction. He was straightening his tie and answered me sideways. Very rude. The other one took my payment and when I enquired about keeping the room he said I think it’s £50 an hour. He just plugged a figure. I new this wasn’t true as other hotels have let me keep the room for four hours for £30. They brought the hotel down to 0 stars with their attitude. Girl in the terrace restaurant had no clue that mocktails were even on the menu, although she was nice but seemed lost. I witness room service being taken on trolleys into the lift with no covers on the food. From the terrace restaurant.

The pool was cold and the showers roasting hot that burnt my skin so I couldn’t shower my child. Plus customers had just left towels on benches. Very grubby in the corridors down there definitely needs painting. 

Overall - view and location brilliant.
Staff - majority were nice, down to earth and helpful, unfortunately let down by the two Asian men in the morning.
Reception, restaurants and hallways, nice. But tired in the rooms and bathrooms. 
My overall experience was good but staff training in the restaurant needs looking at. The girl said they had stopped afternoon tea, when they hadn’t, she didn’t know mocktails were on the menu and generally seemed lost. 

I was expecting a lot more for a five star. Having stayed in five star hotels in the past. There is nothing really five star about this hotel other than the location. It’s more a four star to be honest. But overall it was nice. ",3,2023,05,08
117,It's great to be back!,"It's been a while, since we were able to stay at the Dilly, now under new ownership. I am glad, plenty of staff we know is still around. 
This hotel is simply fantastic because of its location and I really enjoy the lounge (worth the upgrade!) The pool is amazing, sipping champagne on the terrace in the sun is pretty rare in London city hotels. And even if some of the room are a bit outdated, this is the charm of London historical hotels... We do love our library suite! ",5,2023,05,07
117,Hovel,"The WORST hotel we have ever had the displeasure of staying in.  Absolutely NOT child friendly in the slightest.  Terrace bar which is allegedly family friendly is shut, the only vaguely nice bar doesn’t allow children after 9pm, and the bar which they suggest is family friendly after 9pm is full of rowdy men that have wet themselves.  Rooms are dated, bathrooms are disgusting.  WiFi is non existent.  If you complain and ask for a manager you are told that’s not available.  Do not waste your money on this hovel.",1,2023,05,06
117,Amazing hotel,"I Took my parents for a overnight stay at the Dilly on Piccadilly and was very happy with my choice, the location was excellent, the staff were amazing, the hotel was lovely, the bedroom was very spacious and very well presented. I will most definitely return",5,2023,05,05
117,Amazing from start to finish!,"My Mother and I first saw The Dilly back in December, greeted by the fabulous concierge, Paul and also James, The General Manager. We couldn’t wait to one day stay here. 

I decided to organise it as a Birthday Treat for my Mum, Matthew in reservations was at hand for every request and every email I sent across! Very easy to chat to, very responsive and help me book in with ease! I’d mentioned to Matthew about it being for my Mother’s birthday and not long after booking the wonderful Guest Relations Manager, John contacted me. He asked me what we were planning, what my Mum liked and stayed in contact with my throughout the upcoming weeks to my reservation. One of our dinner reservations cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances and he even spoke to the Head Concierge to sort another reservation out prior to our show! Upon arrival I met John, who wished my Mum a happy birthday straight away and upon entering the room - both of us were amazed! Balloons everything and a special Happy Birthday to my Mum. He went truly above and beyond to ensure our stay was great! 

The beds are so comfortable, I had a very good night sleep - our room was near the lift too yet there was no noise! Inside the hotel or out.

Breakfast was lovely, a live piano planner and Laura I believe? Took us through everything and to our table. There’s also a pancake machine, which I was extremely impressed with! Laura and the lady with red curly hair, remembered us both times and the lady with the red hair even remembered I had a hot chocolate! This made me feel so special.

It’s also worth a big mention we saw James, the General Manager upon check in, then again in breakfast - each day. I found it amazing that every single time he greeted us like it was the first time he’d seen us. It’s taking the hotel to the next level.

Finally, the lovely doorman Paul - he was knowledgable, and told us absolutely everything we needed to know about London and how to get about. Whenever we saw him, he was always chatting to someone new. The perfect gentleman to have on the door.

Thank you all for making my stay an amazing one, I will certainly remember it and I recommend the hotel to anyone!",5,2023,05,03
117,Great location- service very ordinary,"The Dilly is a hotel in the best location, rooms are ok, a little tired but ok! The room service however leaves a little to be desired! All phone calls to reception takes ages, regularly ringing out! Whether it’s for the restaurant or room service the phone takes ages to be answered!",3,2023,05,02
117,Great hotel in ideal location ,"Really enjoyed our recent stay at The Dilly. On arrival, we were greeted very warmly by Paul the doorman; if you need directions, or advice on transport, or ideas on what to  do during your stay, Paul is your man!

Check-in was smooth, and our Splendid room (104) was great; spacious, with a modern bathroom, and a brill view of Piccadilly. Despite being only one floor up, the room was so quiet. The bed was super comfy, everything seemed of good quality, and we can't fault it at all. 

Breakfast had so much choice, and everything we had was good. The one blight on our breakfast experience was the  egg cook, who was quite grumpy over both days, rarely mustered a smile or hello, and who seemed offended if he saw you more than once per sitting. He was quite confrontational to my husband, repeatedly questioning if he had not already ordered an omelette, when he went to order some eggs for me. Maybe this cook would rather not be customer-facing?

Otherwise the rest of the staff were polite and friendly, and they were happy to take delivery of a few things for us while we were out. We also left our luggage with Reception for a while after check-out, which we were very grateful for as it allowed us to sightsee a little longer before going home.

The piano bar has some lovely Art Deco accents, with good drinks, good service and live music, so that is worth a visit too. Lastly, the location is superb, with places of interest either walkable, or on the tube or buses that are right outside. 

We highly recommend The Dilly and would happily stay here again on our next visit.

117,"Pre covid this was Le Meridian Hotel but it closed down, sold, completely refurbished and relaunched as The Dilly ! It's FAB.",Completely refurbished a couple of years ago and re opened as The Dilly. Hotel is in a great central position on Picadilly. It is a luxury Hotel. Rooms are very comfortable and have lovely decor. Shower was excellent. Staff were efficient and very courteous in all ares.,5,2023,05,01
117,Avoid - run down and a rip off!,"When I booked a 5 star hotel in Mayfair I had high expectations, but I would have been disappointed if this was a holiday inn or travel lodge. 

I had also opted to upgrade for a splendid room and was greeted with far from anything splendid. From stained carpets, dirty surfaces and outdated and worn out facilities it is a disgrace that you can sell this as a 5 star. 

I had booked the hotel after eating in Madhus last year as the reception looked stunning and I thought if the restaurant was that nice so would the hotel be. 

With numerous hen parties checking in we were left to wait a significant amount of time to check in and without acknowledgement. We also experienced rude staff when trying to get into our room as we were checking out as my partner had forgotten something and was refused access.

This was a special occasion and it was totally ruined. 

Place is completely worn down and totally living off of its location! Utterly shameful to charge people for this hotel as a 5star - rooms are more like a 3 at a push! 

Avoid!

117,Great stay in the heart of everything!,"My husband and I just spent four nights at The Dilly. The hotel is in a prime location…Piccadilly…city center so it was convenient to everything. Our room was comfortable and well appointed. Our daily breakfast in The Terrace was very good and offered a full menu of choices. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by the doorman, Paul, and immediately felt welcomed and at home. Paul continued to assist us daily with information, directions, cabs, and just nice conversation. He is an asset to this establishment. We also visited the piano bar our last night there for a relaxing bit of wine. The only criticism is that we had some difficulty with getting room service and I’m old school and wish hotels still used top sheets on their beds. It was a great stay and highly recommend.

117,Disappointed...,"The Dilly was a one night birthday treat and not cheap, as it is 5*. In ambience I would give it 4*, but in terms of our room none! It looked fine, except for a rather tired bathroom, but when we went to bed we realised the air conditioning didn't work and we were too  mega hot to sleep all night. We made several attempts to call the front desk for lengthy periods of time, but they just didn't answer. I reported it the next morning, but was basically told 'oh dear'.  However, the breakfast staff were brilliant, as was the breakfast. The staff were so hard working and couldn't do enough to be helpful. Maybe the hotel should take advice from them!",3,2023,04,28

117,Amazing cream tea/high tea experience!!,"Unforgettable experience!!!!! We were looking for a place to have some cream tea during our last day in London. We walked past the Dilly and decided to take a peak. The manager James Oliver was extremely attentive and kind. He brought us to the terrace which had a great outdoor patio with a view of Piccadilly street. We had an array of scones, tea, and champagne from Kent. We also had the pleasure of indulging in some desserts shaped like London landmarks such as the Big Ben, the underground sign and the famous red telephone booth. It was an absolute dream come true!! Also, our waitress Aulona provided exceptional service. Thank you James and Aulona! We look forward to returning to the Dilly!  ",5,2023,04,26

Especially the breakfast lounge has serious ventilation problem. But staff were always helpful, even they offer prosecco while we were looking a table in breakfast lounge.",4,2023,04,26
117,Down to do London Marathon ,"The hotel reception are absolutely brilliant such a warm welcome, polite and happy to help.  Rooms are very clean and comfortable.
 The only bit that lets it down is “The Terrace” which is restaurant on 2nd Floor.
I walked over to area where cook was cooking eggs and asked if they did poached eggs and answer was “Good Morning “ I said Good Morning in return and asked the same question again and was told to ask a waiter.  
I asked a waitress and she answered I will get somebody for you.  
I waited and nobody came.  When a waitress came to clear the table I asked her and got them right away.

The next day the coffee machine stopped working and the same member of staff went to fix me and told me to go to bar.
I stood at the bar waiting while a member of staff  played with her phone ignoring me completely.  
Another member of staff welcomed in other guests and then came to me, I explained to her what had happened and she said “Wait till the bar opens”. I said no and when returning to my table I noticed the coffee machine was now working.
On both of these occasions it was same member of staff who I spoke to first.

Literally couldn’t have been any better. The rooms were spacious and comfortable, and the team went out of their way to make us all feel so welcome. There is a stunning Indian Restaurant on the ground floor which is fantastic for dinner. Breakfast in The Terrace was great with a fantastic selection of items including a live Chef station cooking eggs to order. There’s a beautiful pool too.

We booked a room for 2 adults and one child and our booking was confirmed both by booking.com and hotel. Upon my arrival we were given a room for double occupancy by Victor at the reception. So we had to came down to reception and we asked for additional bed for my son but we were told the extra beds are subject to hotel availability??? and they were not able to provide me additional bed for my son which turns my first impression into nightmare. While I was looking for my hotel confirmation the manager Selim randomly approached to me in the lobby. He went above and beyond and provided me the room that I should be receiving at the first place. He managed to turn the nightmare experience into very memorable one in seconds. Selim didn’t stop there and included the breakfast for my entire stay and in seconds we received wine and chocolates with fresh fruits in our room with an apology note from him. Every morning he met us at the t",5,2023,04,17

117,Wonderful,"We were greeted by a friendly doorman and lots of smiling staff, with a beautifully decorated reception area. We were able to check in early and were very impressed with our room. We were on the 7th floor which had great views, room was impeccably clean with everything needed for a great stay.

We were here for my partners birthday and on returning to the room after dinner out, we’re greeted with a bottle of bubbly and tray of delicious treats. Along with balloons and a card…it was such a lovely touch.

Breakfast was buffet style but plenty of choice for everyone. Hot breakfast items and an egg station for fresh eggs. Pastries, juices, cereal and it was all very nice.

We had a late check out which was perfect way to start our day. The location is fab.

The staff were incredible…everyone we met greeted us with a smile and they couldn’t do enough for us.

We would definitely stay again and thoroughly recommend.

Thank you!",5,2023,04,06
117,What a wonderful stay,"Where to start?
We were welcomed at the entrance by a lovely doorman who greeted us warmly. We were early to check in so we placed our bags in holding with the concierge team whilst we went to explore Chinatown. The hotel reception called us once our room was ready about an hour later. We returned to the hotel, checked in smoothly and made our way up to room 904 which was on the top floor. The room was extremely spacious with a walk in closet, very clean and had everything you needed for a stay in London. Our bags were brought up to our room which was a lovely little touch. The bed was very comfy, crisp clean sheets and two pillows each, both of which made a peaceful night's sleep. The only slight downfall to the room was you could hear the room next doors air con and when yours wasn't on you could hear it dripping, but definitely not a big deal, having the TV on will drown out the drips. There are robes, slippers, hairdryer, tea/coffee/hot chocolate all complimentary. We were pleasantly surprised when there was a knock at the door....a member of staff had brought up a bottle of champagne and some macarons. We were shocked! But incredibly greatful of the gesture. 
Bathroom was a great size, large shower and towel rail holders.
Breakfast was delicious, a great variety of hot food for an English Breakfast, cakes, pastries, cheeses and lots of different breads to choose from. Hot drinks like teas, cappuccinos and lattes were offered once you had taken a seat and cold drinks/juices were help yourself. All the staff working in the Terrace Bar were really attentive even at busy times.
We used the pool, gym and steam room. The gym has all equipment needed and a cold water machine. We were the only 2 in the pool when we went to use it which was great. Pool temperature was nice, not too cold. All areas were very clean and tidy, staff were always willing to help where needed.
We didn't eat in the restaurant but we did visit the Piano Bar (Downstairs at The Dilly - this is open I think, Wednesday - Sunday 6pm-12am) offering a variety of cocktails and alcoholic drinks. We were there as a couple, however there was a huge party of around 20+ people having late night drinks. The lady who served us was warm and welcoming and made sure to check on us with the group been loud. The atmosphere was romantic and chilled with a live piano player.

The location of The Dilly is perfect if you want to be in the middle of everything. Very short walk to Oxford Street/Regent Street/Leicester Square/Buckingham Palace/Green Park/Chinatown. The tube is a 1 minute walk away. We walked to Borough Market which took about 50 minutes as the sun was shining and it was a pleasant walk. Tube takes 13 minutes.

I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone who is looking to stay in London. A huge thank you to each and every hotel staff member for making our stay memorable. 

We will be back to stay again.",5,2023,04,06
117,Family Trip to the Dilly,The hotel was amazing - beautifully presented and we were made to feel very special and looked after. If you would like good views request room 609 - we could see most of the London landmarks from this from. Unfortunately the service was slow in the terrace and it was not busy at the time and then our order arrived incomplete meaning we could not eat together. They did bring the missing items however it was too late and spoilt the meal - we were not charged for the items. The actual restaurant was lovely and the food we did have was very nice - just unfortunate that the order was not complete. Overall our stay was magical and would deffo return - such a great location and a comfortable hotel! ,5,2023,04,05

Breakfast selection and service really good. Will definitely return here when next coming to London. The hotel is well situated. ",4,2023,04,03
117,Massive let down on every level,"Where to start: a real let down from start to finish. Firstly, the rooms are nothing at all like the gorgeous ones on the website. At all! Mine was dark and tiny. Old furnishings. Broken lamp. Decor had definitely seen better days. Basic and old-fashioned bath-shower. Small window in the room, no natural-light so it was dark all the time. Noise of the fan directly outside 24/7.  Remote control missing from the room - asked for one, it never arrived, so I had to go to the front desk in my dressing gown to collect. Then it turned out the TV in my room didn't work anyway (which is I'm guessing why they took the remote). The front desk never answered the phone internally (I had to ring the main hotel number from my mobile). Lift was broken. Ignored my texted room service order - when I called instead (at 11:35pm), I was told it was closed and I couldn't order anything. When l I pointed out that the literature in the room had dishes on that could be ordered 24 hours, they sighed and said fine, I could order something. Cleaning closet directly outside, so the door opened and banged shut every ten minutes. When I complained about everything, the hotel covered my sandwich and beer....This is a three-star hotel at the very best. The location is great, but that's about it.",2,2023,04,03
117,Fantastic Hotel,Had great stay. Fabulous hotel and Madhus Indian meal amazing. Will be going back soon for another break. Breakfast great and pool lovely for early morning dip. All the staff helpful and best earl grey teabags in the room. Thank you Dilly,5,2023,04,02
117,£100 for cold room service food,"My wife and I chose this hotel to meet up after travel apart and to have a nice romantic dinner before a series of work events.  We were not told that the Terrace restaurant was closed for a special event that night.  With no time to try and find a nearby nice restaurant with availability (and no one at Guest Relations or the Front Desk answering their phone) we had to use text to order room service (they also would not answer their phone).  We were told it would take 25 minutes (good service) when it really took 45 minutes.  The food came on a tray, not a trolley and there was no table in the room.  Improvise a table out of a dining board, serve the food and find out it is cold.  Some romantic evening - £100 for a cold dinner served on a dining board.  If the food would have been at least warm it would be a funny story but this was incredibly poor service for a hotel of this caliber.  ",1,2023,03,29
117,Dont trust the check in staff at the Dilly,"they take £100 deposit then dont refund you and dont tell you they havent refunded it, you then after to check your account and wait up to 5 working days to get you money back 

what a scam - I wouldnt have expected this of an hotel of this level",1,2023,03,29
117,Poor experience,"Poor service, staff unfriendly. Food lacking. Only one working lift all weekend and rooms to hot air con only blew out hot air. Never a 5 star hotel.I would rate this hotel 3 star at best. Only the location was good.  ",2,2023,03,28
117,Excellent Hotel with just minor bumps,"Excellent location, and charming and solid as an old English castle. 

Meaning also having all the quirks as old castles do. Dont expect it to be a top-notch fresh modern Hotel with everything in perfect condition.",4,2023,03,28
117,Extremely disappointing,"On arrival my sister and I were told our room with a double bed was ready, we had to ask if there was a twin, there was but not ready which was fine as we were early. We went to the terrace for a cocktail, left waiting for ages so we left. On the way out we asked the doorman for directions to Piccadilly Theatre he offered to google (surely that should be known) We returned on a high as the show was amazing, but sadly the mood rapidly declined. I have never stayed in a 5-star so was buzzing having seen the website. It was taken over 2 years ago! On arrival to our twin room, we discovered an air conditioning unit next to one of the beds ""dirty"", heavily soiled carpets, moldy bathroom sealant, broken wall plaques, and to top it all an extremely dusty picture frame. We spoke to the duty manager who then offered a larger room with a double and another bed...... a sofa bed in a separate area (This was a suite???) we declined and requested another ""clean twin"" which we were eventually given. Having wasted over an hour of our one-night stay in London we then asked what he intended to do about it. Suffice it to say I haven't enough time to repeat the conversation, it was simply a complete lack of interest or empathy, he felt giving us a free breakfast £20 each, and an alternative room was sufficient. We asked for 50% off he offered 30% which we had in free drinks (3 x each) This was a £320 (originally £380) per night room 5 star. We also questioned why one of the main lifts wasn't working, he responded ""It is, who told you that? "" we said a member of your staff!! Clearly, they have painted but not replaced carpets, the furniture is very old-fashioned and the mini bars are only filled on request. My final gripe is holding a £50 damage deposit which I am still waiting to be refunded. If this is an example of a 5-star London Hotel I shall never entertain one.",1,2023,03,28
117,Overnight Stay,"Might seem like a weird place to start but the reception smelt lovely!
Lovely, stylist hotel. Friendly staff and facilities. Would definitely stay again and make more of the facilities next time - we stayed for B&B only and didn’t have time to use the pool or the restaurant. The piano bar was a nice spot to finish our evening at the theatre too. Not the cheapest place to stay but I’m a firm believer that you get what you pay for. For a treat or a special occasion that’s just minutes from the theatres in London, it’s an excellent choice.",5,2023,03,27
117,Worth a visit ,"I really like this place. Very friendly staff and very accomodating. very comfortable rooms and bar area. Shame we could not try the restaurant. Although a bit tired in areas. Bar was super and cocktails great too. 
Highly recommended. ",4,2023,03,27
117,"Loved it, will definitely go back","Perfect location for our birthday theatre trip. Staff friendly & helpful, standard room large & immaculately clean. Bed so comfy!! Breakfast lovely, loads of choice & really enjoyed the pianist . Wish we’d had chance to eat in the restaurant & use the leisure facilities. ",5,2023,03,27
117,Dilly Dally,"Enjoyable short break at a great hotel, ideally located next to Piccadilly Circus. Staff very friendly and welcoming. Rooms a good size and very clean. The secondary double glazing didn't shut properly, so road noise probably contributed to a disturbed night's sleep. Rooms might benefit from a bit of modernisation, but overall I was very impressed.",4,2023,03,27
117,Thanks for the Upgrades!,"We booked this hotel for a work event and it was fantastic! ""DJ"" on the front desk very kindly upgraded us to a 7th floor room with the most amazing views over to Westminster and Big Ben.  I half expected Mary Poppins or Peter Pan to go flying by.  The location is superb for getting around central London, with Piccadilly, Regent Street and Leicester Square on your doorstep.

The room and bathroom were huge. My only small complaint was that our room had a broken outside window and the wind howled in. If I were paying full whack, I would want this fixed.  

The gym and indoor pool downstairs were excellent, albeit a little chilly (not surprised with energy costs).  We really loved having a little swim.

We were also lucky enough to have a complimentary breakfast too. The surroundings and choice of food on offer were quite overwhelming. My omelette was cooked to perfection. All of the staff we came into contact with were really lovely.

We will return!",5,2023,03,26
117,One night at the Dilly,"Exceptional location, good service. Old fixtures. Shower not working. No minibar. Room service not responding, ever…stains on carpet. Elevators always busy. Impossible to open the window. Ventilation in the room quite noisy. What a pity!",3,2023,03,25
117,"location, location","the dilly is perfectly situated, for getting out and about, off at kings cross, about 2 minute walk, onto the underground piccadilly line, to piccadilly circus, and another 2 minutes walk to hotel, the hotel looks grand, but on closer inspection, carpets are worn, things need replacing and modernising. but i would come and stay again, because of where its situated and the splendid room was roomy and very comfortable, occasional sounds from out side as ppl pass, but nothing that i would class as a disturbance. ",4,2023,03,24
117,Great hotel great location,Upon arrival we was early so they upgraded our room too a suite which was available immediately we was delighted by this the room was fabulous beds comfy hotel is beautiful the staff was friendly the location is superb too we loved it that much we our already planning our next trip too the Dilly ,5,2023,03,24
117,Not a 5 star hotel,If this hotel is a 5 star then a ibis budget hotel is a 7 star it makes the ratings of hotel go completely out the window rooms are absolutely disgusting floor creaks like it’s about to fall through the bathroom is horrendous the lifts will have you wait 10 mins just to go down 3 floors I would completely stay away also a cashless hotel which isn’t described anywhere until you get there,1,2023,03,24
117,Couples night away,The hotel is in such a handy location. The room was huge . The bar is lovely. The bed was comfortable. My only complaint is the air conditioning didn’t cool the room. The service at breakfast was efficient & the selection was good. Breakfast is served in a lovely room . We would definitely stay again,4,2023,03,23
117,Excellent,"Excellent hotel great facilities.
Staff friendly 
Good breakfast 
Amazing location
It was my wife’s birthday and they helped me to celebrate it very well. They kept a card also with some chocolates Overall great experience and would definitely recommend",5,2023,03,21
117,A wonderful stay at an incredible hotell,"Our trip was for my wife's birthday and I cannot fault anything about the location, hotel or the excellent staff.

John in guest relations exceeded any and all expectations to ensure our night was one to remember and cherise forever.

I do hope we can come back again",5,2023,03,21
117,Beautiful room and lovely staff,"The hotel location was perfect for the theatres and a bit of shopping. The staff were helpful and the room was clean and tidy with a very large, comfortable bed. There was a restaurant and bar for patrons of the hotel. ",5,2023,03,20
117,Blew us away,"We stayed at the Dilly to celebrate my husbands special birthday. They went above and beyond to make our stay so special upgrading our room, putting champagne and balloons in the room. Nothing was too much and we had an amazing time.",5,2023,03,20
117,very ok,"Staff very polite, very nice and clean. Very alive hotel in Piccadilly. Breakfast with live piano player in a marvellous  terrace. Very good room service that clean and ""put order"" literally.There is old school manners here and it's something you appreciate. Only thing, my window cannot be open for fresh air. I do understand secure measures but a inch of fresh air would put this hotel in my favourite London spots ever. ",4,2023,03,20
117,Awesome Experience,"The dilly hotel is in fantastic location, close to everywhere. The staff is very professional and customer focused, Selin Atias is the best, very friendly and nothing was too much for him. We met him in terrace and connected him straightaway. He is an asset for Dilly. We dined in Madhu restaurant and had a wonderful experience. We will be back.",5,2023,03,20
117,What more could you ask for,"Amazing hotel located in W1 Mayfair, Piccadilly is a must for people who love the romantic and opulence. There is an Indian restaurant (Madhu's) on site and must say best I've ever tasted, and cocktail bar with pianist, and large restaurant for other food other than Indian. Cocktails averaged around £10, and they also do bottled beer. In the Indian draft cobra is available as is cobra pale ale costing £10 a pint and dishes range from £14 - £26 per dish. the only issue is ordering a beer at the bar, and get charge £3.25 service charge, after all your in Mayfair. There is a terrace bar outside the main restaurant but closed. 
Lovely comfortable bed, and nice view over Piccadilly circus. Good location for shopping in Bond St.",5,2023,03,20
117,AVOID BREAKFAST,"Very comfortable hotel in ideal location,  but let down by poor buffet style breakfast Whilst the choice was good, there was  poor service with failure to clear plates (not waiting staff's fault as clearly understaffed),  undercooked eggs and the general melee of a buffet for up to £28 per head. Will be back, but will have breakfast at another location.",4,2023,03,19
117,Fancy hotel ,"Can not recommend it enough. Stayed for 2 nights, very clean, friendly and professional staff, safe area. Really a fancy hotel in London, close to underground. The price is exactly what you expect for a fancy hotel in London, and it is really worth it. 
In the room you can find different types of tea and coffee, and coffee machine! Heating on, which is very important to me, I feel cold all the time! Hair drier, iron and the stand.. Loved it.. ",5,2023,03,19
117,Wonderful,"The dilly hotel is wonderful, clean and stylish. However building without people is nothing more than a nice building. What made me stay splendid was the location and the manager Selim’s professional approach from arrival until departure. We dined in Indian restaurant which it was amazing and breakfast was good standards. The service was fantastic I will be back again.",5,2023,03,18
117,Fabulous!,"Honestly, after reading some bad reviews I was worried I'd made a mistake in booking this hotel for our London trip. I'm delighted to say I had no need to worry! From start to finish we had a great experience. Everyone was friendly and welcoming and the service was top notch. Our room was way bigger than I expected! (Having read bad reviews I worried we'd be in a broom cupboard but our room was massive!) 

The breakfast was great! I loved that there was an egg station and a pianist and such great choice. The Terrace is a beautiful space. The cocktail bar was excellent. The only issue was that while the public areas are glamorous and fabulous the bedroom was a bit worn and could do with a new carpet. The shower was very basic too. But the important thing is that it was bright and clean. (Apart from a dusty heating unit.) The pillows were very flat  - I'd have liked a firmer one - but everything else was great. 

I wonder if people leaving negative reviews expect it to be like The Ritz which is down the road? Paying the price we did we did not expect it to be as amazing as it was. It's incredibly well situated and I was thrilled to be bang smack in the middle of everything. We had a show and a gig to go to and it was ridiculously easy to get to them. 

The doorman was friendly and helpful, the manager of the cocktail bar so smiley and welcoming. All staff were pleasant and helpful which is exactly what I look for. I felt very much at ease and would go back with pleasure. ",4,2023,03,18
117,Drinks at The Dilly,"We met a group of friends for drinks at “Downstairs at The Dilly”,last night. 
What a friendly relaxing place. The staff were exceptionally helpful, welcoming and friendly. We had made a reservation, had a great table, plenty of space and when one of our party asked for a drink that wasn’t on the menu, it was made available. 
We will definitely be going back.",5,2023,03,18
117,Convenient location for London escapade,"This was my first stay in the hotel. The location was great, steps away from Piccadilly station/ West end area. Other places like Soho, Covent Garden and regent street are walking distance. Room was a bit tired but clean and had what we needed. They gym was cool and pool was amazing. The staff made our stay special, and helpful particularly Selim - one of the managers. Thanks for the lovely stay.",5,2023,03,18
117,The pleasure of Dilly Team,I stayed with my family for pleasure for 4 nights . We enjoyed a lot and the Team of the hotel is the key. Very goog situation and confortable beds. Dilly Team help to me to do the best surprise to my daughter's birthday,4,2023,03,16
117,Great deal for a 5 star hotel. Central location and amazing service,"I was very happy with my stay at this hotel. The price was so reasonable so I couldn’t resist. The service was excellent, the rooms are a bit on the older side but I didn’t have any other expectations. The staff was great, the place is beautiful and located in the heart of Piccadilly. I loved the beautiful bar too",5,2023,03,16
117,"Great hotel, great location, great price","Rooms are a fantastic size for
London, the location was perfect for what I needed and the price was v reasonable for a 5* hotel. Reception kindly granted me an early check in which was welcomed after a long train journey. Dinner was good at the Terrace, although a little chilly the evening we were there but service was attentive and breakfast was excellent the following morning - it had everything you could need. I will be using this hotel again.",5,2023,03,16
117,Dilly Dally,"Everything except the room was excellent. The room was tired and small. The staff are all charming and very helpful. The Terrace restaurant is great for breakfast. The Madhu restaurant is spectacular, extraordinary service and wonderful food. The Mezzanine bar is a peaceful sanctuary after a busy day. I will stay here again the next time I am in London. ",4,2023,03,14
117,Hotel with excellent location.,"Hotel with good location for theatres, shopping. Nice and clean room, excellent breakfast with a piano player when you eat. friendly and service mind personal. Nice restaurant with India cuisine. I can truly recommended the hotel.",5,2023,03,14
117,Amazing architecture.,The hotel is amazing. The design and architecture is wonderful. Booked this hotel for my parent's anniversary. I can't thank Selim enough for his excellent customer service. He went above and beyond and made my parents special day memorable. The breakfast according to them was fab. Pool was awesome.,5,2023,03,14
117,Long weekend at The Dilly in March,"Me and my 8-year old son really enjoyed our stay: comfortable room, amazing breakfast, helpful staff, beautiful premises and the best location. The concierce personel was really dedicated and warm. We will definetely come back. ",5,2023,03,13
117,Weekend stay,"Greeted with polite and welcoming staff, clean and tidy hotel, room required modernisation, only plug sockets were other end of room but weren't an issue.. queen size bed was not particularly comfy and very low to floor.. gym and pool was open and clean, was well looked after..

Location is perfect.. 

Overall nice stay ",4,2023,03,13
117,Lovely hotel - warm reception and beautiful room,"Beautiful hotel in the perfect location - fantastic decor.  The hotel had kindly decorated our room for my partners birthday, which was a lovely surprise and most thoughtful.
Staff all very friendly and welcoming.",4,2023,03,13
117,Beautiful Hotel in the heart of west end,"Convenient location. Covent garden and wesf end is juzt around the corner. THe guest relations officer selim has made a nice surprise for our birthday, Appreciated the gesture, Will be back again soon,",5,2023,03,12
117,"Napintas, convenient location, writing a review for ilocano visitors in london.","Nagpintas nga hotel, very convenient location in the heart of westend. napintas diay room. naragsakan kame nga nagpasyar diay london. the hotel manager Selim has made our stay wonderful. hopefully agsubli kame manen ti kabiitan nga panawen.",5,2023,03,12
117,A really good place to stay in London,"We stayed for a few nights at the Dilly. I was kind of hesitant booking here after some comments I've read but my experience was the opposite from theirs. The hotel was in a great location to explore London, by foot, the tube station one minute away, Oxford Street, Regent Street just around the corner.  Hotel is excellent! Friendly and professional staff. Mr. Celim  Atias  was very friendly, and made us  feel at home. They are willing to accommodate you in any way possible to make your stay great! We will be back",5,2023,03,12
117,Wonderful stay,"Had a great time at the hotel. The staff were lovely and accommodating. The room size was decent,  the bed was comfortable . Location was also ideal and the room with city view was a plus. I will stay at the hotel again. ",5,2023,03,10
117,Great location,"Excellent location, friendly helpful staff. Room quite warm at night as air conditioning not great. I’d visit again though as the hotel is beautiful and in a great spot for sight seeing and all the amenities.",4,2023,03,10
117,Lovely stay,"We had a fantastic overnight stay at The Dilly. Perfectly placed for everywhere, but the hotel was calm and relaxing.
The Terrace was a joy to be in, despite the pouring rain outside and the pool was a real bonus",5,2023,03,10
117,Very good hotel,"Clean friendly attentive excellent service great location nice breakfast. Spacious room, excellent staff. Only gripe was a pint of Cobra at£11.25 is very expensive. Only stayed one night happily return to this hotel. Gym is good and well equipped.",5,2023,03,09
117,A Place to Remember,"We couldn’t have picked a better hotel for the price! This hotel is in a great location to explore London, walking distance to London tourist attractions and lots of restaurants, patisseries, bars and parks around the hotel. The Piccadilly metro only seconds away. Rooms are tired but good size, the bed and pillows very comfy. Well, we couldn’t have picked a better hotel for the price! The stand out was the wonderful service from staff - especially the very welcoming the manager Selim Attias, his care and cheery dispositions made this like a home away from home. The Indian restaurant in the hotel was expensive, however, the food was amazing. They had everything you could need like a beautiful gym and pool. Highly recommend it.",5,2023,03,07
117,Dilly dally,"Communal areas of the hotel very impressive but classic rooms felt basic, not as luxe as I was expecting for the price. 

Great location and Madhus bar lovely. Piano bar nice but felt slightly like a bar in a conference venue.

Staff were lovely although one person managing Sunday check out made it a bit slow.

Decaf coffee for breakfast should be an option and breakfast service felt a bit chaotic. Also never enough decaf in room and no decaf/ fruit tea options. ",4,2023,03,07
117,birthday present,"Stayed at the Dilly last weekend on a solo trip. The staff was overall welcoming and helpful. The manager Selim was really personable, helpful and easy to talk to, we shared a few laughs. The room was clean and a special touch was added, Selim left a bottle of champagne in my room with a Happy Birthday cake and note. The hotel is in the heart of Piccadilly, Regent street and Oxford street it is just around the corner. I really enjoyed my time here.",5,2023,03,04
117,so glad we piked this hotel,"Amazing stay here! Planned a surprise anniversary for my hubby and he was blown away. Selim was so great, he was very helpful and pleasant with all we needed extra for our stay. loved that he made us feel like he really cared about giving us outmost experience. He decorated our room, met us at the arrival as well as in breakfast. the hotel rooms are really nice with comfy bed. Great staff and atmosphere, beautiful short break.",5,2023,03,04
117,Fantastic Stay!,The Dilly hotel was very accommodating from the time we arrived. The service was excellent. We came here to celebrate my friends birthday. We really loved the birthday treats. Selim the manager gets five stars!  He is so pleasant and helpful. We had a fantastic stay.,5,2023,03,03
117,Fabulous weekend away,Few days away for my friends Birthday. Everyone at the Dilly made our stay perfect. Nothing was to much trouble. Our rooms were lovely. We had been recommended this hotel and the Hotel was everything we had hoped for. Location was brilliant. Service was excellent. Perfect few days away. ,5,2023,03,03
117,Disappointing stay,"Aside from its location, I’m not sure if there are very many other positive things that could be said about this hotel. Check-in and reception were unhelpful: no information was given upon checking in, no mention of what time breakfast was, or even where the breakfast room was or where anything in the hotel (gym, pool, etc) was. Room was outdated and dark. Shower pressure was non-existent. Some of the furniture was stained (walls too). 

One of the elevators was broken so went up and down several times without meaning to.   Breakfast was ok, though lacking in selection but worst was the service. Concierge / guest relations was nowhere to be found as well. Overall, not a great experience. To sum it up: location location location, nothing more.",2,2023,03,02
117,They never gave me back my room deposit,"While checking in we had to pay £200 as a room deposit which was to be refunded after we leave the room. We never got it back, even after ringing them and leaving a voice mail and emailing them twice with no reply. I even emailed a few contacts at once to make sure. 
Very unprofessional i now have to go through my back for a chargeback. 
They could have even got back to me to avoid this fallback. 

Also the room didnt have any external windows, no balcony and there was no sound insulation so we had to listen to the crazy person next door talking to himself all night. 

I wont be back here again, ever. ",1,2023,03,02
117,"perfect location, perfect pillow ever","nice hotel, comforatble and big rooms, perfect location and very kind bellman at the door always greeting you and helping openning the door. a BIG thank you to him to be so kind.
also breakfats we very nice and the terrace",5,2023,03,02
117,No central heating and moths in the room!,"No central heating although was provided with an electric portable heater. A number of moths in the room. Not good at all. I will need to dry clean my coats and jumpers before taking them home.
Sadly will not return until assurances that this problem have been solved.",2,2023,03,01
117,Would not recommend! Disappointing for a 5 Star Hotel,"In the whole 5 Star Hotel were 5 working mini fridges. Hotel only has general heating so if you are cold you can’t heat the room… had to ask for a separate radiator. But it wasn’t strong enough to heat the bathroom! Bathroom was absolutely freezing. Towel heater had to get switched on my maintenance, but even with it turned on didn’t change anything… still freezing! 
There are definitely better 5 star Hotels for the same price! 
",1,2023,02,28
117,Weekend at The Dilly,"We had a great weekend at The Dilly. Great check in with Timo & John on reception offered good information  and very good service.
 We had 4 rooms booked at the hotel. Food in the upstairs restaurant very good at lunchtime. 
Hotel was a great location to get about both by taxi and tube. Taxi's can be waved down by the hotel staff for you.  The windows in the rooms don't open so the room was a bit hot at night.
We would stay again  , due to the facilities and location.",4,2023,02,27
117,Amazing,Haven’t been in London for years. First time in Piccadilly and first time in the dilly hotel. It was just wow. Lovely staff and manager. Breakfast was top class and staff so friendly and welcome. We will be back ,5,2023,02,26
117,Excellent Hotel,"I have always wanted to stay at the Dilly and when I finally did, it did not disappoint. We had a lovely couple of days. Everything about the hotel was excellent. Found the location to be particularly good within easy walking distances of all central London places. ",5,2023,02,26
117,Wonderful stay in the heart of London,Selim the customer representative was super helpful and very concerned with making our stay memorable. His customer service was through the roof. We were not only greeted every morning with smile he remembered all my kids name.  The location of the hotel is amazing and rooms are big enough to accommodate my 5 family members. We enjoyed our stay very much and my kids were very sad that we had to leave after 2 nights stay. We will be back!,5,2023,02,26
117,A really lovely experience,"A very friendly hotel with high service standards in the heart of London.
Lisa on reception, with her team, made us feel most welcomed and uniquely special. A beautiful hotel that’s most decadent and oozes character and charm 🙌
The staff smile naturally and are there to please.
The terrace/conservatory is a beautiful way to see the outside of the hotel while experiencing natural light in a grand setting for wines, champagne or food. Breakfast here was special.",5,2023,02,25
117,The Dilly review,"Thank you very much for the nice stay. Selim atias was very kind to host us. The room was comfortable, the breakfast had many options. It was located in the center so it was easy to walk around for a promenade.",5,2023,02,25
117,Birthday Treat,"The service provided and the courteous staff exceeded all expectations. The icing on the cake being the beautiful surprises left in our room for our daughter's 21st!
The team in The Terrace restaurant were very attentive, turning on the air conditioning the moment we mentioned it was getting hot! The food excellent!",5,2023,02,24
117,Above and Beyond Service,"
I encountered many hotel employees in my time and none have been more accommodating, genuine, friendly and very funny as Selim. Whenever we experienced an issue such as reception services, room cleanliness, we knew who would be able to solve the problem in seconds. Thank you Selim for standing out in as a leader in hospitality business. The hotel location is just perfect. The hotel is  next to piccadilly tube station, Soho, Covent Garden walking distance. We enjoyed every minute of our stay.",5,2023,02,23
117,5 Star Rating Deceptive,"Fused bulbs, open Wi-Fi with no key, low range Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi signal kept breaking, kettle had no proper place for plugging in the cord was just too short, the living room did not have a telephone, ac temp could not be controlled properly, front desk never answered calls on telephone; ordered a late night pizza which the front desk refused to deliver to our room. Sent multiple emails about these issues. No one ever came to ask if these were ever resolved. Nor did anyone ask if our stay was satisfactory inspite of our staying for 2 weeks. Not a pleasant stay. The use of the word 5 star in advertising campaigns is deceptive. ",1,2023,02,23
117,Work trip to London,Very good value for classy hotel in excellent location. I enjoyed swimming and steam room. It was great to sit in windows overlooking Piccadilly for breakfast. Good choice of breakfast buffet and attentive staff. ,5,2023,02,22
117,DEFINITELY NOT A 5 STAR,"Just back from our stay here and very disappointed . We had a executive suite which was anything but 5 star standard old dated chipped furniture ripped carpet , plaster missing from walls the shower was old and difficult to use  with a grubby shower curtain  . The mattress was rock hard ..The rooms were unbearably warm at night the air-con/heating system blew hot air on both settings we had to open the windows which meant we couldn’t sleep with the noise .We returned from a show and fancied a nite cap only to be told there is no residence bar they advertised 24hr room service but it wasn’t available either.. Breakfast was mediocre the coffee and tea were lukewarm the line for the toaster was long as only one worked and this morning the coffee machine wasn’t working so no filter coffee we waited 20mins for tea which was undrinkable.. Because we stayed in the executive suite we had access to a lounge with complimentary beverages , a selection of bottled beers and soft drinks  but no bottle opener to open them,  Few bottles of cheap wine available the white wine was warm and again un drinkable..

The pool and gym looked nice .The Concierge staff were friendly and helpful. Reception staff were pleasant however they did take 2 payments from our account for security deposit which we had to ask twice for it to be rectified which it was eventually.. 
The only thing this Hotel had going for it was the Location. I am a firm believer in you get what you pay for this hotel is expensive but in this case we definitely didn’t get a 5 star experience.. So disappointing..",1,2023,02,22
117,Best value for the money and Excellence Experience,"We stayed here two years ago and was very disappointed with the hotel product and services. I heard, the hotel owned and managed by different management not long ago and wanted to give it a go. 
Wow, what a change and improvements in regards to customer services!
Mr. Atias the guest relations manager was the most professional staff member, I have ever met in 10 years. I could not believe the service I received for the rate I paid. This level of service carried was was also displayed at the Terrace for breakfast. 
I am glad that I booked this hotel and hopefully I will be back before the hotel goes into full refurbishment and rates doubled.",5,2023,02,22
117,One of the best hotel in London.,The location is very good. In the heart of Picadilly. You can reach many places by foot.  Rooms are very comfortable. Front desk is kind and helpfull. I will always try to stay in this hotel.  Thanks a lot for every thing.,5,2023,02,22
117,Golden Wedding,we have stayed here many times but the first time as the Dilly  each time has been excellent and this time is no exception the terrace team were very attentive and the food excellent. We are looking forward to our return in August. ,5,2023,02,22
117,Convenient,"Very central but rather dated. Rooms were spacious and clean but rather dated and the bathroom was much too small and felt really cramped. We had one round of drinks in the hotel bar (£72) for 4 of us, hence the reason we only had one. Staff very friendly. ",3,2023,02,22
117,A long weekend at the Dilly,"The hotel is at the heart of London and a lot to see in walking distance. Breakfast is oppulent and of good quality. Some of the rooms are renovated, whoever not all of them. The bar has a good choice of drinks and the Indian restaurant is well known.",4,2023,02,20
117,Fantastic Hotel,"Excellent location on Piccadilly, ideal for theatres, restaurants and shopping. The staff clearly take pride in their work and everyone we met and spoke to were extremely pleasant and courteous, nothing was too much trouble. Without a doubt we would stop at The Dilly again, they’ve won us over. ",5,2023,02,20
117,Fab Stay at The Dilly,"We stayed at The Dilly mid February 2023.
The hotel is centrally located. Clean and comfortable. We would stay at The Dilly if we were to visit London again. Highly recommended.  Paul at the entrance was most kind and helpful.",5,2023,02,20
117,A Phenomenal Experince,"  Happy to be back to London after 8 years. What a way to spend the Valentines day. We welcomed by Selin Atias and escorted to our room on the 1st floor. Our room was a good size and we had the view of the Regent Street, Our room was decorated with Rose Patel's and red Balloons and there was a lovely welcome note. The hotel staff was very friendly, accommodating and responsive. Thank you for making our special trip very memorable....",5,2023,02,19
117,Dallying at the Dilly,"I was surprised that the Dilly came up as the cheapest option on my employer’s hotel booking system. That’s the reason I booked! Normally a classy hotel like the Dilly would be out of my league! It turned out that the price didn’t include breakfast but that wasn’t a disaster. The room was lovely with a massive bed. The complimentary water, tea and biscuits were appreciated.",5,2023,02,19
117,Great location and hotel,"Great hotel, amazing breakfast, the location is perfect to walk to the theatre district or the savoy / covent garden, regent street etc.  Close to tube stations.  The team were lovely, the rooms great.  Can't fault it. ",5,2023,02,18
117,Loved our stay,"We stayed in family rooms, which is perfect for family or two couples with plenty space. The gym in the hotel is amazing and my partner used it every morning. Every member of staff was very friendly and helpful. Especially shout for Selim Atias the manager who is ready to assist you 24/7. The location is fantastic. Piccadilly Circus, Regent street, Oxford street is a very busy areas so could be a bit noisy, but you are in the heart of the london. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,02,17
117,Fantastic stay!,"We had a lovely time at this hotel, the staff were really friendly and helpful. Food was lovely. Rooms were quiet and the black out curtains were really good. The beds were really comfy and the facilities were great! 
On top of that it was in a brilliant location. We will definitely be coming to stay again! ",5,2023,02,17
117,Amazing,"Our stay was absolutely amazing here, we dined at madhu's our first night and enjoyed every bit of what we ate and had the perfect wine recommended to us. The breakfasts we enjoyed were amazing and the selection was great too. Very well connected and ideally located, can't recommend this location enough! ",5,2023,02,17
117,Being part of a family,"It was as being part of a family. The reception, door man, cleaners, breakfast restaurant personel all welcomed us as being part of a family and did everything to make the stay memorable. 

Located at Piccadilly the location is also perfect.",5,2023,02,17
117,Incredible hotel with exceptional staff. Thank you!,"Where do I even start. The whole trip was amazing and The Dilly was the best part of it. 

I booked a 2 night stay at The Dilly for a valentines trip for me and my partner. Booking was easy, we chose a city view double. I asked for the Valentines Package to be added to our room, which included rose petals, balloons and a mirror message. This was because we were celebrating also. This was so easy and they were very helpful. 

When we arrived at the Dilly we were greeted with the kindest gentleman, who opened our taxi door, took our bags and helped us inside, where we were given two glasses of champagne and shown to the front desk. All of the staff were friendly, helpful and genuinely wanted to give us a good experience. The doorman asked us what we wanted to do whilst in London and gave us some helpful recommendations on what shows to see (we went to Moulin Rouge, which was around the corner) and assistance with directions. I can’t thank him enough, delightful man and a credit to the hotel. I wish I got his name! 

Our room was spotless and spacious. And to our surprise we were given extras in the room, over and above what we’d asked for including wine, a bunch of flowers, roses and treats. I will add a video or photos  of the room if I can. It was spectacular. The only downfall for me personally was that there was no where I could plug in any styling tools anywhere near a mirror, so I had to curl my hair using my phone as a mirror. But this is such a trivial issue and I didn’t mind as everything else was so perfect. 

Every time we left the hotel there was  someone to open the doors, greet us, assist us. It was amazing and we both felt so looked after. 

Sadly our stay had to come to an end, the checkout process was seamless, and the hotel kindly stored our bags for us whilst we spent our last day around London before travelling back to The Isle of Wight. When we had to leave the concierge kindly got us a taxi instantly and our bags were placed into the vehicle for us and they wished us a safe journey. It’s the small things that they did that made all the difference. 

The staff were amazing, the hotel is stunning, the atmosphere was peaceful and I have never enjoyed a stay so much. The hotel made our trip for us and I want to thank The Dilly and all the staff we interacted with for making it so special.",5,2023,02,17
117,Poor,No hot water in room - we had to use another rooms shower - 3 kids!. Room was tired and unloved. Location great. Terrace restaurant was great. Just make sure your get a modern room. (if they have any),2,2023,02,17
117,Brilliant experience,"So glad we picked this hotel for two nights stay in London. The value to price cannot be beat in London. It was perfect for our needs in terms of getting around london easily. The hotel is short walk to Piccadilly subway and tourist attractions. Lots of cafes and restaurants around the hotel. Huge thanks to Selim who was very kind and professional he went extra mile and decorated our room for our daughters birthday. 
The hotel itself is relax and comfortable. We loved the atmosphere and decor. We booked the hotel via booking.com and Selim kindly included the breakfast with no additional cost during our stay. The terrace was nice and very welcoming and the breakfast was okay. 
Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel  in-terms of location, service and comfort and value. We will return!",5,2023,02,17
117,"Great location, some issues with the room","The location was fantastic. Room was small but comfortable. One issue was our heater wasn't working (they had to bring in a space heater), their was a very loud noise that would occasionally go off, all hours of the day and night (avoid room 912), and the lights of the nightstands weren't working so the room was quite dark. Maybe we were just unlucky with this particular room! ",4,2023,02,15
117,I’ve stayed in better premier inns.  3 star at best!!,"The public areas all look fantastic . Then you go to your bedroom. Fraying threadbare stained carpet, stained bathrobes , peeling paintwork and skirting boards that have t seen a duster in a king while, tired furniture more shabby than chic!!  

One of the lamps in the room had a electrical problem and flickered constantly. 

They take a credit card number and charge you for “incidentals”. When I returned home they charged my card. I am awaiting a refund. When I tried to call the hotel , trying all options ( press 1,2 etc) I couldn’t speak to anyone. 

The beds were comfortable and sheets clean. 

Staff were friendly . 

Location is fantastic ,  I doubt I’d rush back. It was all a bit of a letdown.",3,2023,02,14
117,Too Many Other Hotels To Stay Again,"Was quite looking forward to staying at The Dilly but just didn't quite live up to expectation.   The location is fabulous and all of central London is just a short walk away.  But the room decor is a little dated, our sink was blocked and the bathroom is needs replacing.  Too many other 5 start London hotels to stay again. ",3,2023,02,14
117,Fantastic location- highly recommend,"We have just spent 3nights at the Dilly- with my three daughters. Location is fantastic , staff very friendly and helpful….. breakfast was wonderful in the Terrace with a piano playing in the background. Beds comfy, no noise in rooms. Pool and steam room great…… Yes the bathrooms could do with a refurb maybe but was insignificant when look at whole picture. I was slightly concerned as had read previous negative reviews but we all can’t wait to go back!",5,2023,02,14
117,A wonderful experience,"The friendly, helpful staff truly enhanced my stay.  The hotel is clean and comfortable, breakfast is ample to suit all tastes.  The staff go above and to ensure guests happiness.  Ideally situated with so much choice of activity within a short walk.",5,2023,02,14
117,Great location excellent hotel,"Highly recommendable for location, services and friendliness of staff.  Also piano atmosphere at the bar very much appreciated and service overall was excellent.  Only issue was non availability of breakfast table on the Sunday.",4,2023,02,13
117,Lesley and Steven,We have given The Dilly a 5 rating even though it is not quite there yet as you can clearly see this classification being achieved given it is now under new ownership/management and the amount of refurbishment going on. The staff also gave you this impression and confidence and we wish them all the very best in this exiting new chapter for The Dilly,5,2023,02,12
117,Superb location and quality for the price ,"My friend and I stayed here recently, and we loved it! This hotel is also only a 1minute walk to Piccadilly Circus underground making it super easy to hop on and explore London. But there are also so many bars and restaurants around if you want to stay near the hotel.

The breakfast was surprisingly delicious. We enjoyed the breakfast on the second floor, we were given access to the balcony but we didn’t enjoy the amenities much there. 

We stayed at a few hotels during our trip and hotel Dilly was definitely our favorite hotel in London. The hotel and staff were fantastic, super friendly, especially Salim  Attias, the sweetest person in the world.  Can't wait to stay here again in the fall!",5,2023,02,11
117,Overall,"Check-in, check-out quite fast, room is clean, front door staffs are very very courtesy, hotel concierge very very good services. But personal did not have a time to enjoy gym, restaurant, bar …etc services.",5,2023,02,10
117,Great Hotel and friendly staff,"I simply loved it.

This Hotel is a diamond, you get even more for what you are paying, the most remarkable is their personal, specially my new friend Selim Atiyas the manager who is indeed a very nice person, professional  who likes to go extra mile to make sure, we are happy, he is so special… The rooms are beautiful, smelling delicious every time you arrive and clean, I really loved London and now I can say I love the Dilly hotel definitely will be my home when I come to London!",5,2023,02,10
117,"Convenient location, Value for money, Superb service!!","It’s our second time in London, and first time staying at the Dilly Hotel. It’s a very good value for your money. The room we stayed in was a bit tired and dark but the bed was very comfortable. Women at the breakfast room wasn’t kind enough when I asked for coffee around 11 am and she told us that the breakfast was over  but there was a hotel manager called Selim Atias who was very pleasant, friendly and funny who offered us coffee and some pastries. Selim went above and beyond to accommodate us during our visit and we will remember him for this reason. Overall I am very happy with our stay and you won’t be disappointed if you stay here!!!! We would recommend this hotel.",5,2023,02,10
117,Great location,"The Hotel was in a great location for the Piccadilly theatre, literally come up from the subway and is in front of you. Lovely entrance hall, and the terrace is lovely setting for breakfast.
Room was a little aged, in need of some tlc but clean and tidy and a good size. comfy bed.",4,2023,02,09
117,Great location but otherwise nothing special.,Great location and building. Because of that perhaps the hotel has let itself to go a bit. It’s OK but nothing to write home about. Extra points for having a pool in central London. Would go there again for the location.,4,2023,02,09
117,"Lovely hotel, great location, good value for money","A lovely hotel in a great, central location in London which was good value for money. Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Bedrooms were spacious and decor throughout the hotel is sumptuous. Would definitely recommend a stay at this hotel.",4,2023,02,08
117,Great value for money and awesome staff Selim in particular  ,"We were very pleased with our stay. The hotel location is superb, a minute walk to Piccadilly Circus and 10 minutes to Oxford Street. We got a specious room with a nice view. We were impressed by the manager Selim Atias. He provided us with outstanding customer service answering all our questions and he made sure, we are enjoying our stay from day one until our departure. 
We normally don't write any reviews to any hotel we stayed in; however, we thought after this wonderful and memorable experience in London, we should leave one for Dilly Hotel. ",5,2023,02,08
117,"Fabulous hotel, ideal location","This is a wonderful hotel, a real treat in this bustling world. It is calm and unassuming yet deliciously decorated. The staff are all super polite providing excellent service. The downstairs at the dilly bar is a wonderful way to wind down at the end of the day.",5,2023,02,06
117,Excellence at Dilly Hotel,"The hotel is located near Piccadilly Square and near the subway. The service at the hotel was excellent, the room we got was spacious with a daily cleaning service. The staff was kind and helped us with every question and request. The hotel's customer service manager  Mr. Selim was at our disposal in every matter and helps everyone who contacts him immediately with great kindness. The hotel has a gym and a heated pool. an amazing stying.",5,2023,02,06
117,Top Hotel,"The location is perfect! It is near to many great spots in London, like the picadilly circus and the palace. The staff is super friendly! We had a super big room with two comfortable beds. Defenitely going back. ",5,2023,02,04
117,Hotel personnel especially selim the reason to come back!,"Mr selim helps us for everything! Perfect employee!! 
We are telling now to everyone in our country to stay in dilly hotel.
The location and the foods are also wanderfull!
There is no chance to regret !!
Choose this hotel

117,Lovely Stay at the Dilly,"I stayed at The Dilly for 4 days during my family holiday and I really loved it. The staff were very friendly, cooperative and helpful. They also responded very quickly and efficiently to any requests we had. The hotel was very clean and we noticed a really lovely smell at all times. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay and I will surely stay at this hotel again when I’m back at London.",4,2023,02,04
117,Family break in London,"We traveled to London for my oldest daughter’s 18th birthday, she always wanted to stay in five star city center hotel in London. 

The Dilly was the perfect choice, located at the heart of Piccadilly west end and walking distance to tourist attractions. The manager Mr. Atias met us at the lobby with a huge genuine smile and told us that due to our special occasion, he included the breakfast without any additional cost. 

Our room had two queen beds and was decorated beautifully, gift for my daughter and a birthday cake with a lovely mirror message. We were blown away. Mr. Atias met us at the Terrace next morning and made sure that we are enjoying our stay. 

It was beautiful one night stay!! A huge thanks to the staff at the Dilly for making my daughters dreams come true!!. ",5,2023,02,03
117,Best place to stay,"We arrived on Sunday and stayed for 4 nights, The room was clean and comfortable, we had a view to Regent Street, excelent location on the Picadily station. Everything is walking distance, theaters, shops on Regent st. and Oxford st. and some sights. We walked 20 min to the Big Ben, we eat kosher food so we walked to Rubens restaurant 30 min or took the bus. The service was good Everything we asked for Selim helped us. We will definitely be back",5,2023,02,01
117,"Wow, what a great service!",I would like to give 7 gold stars for hospitality of Selim Atias the manager at the Dilly. Upon our arrival we were greeted by our own language and due to my partners birthday Selim gave us a breakfast with no additional cost. So he went out of his way to make sure that my children’s were happy and took care of us. My son loved the small black British cab which was given as gift. His kindness was so much more appreciated than he’ll ever know. The hotel has a lovely pool. The breakfast was nice and the room was beautiful with two queen beds. The location is a wow factor. Thank you and we will be back.,5,2023,02,01
117,Cozy stay at the hotel,"Comfortable room and hotel with excellent facilities and perfect location. Highlight the friendliness, closeness and professionalism of the hotel staff, and in particular of Eleni (guest relations area). He had many details with us, not forgetting the welcome when arriving at the hotel.",5,2024,10,13
117,London with charm,Great service no matter what area. Highly recommended as it is extremely centrally located and you can reach a lot on foot. The hotel has old charm and is very stylish in every respect. Come back and book yourself junior suite.,5,2024,09,29
117,Negative experience in London,"Actually it was a disappointment! Only the location and 'great, all to be redone. To have breakfast you have to go out and go to a university canteen.... The room has a bed that instead of a double is a square and a half, very small. Not to mention the bathroom that is very small, fixed shower and therefore uncomfortable, the bathroom products have put them only once in four days, there is no hairdryer.... It seems to me that it is certainly not to be recommended! Bad experience.",2,2024,09,21
117,A week in London,"Great hotel, large and welcoming rooms, central location, courteous staff. Class-leading amenities for London. Beautiful terrace where you can enjoy breakfast. If renew the sanitary facilities (especially the shower), top hotel. I would definitely return.",4,2024,09,11
117,Excellent hotel in central London,"Really an EXCELLENT hotel. The treatment of exceptional service. Perfect rooms, every day they refueled 2 bottles of water, cookies, soaps, etc... We also enjoy a pool and spa ideal for when you arrive in the afternoon/night after walking all day. Perfect and complete breakfast in a dining room with a lovely gallery. Unbeatable location in central London on Picadilly Circu. Very good and set area. Excellent treatment from Hossein, super attentive and friendly with us. No doubt if we return to London we will repeat hotel.",5,2024,08,17
117,That's too bad. Everything seemed better.,"A nice facility in the common areas. We have in fact changed the Reservation compared to another a few days before, because attracted by the location, which, however, remains the strong point of the hotel...
The room not too neat, lacking in the bathroom set, with noisy air conditioning in the living area of the suite.
The staff frankly, for the most part, careless about the needs...
Little elasticity in the management of breakfast, compared to whose duration (by 10 30 from Monday to Friday) you are almost invited to get up...
Frankly we expected something better....",3,2024,08,17
117,Great location! Great hotel and great rooms.,"Great location, with clean room and good facilities. Pleasant bed with good cooling through the air conditioning. It was just stupid that there was no window to open. (window locked)

Otherwise, everything is high class.",5,2024,08,01
117,not recommendable,"They came to clean the room at 5 p.m., rushing and bad. the two days we were there.
There is only one lamp to read in the beds.
The breakfast is not worth what they ask for, example: two cheeses and bad. There is no York ham...
I do not recommend it, the price does not match the quality.",2,2024,05,21
117,Thank you Abdul,Thank you Abdul for making our stay so pleasant despite all the initial challenges. You are a star one day I want to come back and visit with my family and chill again I think that's really cool see you soon and have a nice day,5,2024,05,10
117,Fantastic,"Beautiful hotel, which is centrally located, if you are not too lazy, you can actually reach all the sights on foot!
Very friendly and courteous staff.
The breakfast was varied and very tasty. Our room was large and the bed was very comfortable.
The swimming pool is also large, and the fitness equipment is also great 👍
The hotel staff also surprised me because they decorated the room really sweetly for my birthday and I was given a bottle of Prosecco, little cakes and a teddy bear with a Snickers.
That was a really nice and friendly gesture from the hotel staff. I was very happy about it.🤗
I can really only recommend the hotel and we will definitely be back soon.
Thank you again for the great service🥰🥰🥰",5,2024,05,08
117,What a disappointment!!!,"Arrived late in the evening with my husband and they reserved us a microscopic room, frozen cold, windows with incredible drafts. The next day, after many complaints, Abdul understood the problem and gave us another large room with a bathroom for disabled people but certainly much better!!! The cleanliness in the room left something to be desired, something was always missing!!! For the rest, the breakfast was good and rich and the location of the hotel was excellent!! But they only dream of 5 stars!!!! A delusion",2,2024,05,05
117,Disappointment,"The only advantage worth mentioning is the location in the center. For the rest nothing 5 star. Lack of room service, many flaws in the rooms: blocked sink, which remained that way even after requesting an intervention, radiator in the bathroom off, empty minibar, safe not working, windows that cannot be opened, room still to be redone at 3pm . The hotel has excellent potential but unfortunately the management leaves a lot to be desired.",2,2024,04,02
117,Wanting and not being able,"The only really positive note is the location. For the rest a semi-tragedy.
Nothing 5 stars, at most a poor 3.
Small rooms. Non-existent wardrobe, for 5 days we used the suitcases as a wardrobe.
Old furniture.
The mini bar was even empty, I would say not acceptable.
Small bathroom, the sink didn't drain
Normal breakfast, good food, but very slow in express preparations.
In summary, the cost of a 5 star but the service of a 3 star.",2,2024,04,02
117,Excellent location,"Excellent location. The hotel is a little old fashioned but the rooms on the first floor are renovated. The very large executive room, despite the renovation, had stained carpets and it was cold in the room but they brought me a heater. Very attentive service and fantastic location. Overall great experience.",4,2024,03,31
117,The suffocating room,"Very nice hotel in the common areas, but certainly not the rooms.
I discovered once there that for safety reasons you can't open the windows and the temperature in the room was very high.
They provided us with a fan which did not solve the problem and increased the chaos of objects that the room was already full of.
There wasn't even a socket for a hairdryer in the bathroom and the carpet was dirty.
Let's say it was a room you couldn't wait to get out of, mainly because it was too hot and had too many objects in it.
Another negative note is the absence of hanging supports, both in the bathroom and in the bedroom.
The bed was very comfortable, perhaps because it was the only new thing.
All the receptionists were very kind, and even in the event of inconvenience and their mistakes they knew how to manage the situations well, they all seemed aware of the problems in the rooms, not surprised by the complaints, as if they heard them every day.",3,2024,03,15
117,I advise,"It was a very short stay, just one night. The hotel is in the center of Piccadilly Circus and therefore has a strategic position, especially for us who had an appointment nearby and then decided to visit the city.
The kindness of the staff was the best thing about this hotel. I therefore thank Heather and Daniela who were really kind and helpful. Ah Sunday, breakfast is very good! I advise :)",5,2024,01,25
117,Don’t go there!,"First the positive: the Dilly is ideally located for exploring London on foot or by public transport. The concierge staff are very friendly and helpful, the rooms are spacious and the beds are large. But that's about it.

We booked three rooms for a long weekend directly via the hotel website at full price. Apparently there are renovated rooms, but we didn't have one. The result: very worn rooms with mismatched, shabby and worn furniture. One room only had one bedside lamp, and despite asking several times, no more was brought. The only socket that can be used to charge mobile devices is behind the door. The bathrooms are really bad: rusty fittings, mold, no shower curtain, everything pretty unkempt and unappetizing. The whole thing wasn't ready for use until 4.30 p.m. on the day of arrival.

Room service is limited to the bare minimum: making the beds and replacing the towels, pajamas are thrown on a chair. In the bathroom, the flood caused by the missing shower curtain is removed, but apart from that, it is not noticeably cleaned.

In the corridors, half-eaten meals are left on trays and here and there there is a vacuum cleaner that would be nice to use.

In the lobby there are only two armchairs that you can sit on and a separate room without daylight with another six seats. There is no service, at most you can get water from paper cups at a ""buffet"", although the water tank was mostly empty during our stay. The former lobby is now a bar run by external parties that is also available to external guests. As a hotel guest, you are at a disadvantage if you want to consume something without having made a reservation.

All of this takes place in a hotel that presents itself as a luxury hotel and charges accordingly. Even if London is an expensive place and the hotel standards in England are a bit special, you are miles away from your own expectations here.

It should be mentioned that after our complaint we received a 20% reduction on the (already paid) room price, which, however, was far from compensating for the great annoyance and disappointment of staying in an allegedly upscale hotel with the quality of a train station flophouse. Although our feedback did not seem to surprise the reception staff, the feedback was received with a certain cold-heartedness and a general shrug of the shoulders.

In a response to a review (November 2023), the hotel replied, among other things:
""We take great pride in our prime location in the heart of London"". Well, in our experience, there is no reason for that at all.
",1,2023,12,14
117,Excellent 4s hotel,"A good hotel in the center of London. Traveled with family.
The location is absolutely unbeatable, just a few meters from Piccadilly. The lobby is nice and decorated for Christmas with fruit, sweets and water available for guests. The reception and concierge staff were very courteous. The tea room on the ground floor and the breakfast room on the terrace are very beautiful. Our Family Room is very large, well above the London average. Attentive staff, excellent and courteous room cleanliness, good soundproofing, comfortable beds. The welcome surprises, snacks, bottle of wine and more are very nice, certainly touches from a high-class hotel. Requested a room on a high floor and away from the lift landing, assigned a room on the highest floor and among the last in the corridor. Well.
What currently differentiates the Dilly from a real luxury hotel in my opinion is first of all the breakfast: good choice and excellent quality, however the service is minimal: hot drinks for example are not served at the table but must be taken from the classic automatic machine . As mentioned, the room was large in size but needed renovation both in the bathroom, a little dated, and in the heating system and furniture.
I believe that if we base ourselves on value for money, the Dilly is almost unbeatable for a family of four like ours. Obviously if you are looking for pure luxury you can find it in other hotels in London, at double or triple the cost.",4,2023,12,11
117,Excellent,"Exceptional attention
I loved Latika and Ahmed! They gave us first-class personalized treatment
They care a lot about their clients, we liked it a lot, the hotel is very good, it is very big and the location is the best
It is 2 minutes from Piccadilly
I would repeat without thinking about it",5,2023,11,17
117,Excellent,"It is a very nice hotel, the staff extremely friendly and attentive from the entrance. The rooms are extremely comfortable, spacious and cozy. Very detailed, on the mirror of the closet a welcome message, They sent us a present in the welcome room. Breakfast in a closed terrace with a transparent dome that creates a beautiful elegant atmosphere. Very complete with a wide variety of juices, breads, fruits, etc., they make omelettes to your liking.
It has an incredible Roman-type pool in the basement, there is squash, gym and massages. The location is excellent, a few steps from Picadelly, 4 blocks from Trafalgar Square and about 3 or 4 blocks from China Town. It is close to New Bond street, Regent street where the most exclusive shops are located. Tourist bus station steps away. Surrounded by restaurants, cafes, truly a spectacular area",5,2023,10,25
117,Bad!,"Unkept hotel, unfriendly staff. Mass processing. Unclean. Windows not cleaned. Carpets dirty and old. Light bulbs broken, rubbish left in the hallway outside the room all day and not taken away. Far from 5 stars. Disappointing. Management must be bad. Would never stay there again.",1,2023,10,08
117,"Befriedigend zu wenig, sehr gut zu viel","Wie alles in Grossbritannien ist auch dieses Hotel überbewertet. Es ist zwar nicht schlecht, aber eben auch nicht sehr gut. Das Hotel liegt zwar sehr zentral an allen guten und besuchswerten Strassen. Die Bar düster, man hat auch das Gefühl irgendwie im Nahen Osten zu sein (Musik, Leute) der Service, naja auch wie überall einfach nicht was wir uns vom Festland her gewohnt sind.",3,2023,06,11
117,Ottima esperienza,"Ottimo hotel in posizione fantastica. Perfetto per qualsiasi vacanza a Londra. Belle camere e letti molto comodi. Ottima la colazione at the Terrace, ampia scelta e ottima qualità. La preparazione di Lucy, la simpatia di Canido e  la professionalità di Aulona (e i suoi cappuccini italian style) sono un ottimo punto di partenza per iniziare la giornata col piede giusto.",5,2023,06,06
117,Pasqua 🐣 a Londra,"Hotel molto bello…magari un po’ vecchio ma comunque ristrutturato e ben tenuto. Nel contesto sono stati inseriti elementi moderni con elementi classici! Il risultato è veramente “wow“! Servizio eccellente sia a livello di pasti, di bar, di pulizia e di accoglienza in generale! Appena arrivati ci hanno dato una camera molto bella ma mancava un letto, nonostante l’avessimo richiesto nella mail, immediatamente ci hanno sostituito la stanza… Dandoci una suite per sopperire alla mancanza! Personale gentilissimo ed educatissimo! Rapporto qualità prezzo elevato!",5,2023,04,12
117,Bien equipo!!!,"Buena experiencia! Al principio desconcertante, después de un Upgrade gratuito resultó que la habitación no nos gustaba. Lo comentamos con el equipo y todo fueron ayudas. Al final, después de ofrecernos varias habitaciones, todo encajaba. 
Agradezco el trato y la profesionalidad del equipo de recepción. Buen trabajo!!!
Ubicación perfecta, y aunque no es un 5 estrellas está bastante bien!!",4,2023,04,04
