133,A disappointing return,"Having previously stayed at the Royal Garden hotel many times prior to the pandemic and its refurbishment we were looking forward to our return but unfortunately we left very disappointed. 

Without upgrading previously, our rooms had always been a substantial size and very spacious but it‚Äôs appears the refurbishment has resulted in rooms now being much smaller/compact and as comparison rooms at a Premier Inn are often considerably larger !!!

The bathroom was average but similar to many other hotels at a much lower price bracket. 

The bed was very comfortable but despite being on the 5th floor, the noise from outside traffic was considerably which may also have been due to the poor fitting windows as the strong wind could also be heard whistling through a gap somewhere which both resulted in a disturbed nights sleep. 

One small bottle of complimentary water and a television which didn‚Äôt function properly simply compounded our disappointment so it‚Äôs unlikely we‚Äôll return.",3,2024,10,20
133,Perfect Kensington Location in London,"Convenient & walkable Kensington location in London with excellent services and amenities. Clean and comfortable room made our stay relaxing.

Highly recommend.",5,2024,10,10
133,Fabulous location and views of Kensington Palace,"This is a very good hotel. Lots of staff, high standards, and attention to detail. The greatest difference is made by excellent  staff attitude, competence, and their ""can do"" approach"". the hotel is recently decorated and my room had no aspects that I thought were old or tired. A refreshing change! 
I would happily use this hotel for business of leisure and happened to be attending a conference. if you are planning to use this hotel as a conference exhibitor, watch out for the ceiling heights in the ante-rooms downstairs in the events. They vary greatly and whilst being a certain height in paper, were slightly too low in specific areas for certain brands of pop-up vertical displays. ",5,2024,10,10
133,A great hotel with exceptional value in the Kensington area.,"Rooms were bright, clean and the beds were very comfortable. Loved the bathroom and its walk-in shower. View from the 10th floor overlooking Kensington Palace and the Park was lovely first thing in the morning to see people walking across to work, or simply out with their dogs. High Street Kensington was buzzing with shoppers and tourists with a great selection of restaurants and coffee bars.",4,2024,10,07
133,Family break in London,"The hotel location was perfect. The hotel experience itself was of the highest quality. All of the staff, from front of house to service staff were very helpful, friendly and courteous.

During my most recent stay with my 5 year old, Renatta  gave her a kids travel pack and a teddy bear named Ben. She took the time to stop and talk each time she saw us. We formed such a lovely rapport. So much so, that my 5 year old wrote in her hotel stamp passport ""my favorite thing about the hotel is Renatta.""

133,Wonderful hotel and restaurant,We had a wonderful stay. Many thanks to all the staff but especially Monty at front of house and Renata. The Min Jiang Restaurant was amazing.

133,"Good stay, Great location","We have stayed at this hotel three times and we had a good stay. We particularly love this hotel for its location, very convenient access to the Kensington Gardens and good value for money.

I would like to give a special mention to Nasir from the reception who assisted us during check out. He is an excellent staff who went above and beyond to ensure everything was settled fairly and accurately. 

I would have given a 5 star but they have a lot of things to work on such as.
- There were times during our stay that the TV does not work.
- Housekeeping does not answer the phone if you call around 10-11pm (we usually ask for water bottles night time)
- A lot of staff don‚Äôt even smile (particularly at the origins restaurant)

Overall we had a good stay and this is our go-to hotel whenever we are in London.",4,2024,08,27
133,Not feeling satisfied and treated unfairly,"First of all as a guest and any hotel wants to be treated fairly as any other guests they asked me for a deposit for 500 pounds in cash for five nights why they took from my friend only 100 pound deposit and the confusion happen even in the checkout they gave me let out till 1 pm why did they give him till 3 !! I was very, very disappointed .",2,2024,08,25
133,A lovely hotel in the heart of London,"Stayed overnight at this hotel, and found it to be very comfortable and an all over great experience.

The only downside was that the TV in the room didn't work and despite reporting it to reception no engineer attended - although to be fair this was very late at night",5,2024,08,22

133,Royal Garden Hotel Review,The Royal Garden Hotel is located in a historical district with exceptional views of Kensington Palace and Hyde Park.  Within walking distance from the hotel there are multiple ways to access the Tube or tourist sightseeing buses. The Staff at the hotel provided professional and polite services.  ,5,2024,08,20
133,Best hotel in Kensington,"My family has a long tradition with the Royal Garden Hotel.  My parents stayed there many times from 1997, before the refurbishment.  After the refurbishment the hotel has been lifted to a very high standard. The location of the hotel is perfect, with easy access to the lovely Kensington Gardens and also very close to the many attractions in the west end.  I highly recommend this hotel for the friendly service and excellent rooms.  The hotel is also very family friendly, with special attention to small children.

133,Great experiance,"Had an amazing stay at Royal Garden Hotel! The staff, management, and reception were all exceptional. Highly recommended!",4,2024,08,01
133,Unexpected,"Hello, I hope that my observation will be taken seriously, as I booked the Royal Garden Hotel London through you, but I had very difficulties to obtain the required rooms, which is as follows:

The required rooms were provided at five o'clock in the afternoon! Since he has a child, we were explained in the reservation, and I suffered a lot to get the room and justify the hotel that the rooms are not ready.

And the biggest calamity turned out that one of the rooms was air-conditioned was broken and did not work, according to what the air conditioning technician told me!!

I faced a very great difficulty as it is not possible to sleep in rooms with no air conditioning and the temperature today in London is 31 degrees and I can not cancel the reservation because it is a conditional reservation will be charged a night fee (while it is not my fault)",2,2024,07,31
133,"Excellent hotel, great location","We received great service, the cleanliness and efficiency of the room are impeccable, all of our requests (extra douvet, toilet problem) were addressed in a timely manner and to our satisfaction, and the location is perfect. The room was quiet despite facing the busy street, and the mattress was supporting and not too soft",5,2024,07,30
133,Not even close to a 5 Star Hotel other then Location :(,"This is not a 5 star hotel.  The ben linens barely cover the surface of the bed and come loose (exposing you to the mattress!) whenever you roll over!!  I woke up with my face on an exposed mattress which is utterly revolting.  The staff told me these are ""normal"" bed coverings.  The shower was miniscule and appears to be bought from a discount hard-ware store.  5 Star prices for 2.5 Star Hotel Experience :(",1,2024,07,29
133,Glorious London stay!,"From the moment we entered the hotel, we were met with excellent service! The Duty Manager Andrea Tudor, went out of his way to ensure our stay was perfect!

Nothing was too difficult for the staff, including the charming doorman! We would return in a flash!",5,2024,07,25
133,Beautiful neighborhood,"I liked staying at Kensington. Far from the crowds. Right next to Kensington Palace and its gardens. I loved the neighborhood. I just had to walk a bit to the metro station and I could get anywhere. 
Staff was excellent. 
I would stay here again. ",5,2024,07,23
133,Excellent! Awesome! Recommendable!,"The engineering services even brought up an adaptor to my room so I could use my American voltage Flat Iron!

I had an aircon problem which the manager, Jamie, dealt with, upgrading me to a fabulous suite. Excellent, top class Chinese restaurant on 10th floor. Fabulous views. Highly recommend.",4,2024,06,29
133,Hotel Royal,"My review was sent to you 
Thank you, 

Room that I stayed in too small for 
King bed in my opinion.
Other than that it was nice experience 
Location perfect 
Staff in breakfast and conceirge were very helpful and nice .",4,2024,06,28
133,Good but could be better,"The hotel was renovated and they continue to make improvements. Unfortunately they didn‚Äôt include sound proofing or better noise insulation. We could hear drilling and hammering from within the hotel and other sounds too. Apart from that it convenient, nice and service was great. ",4,2024,06,28
133,Overnight stay for business,Nice enough hotel and pleasant staff but i think too expensive for what is on offer.  Would recommend if you can't find anything cheaper in the area.,4,2024,06,28
133,Very bad hospitality,Not recommended at all. The hospitality was bad. If you booked more than a room then ur deposit will not be returned ,1,2024,06,27
133,Lovely Stay,"A great place to end our vacation before returning to the USA. Spacious room for a family of three, and the extra deep bathtub was a welcome retreat after days of walking around England. The buffet-style breakfast is not included in the cost of the room; however it was the largest buffet I've ever seen and we started every day there. The hotel is located close to the tube station, as well as, obviously, Kensington Palace and the park was a lovely place to take the kiddo. We also used concierge services to book private transportation, and this was a breeze. If we travel to Kensington again, we would definitely stay here.",4,2024,06,26
133,VERY COMFORTABLE STAY IN A WELL LOCATED SPOT,"POSITIVE:
Generous size, comfortable rooms
Recently spruced up. So many other London hotels are in serious need of a lick of paint
Great location
Quick and efficient lifts ('elevators')
Breakfast room has best view in London overlooking Kensington Gardens.

COULD DO BETTER
The tops of the little bottles of shampoo, conditioner etc were impossible to open.
The final bill included a random 'administration charge'. When I queried it they were quit happy to remove it but it left a bit of a sour taste",4,2024,06,26
133,Excellent hotel in every respect,"I booked this hotel for a weekend in London for my wife‚Äùs 50th birthday. The hotel is in a fantastic location in Kensington and our room allocated overlooked Kensington palace . The check in was very friendly and efficient and they wished my wife happy birthday, I wanted the stay to be special, and the quality of the service and accommodation certainly lived up to this. The room was spacious and absolutely spotlessly clean. Excellent attention to detail as there was a turn down service and Penhaligon s toiletries. I was also amazed to find a full bottle of complimentary champagne on ice and a birthday cake in the room for my wife. Both were top quality and this was an amazingly generous gesture. 
We ate at the origin restaurant at night, the food was excellent , service too and I thought the prices very reasonable too considering where we were. Excellent presentation too.
Breakfast in the morning was ¬£28 each, However, the quality was outstanding of every item - pastries totally fresh, excellent cooked breakfast and fresh squeezed juice.
Overall, I thought this hotel was exceptional in every way, and although slightly pricier than e.g. a 4* chain hotel, I thought it was worth every penny, will not hesitate to book again on our next trip to London.",5,2024,06,26
133,Disappointing!,"A disappointing stay unfortunately, mostly due to a lack of 5 star service.
Poorly treated on arrival with one of our rooms not ready and taking 1.5 hours and chasing twice to be ready! All with no apology!
Great location and views across Kensington Gardens but left feeling it was overpriced due to the poor service.
The Langham is in a different league when it comes to making your stay special and most Premier Inns for that matter!",2,2024,06,25
133,Impressed by the kind concierge,"We stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel for two nights from June 20th

That was when

I wanted to take the London bus

so I consulted with the concierge, Mr. ADAN

He was very kind and provided us with the necessary information

he wrote down the route number and the bus stop to get off at

he even guided us to the bus stop in front of the Royal Garden Hotel and confirmed the city

Thanks to him, we were able to get there without getting lost on our first London bus, so we felt very happy‚Äº(‚Å†‚òÜ‚Å†‚ñΩ‚Å†‚òÜ‚Å†)

As a postscript, he also told us that the walk from the passage next to the Royal Garden Hotel was wonderful, so we took a walk the next morning

There were various birds and squirrels there, it was lush greenery, and we could see Kensington Palace, so we had a wonderful morning

If I have the opportunity, I would like to stay at the Royal Garden Hotel again and meet Mr. ADAN

Thank you for the wonderful time (‚Å† ‚Å†Íàç‚Å†·¥ó‚Å†Íàç‚Å†)

133,"Good Bed, poor Breakfast","Rooms, facilities, toiletries, location, reception and concierge all very good. Food and drink experience in the ground floor dining room is consistently poor, but particularly at breakfast time. If you would like Tea or Coffee with your breakfast make sure you order it the night before. It is difficult to get any attention from the waiting staff as they all appear to be too busy talking amongst themselves.",3,2024,06,10

Room service is available and there are bars and restaurants in the hotel and nearby. 

We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Kensington area.",5,2024,05,31

133,London Hotel Break,"Short break in London at a great hotel, with easy access to the tube line and next to an excellent variety of shops and restaurants.  Highly recommend.",5,2024,05,30
133,Nice but noisy room running water,Hotel itself is very nice and breakfast was excellent with such a variety of food to choose from. Staff were very welcoming and friendly. What ruined our stay on the 9th floor was the sound of running water virtually all night not sure if it has to do with Air con or we were told some works were being carried out. I hardly slept which ruined the following day and was unable to walk around the museums and left London earlier than expected. Such a shame as we paid a lot of money to stay for one night and the noise ruined what would have been a great stay at a nice hotel ,3,2024,05,30
133,Excellent location - great staff - very enjoyable stay,"Excellent location - right on Kensington High Street, sandwiched between the shops and Hyde Park, 5 min walk from the tube and just down the road from the Royal Albert Hall.
The staff were excellent - polite, friendly, helpful & efficient. They made the stay feel that little bit more special. 
Our standard double was not huge, but it was very clean & comfortable, with an excellent shower. You have to pay extra for a view over Kensington Gardens, though.
Very good breakfast, with lots of choices, and constantly kept stocked up.",5,2024,05,28
133,"Great hotel, shame about the access to the car park","Had a lovely room overlooking Kensington Gardens and was a very comfortable stay. Food was great and drinks in the piano bar was very good with excellent service. Highly recommend that. Unfortunately, trip was ruined a little due to the terrible access to the car park which will destroy your wheels on your car and the difficulty in even speaking to the parkbee car park reps. Shame because the hotel itself is really nice. ",3,2024,05,28
133,The best London hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in.,"Faultless and I don‚Äôt say that lightly. Over a good 25 years my husband and I have stayed in dozens of hotels in the city and none have come close to The Royal Garden. Firstly this stay was special because it was our first since my husband almost lost his life at Christmas. I had advised the hotel as we had a couple of requests and not only did they honour those but they upgraded us to a stunning room over looking the park AND placed some extremely thoughtful gifts in our room. A wonderful lady (who I had the pleasure of meeting upon check out) had handpicked some items for us. We were incredibly touched. The room itself was joyously quiet, a great size and the view was so relaxing. The fluffiest towels ever and everything you could want or need on hand. The bed was extremely comfy. Breakfast was OUTSTANDING. The quality of everything was excellent and whilst a buffet, all items were fresh, hot and delicious. Eggs and coffees are available on request when seated. Every member of staff we encountered was delightful, welcoming and friendly but the front of house reception staff really shine here. I can‚Äôt say thank you enough for making our first stay away from home since our life changing event, such a memorable one that we will never forget for all the right reasons. We will always choose The Royal Garden from now on.",5,2024,05,27
133,Caroline & Steve Scotter,Absolutely fabulous upgraded immaculately clean room room with superb views. Extremely good service. Couldn‚Äôt fault anything. Very convenient to walk to Royal Albert Hall and enjoy the parks.,5,2024,05,27

133,5 Stars all the way!,"The entire team at Royal Garden went above and beyond. I truly felt welcomed. Thank you for the 5 star service! I would defiantly recommend this hotel to anyone. 

",5,2024,05,21
133,Overall poor,"Bedroom very cramped - between the end of the bed & the wall - stubbed toes 4 times.
Breakfast experience poor - Maitre D not acknowledging us as we waited to be shown to a table. Tea/Coffee didn't arrive until halfway through breakfast. No granulated/caster sugar to go with cereal. No teaspoons for grapefruit. Ran out of butter - delay in replenishing supplies. ",2,2024,05,20
133,"Lovely hotel,  great location","We had a delightful time at the Royal Garden.  The service was excellent.  We had one meal in the restaurant which was nice.  The room was well appointed.  Every staff member we dealt with was pleasant and efficient.  I asked for a small extension of the check out time,  and it was graciously granted.  I have already booked a return visit.  And High Street Kensington is a lovely place to stay!",5,2024,05,19

133,Awesome Hotel (perfect for Royal Albert Hall),"This is an amazing hotel in a cool location. We stayed for the Mountbatten Festival at Royal Albert Hall which is only a short stroll from the hotel.

Room overlooked the park with a great view 

When we arrived we had a nice surprise as the hotel had left us a cake and some bubbly. I usually don‚Äôt like chocolate cake - but this was lovely. Probably the best cake I‚Äôve ever eaten!

Breakfast was perfect - great choice and quality 

Can‚Äôt wait to return",5,2024,05,19

133,A great stay!,"I had a lovely stay at this property with my sister to celebrate her birthday. The staff were extra friendly, and we absolutely loved the breakfast buffet - one of the best I've had! The Chinese restaurant on the 10th floor is also a must-try! Stunning views of London and absolutely gorgeous food. ",5,2024,05,15
133,Great Weekend Stay,Very welcoming and friendly. Staff always very helpful.  Attention to detail and very attentive. Love this hotel ,5,2024,05,07

Noise from the piano bar until 1am

Rooms on the first floor not renovated yet
",2,2024,05,07
133,Comfortable stay in close to central London,"The newly refurbished rooms are love and spacious, lovely views over Hyde park. The room is cosy and the bed is so comfortable, had an amazing sleep. Only issue is the screen casing doesn‚Äôt work I‚Äôve stayed in this hotel a few times and they still haven‚Äôt fixed the problem.",4,2024,04,29
133,Sunday lunch for a birthday,We had Sunday Lunch in the Origin restaurant. It was a good experience and our table was by the window overlooking Kensington Gardens. Our waiter Istvan was very friendly and attentive. The food was very good and good value too.,5,2024,04,28
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"Great location, great staff, great experience. Definitely going to return on any future trips to London. ",5,2024,04,18
133,Great place to stay near Kensington High Street,"We loved our experience at the Hotel. Check-in experience was great. Needed to extend the stay (originally booked via Expedia) by one day and the check-in person was able to ensure that we were able to do that without having to move to different room. Housekeeping was perfect every day too. Yes, the elevators were 'tiny' (compared to what we see in US), but we never had to wait for elevators for more than a few minutes...  and yes, even the pillows were nice and soft:-)",5,2024,04,15
133,Amazing Royal Garden Hotel in London!,"An absolutely amazing hotel. The beds were really comfortable to sleep in and they provided tea, hot chocolate powder, biscuits and coffee for use. Water bottles are refilled daily and they have a desk to work at. Didn't really eat at the hotel, but I'm sure that they have delicious food. Rooms were really clean and I enjoyed my one week stay there.",5,2024,04,09
133,Superb Anniversary stay,"We booked one night at this hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary and couldn't have wished for anything more superb in all respects.
The hotel itself is spotless and most welcoming with spacious rooms, public areas and every attention to detail.
The staff are individually the most friendly and efficient we have ever experienced in all our previous stays at London hotels.
Our stay was made very special by recognition from the staff of our wedding anniversary and we really appreciated the lovely extra touches that made us feel like important guests.
The hotel is perfectly placed over looking Hyde Park and very convenient for visiting all surrounding areas with excellent links to central London.
Thank you for making our stay so very welcoming and we shall certainly check in again when visiting London.",5,2024,04,06
133,The Royal Garden Hotel: simply convincing,"The Royal Garden Hotel at the Kensington Garden keeps what it promises. We experienced a friendliest team, the best service,  even at night, when the safe in our room didn't open. Every morning we were welcomed by a great breakfast, the perfect start into the day.  
We recommend this perfect location to have a fantastic stay in London.",5,2024,03,28
133,"Magnificent all round, highly recommend.","Stayed for an overnight to attend a concert in the Albert Hall, ideally located only a 10 minute walk from the venue.The hotel was superb, great service from very friendly staff,beautiful well appointed and spotlessly clean room with a lovely view.
Couldn't be any better, highly recommend.",5,2024,03,27
133,Returning Guests,"Stayed at this hotel 3 times a week over 4 years some years ago on business.  More recently, having now retired, my wife and I have used it for short trips to London, normally to take in a West End show and dinner. 
The hotel has been upgraded to keep it fresh looking and we enjoyed the hotel, the excellent service and location. ",5,2024,03,26
133,Loved the hotel and area,"Loved waking up to the view of the park. We have stayed here a few times and it‚Äôs always perfect. After a long day of sightseeing, it‚Äôs nice to take a stroll in the park, sit on a park bench and have a cup of tea. Whole Foods and Marks & Spencers are 5 minutes away, as well as Kensington High Street Tube station.",5,2024,03,26
133,Lovely room overlooking Hyde Park,"We had a fantastic room overlooking Hyde Park ... eventually .... in spite of having booked this, we were initially allocated a room overlooking the road but, to be fair, the staff were exceptionally pleasant and sorted the problem out quickly.  (Unlike the White Swan in Stratford on Avon whose management were far less than truthful rather than sort the issue - but that is another story!).  The hotel doesn't look much from the outside but the rooms and position are excellent.  It was a joy to wake up to a view of Hyde Park and yet have the convenience of a tube station close by for trips to the theatre.  The museums and Royal Albert Hall are a short walk away.  The staff were all excellent and very friendly and the breakfast was wonderful.  Would I stay again?  Definitely.",5,2024,03,26
133,A very pleasant stopover,"Stayed for 1 evening and had a very pleasant stay. We had a room overlooking the park so that afforded a lovely view. In general, the food at the hotel's restaurants are great and the service excellent.  The room was comfortable and clean. Overall a great experience.",4,2024,03,25
133,Overpriced and Bad Service,"I have had better service and atmoshpere in 3 star hotels. London prices are insanely outrageous but this is really overpriced for what it is. Service is bad, workers seem like zombies. Room was not ready at check in but seems embarrassing for a 5 star hotel. The only thing that saves this place is the modern rooms and cleanliness. Everything else was crap to be honest. Would only stay here if a room was maybe 100-150 quid, not more.",3,2024,03,25
133,The story a snowglobe and kindness,"Wow. Wow, and once more Wow.

One morning, while staying in the hotel, my 4 years old daughter took out her new snowglobe in the lobby and it fell and broke creating a small mess. She was, obviously, crying.

In the evening, when we returned to the hotel we found a new snowglobe in our room with the attached note. Basically, Amy from the hotel bought us a new snowglobe!!! Amy, thank you so much.

Other than this small (and amazing) story, this is the third time that I stay in this wonderful hotel and as always it is top notch!",5,2024,03,24
133,Brilliant staff and wonderfully situated hotel,"Deluxe double room, clean, pretty and comfortable. The staff at this hotel make this hotel the gem that it is! From the moment you enter, they are ready and waiting and beyond helpful. As a solo traveller, I was helped tremendously by John, Andrea, Harry, and more. My holiday was made more special by their kindness and attention to my well being. 5stars",5,2024,03,24
133,Great location friendly staff,"A functional clean and welcoming hotel in a great location (especially for the Royal Albert Hall). 

Staff were great, bar and restaurant overlooks the park, food was good if not stand out. 

Rooms comfy and have everything you need. I was woken by banging and clattering from a next door room / service area.",4,2024,03,24
133,Amazing staff!!,"The staff are so kind and welcoming. Vyan was the sweetest, I love this hotel and the breakfast was amazing! The staff is super friendly. I really recommend having the breakfast, amazing food. Everyone who works at the royal garden will welcome you with open hands.",5,2024,03,23
133,Amazing Family Stay.,"We had a lovely stay at the Royal Garden Hotel, amazing service, in particular a special mention most go to Vyan and Joyce who delivered our breakfast to our room , they were both a breath of fresh , great ambassodors for the hotel. Also a special mention to the head of security of the Hotel who kept us informed during  the marches taking place in London. All ensuring that my family had a thoroughly enjoyable stay.",5,2024,03,23
133,Min Jiang unique.,"Incredible views from the hotel. Min Jiang lovely food, probably Best Chinese Restaurant in London and United Kingdom.
The blonde lady manager with glasses doesn't have any people skills. Please give her some extra training.
Tim reception manager very polite and professional gentleman.
A big mention to Andrea Tudor Operations Manager, very professional and always going above and beyond for me and my wife.",5,2024,03,21
133,Excellent,"What a great experience. Great hotel, location, comfort, food. Everything was perfect. The service was good, the staff were friendly and very helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a perfect location in London. Close to Hyde park, lots of shopping and places to eat. ",5,2024,03,21
133,A gift in London,"Excellent! Since the arrival, greeted very nicely. The entrance is stylish. The personnel is very attentive, nicely dressed and presented. Amazing room, with lots of snacks and great toiletries. Great location. The view from the 8th floor is lovely. Highly recommended. The restaurants are perfect.",5,2024,03,20
133,Great staff,"Excellent friendly staff. Quite basic rooms, small. But excellent location and the bed was really comfortable. 

I do think more could be done to continue the 5 star rating it‚Äôs listed at in some areas. ",4,2024,03,20
133,Poor service,"The attitude of the staff is very impolite. They didn't even say 'thank you' to us when I provided my ID and credit card to them. That's should not happen in the high-level hotel. It's very terrible. But I saw they are being polite to other people, perhaps that is not because we are Hongkongese. I can't believe that will happen in the high level hotel. I paid 200 pounds and more to get those service, it's not make sense. ",1,2024,03,19
133,Fabulous hotel,"Superb location for the Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Park. Very upmarket hotel, with polite, professional staff, we were upgraded and the view from our room was the best. The nearest tube station is just a 6 minute walk away.",5,2024,03,19
133,Super solid family hotel,"Nice rooms, lots of space, excellent breakfast, right on the park! Recommend for families of 3 who want more space or 4 or more who like an adjoining room setup. Location is also really great- easy walking to the museums and many great restaurants.",5,2024,03,19
133,Lovely stay,"Well located hotel , excellent staff friendly and warm full . Housekeeping was great easy access and professional concierge services. Accessible Taxis at a glance . Animated and clean lobby . Maybe one remark narrow space for closets when your a 2. ",5,2024,03,19
133,Very comfortable with service above and beyond,Mum and I stayed for her 93rd birthday. The staff from the booking to the concierge to the doormen couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful and special thanks to Emma and the front desk staff for the lovely handwritten + signed birthday note + surprise,5,2024,03,17
133,Very nice stay,"Staff was friendly, professional, and accommodating. The hotel is close to the underground and had a bus stop right in front making travel around the city extremely convenient. The breakfast buffet and menu is good as well. ",5,2024,03,15
133,Outstanding in every respect,"Went for a one-week trip with the family (two adults, two young children).  Room was large and well-appointed, with an incredible view of the palace and gardens.  Staff were outstanding and bent over backwards to make sure we were happy.  Breakfast was really memorable.  Overall, a truly outstanding hotel experience.  I've stayed in most of the nice hotels in London and this was my best experience ever.  Highly recommended!  ",5,2024,03,13
133,Royal Albert Hall visit,This is a fantastic hotel very close to the Royal Albert Hall and has 2 excellent restaurants. The rooms with a view of Hyde Park are well worth staying in and the night view from the Min Jiang restaurant is superb.,5,2024,03,13
133,Nice stay,"We had a lovely stay with the family. Great location, beautiful hotel, good food and nice rooms. They aren't very big though for a mini suite and the beds are quite small but we had a nice stay at the hotel.  ",4,2024,03,13
133,An excellent experience,Every part of our stay was first rate. I can't think of anything I would change.. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. The food was delicious and served by very attentive staff. Our room had spectacular views across Hyde Park and was extremely comfortable.,5,2024,03,13
133,Don't use food services at the Royal Garden Hotel,Rooms are very comfortable and well appointed.   Staff are courteous and helpful.  Food quality in the main hotel restaurant is very disappointing.  I appreciate the waiter advising against ordering several dishes but even those recommended were small overpriced and not very good. Don't eat in this hotel.,3,2024,03,12
133,Will definitely stay again,My wife and I came to attend a conference at the hotel. I cannot fault the hotel in any way. The newly refurbished rooms were tastefully modern and spacious with beautiful big windows overlooking the garden. We will definitely stay again!,5,2024,03,12
133,Lovely hotel but where's the deposit they owe me?,"The hotel was beautiful and our room was outstanding. However what killed our experience was the aftermath. We travelled at the start of February and were told at the desk they had to hold a deposit of ¬£150. We ended up having breakfast one day so they deducted this from the deposit... and it's now a month later and they still haven't issued me a refund. I got on to the hotel endlessly sending a load of emails about this and they'd send vague emails back saying it was sent but my bank can't see the refund being held at all, so it shows that they just haven't given me my money back. This experience kind of killed our enjoyment because it's a month later and I'm still owed ¬£86 from the hotel, and I've found it so hard to keep in contact with anyone who emails me about it! The hotel is lovely but I'd be really careful when giving a deposit of any kind as it's caused me so much stress.",3,2024,03,11
133,Stay at Royal Garden Hotel,"Wellcome at the reception was exceptional.
I had to change my room two times and the staff was very helpful.Room service and the selection of food was great.I also loved the view to Kensington Garden.The only thing this hotel was missing was the swimming pool.
Also close to Whole Foods was great.
I will definitely come back .Thanks for all of you helping me out duting my stay.Especially Emmaüôèüèº",5,2024,03,09
133,Our Family's Best Hotel Stay Yet,"My family of 4 stayed at the end of February and the service, cleanliness, and location of Royal Garden Hotel really stood out as the best we had ever been to so far in Europe. My parents are elderly and we had large luggages, and the hotel porters were so very kind and helpful with carrying them, both when we arrived and left for the airport. The front desk and concierge staff were very warm, welcoming, and professional, and housekeeping was excellent. Occasionally I would be able to hear noise from one of the adjacent rooms, but I do have sensitive ears (my other family members couldn't hear the noise) and it wasn't anything significantly loud that it kept me up at night.

The hotel is located right at the edge of Kensington Palace and Gardens and is only a brief walk to Kensington High Street Underground Station, with one bus stop right outside the hotel doors and another less than 2 minutes walk away - making it a quick journey to the center of Westminster for all other tourist attractions. It is also conveniently near grocery shopping, dining, and fashion shops. I believe this hotel was on the expensive side, but you certainly get the quality that you pay for, and more. It's my hope that we will be able to vacation again in London, and I would easily choose to stay at Royal Garden Hotel again in the future.",5,2024,03,08
133,Andrea Tudor,I had to have a medical procedure in a London Hospital so we decided to stay at the very  convenient  Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington  for a couple of weeks - I was in hospital for five days while my wife stayed in the hotel herself - massive shout out to duty manager Andrea Tudor who really looked after us - his level of dedication & professionalism is a credit to the RGH  - look after him - we had breakfast most days plus a couple of meals in the restaurant - food & service 5 stars - all in  an enjoyable stay in the city given the circumstances - would definitely recommend this hotel,5,2024,03,06
133,"Luxury Hotel, Great Picing, Excellent Friendly Service",Great location and super efficient check-in offering a warm reception. Friendly and welcoming staff providing advice and local knowledge made our stay perfect. Room was comfortable with everything you we needed. Thank you.,5,2024,03,06
133,"Wedding Anniversary at Royal Garden Hotel, London","A memorable weekend thanks to the hospitality of Royal Garden.
The suite, with views across Kensington Palace Gardens, was marvellous. It was spacious, had comfortable /  elegant facilities - even underfloor heating in the bathroom. In a word - luxurious.

Staff were all courteous, polite and helpful, without being obsequious.",5,2024,03,05
133,Great location but a bit tired.,"Fantastic location next to Kensington Palace Gardens & 4 minutes walk from the tube station.

The room was quite small & the TV was very old 7 channels did not work. 

Breakfast was very good with lots of selection. ",3,2024,03,05
133,Very nice stay at the Royal Garden,Service is excellent and the hotel is very well located. I attended a conference and the foos and accomodations were top notch. There are many good restaurants in the area and the Kensigtington High Street tube statiion is very close making it very easy to visit London.,5,2024,03,03
133,Not a great place for sleeping,"The heating didn't work in the room and they took their time to fix it. The doors are paper thin, so a party on my floor meant there was not much sleeping taking place, despite noise-cancelling earphones and a sleeping pill. ",3,2024,03,03
133,Charged Twice.,I was emailed by Henrietta from the booking team stating that the room needed to be pre-booked. As I was suspicious that this was a scam I thoroughly checked with the Hotel who confirmed that this was a legitimate request. On leaving the hotel I was charged again and the Hotel refused to refund the double payment. They confirmed that the email from Henrietta was legitimate but still refused to refund the double payment. This has been reported as Fraud and I would urge all guests to check that they haven‚Äôt also been scammed by this hotel.,1,2024,03,02
133,Great hotel for a London stay,"Great location overlooking Kensington Palace gardens, close to all the tourist locations which are easily accessed by public transport.The hotel exceeded our expectations, our trip was a gift for a special celebration which was marked by the hotel with balloons and flowers in our room and a bottle of champagne and some cake. Totally unexpected. In addition the hotel upgraded our room to have a palace park view. The staff were welcoming, friendly and efficient. Breakfast was extensive and well presented. I have no hesitation in recommending the Royal Garden Hotel as a great place to base your London stay.",5,2024,02,27
133,back home,"I used in the past for business travel and  now  after several years  I came back with family as I was sure I could find the best balance between hospitality, location and price . 
It was all great and in line with expectation.",5,2024,02,27
133,Short break in an excellent hotel,"Very pleasant and helpful hotel staff. Hotel well positioned just off Hyde Park. The Chinese restaurant was ok but did not live up to its statement of being the ""best"" in London. It was full and rather noisy. Service was good but the food was nothing particularly special ",5,2024,02,27
133,Excellent,"Fantastic stay. Wonderful staff and spotless, comfortable room. Would definitely recommend. Very well situated and easily found. Nothing was too much trouble. Bathroom toiletries were lovely and the bed super comfy ",5,2024,02,27

Lovely food, within walking distance to the royal Albert hall & Kensington gardens 
Great music, lovely wine selection, we would definitely stay again 
Definite ease for parking ",5,2024,02,27
133,A friendly international hotel,"Very well located just a few minutes‚Äô walk from the tube station, Albert Hall, restaurants and shops.

Reception was welcoming and professional. The room we were allocated didn‚Äôt really conform to its description, so they immediately upgraded us and were charming in the process.

The second room was fine, with a good bathroom that had separate shower and bath: not so usual these days. Penhaligon products were provided too.

The bed was large, if a little too firm for us. Generally, the corridors seem a bit tired and need a refresh. The Piano bar is best avoided, especially if they have raucous live music on a Saturday night! We didn‚Äôt try the food, simply because we were in Kensington, which offers hundreds of restaurants of all types.

One star off because of the need for decorative updates, which we understand are in progress, but generally recommended.

The best things about this hotel, apart from its location, is the staff. They are friendly and engaging, from the very pleasant Doorman, to the front desk/ porters, and the cleaners. It makes a big difference, thank you.",4,2024,02,26
133,"Location is great, sleep quality not so much","I brought my wife and daughter to the hotel for the night for a special birthday weekend and while the hotel was very nice I found some aspects dated for the price like charging points and lack of. 
We all found the beds an issue, the master bed was very hard and lead to an uncomfortable sleep which I didn‚Äôt expect and my daughter was on a pull out which she complained about having springs digging into her all night. The rooms and bathroom was well presented but when sleep in one of the most important parts of a hotel, especially one that‚Äôs 5* in the centre of London we all just expected more. It‚Äôs did dampen our visit to the royal Albert hall the next day, as well all had aches from our nights sleep. 
The breakfast was lovely but I have to note we were seated at a table with crumbs of food on the bench seat and under the table which is not great while trying to enjoy you breakfast. Your fresh juice and yogurt pot were a triumph",3,2024,02,26
133,Superb!,A fantastic stay with beautiful views and a superb room. Staff were highly attentive and professional and went the extra mile to sort out an issue with the parking and a gift in our room for our anniversary.,5,2024,02,26
133,Special stay for sons 7th birthday,"We stayed 2 nights for our sons 7th birthday, his first ever time to London. The hotel was amazing and the staff were excellent, especially Emma on the front desk who arranged a special surprise on my son‚Äôs birthday. The kids also received goodie bags on arrival which they absolutely loved. The whole experience was fantastic and we will definitely be staying again on our next visit!",5,2024,02,25

133,Perfect getaway for weekend with great location and food,"If breakfast is the most important meal then this is the place for it. Probably the best place in Europe for breakfast and lovely scenery overlooking the Park.

The rooms are quite cosy and well decorated and spotless clean throughout. Top service.. Royal treatment almost if you didn't have to pay for the stay. ",5,2024,02,20
133,Super efficient and super welcoming !,"From the greeting at the door, to the very efficient check in to the lovely touches to celebrate our anniversary The Royal Garden hotel was excellent.

133,Beautiful Property!,"This a true 5 star property, they make you feel special from the beginning to the end. Clean, comfortable, great location, close to everything but in a quiet area, so we relaxed. However the most special about this hotel is the politeness, kindness and attention to details of the associates. We are amazed with the service! Go to the Piano, great live music and good ambiance, need to make reservations. The rooms have everything you mat need, and the room service was topnotch. ",5,2024,02,19
133,Lovely half term treat!,"Lovely hotel for an overnight trip to London in half term. Staff were really friendly, our room was great, with a view overlooking Hyde Park, breakfast was delicious and there was so much choice. All in all, a lovely treat and I‚Äôd definitely return.",5,2024,02,18
133,Staying on a building site,My daughter booked a 2 night stay over the telephone 14/16th feb2024 and requested a quiet area which we were assured would happen It materialised renovations were being done during this period with loud drilling and hammering banging all Thursday afternoon and Friday morning was unacceptable Have stayed at this hotel for many years but post pandemic has declined in many aspects Lost its 5 star style and charm which starts at reception/ check in Seems to have moved to a standard of high end budget Found a half empty bottle of hand sanitizer and packet of chewing gum under a cushion The renovations would have been planned in advance and noise levels known I suspect showing complete disregard and respect towards guests Scrolling through the reviews are not reflecting a 5 star residence Abysmal,2,2024,02,17
133,Outstanding Service & Amenities,"My 2nd visit to London was truly one of my best stays due to the outstanding service and accommodations provided by the Royal Garden Hotel. The entire staff was attentive, friendly and pleasant. Room was clean, great views and very comfortable.",5,2024,02,16
133,Out of this world!,"Where to start with this amazing hotel. From the moment we got out of the car we felt like Royalty. The doormen helped with our luggage and my wheelchair, when I went to check in they opened up a desk for me and on booking in we were given an upgraded room. The young man who booked us in took us to our room and showed us around and we had the most incredible room with a fantastic view of Kensington Gardens and right across London. We had lunch in Origin, which is great for a light snack as well as a meal, and evening meal was in Min Jiang Chinese restaurant on the 10th floor of the hotel. Wow, what amazing food that was and you really do need to have the Beijing Duck, it is out of this world! This needs to be pre-ordered. Food and service was outstanding!  After our meal we continued our evening in the Piano bar, and there was a live singer and piano player who really was excellent and made the evening more special. This hotel was like a little oasis in the chaos that is London. On our second day we went off out for the day, but when we came back we found a lovely bouquet of flowers in our room from the hotel. We went for breakfast both mornings we were there and the choice was vast, the hot selection was brilliant, and the service excellent. On our arrival I had spoken with the young man who booked us in about the fact that we hadn't been to the hotel for a while and the reason why. On our last morning at breakfast one of the managers came to our table and brought me a lovely card and gift from the reception team to wish me well. What an absolutely wonderful gesture this was and it really did put the cherry on the cake so to speak. An incredible hotel, amazing staff, wonderful restaurants and bars, what more could you ask for! I would give it 11 out of 10 if I could!",5,2024,02,15
133,Fantastic stay. Highly reccomend,"I cannot recommend this hotel enough.  Everyone working there had a smile on their face and were so engaging, friendly, and helpful.  Taxi Cabs always available out front, superb location, safe, clean.  Highly recommend!",5,2024,02,15
133,Private,I stayed at the Royal Garden hotel with my daughter and her friend as a birthday treat. It was absolutely perfect from start to finish and the staff were all so helpful and kind. We loved our park view suite which was really peaceful and spotlessly clean. Thank you üòò,5,2024,02,15
133,Absolute Bliss,Everything was top class from check-in (upgraded) to dining (both Min Jiang and Origin) through to departure. Beautiful park view included with the gorgeous London skyline to the North and East. Min Jiang is always an annual pilgrimage for us. No hesitation using the hotel for accommodation in future. Even the car park was a joy to use.,5,2024,02,14
133,The best stay!,"Perfect stay, amazing room and lovely staff. The hotel is in a great location and we won‚Äôt be staying anywhere else in the future! Breakfast was really lovely too. The reservation team were brilliant and went above and beyond to accommodate us!",5,2024,02,14
133,Wonderful stay,"Fabulous Park Suite overlooking Hyde Park. Very spacious room with two rooms and an extra toilet. Lovely toiletries in the bathroom and good choice at breakfast.

133,Lovely family trip,Stayed for a night. Reception staff were lovely. Upgraded to a suite overlooking the park. Room was fantastic!! Kids were so excited. Location good for the park and enjoying Kensington. Only slight negative was breakfast as we queued for a while to get in and then table service was quite slow - next time we‚Äôll order to the room. Overall a brilliant stay! ,5,2024,02,13
133,Not great.,"Arriving to the hotel after 20 hours of travel, I was looking to take a shower. Something was wrong with the bath tab which prevented me to take a shower. The receptionist just did not answer the phone. I have rang for 25 minutes. Finlaly, I rang the consierge and he sent someone to fix the porblem. But this person was not able to fix it so he called the receptionist, but she does not answer the phone. I was not able to take a shower. Terrible experience. I have never heard of a hotel where you cannot get hold of the front desk. I have tried housekeeping, but no asnwer there. You can just imagine the feeling of getting to a hotel and all you want to do it to get into the shower and relax.",2,2024,02,12
133,Great time is a super place,"Aside from a bit older building from the outside, the inside is modern and new and very nice. The service is excellent and the rooms as well. Only little negative is the noise of the closing doors of the rooms.",5,2024,02,10
133,Okay could do with some improvement,The hotel seems a little out dated and could do with updating. Along with basic hotel etiquette for the staff. The hotel was located in excellent area with plenty shopping options. The tube station was also located 5-10 minutes away from the hotel,3,2024,02,09
133,My stay,"This was a very good experience and a lovely stay. Everybody was so nice to us and helpful and made sure we had a pleasant stay and felt welcome.

133,Lovely. Situation,"My ""go to"" London hotel.  Ideally situated for tube, shops, Kensington High Street and Kensington Palace and gardens.  Service always excellent, rooms are a good size.  If you need a quiet room then you need to book a room facing the gardens rather than the road!",5,2024,02,03
133,"Comfortable, friendly staff, great location","A premium hotel, good deals available can make for great value though. Very comfortable and quiet room, spotlessly clean. The staff were welcoming and friendly, and the location is great with the tube and shops near by.",5,2024,02,03

133,Best Hotel I have ever stayed at.,"My family and I stayed here over the weekend for a night and it was the most outstanding hotel I have ever stayed in.

133,Amazing 2 night birthday stay,"Here for a special birthday weekend. The hotel is fantastic and the staff amazing. We stayed for 2 nights and can not fault anything, even evacuating when the fire alarm went off. Although they should have had a fire Marshall on each floor to advise and assist.

The food in the Chinese restaurant was also exceptional. 

Big shout out to Poriska in the Origin restaurant,  she was amazing and her customer service skills were top notch and because of her we will definitely be back, hope management recognise her in some way.",5,2024,01,29

133,Enchanting Escape at the Royal Garden Hotel: A Sky-High Oasis in Kensington!,"Had an incredible experience at the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington! Warmly welcomed by the courteous reception staff, my partner and I enjoyed the upgraded room. Nestled on the 8th floor, our room boasted a breathtaking cityscape view. The accommodations featured an exceptionally comfortable bed, ample space, and a charming platform area with a small sofa and chair by two expansive windows‚Äîa perfect spot to soak in the mesmerizing view day and night! The only minor drawback was the unmarked platform, leading to a few stumbles in the dark. Despite this slight inconvenience, the beautifully designed bathroom and overall stay left a lasting impression. Highly recommend",5,2024,01,28
133,Great Hotel Stay,The hotel is clean and the staff is amazing. It was a perfect location to take public transportation and see many sights in the West End. There are a good selection of restaurants inside and around the hotel. ,5,2024,01,25

133,"Friendly welcome, great service","The go to place if you need or like to be in the Kensington area. The team is friendly and helpful. The lobby is spacious and the rooms are correct. This is not a central London hotel, but it's perfect to attend a show at the Royal Albert Hall or if you like a visit to Harrod's.",5,2024,01,20
133,Our favourite hotel,"We celebrated our Silver Wedding Anniversary with a trip to London staying at the Royal Garden Hotel - our favourite hotel in London!  We found champagne, gateaux, and fresh dates in our room - such a lovely surprise! ",5,2024,01,19
133,"Excellent, professional service","The staff are excellent, professional and genuinely friendly.  A real pleasure to stay.  Particular thanks to the concierge team - one helped me carry my very heavy photography kit to the car park.  Very lovely lady brought breakfast in the morning to my room.  The prawn Laksa on the room service menu was utterly divine.",5,2024,01,17
133,Very comfortable hotel in great location,"We have stayed in the Royal Garden several times. We particularly like the location and the comfort of the rooms. The staff are friendly and helpful. The location is great for sight seeing, but also quiet - which is not easy to find in London!",5,2024,01,16
133,Wonderful stay celebrating Anniversary Weekend,"I booked this hotel via Secret Escapes of whom I have used in the past and are always excellent .
My husband was a wee bit apprehensive when I booked as he read some poor reviews on TripAdvisor.We tend to use TripAdvisor as a monitor prior to traveling. 
I shared my concerns with Mohammed from Guest relations prior to our stay  and advised him we were celebrating a special Anniversary . He ensured  me that we would be looked after and we certainly were .Thank - you Mohammed . 
Let me start at the beginning ; 
On arrival at hotel by taxi we were met by an extremely professional Door man who looked after our luggage whilst we checked in .
We managed to receive  early check in as room was ready. 
We were checked in by Hammad the front officer Supervisor . He was so ,so welcoming and very polite. 
Our room was large with beautiful views of the park .Everything in room was immaculate . 
We then went to Origins to have  a light refreshment prior to our appointments . We were served by Istvan who was friendly and efficient . He also looked after us at breakfast with other excellent staff. 
We had breakfast included which was very good - I was impressed they served freshly squeezed orange juice. We are not too keen on buffet food as never hot enough for us but at a minimal cost you could order fresh from the breakfast menu .The omelettes  were very tasty . 
On our anniversary ,Saturday the 13 th of January we went to Min Jiang for dinner . In the past we have eaten many times at China Tangs at the Dorchester when staying there. It was our true favourite in London until we visited Min Jiang . 
It was truly perfect , ambience , service and food. They also acknowledged our anniversary with a beautifully presented dessert . 
Throughout our stay I met regularly with the Deputy manager, Andrea - he was extremely visible and professional.He sat near where you could collect national newspapers which my husband loved as he likes to read the papers daily . 
These were all the many positives. 
Our only slight negatives were ; 
We found the Piano bar to be a bit noisy for us but people around us seemed to be enjoying ,the staff were excellent and very attentive . 
Housekeeping was a bit erratic , they left us with no bath towels and took away the fresh ones they had delivered the night before. They also did not replace our coffee cups or milk . 
Certainly once you asked for small issues to be resolved t was done so quickly and the staff were very friendly . 
The dressing gowns in room need replacing as like sandpaper . Slippers were comfortable . 
So in summary we would vote our stay 9.5 out of 10 . 
We loved the location and would definitely return . 
I do hope this review assists you when deciding to stay at the Royal Garden hotel , Kensington . Just Do it as Nike would say.

133,3 day visit,"Lovely staff, very helpful, hotel very clean and location excellent for our trip. The classic rooms are quite small but functional, great to have a bath and shower, the breakfast was excellent such variety.",5,2024,01,16
133,Excellent experience,"a pleasant, warm, welcoming, and delightful stay for our study trip. Situated in the heart of the city, the location is ideal, offering easy access to many popular destinations and points of interest. It is flavorful and offers a good selection.",5,2024,01,15
133,5* Gem in fantastic location to explore Central London. Excellent service from every staff member we encountered. 10/10,"A 5* gem in a great location at a very reasonable room rate. We were a family of 4 who stayed for 1 night in room 336 (a studio) which has excellent views of Kensington Palace. From arrival to departure the service was outstanding and I really hope this continues. We were greeted by the doorman who assisted with our luggage, he was very friendly and helpful and the receptionist was also fantastic and offered us an upgraded room. This may not always be possible but on this occasion they upgraded our stay and the room was fantastic, spacious, comfy beds, small dining table for 4 and a separate lounge which can be converted to another bedroom. There were 2 washrooms one with a shower and bath and a smaller toilet room with was basin in the hall. Housekeeping made us up another bed and again they were excellent, nothing was too much trouble. The room looked newly renovated and was very spacious for Central London. We had breakfast in the room which was delivered by the most enthusiastic and friendly staff member, she was excellent as was the breakfast. In fact the service by all staff members was excellent 10/10 for our stay and I'll be back again very soon. Keep up the great work!",5,2024,01,10
133,Exquisite,"Mr Ali Adan was superbly fantastic. A truly kind gentleman and a big credit to the hotel. Professionally resolved an issue we had and showed my family such hospitality. We are definitely going to make it our stop in London every time and will highly recommend the Royal Garden Hotel to business associates, friends and family.",5,2024,01,09
133,Personal touch,"Stayed many times at The Royal Garden hotel, recently came across a lady called Vyan, who works in room service. What a beautiful, exuberant and special  lady to be served breakfast by. Makes our stay here in the hotel  all the more joyful ..... Gerry and Bonnie",5,2024,01,07

133,Definitely no 5 star hotel,"Very, very noisy at night (sleeping was almost impossible). By no means a 5 star hotel, more like 3. We ordered breakfast to our room, since the hotel claimed we'd be able to (the main reason why we booked the hotel in the first place), but the order was completely ignored even though we did everything correctly. The receptionist couldn't give an explanation why the breakfast didn't arrive and mostly shrugged the issue off. The waiters of the restaurant were very friendly and polite. The location was good as well, but it's not worth the trouble. Not coming back.",3,2024,01,03
133,Oustanding,"Such a lovely hotel in a great location.  Staff and rooms are first rate.  Been staying there for more than a decade, will always come back.  Easy to get to by car and tube and being so close to the park is a huge bonus.",5,2024,01,02
133,Terrible experience,"Awful the worst hotel I‚Äôve been in my life,they didn‚Äôt have dental kits and with a really rude tone they told me they don‚Äôt have any left,and they didn‚Äôt gave my money back yet,very old building and dirty sheets and mirrors ",1,2024,01,01
133,Experience,"Overall experience was v.good 
Welcoming was excellent 
Break fast was very good 
Location is excellent 
Room cleaning was acceptable 
Room dining was very good 
I have face some issue during my checkout and the experience was not as expected due to manager attitude which was not acceptable at all. ",5,2024,01,01
133,We will not return to this place,"I will describe my whole experience here Upon arrival the suite was not ready We waited for about 45 minutes
My reservation was for a suite with King size bed and a Queen size sofa (it as not Queens size)
Upon checking the rooms we noticed that the room had two twin beds After a brief argument the issue was resolved
The suite 701 needs renovations with stains all over The room lacks of USB connections,  the curtains do not have pulling sticks
Housekeeping was correctly done
Breakfast was good and two individuals were really great
Most of the time two elevators out  of four were out of service
This was a big minus for a large  5 stars hotel
We had reservations at Origin restaurant (at the hotel) on 12/24/23
The food arrived cold  two times and we were overcharged cocktails and the returned food
We were able to get a refund a day after
We had reservations made three weeks in advance at Origin restaurant for today 12/31/23
We arrived on time and we were offered one tiny table in the corner
We requested to have another table with window (half of the restaurant was blocked with no use)
The bearded male in suit refused saying that all window tables were reserved (hard to believe with half of the restaurant blocked and empty)
We told him that we were leaving. He gave us attitude shrugging his shoulders
We requested to talk with the manager on duty
Another waste of time This hotel has clear problems of management She did not resolve the dinner issue neither the elevators out of service
I honestly feel that this is a 3 /2 stars hotel due to lack of professional management and complete lack of customer service

133,Fantastic stay,"Amazing hotel, with great service and friendly staff. Throughly recommend this hotel, particularly for families. The hotel room was spacious allowing the entire family to enjoy the overall experience.",5,2023,12,31
133,Very friendly staff,Very kid friendly and highly recommended. They gave our baby a very cute teddy at checkin. Make sure to ask for a renovated room to get the best set up. Not the closest to the tourist type areas so lot of tube and taxi. ,4,2023,12,23
133,London,"Great hotel, close to everything, rooms are spacious and very comfortable. The staff are very friendly and make sure to get you whatever you need when you request for something. Definitely the right hotel for a London vacation",5,2023,12,22

Kensington park & Hyde park side from the higher floors best views of London skyline.

133,What a superb hotel,We chose this hotel to be close to Hyde Park and it certainly did not disappoint. A large and well appointed comfortable room which had a great bed for a good nights sleep. Will certainly book this hotel again!,5,2023,12,19
133,Nice hotel but totally soulless,"Nice hotel but totally soulless, staff were quite robotic. Rooms nice and comfy, food excellent but lacks atmosphere in the restaurant. I would say fine for a corporate trip but not for the family trip we were on",4,2023,12,19
133,Royal Garden,"Rooms were clean however it had multiple insects 

The corridors were terrible the hotel entirely didn‚Äôt smell fresh smelled like food and ONIONS 
receptions blonde with short hair was super rude. AC wasn‚Äôt working and I had difficulty sleeping with the noise at the hotel. Bed was comfortable ",3,2023,12,18
133,Birthday Stay made Perfect,"Booked trip for boyfriend‚Äôs birthday.  Lovely hotel in fantastic location. Amy on Reception could not have been more helpful.

133,Stay at RGH,Excellent staff and restaurant. The rooms facing the street are extremely loud due to traffic. You need to put a extra insert into the windows to eliminate the noise. I would not book a street facing room there again.,4,2023,12,17
133,It wasn‚Äôt a pleasant stay,"Room was dirty and felt like it wasn‚Äôt cleaned for a while, it smelled terrible. Wifi was so poor, staff were not friendly and helpful. I asked for late checkout and offered to pay additional but it was rejected saying they were full. I checked online they had plenty of rooms available. They definitely need to improve customer service. ",2,2023,12,17
133,Fantastic Stay,"Great stay , staff were extremely helpful and friendly , the room had been recently refurbished and top notch .  The breakfast service was very attentive! Probably the only negative was it was very loud music in the piano bar ! However it was work Christmas Party season ",5,2023,12,17
133,Great hotel and wonderful staff,"Great location 3 mins from the underground and easy to get to. Our room had a wonderful view over the park. The room was very clean and tastefully done.

133,"Expensive, and wanted more.","The hotel was gorgeous, the welcome from the reception team was superb. It was just the little niggles that disappointed:
1. Room not suitably provided for for 4 people.
2. Lack of rectification of mistakes made.
3. Extra charges for a la carte breakfast items and service charges for serving coffee and taking your crockery away.
4. Reservations are the only way to guarantee a visit to the hotel bars. Even for hotel guests.
5. The public areas were ridiculously warm",3,2023,12,12
133,Rooms not ready!,"Arrived at 3pm room not ready after 3 hours waiting in the bar at 6pm still not ready, complained as we were going out and eventually they found a room with the TV not working, overall hotel is lovely ",4,2023,12,10
133,A disappointed loyal customer,"After being a loyal guest for more than 15 yrs a was mistreated by their new poor staff the room was less than what I paid for, lied to, not even an apology was offered or some kind of refund for giving me a room that is lower tier than what I paid for",1,2023,12,08
133,A firm favourite,"The check was a great experience, lovely gentleman that checked us in. The room was just perfect, the view was incredible. Our children‚Äôs first experience of London was made by the hotel experience. We will definitely return.",5,2023,12,08
133,Classy hotel overlooking Kensington Palace,"Great location and excellent hotel. Spacious rooms, many with an exceptional view overlooking Kensington Palace and Gardens. Superior staff attention and service and an impeccably clean room and bathroom. The bathroom sparkled and the amenities were Penhaligon. A completely top class stay at affordable price.",5,2023,12,07

133,Business visit with Daikin ,"The Staff were exceptional and made us feel very welcome and special. We had both lunch and breakfast in the Origin Restaurant and it was very slick service. The Food was excellent with plenty of choice and constant checking of quality/quantity of choice. 
The beds were comfy with lovely pillows too.  We would have liked more ""breakfast tea"" than other selections  ",5,2023,12,05
133,The height of comfort,"From check-in to check-out, the team at the Royal Garden Hotel deliver the best hospitality. Fantastic rooms with great facilities. The Origin Restaurant was great for lunch and breakfast. Treat yourself to a stay here - you will not regret it.",5,2023,12,05
133,Great view,At beginning it was nice welcoming from staff and the category of room I choose was super because of the park view and room space also i liked the area of the hotel small shopping in the street and nice food specially Italia style it is near from Harrods I missed one thing near place to have shisha or hooka the weather was cold but I enjoy it.,5,2023,12,05
133,Disappointed again,"Greeting at hotel was excellent,it‚Äôs our 27th time at this hotel.Before Covid this hotel was as good as it gets but now not so.Came back after seeing a show for a relaxing drink at the bar only to be told a private function is on so you can have room service which for a 5star hotel is appalling.It was like a night club with DJ thumping out really noisy sounds.Breakfast this morning the staff seemed so disorganised.This is my second poor stay,we compare to Lancaster Gate 5star as well which is on a different level sorry",3,2023,12,01
133,Kept my souvenirs despite saying they would mail,I am very disappointed in the security team at the Royal Garden Hotel. I left our souvenirs behind by mistake so I contacted the hotel to let them know what happen. I was told they were found and would be shipped my way. I offered to pay for the shipping and then I never hear back from Debra or Jay. They are items I can‚Äôt replace - including gifts my children bought with their money. Shame on them for keeping something that doesn‚Äôt belong to them. ,1,2023,11,30
133,City Break,"Four nights in this hotel made an excellent city break. The location, next to Kensington Gardens, is away from the main tourist areas of the West End but close enough to be able to enjoy them. Rooms are very comfortable and restaurants are very good.",5,2023,11,29
133,Lovely hotel in a wonderful location in London.,Nice hotel in a lovely part of London.  Staff very helpful and room lovely.  Very good location too.  I always ask for a high floor as it's usually quiet.   Thank you for a lovely stay.  Walking distance to shops and the parking at hotel handy but a little hard to drive through.   Otherwise a lovely stay.,5,2023,11,29
133,Highly recomended,"Very good experience even for a five star hotel. 
We highligt the staff willingness to please the customer. 
Very good breakfast. 
Excelente room and very clean. 
Very close to the center of London. 
Highly recommended. ",5,2023,11,29
133,Mixed bag of a hotel,"Unfriendly welcome, not compatible with a hotel purporting to be five star.  Club sandwiches at 1am were delicious, and presented well for room service‚Ä¶ so this was a plus.  Piano bar had a comfortable lower lounge area - so this buffered the loud music- that was not unwelcome!",3,2023,11,28
133,Rating it 5stars,Worth the $$. Staff were attentive to our requests & needs. Stayed at a suite to accommodate for 4 adults on top floor with a beautiful view. Staff were very attentive to our requests and needs. Huge bathroom with tub & shower. Location so close to the Tube & local market right on the main strip. Felt very safe to even walk back from the Tube after a show getting back after 11pm,5,2023,11,28
133,Just ok,"Very average experience this time around. You don‚Äôt feel welcome as a returning guest for the nth time. Personal requests not taken into consideration and very minimal attention to detail and to guest needs. 
WiFi connection and location very good. Origin service was good and breakfast was simple but nice. In room dining inconsistent in quality and portions and lack of consideration to people request by adding pork when it was clearly not on the request for a spinach omelette. Lighting in bathroom annoying. One sink in a master bathroom of a suite and shower basin drainage clogged. ü´§üòë
Room request not honored and although it was same category and name it was a poorer version and location. Quite frankly disappointed this time around. ",3,2023,11,27
133,Lovely Staff,"Very friendly front of house (particularly AJ) who was very polite,warm and professional.
The housekeeping staff and concierge were excellent.
Also a great location and easy to park the car for Christmas shopping.
Well done we will return next year.",5,2023,11,26
133,Royal Garden Hotel - Slightly disappointing!,We have stayed several time in the past but find that the refurbishment of the rooms and the main restaurant to have spoilt the luxurious feel of the hotel - quite sterile and utilitarian. Little extras seem to have disappeared which made the stay seem rather ordinary. We will look elsewhere in the future,3,2023,11,22
133,Definitely NOT ROYAL with no Garden View and Horrible Customer Service,"I checked into Royal Garden Hotel last night at 6 pm into a hotel room where the heat didn't work. They sent maintenance up to fix the heat issue. I am jet-lagged and so went to bed early. Woke up at 4 am to a room that was 16 degrees. Called the concierge who had maintenance come up and fix the issue again. The heat never really kicked on and at 5:30 am it was again freezing cold in the room. At this point, I'm pretty irritated. The concierge said he would transfer me to the front desk but left me on hold indefinitely. I tried to call back but the phone just kept ringing so I took myself downstairs to sort the issue out myself.
Management moved me to a new room which albeit bigger is so heavily scented that I have a headache and no palace view which is what I paid for. I contacted the company where I booked the room to see if they could intervene. It is now 6 am. I asked the company to see if they could organize a refund because it is obvious that I'm not going to be able to get any sleep because the rooms are sub-par. The management refuses to offer a refund because they feel they have moved me to a bigger room (without a view and with a strong scent).
It is now almost 7 am. I am sitting in the lobby of the hotel, hoping my headache will subside waiting for my friend who is picking me up today to wake up and hopefully get me out of here before too long.
I understand that maintenance issues happen but the customer service is really, really, really lacking!",1,2023,11,20
133,Albert Hall,A simple one nights accommodation for a birthday celebration with my daughter. It was the perfect stay; Ideal location and excellent accommodation in a spacious twin room. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. Thank you. ,5,2023,11,19
133,Not great,"Don‚Äôt stay on second floor. Very loud at night and no view whatsoever 

Room was out of date. Got a note that needed to go front desk to make larger deposit which was not the case and wasted my time. Staff was fine ",2,2023,11,18
133,Luxurious and Welcoming Kensington Hotel,On arrival we were given a free upgrade and enjoyed what was a wonderful restful night in a beautiful and clean room. All the staff were polite and kind and the food in the 10th floor Chinese restaurant was the best I have ever tried.,5,2023,11,17
133,Recent stay,"I have stayed previously at this property and returned recently for an overnight stay 
Entire experience was extremely satisfactory 
Received recently refurbished room on 7 th floor which was good 
Breakfast following day was excellent 
No issues staff responsive and helpful 
Look forward to returning for future stays 
No issues at all very enjoyable ",5,2023,11,16
133,WHAT A TREAT,"Had a very enjoyable stay, the hotel is in an enviable position right next to Hyde Park. The room was spotless and had great attention to detail. The food was really delicious and all the staff were very welcoming and friendly, a particular shout out to Vyan who delivered my room service breakfast this morning - what a beautiful soul, so warm, friendly and kind, she had a lot of pride in her work and is an asset to the hotel! Will definitely be back again.",5,2023,11,15
133,Great hotel,"This hotel is located in a very prestigious location.  It‚Äôs close to parks, pubs, shopping, hop on/off bus etc.  The staff were excellent.  The room was nice.  We had breakfast included in our stay, which was excellent.  We had a great stay!  ",5,2023,11,15
133,5 star service,"We had a great stay, my husband and I were very surprised at the complimentary gift in our room. I mentioned on my notes when booking that we are celebrating our wedding anniversary and Henrietta and Fiona and of course the team made sure to make it special and a memorable stay. We would definitely to come again ",5,2023,11,15
133,Wedding Anniversary Weekend,"Had a very enjoyable stay  Despite a heavy police present for weekend  due to Armistice Weekend. Must have been really stressful and difficult for staff to get to work..
They did not allow it to show. There were very professionally and conscientious .
Do not think breakfast is excellent. Food and water in  tea pot not hot. 
We were than presented a breakfast chit to sign which was in fact a ¬£7 service charge for a buffet breakfast , which was prepaid. Never had that anywhere before!
We had a great weekend concierge staff were extremely helpful  also Sal in Origin. The bar staff there were also very professional!
Than You, all for a great experience!",5,2023,11,15
133,Excellent property,"Everything was clean and spotless, the staff was very helpful and friendly.  The in-hotel gym was closed, but that was about the only complaint we had.  they have 3 different restaurants here - a piano bar, a Chinese restaurant, and another restaraunt.  lots of great views!",5,2023,11,14
133,Short break,"The hotel was lovely, we have stayed before. Before booking this time we decided to take advantage of a birthday offer (15% discount) that had come come through for my husband as his birthday was coming up, when I phoned to book this I was told it was only for October, I said well why did we get it as his birthday is November 10, the lady I spoke to said, as most people have October birthdays we can only offer it for then‚Ä¶really? Ridiculous! We still booked as we were attending the Albert Hall and as it was a birthday treat we wanted to stay at your hotel but I feel cheated why send an email with an offer only to renege on the deal with a silly excuse!
Our stay was very good.",5,2023,11,14
133,Great hotel in London,"This hotel is at the best location, next to Hyde park, Kensington Palace. Very convenient for the taxis, Uber , buses and subways. Near to all kinds of restaurants. 
The staffs are very courageous, helpful, kind and human. 
The reception people were very understanding. It was my birthday and at evening I receive a birthday cake and a champagne. 
The breakfast room located across the Hyde park with the view of that park. Breakfast was great all kinds of food that you were wishing they had. I have enjoyed staying there. If I travel there again, I will stay there. Thanks to the manager Andrea Tudor, checking on us all the time. He is exceptional.
Housekeeping was doing an outstanding job. Thanks",5,2023,11,13
133,Great location and excellent service,"Stayed for 6 nights. Excellent location near Kensington park and Palace. Great area to visit and shop. Service is impeccable. The equipment in the rooms need some upgrading (cooling and heating system was malfunctioning + the mini fridge needed to be replaced). All in all, the rooms are very comfortable and service is of high quality, expected of this hotel. Would recommend. Close to everything.",5,2023,11,12
133,Lovely weekend,"We had a great weekend apart from the chaotic breakfast which was rescued by Fabio. The view from our room was stunning, the location was great with the number 9 bus stop right outside the door. 
Staff were all helpful and friendly.

133,Beautiful hotel in prime location. location.,"I would never stay anywhere else in central London. Comfortable, professional, friendly and in a great location. Great choice of restaurants on site or good room service. High Street on your doorstep with super shopping, eateries to suit all palates and underground 10 minutes walk.
Kensington Palace and Gardens next door. Royal Albert Hall 5-10 minutes safe walking at night. Bedrooms are larger than most in central London with every facility. I've stayed in other hotels in this area but none compares!",5,2023,11,11
133,Pleasant and comfortable stay,"We enjoyed our stay overall. The room, although on the smaller side, was functional. The hotel staff, both at the front desk and throughout the establishment, were exceptionally warm and friendly. The staff at the Piano bar were kind and helpful, and the music added a nice touch to our stay.",4,2023,11,09
133,One of the best hotels in London at a reasonable price,We absolutely loved our stay at the Royal Garden.  Hope to come back real soon.  Everyone is super friendly and the hotel was incredibly clean and efficiently run.  It was a great trip! Thank you Royal Garden. ,5,2023,11,08
133,Excellent,"Lovely welcoming service, Very clean room with a nice view, Room service fantastic, Shops, restaurants, parks all near by!

Issues with Tv, and no iron in room, however these were not a major concern during my trip :)

",5,2023,11,07
133,Great location,"The hotel location can‚Äôt be beat. It was away from all the hustle and bustle, but still close to shops, restaurants and the underground. The staff was very nice, giving us recommendations of places to eat despite the late hour. Our room was spacious, clean and updated.",5,2023,11,05
133,"Outstanding Staff, wonderful property","
I have stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel many times and would not return. If I did not think it was an excellent property. The welcome I am given is always warm and friendly. The Staff really are exceptional. Given the price of similar properties in central London. It also represents excellent value. . I would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this photo to anyone and have indeed done so with many of my friends.

133,Great stay thanks to izel,"Gorgeous hotel - we had the most special bithday as the staff made it amazing ! Thank you Izel for everything ! The view was exceptional and they were so accommodating with everything ! Would come back in a heartbeat!!
",5,2023,11,01
133,Nice Quiet Stay in London,"I quite liked the layout of the hotel rooms with a separate platformed office area. I also used this area to do yoga and it was the perfect space for it. I travel a lot and yoga helps! Room service was good and quick. The beds were very comfy and the tv was basic, but adequate. The hotel staff were very friendly as the concierge gave me several waters upon request and even ordered me a car to the airport informing me of demonstrations in the area, which was quite helpful. The neighborhood is awesome, not noisy, but with great shopping and right next to Hyde Park and plenty of food options. I would definitely stay here again! ",5,2023,10,31
133,My dream trip,"Lovely hotel, very elegant, good location, very clean, friendly staff, good  customer service, excellent breakfast. Beds could be more confortable but bathroom was lovely.   I loved the piano bar, with live music and very good environment.  ",5,2023,10,31
133,Beautiful Hotel,Very clean and Morden hotel .All staff members are attentive and polite above all the food was amazing from breakfast to dinner .Will definitely recommend and will definitely be back again.I love how the hotel is very central making it easier to travel around London.,5,2023,10,31
133,The best experience,I have been going to royal garden for almost 20 years now and i am very loyal to them and their level of professionalism is perfect and the rooms are the best for me i love everything in this hotel plus i think my memories makes it very special to my heart. its next door to the hyde park which is perfect for me again ,5,2023,10,30
133,Fantastic overall - minor points.,"The only minor points were that the room (Garden Deluxe) did not come equipped with an iron and ironing board, the bar did not have a wide range of cocktails (no Margarita?) and the coffee ordered with breakfast did not arrive.",5,2023,10,29
133,Dingy room,"Our room was not as advertised, it had a stained old carpet, broken sofa bed, smell of smoke and dated wallpaper. Guess the renovation process never reached our room. Amazing views and breakfast though.",2,2023,10,26
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"I stayed at the hotel for a family weekend in London. The hotel was is in a great location for the sites including Harrods, the Natural History Museum, Hyde Park, Royal Albert Hall etc. The hotel had a good atmosphere and staff were really friendly, attentive and efficient. Rooms were comfortable and well maintained by staff. Great value for money too.",4,2023,10,26
133,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel. Highly recommended for business, pleasure and family trips. We arrived early morning and were greeted by the reception, provided water and our luggage was taken to the room in no time. Highly recommended. ",5,2023,10,26
133,Very nice hotel,"This is a great place to stage out of if you are taking in London.  Convenient to the underground and many restaurants in safe neighborhoods, the hotel is a cut above.    The piano bar is an attraction unto itself. Fun, interactive and just spacious enough to not have to wait in line for a drink.  ",5,2023,10,25
133,Great stay at the Royal Garden London,"Location was amazing and front desk, bellman etc very welcoming and helpful. We arrived very early and they had our room ready promptly. The piano bar was lively and great fun on a Saturday night. Service in the bar was top notch. ",5,2023,10,25
133,5 Star hotel still?,"We have stopped at this hotel many times over the years, it is just a shadow of the hotel before the pandemic, the restaurant we believe was actually better before the refurb, before there was a lovely round table for fresh fruit, cereals etc, now a wooden rack that looks like something from Masterchef to choose your ingredients from.

The Piano bar is really disappointing, we used to enjoy drinking in the old Berties bar, now you can't even hold a conversation because the Piano/singer is so loud, the hotel needs a bar that you can just talk to friends without having to shout.

This hotel used to be so much better.
",3,2023,10,25
133,Beautiful central hotel,"Stayed here again recently. Clean and beautiful hotel overlooking Kensington Palace, loads of amenities right on the doorstep and a bus stop to take you into central London outside the door.
Friendly helpful staff and amazing pillows!",5,2023,10,25
133,Perfect Hotel,"We love staying at The Royal Garden Hotel in lovely Kensington and think it's perfect! From the lovely setting to the friendly and helpful staff, it meets all our needs for a perfect stay. Highly recommended.",5,2023,10,24
133,Very Good,"Had an excellent stay. Warm and efficient welcome. Room was very good but the bath requires some repair. Excellent location of the hotel. Very good breakfast. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Could improve amenities such as more drinking water, toothpaste. ",5,2023,10,23
133,Location,Excellent location. Very close to tube and bus stops. Friendly staff and good food.  My only complaint is the room was very outdated. I stayed here for a week with my wife and 22month old. They provided a cot for the child and the location allowed us to go on walks in the park nearly every morning and find great restaurants within just a few minutes walk. Would definitely stay here again.,4,2023,10,21
133,Baffling,Sever lack of communication throughout staff leaving the guest to be caught in their mess over and over. Staff take no accountability or make and apologies for trouble caused by the hotel. Not 5 stars,1,2023,10,20
133,Nice Room and Good Location,"The room was great and the hotel in a good location. Check-in and check-out experiences were smooth and quick. However, might want to consider booking own transportation instead of relying on street hails by doormen.",4,2023,10,19
133,Royal Garden Hotel,Excellent hotel. Comfortable beds. Great location. We all enjoyed our stay here and found facilities to be very good. Staff were all very helpful. This was a last minute booking which proved to be an excellent choice,5,2023,10,19
133,My disappointing stay at the Royal Garden Hotel,"My family and I are regular guests at the hotel for many years now and we have always enjoyed our stays here.
Unfortunately this time I was quite disappointed with my stay which was for 3 weeks, as many things were not up to 5 star standards at all.
First of all, I did get food poisoning from the hotel lobby lounge after eating a Caesar Salad, the chicken was not cooked well and as a result I stayed up all night and morning very unwell.
I was advised to speak to the Deputy Manager Andrea Tudor, who told me i need to inform security. I‚Äôm not sure what security has to so with that. Anyhow indeed the security came and asked me a few questions and that was it! I was not offered any compensation nor did they follow up with me or let me know anything until now. The attitude of Mr. Andrea was quite unprofessional and I was completely discarded . This is not 5 star quality or how to deal with guests‚Ä¶ nothing was done about it until this day! 
Secondly, the room service has been a disaster, there is not one time I ordered room service where they have not forgotten to bring something even as simple as Cutlery. Every morning when I ask for an omelette with spinach they never have spinach. How is this 5 star service or quality?
Lastly housekeeping as well has not been good. I had to call and complain that they put torn bedsheets on the bed, no extra water given and many times missing towels  and room not cleaned that well at all! 
I have to stay I am quite disappointed at my stay this time and makes me think twice now about me or any other family member returning back to the hotel. I have stayed 3 weeks this time at the hotel which has been quite expensive and I did not receive the 5 star or even 4 star service treatment or service or quality at any level.

I am extremely disappointed and dissatisfied at this point and would hope that the management would take all of the above into account and do something about this.
On a better note I would like to highlight Salwa, Kim,  Finner and Nathen from Origin who have been absolutely superb, and have gone out of their way to make us feel welcomed and at home. A big shout out to Jay as well from Sales who‚Äôs been of great help and always prompt and as well just lovely to deal with.",2,2023,10,18
133,Missing bracelet!!!,"Missing diamond bracelet.
We stayed for two nights (10-12 Oct) and during the stay my wife‚Äôs diamond bracelet went ‚Äòmissing‚Äô.
Haven‚Äôt subsequently read Tripadvisor and after sharing our experience with others we found out this is not a rare experience at this hotel.
The staff asssured us there would be an investigation but this turned out to be lip-service and they were very dismissive of both the incident and us.",1,2023,10,18
133,Good Location,The location was good and suited us. The staff were friendly but the service levels were not what we expected from this standard of hotel. We had a poor experience with a room service order that did not show up and we waited for 20 mins for 2 cups of coffee in the Origin. ,4,2023,10,18
133,Excellent Stay,"I highly recommend this hotel. Great location, perfect for families with lots of shops, markets and High Street  Tube Station is actual near. Friendly staff, great comfort and excellent fruit in breakfast. My stay in London was superb thanks to this hotel.",5,2023,10,16
133,Excellent stay,We had a lovely experience at Royal Garden for 4 days. We had actually checked into a different hotel on our first night and hated it. We walked in the RG hotel to inquire if they had rooms available and thank goodness they did. From the moment we checked in until the time we left it was a great stay with excellent service and friendly staff. Highly recommend üòä,5,2023,10,16
133,Not a 5*,"
I have stayed in many 5* hotels, this one to me is just basic.
It was for my 60th birthday.
Rooms are plain, not fancy at all. 
Showers, the water pours out, so you need to place towels on the floor.
Breakfast was fantastic.

",3,2023,10,16
133,Successful stay,Always a pleasure to stay at this hotel    My family are always made very welcome and we enjoy all it offers   We will return again soon I‚Äôm sure.  The staff are very accommodating as are the facilities there too     See you again soon  ,5,2023,10,16
133,"Great location, could use some updating","This hotel is in a very nice location and the staff are great. We were able to check in early which was nice after a long overnight flight. It is right next to Kensington Gardens and also a short walk from the High Street Kensington tube station. The bathroom layout is super odd -  there‚Äôs only half a shower door and water will spray everywhere. So, be prepared and ask for extra towels because you‚Äôll have to put them on the floor.",4,2023,10,14
133,First Trip to London,"We came to London for my son's wedding last Saturday and ended our 8 day visit with the final 3 days at Royal Garden.  We originally were going to start off our stay there but then had to change our schedule and your Royal Garden accepted our request even though we apparently missed some kind of deadline according to Expedia, who we booked with.  Royal Garden has been nothing short of a truly positive experience.  Thank you!",5,2023,10,13
133,Disappointed guest,"On the hotel's website, where I booked, the picture showed one of their very nice park-facing rooms.  Instead I got a smaller room at the hotel.  At best, the website is confusing.  At worst, I was down-graded. VERY disappointing.",3,2023,10,12
133,Excellent family get away,"Amazing hotel, with a warm and welcoming staff. Very comfortable with excellent facilities.
Location made exploration of the London landmarks easy, with close options to all public transport links.
We will not hesitate to stay at this hotel in the future.
 ",5,2023,10,10
133,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel and lovely, welcoming staff and extremely comfortable rooms.  However only 2 desks were open in check in and check out making it extremely slow.  Suggest put more people on desks or have key drop off boxes available.",4,2023,10,09
133,wonderful Hotel,"When our VRBO was cancelled at the last minute, VRBO organized for us to spend a couple days here.  What a treat.  Excellent location.  Close to great shopping and restaurants.  Albert Hall just down the street.  Next door to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace, we felt like we were living in Pride & Prejudice.",5,2023,10,08
133,Excellant location,"We really enjoyed our stay in the hotel. The staff was very helpful and the room was perfect, very important for me as I am confined to a wheelchair.
Both inside and outside were wheelchair lifts next to the steps.
The location next to Kensington Garden is lovely for a walk but it is a short distance to the Royal Albert Hall where we enjoyed a concert.",5,2023,10,08
133,overpriced suite,"We upgraded to a suite which had a beautiful view of the park however the king size bed was very uncomfortable and needs upgrading.  The rooms were spacious with 2 TVs, a bathroom and a guest toilet.  If the mattress was changed it would make this a A* room.",4,2023,10,07
133,First trip to London,"Royal Garden hotel was a prefect location for are 1st trip to London. We felt it was easy to walk, cab or tube to all our destinations. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. The room was clean and updated nicely. Nice views of the park. As we did a lot of touring on our stay we didnt use much of the hotels amenities. We did eat at Ming Jiang for dinner the first night.  We felt it was OK , not as special l as it was hyped up to be. Just average.  I would definatly stay there again.  ",5,2023,10,05
133,The perfect London venue,"Reasonably priced, super location overlooking Kensington palace and gardens, very good service and facilities including private secure parking. Will certainly be returning.  

A fantastic hotel, what more is there to say.
",5,2023,10,03
133,Relying on its location,"Stayed for another two nights having decided to give it another go after last time‚Äôs poor experience. Park side rooms are refurbed so better than the others (by far). Welcome at check in was absent. Had a meeting room for two days and it was awful. No key for the room, had to wait for an hour for a flip chart, and no phone to call for help, so had to keep going to reception. Service in Spice was 2/10. Guy in Piano bar was good but the bar isn‚Äôt worth visiting. Dark and soulless. Min Jiang was great. Won‚Äôt be back - Oh and the plaster I found in the shower was still there when I left",2,2023,09,30
133,Bland Functional Hotel,"Hotel has a wonderful location, what a pity it has been so poorly decorated and is so bland in many areas. The rooms are very small, functional, but lacking style. Room 128 was tiny and bland. Breakfast is really good; however, service is very hit and miss, the service bill gets bought over to the table very fast, despite their being no service. The piano bar is noisy, be better without the musician and just soft background music. I suppose the words inconsistent, and average come to mind unfortunately. Hotel is in need of a re-furnishment it really is tired. Some staff very friendly and hospitality driven others miserable. ",3,2023,09,29
133,Recommeded. Excellent situation,"Confortable room, great park view. Silent place. The bathroom is big with shower and bath. At the reception the girl was very nice. The situation is perfect if you like go walking into the park, to V&A museum, Albert Hall, Notting Hill or around. ",4,2023,09,28
133,Very quiet room,"Excellent location, everything by is there. Super comfortable beds and very quiet evenings, you can sleep and not hearing neighbors. Amazing beautiful park just next to hotel, enjoyed everything. Loved it.",5,2023,09,27
133,Weekend trip with friend,"I was very disappointed by the service of the hotel on request of teabags for my room for which I had to wait 45minutes and make multiple calls. Also disappointing to find a moth in the bathroom and bedroom, and finally the error of my title, and also considering I told them at the desk that I am a Ms and not a Mr. Today I get an email addressed to Mr again! ",3,2023,09,26
133,ASAP EU conference,"Best banquet and meeting staff I have ever worked with, service was excellent, food was outstanding and meeting space was perfect. Friendly and focused staff throughout the hotel.  Breakfast was great, location next to Kensington gardens was amazing. ",5,2023,09,25
133,They care about you relative to what you spend and it‚Äôs blatant,"After 20 hours of flights we got in and it was 5 hours before check in which was entirely on us. I explained the situation to the front desk who acted extremely accommodating and promised to prioritize getting ours turned over given what happened. I was very gracious as we really didn‚Äôt have the energy to find something to fill 5 hours. What we actually got was hour after hour after check out of ‚Äúno quite yet‚Äù after needing to stand in like over and over for an update. If they couldn‚Äôt accommodate the situation, that would have been entirely fine as again it was our fault. But leading us on with assurances while stuck in their miserable lobby for half a day when we would have found alternative things to do speaks volumes about how much they value guests. ",1,2023,09,23
133,Poor and a little fly,"Stayed here many times  over the years. Went this weekend with our son and had been handed a 25% discount card for restaurant. Son went for breakfast on checkout was told it didn‚Äôt apply for breakfast (the meal everyone goes for).

Little bit fly and poor show I‚Äôd say when the restaurant manager in approach by myself didn‚Äôt seem to even care.

It‚Äôs events like these that cause us to simply try somewhere else on our next visit. And they simply aren‚Äôt interested.",2,2023,09,23
133,Excellent experience,I came for some drinks with a friend and it was such a nice experience. I would like to say a HUGE thanks to Sall because of her help and positive personality. We had very nice conversations and she was explaining the ‚ÄúLondon fashion week cocktail‚Äù what we have tried and it was incredible. The staff was very helpful and polite as well and we really enjoyed. Definitely will come back.,5,2023,09,21
133,Fantastic experience!!!,"l was with my friends to drink something we has an amazing time specially your staffs are amazing!!!

133,ORIGIN KENSINGTON RESTAURANT: a lovely place to dine.,"My companion and I visited the restaurant, Origin Kensington. 
From the very start, we were warmly welcomed by Sal as if we were family. 
She was warm and gracious.   As was our waitress, Karina. 
Cocktail were excellent, especially my very dry Grey Goose martini. 
There was a pleasant pause whilst we were enjoying our drinks, going over the menu with Karina.  We ordered a shrimp dish for my companion.  I began with a bowl of wanton noodles and pork.
This was the only flaw I could see in the otherwise excellent meal:  
the wonton bowl was way too big and generous and my companion wisely suggested that I should leave room for my entree.  
Both Sal and Karina spent time with us at dinner, getting to know us and Vice versa.  This is something very rare in restaurants.  We truly appreciated it, as I believe so did the staff.  
ORIGIN KENSINGTON RESTAURANT gets 5 * in my opinion.",5,2023,09,19
133,We arrived as weary travelers and left refreshed and relaxed,"We had a lovely time staying at the Royal Garden Hotel. My husband and I booked an Airbnb nearby that turned out to be terrible, our trip was saved by staying at the Royal Garden. The staff are helpful and attentive, and clearly take pride in their work. We found our room sparkling clean, very well designed and comfortable. The location is perfect with easy access to the tube as well as lots of great restaurants, shopping, and attractions nearby. I would recommend staying here to anyone visiting London. ",5,2023,09,19
133,Not quite 5 star,"Service let the hotel down, but great location.  Room was too hot, service at breakfast slow, no valet parking. Would not rate this 5 star due to poor service received which needs to be improved.  Would expect staff to better at breakfast service like other 5 star hotels. ",3,2023,09,19
133,Excellent hotel near to Kensington Palace,"Very good hotel, excellent locality, specious rooms with natural light and air. Nice n healthy breakfast, polite and ever smiling staff. Well equipped board rooms, very near to tube station, parks & gardens.",4,2023,09,18
133,service sucks,"Good location, bad service. Expensive. Stay away from this one. 
Only reason that I would stay in this hotel is the location. It is close to the tube and bus routes and there are many restaurants and stores.                                                                                                    ",1,2023,09,18
133,Sliding downhill over 20 of staying here.,"This hotel used to be a great joy to visit but this last stay was a great. Disappointment.  Most of the old staff seems to have disappeared, the restaurant/bar is unwelcoming and had the charm of a warehouse. Bedrooms are good still, but the Mon Jiang restaurant is a shadow of itself. Again most of the staff are new and not experienced enough. Take breakfast in your room, it‚Äôs terrible to get served downstairs.",3,2023,09,16
133,Excellent service and big thank-you to Salwa from the restaurant,"They have Great food with also a great views on kensington garden palace which is so
Enjoyable! Service is perfect. I m local and love getting liked after by Salwa who is always helpful, smily and super welcoming! All that you need. ",5,2023,09,16
133,What a view,The location of the Royal Garden is superb and the views from the upper rooms across London and the Park are wonderful. Sadly I was only staying for one night as I had an upgrade to a magnificent suite on the 8th floor where I could have happily stayed for weeks.,5,2023,09,16
133,DO NOT STAY HERE,"I‚Äôm writing this review to warn the fellow travelers about Royal Garden Hotel. This was my first trip to London and I should have paid more attention to the reviews when I was booked this hotel. 

Let me begin by giving a shout out to your hotel staff who were the only positive experience about this hotel. I would have given this review 0 stars if it wasn‚Äôt for them. 

The Royal Garden Hotel is definitely NOT a 5 star hotel. It‚Äôs more like 2-3 star hotel so I‚Äôm not sure how you‚Äôve managed to keep your 5 star status. 

We arrived at the hotel at 12:30 pm. We had flown for 11 hours and the cab ride from the airport to the hotel took an hour so we were so tired when we arrived, but our room was ready for us so we hat to sit around until 2:30 to be checked in AND not only that, we were put in a different room than the one that assigned to us because I had to keep complaining to your front desk to put us in a room right away.  We stayed at room 801:

The carpet in the room was so disgustingly dirty. There were stains on the wall.  Have you tried a black light in that room to see how stained everything is? It‚Äôs utterly disgusting. 

The couch was so old and beaten up. I felt really bad for my brother who slept on the couch during his 2 night stay as my guess and it was freaking embarrassing. 

The decorative lamp was broken and sitting in the corner of the room side ways. Nobody even had bothered to straighten up the top of the lamp. 

The bed was supposed to be a king size bed but you had put two queen mattresses next to each other to make it look like a king size bed which made the bed very uncomfortable. How difficult is it to put a real king size mattress on your king size bed?  And by the way, there were no fitted sheets nor top sheets on the bed; only pillows and a blanket! 

Our room was broken into two nights in a row. Fortunately nothing was stolen because I had locked up all our valuable items which worth over $20,000  in my suitcase. 

We spoke with the night shift manager, Manish, and also the duty manager Andrea but they didn‚Äôt do anything for us.",1,2023,09,14
133,2 Star Room with 5 Star View,"My 4th stay at this property.  First time on 9th floor with garden view.  The 10th floor restaurant is above these rooms.  Each night after midnight it sounded like every table in the place was being moved.  This lasted from 2-3 hours each night.  Wonderful property, just be aware of 9th floor garden view.",3,2023,09,13
133,Amazing Experienxe,"The hotel is really well located, the staff are all great but a special mention to the head host lady, I think her name was Saloua, she speaks French and Arabic which was really helpful for my wife and I. She been very helpful, please if you can share my feedback with this lady. I recommend this hotel to anyone visiting london. Thank you guys ",5,2023,09,11
133,Would recommend,"I was recently having a meal in the restaurant which was absolutely lovely, staff was great and accommodating especially the lady on the desk. Believe her name is Sal(with dark hair)  she is outstanding in her hospitality, great energy and friendly attitude.",5,2023,09,11
133,Very pleased with the customer service,"Sall was very accommodating when taking my booking she did explain the menu to me as I am vegetarian.
I am very happy with the level of friendliness and professionalism I received. Definitely recommend it! ",5,2023,09,10
133,Great service,We really enjoyed our stay! Great room and especially enjoyed going the the restaurant. Special shout out to the host Salwa who took care of us the whole time. Made our stay very memorable and enjoyable ,5,2023,09,10
133,Great Location,"Fabulous location next to Kensington Gardens and High Street Kensington.
Great Whole Foods Supermarket close by filled with delicious organic foods and snacks also Joe the Juicer a couple of doors down to get a early morning juice before a walk in the wonderful Kensington Gardens.Really nice breakfast at the Hotels Origin Cafe.Staff very friendly and helpful .Gym downstairs was very dirty and a bit rundown and in need of a upgrade.",5,2023,09,10

133,Amazing hotel with exceptional staff,"My recent stay at Royal Garden hotel was outstanding. The hotel itself was clean, comfortable, and conveniently located. I highly recommend the Royal Garden Hotel to anyone visiting London. Kudos to Ibrahim, the receptionist extraordinaire, for his exceptional and friendly service. We will see you again soon. ",5,2023,09,08
133,Friendly in the big city,"While being a lovely hotel with all of the amenities you could wish for, this hotel is also full of kind and friendly staff that made us feel comfortable and among friends for our entire stay. Steve the concierge set the tone with his kind welcome, Finn in Origins made us feel we had a new friend and every one of the team we encountered smiled and was very helpful. We are not fancy dressers and our luggage doesn‚Äôt say wealthy‚Ä¶ but we were treated as if we were the highest level guests. We will return and highly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,09,06
133,Royal Garden Hotel üëç,"Very convenient hotel. Good location and has all the functionalities. Close to the park and shops of Kensington. 
Never fails to disappoint and very competitively priced. 
Best to book in advance as it gets booked up. ",5,2023,09,06
133,Lovely hotel,"Terrific experience.  I arrived early (11:00 am) and was greeted warmly and able to check right into my room, which was wonderful after an overnight flight.  The room was very comfortable, clean, and quiet with ample closet space and a mini fridge.  The air conditioning worked well and views of Kensington Palace and Park from my room were a plus.  I slept well, which is unusual when I travel internationally.  I would definitely stay again. ",5,2023,09,05
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"Great hotel, excellent location! Disappointed that the rooms didn‚Äôt have a coffee machine, especially choosing a royal deluxe double room. A big let down for me. Staff are friendly and attentive. Overall great. ",4,2023,09,05
133,Lovely stay / good location for Royal Albert Hall,"Deluxe garden rooms were lovely. Bathroom also very good, excellent breakfast although slightly disorganised on second stay as they brought someone else‚Äôs twice to our table and we‚Äôre t very good at clearing. 
Piano bar was friendly and pianist good but the room needs some money spending to make it more comfortable eg booths which would make it less sparse and cold. Overall good value and would stay again. Very good location for Royal Albert Hall",4,2023,09,02
133,"Adan, the doorman rocks!","Adan literally ran a block to hail a taxi for me at 5:00 a.m. The rest of the staff was good.
Restaurant was overpriced for the quality, in my opinion. However there are a dozen in the neighborhood to patronize.",4,2023,09,01
133,A delightful break.,"We stayed here for a birthday treat and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Our room on the 10th floor was comfortable, spacious, clean and quiet, and with the windows closed at night, we weren't disturbed by traffic noise. 

I have ME and fibromyalgia, and usually find hotel mattresses much too hard. I normally take my own mattress topper with me, but since we were travelling by train, that wasn't an option. I needn't have worried - I've never been so comfortable on a hotel bed. The only downside was the pillows which were pretty much hard and flat. I'd brought a small travel pillow, so I was fine. My husband hadn't and woke up with neck pain each morning. 

Most of the staff were delightful, and I'd like to give a shout out to Aaron Street. We arrived in high spirits, and his welcome was warm and enthusiastic. When I let slip we were celebrating my birthday, he surprised us with a very unexpected and delightful treat.

There was a bit of a mishap with our cases, but it was sorted out easily enough. 

We ordered room service breakfast both days, and it was delicious. To eat that overlooking the city was a treat indeed.

The only thing we found slightly disappointing was the lack of gluten/dairy free options in the restaurant - the ones available were things I didn't like. We come from a more rural location, and chefs will often make me a similar alternative to a menu choice, but that wasn't the case here. In fact, getting gluten and dairy free options in London generally seems much harder than I expected.

133,Thanks,"Nomination of Serina at the front desk as ‚Äúemployee of the year‚Äù. She was very helpful in finding a resolution to the challenge of no walk- in shower in tge room.  Furthermore, she followed up subsequently durin my week‚Äôs stay, seeking assurance that all was okay.",4,2023,08,28
133,Perfect Hyde Park location,"Our first stay since the pandemic lockdowns. The Royal Garden Hotel was a perfect location for our overnight family stay and celebration. The rooms are a good size for central London and the views over Kensington High Street rooftops is a great alternative if you're not on the park side.

The revamped Origin restaurant on the ground floor offered a stylish, calm environment and perfectly cooked cuisine .",4,2023,08,28
133,Very poor service attitude ,Very disappointed with the service at Origin. I was unduly charged for items provided gratuitously. On complaint to the manager Pedro the attitude was very negative. I live locally in South and had visited frequently but I will not do so again,1,2023,08,27
133,Great Hotel,"Very Good location, friendly staff, spacious rooms (Studio rooms), good food. Some rooms with nice views on Kensington palace and park. Very short distance to Hyde Park. Some rooms were renovated, looking forward to stay again in December 

",5,2023,08,24
133,Great Hotel,Stayed here 2 times last month and both were very good stays. Would happily recommend to others in the future. TV worked better in 1 room than the other but did not take away from stay in any way. Enjoy!,4,2023,08,24
133,Good Hotel location but bad reception service,"The hotel is well located on Kensington high street. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The receptionist are not welcoming. They are not willing to try to help you with anything. It‚Äôs very obvious that they are always too busy For you so it‚Äôs always ‚Äònot possible‚Äô or ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know‚Äô. Even if there‚Äôs a lot of positive things about the hotel, the service of the front desk makes me uncomfortable to go back. They don‚Äôt make you feel welcoming at all‚Ä¶not friendly at all. ",3,2023,08,22
133,It‚Äôs ok.,"Service is about 4-5 star
Room amenities is‚Ä¶nahh‚Ä¶

we stayed at their old room which is verrrrrry different from their website pictures. It is out dated! Not just the sofa, cushion, even the curtain has stain on it‚Ä¶
There is no kettle, no coffee machine, no mini bar, no mini fridge in the room. 
The room is not small, the king size bed is huge and comfortable. 
There are Penhailigon‚Äôs shower gel and lotion in the bathroom which makes the room feels kinda luxurious.

Location is good, walking distance to Kensington Palace. Bus is downstairs. Subway station is about 7 mins. Lots of shops and restaurants around.",3,2023,08,18
133,Beautiful hotel and very nice rooms,It was a great hotel and very nice staff. Our only issue was how warm the room was. We chose a hotel with AC and it was not blowing cold air. Still worth it for the park next door and views! Request a fan from the front desk. We didn‚Äôt think to ask until the last night.,4,2023,08,18
133,Good location,"Good location. But they need to improve house keeping not delivering the minimum requirements and security level must improve the hotel needs to look at this very carefully and front office attitude and being racist and giving grumpy face to the guests , Some of the staff are great and some needs to be trained very well it‚Äôs a 5 star hotel and those staff are not serving the guest in this level at all. 
Door men are very helpful and the smile and help you all the time when they are there .

133,"It's true, you can't go back!","Prior to Covid, The Royal Garden used to be my favourite hotel in London. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. I recently stayed there with my family (8 adults and 3 children) and all the adults were disappointed to varying degrees. When we checked in the front desk staff and the concierge  were still courteous and helpful but that's where it ended. Breakfast staff need a lot of training. Some were quite rude and for the most part indifferent. The biggest disappointment was the hotel's buffet breakfast. Hot food used to be fresh and prepared as needed. Now it is all stored in warming pans and left to dry. The back bacon was hard and obviously cooked some time prior to our arrival. Not worth the price!",3,2023,08,16
133,Nice location,"The room was on first floor facing Kensington High Street, so it was bit noisy. 
Specially during the weekends people were myaking noise in the street, engine sound and horns of cars were beeping until late evening.
Better to select garden view room.",3,2023,08,16
133,Disappointment!,"The hotel should be a five stars hotel, but it is lacking basic things like iron in the room. I had a meeting at evening so I ordered an iron. They told me they don‚Äôt have one now and they will bring it the next day! The rooms are outdated and sheets are not clean. When I booked I expected 5 stars hotel service and what I got was hardly 4 stars.
On the other hand and to be fair, the location was amazing.
I don‚Äôt think I will ever stay here again. I am very disappointed.",1,2023,08,10
133,"Amazing location, gorgeous view and spacious room","Beautiful room with an amazing view of Kensington Palace. The room was very spacious and the bed very comfortable.
Location was perfect as we had to go to the French Consulate. Perfect for exploring the museums near by and reaching town.",4,2023,08,10
133,"Excellent hotel, brilliantly located","This is an excellent hotel, located steps away from Kensington Gardens and close to holland Park and Hyde Park. Perfect location if you want to be in Kensington and like walking in the park. 
Breakfasts are good, but expensive. I didn't try dinner, but there is an upscale restaurant on the ground floor and what is supposed to be te best Chinese restaurant in London on the top floor...but the hotel is in an area with lots of great restaurants.
I have stayed here several times, and the rooms are quite nice, but you get what you pay for. A larger room will cost you more money, but probably is worth it.",4,2023,08,06
133,Book without hesitation.,"It is such an excellent hotel. Staff is super polite and professional. Also really nice and helping. 
Our stay was simply perfect. Rooms are updated, clean and really suitable. 
The check in was fast, they let us early check in at 7 am, wich we much need it to shower before going sightseeing. 
Def recommend and hope to be back soon.",5,2023,08,06

133,Business trip,Very friendly staff and extremely helpful. They were superb at ensuring we had what we needed for a business meeting and conference.  Breakfast was superb with a good range of food. They do need to add cider to the bar drinks menu.,5,2023,08,05
133,"Excellent location, great views, good value","Stayed at the Royal Garden after living for many years in Kensington and so enjoyed being back!  The views of the park, the attentive staff, the clean and spacious rooms all make it a great visit!  You can bus to anywhere or walk all over Kensington, South Kensington or go explore Notting Hill!  So many great restaurants, shops and pubs in the area and the park is next door to relax! ",5,2023,08,04
133,Excellent hotel in the perfect location.,"The royal garden hotel is our London go-to. Perfectly situated on high street Kensington, right next to Hyde park, this property has lovely, light-filled rooms and excellent service. We have always loved our stays here. ",5,2023,08,03

133,Truly first class. ,Five star experience through and through. From start to finish of trip to London this hotel definitely does not disappoint. Amazing staff who can‚Äôt do enough for you. Every little thing possible is catered for. Relaxing and rejuvenating stay. We are looking forward to returning. ,5,2023,07,31
133,Outstanding service,"I spent two nights at the Royal Garden with my family (two young daughters).
The staff and service is outstanding. The room was really big compared to the standard rooms in London. Everything was sparkling clean (something I valued a lot). The hotel is very kid‚Äôs friendly, and the location is just perfect for a relaxing day to the park, or a shopping and dining day. I will definitely be back. One more thing, the value for the room was incredible compared to the other hotels in the same category for our dates.",5,2023,07,30
133,Almost 5 stars. I‚Äôd stay again. Wish they fix couple of things.,"Great property. Great location. Great and friendly staff. Piano bar was awesome!!! Check-in check out experience was good.

Sofa bed was absolutely terrible. I can feel the bar of the bed frame. Wish shower was a bit bigger in place of tub.",4,2023,07,27
133,Fawlty Towers Revisited,This place makes Fawlty Towers look 5 star. The first room had blood on the bathroom wall so we were changed to another room with a broken air conditioning sensor and at circa 500 quid a night needed 3 fans in our room. The maintenance man assured is all the rooms were the same as the aircon sensors were in the wrong place everywhere. Don't go in summer!! Nobody apologised or offered a discount at restaurant...in fact nobody cared. Not our first time there but definitely our last. Reconsider your thinking if it includes here.,1,2023,07,26
133,Checked into a dirty room and had people walk into my room at 8 am while sleeping,"I was expecting a good hotel but received a 1 stay hotel experience. 

Checked into my hotel room, the bathroom was dirty. Tissues down the toilet drain and towels on the floor. 

Our bathroom robes had big holes due to rips and they were extremely scruffy. 

While sleeping on one of the days someone walked into our room at 8:55 am. When I woke up and asked who‚Äôs there, they immediately ran away. Reception claimed it was housekeeping but when I asked who‚Äôs there no one ever replied to me. Very unprofessional, I was startled and wasn‚Äôt able to sleep.  

Ibrahim from reception gave us an upgrade to apologize for all these terrible experiences and provided us with an upgrade for a whole week. Felicity then asked us to leave the room on day 2, she literally said ‚Äúa VIP is coming you must leave the room‚Äù. No guest should be told someone more important than you is coming and be treated like they‚Äôre second class. Felicity has no hospitality experience and honestly  this hotel deserves a 1 star for the level of housekeeping and hospitality I‚Äôve experienced.

and comfortable room, very quite at night (at least those rooms that are on the park side) nice international staff. ",5,2023,07,23
133,A great stay in Kensington,"My flight had been cancelled and I had to find a new place to stay until my new flight, so I booked at The Royal Garden. It was wonderful! All staff were super friendly and professional. The accommodation itself was roomy with excellent AC. It was perfect for our needs and we felt really pampered. Next time i‚Äôm London, would definitely book here again.",5,2023,07,18
133,Won‚Äôt recommend it,"We have booked three rooms for a family gathering. 
Contact the hotel to ask how they can make it nice stay for us and check for upgrades, also mention about disabled person, unfortunately I have found them not interested. 
I have spoken to Tim who is apparently one of the managers, his approach was so unfriendly and disappointing. 
He didn‚Äôt help at all, even with upgrades or parking. 
The hotel is not really 5 Star, rooms are very small and needs refurbishment, Carpet was so old and smelly. 
We have left very early and won‚Äôt come back.",3,2023,07,17
133,Ever so slightly disappointing ,"Staff very friendly, room not large but big enough, price quite expensive but that‚Äôs London for you.
The disappointment was breakfast, very expensive and lacked quality you would expect from 5* hotel. Cheese omelette was tasteless and no cheese flavour, mushrooms on toast asked for white bread arrived on brown wasn‚Äôt very nice. Coffee took an age to turn up.Should have complained but not one to do that.we either stay at Lancaster or this one but Lancaster def has the edge.",3,2023,07,02
133,Fantastic location,"We chose this hotel for its location and service and it did not disappoint.  We were welcomed and  assisted when 1 of our vehicles was not suitable for the car park. Breakfast was very busy as were the lifts but both issues we had were addressed professionally.
Special mention for Andreas whose service was impeccable.
I will gladly return to this hotel when opportunity allows.",5,2023,06,27
133,Understated elegance and perfect position ,It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt look like a remarkable hotel but it is really well positioned . The room we got was above the main entrance on the first floor and was surprisingly quiet . We had a newly renovated room which was really lovely with wooden floors and an understated oriental feel about it . Bed was firm; lovely bed linen and soft pillows . Bathroom was a good size although the shower was a tad and overflowed into the bathroom . No safe in the room which is actually unacceptable . Okay size cupboard and nice coffee and tea selection although the kettle was in the cupboard ? ,4,2023,06,26
133,"Great stay, great concierge Edwin","A great stay at RGH. Special thanks to Edwin for his effort to resolve an issue with my TV. Best concierge. The hotel is perfectly located close to the West End, next to the royal park, with a smorgasbord of shops, restaurants and cafes on its doorstep.",5,2023,06,25
133,Weekend away with daughter,"A fantastic hotel . The staff were all so friendly and helpful. Our room overlooked the High Street but there was no traffic noise . The buffet breakfast on a Sunday was lovely. It‚Äôs right next to Kensington Gardens , a five minute walk to the nearest tube station. Will definitely be back.",5,2023,06,25
133,Nice but very tiny room!,"Just stayed here for two nights, greeting and reception faultless as expected,as was door and luggage service.
Only surprise we got was the size of our room‚Ä¶‚Ä¶tiny, ok for one person, very difficult for two, especially went my wife travels‚Äùheavy‚Äù(lots of stuff)
The room really was very small, however we didn‚Äôt complain.
We did however complain when we had no air conditioner working, which they came and ‚Äúfixed‚Äù promptly‚Ä¶.however it was never really very good.
Will put that down to the hot weather! (Needs improvement)
Apart from tiny, the room was clean, well appointed, quiet with a comfortable bed.
Breakfast Buffett was good, adequate (seen better and seen a lot worse elsewhere)
Found all staff very pleasant.
Location excellent.
Would stay here again but in a better room.
Finally, I just find that when you book through a third party aggregator, you often do not get the better rooms!",4,2023,06,18
133,A stay  to forget ,"1. Room is tiny for 2 persons. With luggages, one cannot even walk to the bath room. Rate was ¬£450. 
2. We booked hotel for 2 nights and front desk manger was reluctant to have us cancel the second night until much argument. 
3. Water kettle was non functional, we requested another, still non functional. 
4. Amenities limited, no hair conditional. 
5. Air condition required maintenance to service. 
6. No information on room size shown on booking 

The only positives are
1. Service response
2. Location 

In summary,
Go elsewhere. ",2,2023,06,14
133,"Eddie the concierge is a rude, nasty human and he ruined our stay","When I arrived at the hotel, it was pretty late. We had booked a room with twin beds (it was my brother and I) and instead, we had one single bed. We decided not to complain, because we figured everything would be fine. The room had no safe, and as an international traveler, the security of having a safe is pretty important. Again, we decided to say nothing. My third and final strike, was ordering food to our hotel and having Eddie, the rudest concierge I‚Äôve ever encountered, throw our food away while we were on our way back to the hotel after a night out, after berating us. His tone was truly the lowest of lows and he made me uncomfortable to continue staying at the hotel. Eddie told us he didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd like it and proceeded to throw away ¬£42 of food. I spoke to two managers, who told me I would be emailed about this incident, never followed up. As someone who has stayed here before, I promise you it will never happen again. The way Eddie spoke to us, treated us, and then the way they handled the situation was the deciding factor in never staying here again. The service is astonishingly terrible and I was horribly disappointed.",1,2023,06,13
133,There is no free parking here,"Needed a spot in London for meeting friends and attending a business meeting. The location is good, close to Kensington High Street station, along with plenty of cafes, shops and retail stores. The room was fine and the staff were attentive.
As there were train strikes on the day I arrived, I decided to travel by car. One of the main reasons for staying here was the fact they advertised parking on-site. When I booked, there was no mention of the fact the parking lot was open to the public and chargeable in the same way NCP charges customers. Hence, when I checked out and asked front desk to stamp my parking pass, I was presented with a bill for ¬£90. I told the guy on the front desk I had only booked the hotel as it had parking ‚Äì but it didn't make a difference. I would have to pay the bill in order to get out.
A disappointing end to the trip and I hope the hotel changes the way it advertising parking in future. ",3,2023,06,13

133,Great Location but Not Great Value,"We stayed 6 nights and were generally happy with this hotel.  However, there were 2 steps inside our room up to the desk/refrigerator/couch area which were very bothersom and totally unnecessary. (our room was one of the renovated ones but overlooked the street, not the park. Bed was very firm and comfortable, room was quiet.  For over $400/night we should have had a garden view.",4,2023,06,04
133,This is not a 5 star hotel,"Rooms are basic (but are quiet).The welcome was cold and impersonal and asking for a key to the gym seemed to be a real hassle for them. The lift are a pain and I had to wait a while. The room was relatively basic, I would say the only element of the room were the robes and toiletries. I left well and would be happy to stay here if my expectations hadn‚Äôt been so high due to price and star rating. ",2,2023,06,04
133,"The Good, The Bad and the In Between","Our Royal Garden Deluxe room on 9th floor was of a high quality with outstanding views of Kensington Gardens and beyond and a glimpse of Kensington Palace.
Very comfortable king size bed and lovely soft pillows. Excellent wi-fi reception. Small empty fridge with minimal cooling effect. Safe. Sofa not placed to take full advantage of fabulous views. Excellent black out curtains. Top sheet had to be requested.
Breakfast was included in our seven-night booking. From a staffing perspective, our first morning‚Äôs breakfast was chaotic and disorganised and it got only slightly better as our stay progressed.
The floor staff seemed inexperienced and lacking any form of training. There seemed to be no structure in place nor oversight to ensure guests needs were attended to in a timely manner.
Simple things, like ordering some toast, tea or a coffee, became a drama in trying to attract someone‚Äôs attention in the first place. Then sometimes experiencing extensive delays in delivery. 
Simply resetting a table was not without its mishaps. We noticed instances of some cutlery missing. One morning our table was missing a fork. Then on another morning the next table had been reset but there were crumbs on both chairs and a mess left on the floor. 
I was struck by the absence of any means of the Hotel communicating to me the facilities and services available in the Hotel either electronically, hard copy or verbally. At check-in, I was handed the key to our room and that was it.
However, overall the positives far outweighed the negatives and we would stay here again. The location is ideal. Beautiful park next door. Buses outside the door running every 10 minutes or so. Underground station maybe 300 metres away. 
If you intend going to Notting Hill Markets, they are not open on a Sunday. Main day is Saturday.",4,2023,06,02
133,Go for it you won‚Äôt regret it !!,"Been in London for a whole week, stayed at three, 5 star properties but this was the Best. Best food, hospitality, Location everything was just phenomenal. Even met the Liverpool football team and England cricket team here.The staff was very polite would like to specially thank Mr. Mohib And Mr. Shubham for helping us out on our complete stay. Will definitely stay here whenever in London and would suggest everyone to stay here.",5,2023,05,29
133,May 2023,"The Hotel is in a fantastic Location in Knightsbridge right next to Kensington Palace / Gardens The Food and Drink on offer is good, and the hotel is operated by a welcoming and proficient team. There is also a convenient Car Park Adjacent to the hotel",5,2023,05,28
133,Better than average Hotel,"Not a bad Hotel, but not as good as it was pre Covid. The Garden Rooms are much better than the standard. Lunch and Evening Meals at the Origin restaurant are very good.
Breakfast could be improved, as it is not much better than a Holiday Inn.",4,2023,05,26
133,Wonderful Stay at Royal Garden,I stayed at Royal Garden Hotel kensington next to palace and park beautiful views and wonderful hotel very good price too ! polite and helpful staff good breakfast I shall come back soon.

133,Excellant Stay in the Heart of London,"The Royal Garden Hotel is a hidden Gem in the great selection of hotels in Central London. The accommodations and facilities were top notch for the price. Great location near all types of shopping and dining venues. The staff was extremely helpful. Especially the Concierge service providers. The facilities are very clean and nicely appointed.  the only thing I would have liked to have in my room was an ironing board and iron. I might have missed it, there were so many storage options in the room.",5,2023,05,22
133,American in London,"To my fellow American who need endless amount of hot water, an AC unit that‚Äôs able to keep things sun zero don‚Äôt look anywhere else and stay here. The hotel is amazing, small square footer as per Europe standards but i hole you don‚Äôt plan to stay in your room enough for it to make a difference. The hotel is the perfect location to a Whole Foods, plenty of awesome restaurants, a bus stop that can take you all the way to SoHo and beyond, AND the tube just a 5 minute walk. BOOK THIS HOTEL NOW!",5,2023,05,22
133,Hotel,"nice and quiet hotel. like that public transport is so central and easy to use from the hotel. the staff are nice. Nice to get new bottles of water in the hotel room every day. good coffee
Will come again ",5,2023,05,22
133,"Good location , only average performance.","We stayed 6 nights, 3 out of the breakfasts were chaotic and disorganised. Food choices at breafast were good but not exceptional.
Room was clean and comfortable with usual facilities but no USB charging facilities .( only in refurbished rooms) No USB adapters available in concierge.
House keeping staff especially the supervisor were friendly and very helpful.
Considering we booked very early with a 25% discount we could have got it cheaper last minute
via a booking site. Management staff very unhelpful and could not answer a query in 6 days.

133,Good hotel,"The place is very nice, near from the city center, there are some bar and restaurants very near. 
The refurbished room are very confortable, clean and big. 
We had a great time with our family. 
We recommend.

133,Excellent,Excellent location waa easy to  get to by train front desk in hotel where really good room was a bit on small size but very good for price and location. Kensington garden is a short walk the train station up the road ,5,2023,05,19
133,The worst hotel. Don‚Äôt stay there!!!,"The air conditioner is not working. 
Towels are dirty.
The phone lines in all hotel not working during my stay. The receptionist are not friendly and they don‚Äôt care to help. 
My advice to avoid this hotel !!!!",1,2023,05,19
133,Good Service,"On the date of my departure to catch an early morning flight, one of the staff took the extra effort to knock on my door to ensure I am up after the 445am wake-up call failed to get my response. Thank you!",5,2023,05,17
133,Weekend break,"This was my wife and I first stay at the Royal Garden and it was a truly pleasurable experience. From arrival to departure all the staff were friendly, courteous and super helpful - nothing was too much trouble. The room overlooking the park was spacious with all the amenities you would expect from a luxury hotel and was beautifully appointed. Most importantly it was quiet and the bed super comfortable so we had a great sleep. An easy recommendation - thanks to all the staff.",5,2023,05,16
133,Weekend in London,A wonderfull hotel centrally located in Kensington. Friendly staff at all levels. Good food and nice surroundings. Close to Royal Albert Hall. A perfect place for couples. We will certainly stay here the next time in London.,5,2023,05,16
133,Perfect,"We stayed in three hotels in England and this was by far the best. Excellent location, quiet spacious room with excellent amenities. Would return. It was also one of the only places we could find a kind sized bed + a pull out couch for our child. Worked beautifully. ",5,2023,05,15
133,Avoid this hotel,This is an appalling hotel the basic rooms are tiny not suitable for a couple the larger rooms are better but the beds are uncomfortable The Inter room noise is appalling you can hear a conversation from the next room ,1,2023,05,11
133,Weekend stay,Overall a very nice hotel with an exellent location. Nice rooms and service overall.. In general high price level but you get the little extra in most cases. Very nice breakfast and service related to that.,5,2023,05,11
133,Location is perfect,"Hotel location is perfect! Hotel is right at the foot of Kensington palace and garden, walking distance to subway station, restaurants and shops. I was able to take the subway to different locations without trouble. This was my first time in London and I could not have chosen a perfect location. ",5,2023,05,10
133,Perfect and comfortable,"I liked the hotel , the service was excellent, cleanliness , value sleep quality also excellent , the location was average some places we must take taxi , the supermarket was very near from hotel , im thinking to visit again !",4,2023,05,09
133,Enjoyable stay,We returned to this hotel after several years and were pleasantly surprised as the hotel has been renovated. The room had a beautiful garden view and was comfortable and modern. The location is great! We had a lovely time ,5,2023,05,06
133,Terrible Hotel in my life,I have never had the so bad experience as we had with this hotel. I forgot my jewelry on the safe locker and when came back to get it the jewelry has been stollen. The security director responsible hadn‚Äôt show for a meeting schedule. It‚Äôs so disappointing for a 5 star Hotel,1,2023,05,05
133,Really fabulous!,"Well, up front, I have to say, the stay here for us was fabulous largely due to the view over Kensington Gardens. This was a big priority for us. When we went to the room allocated, we were very disappointed. It was meant to have a view over Kensington Palace and Kensington Gardens with a flat screen TV. The room we were given did have views over Kensington Palace but it was the ‚Äòback side‚Äô of the Palace looking up a side street and far from what we had expected. The TV was not flat screen. In fact, it was very old, fat TV that has seen better days. Of course, we immediately asked to be removed. We were moved to a Royal Garden Deluxe room which is what we believed we had booked via booking.com. The hotel gave lots of excuses and said we were only being moved because they were being kind, had upgraded us and the hotel was not full. Well I do not agree with this. Nonetheless, we ended up with the room we thought we were going to get. I recommend booking directly on the website, not booking.com as the room descriptions and names are misleading. Once we settled in, this was a fabulous room. Lots of natural light, large window, lounge, small fridge, very modern and bright. The breakfast was delicious. A selection of everything you could imagine. The views for the room we had were outstanding. Remember, if you book a cheaper room, your experience will be different. The hotel is marked as 5 star. I think that is a stretch if you are not in one of their renovated rooms. Overall, we had an amazing stay but I cannot emphasise enough that you need to book the right room. Do yourself a favour and book a table for dinner at the restaurant on the top floor, Min Jiang. First class food and service.",5,2023,05,03
133,Belows Expectations,"The room was close to the elevator and there was a lot of noise throughout the night, so we couldn't sleep. After talking to reception twice on the first day they sat around trying to change the room but when we came back in the afternoon nothing changed, when we asked for our change no one knew. . . and the next day in the morning. , the same... but finally that afternoon we changed rooms and finally we could sleep well... 1 of 3 nights...
Also note that they did not prepare the room for 4 people, always for three despite being 4 in the reservation.
We really liked the location of the hotel, but we expected much more from a hotel of this reputation and fame.
Not even an apology, not a detail for the inconvenience.
I don't think we will return to this hotel on our next trip to London.",3,2023,05,02
133,Our recent stay,Lovely stay for my husband‚Äôs 60th birthday with our sons and family. We couldn‚Äôt really fault anything. The view from our room was spectacular! Breakfast was very good.  The location of the hotel is fabulous.,5,2023,05,02
133,Fun Trip!,Great hotel near many local attractions. Staff were very friendly and attentive to us.  Suggest the hop on hop off tour bus directly across the Street to explore lovely London. Would stay here again for sure.,5,2023,05,01
133,Great Value for Money Hotel,"Fantastic location in high street Kensington, next to the most beautiful Kensington Palace gardens and park. Our room overlooks the beautiful park. Large rooms that is very clean and ample space. Staff extremely friendly. Great restaurant and food in hotel. Good value for money. Thank you, we will come back.",5,2023,04,30
133,So royal and lovely,Royal garden hotel was so warm and welcome mind. The room was so cozy and comfortable also great for business use. Personally there were slippers in the room that is excellent! I really wanna stay again when I come to London!,5,2023,04,30
133,Overpriced and tired,"No welcome or farewell from staff. Room old and tired (I thought it had been refurbed). So overpriced compared to other, better hotels eg Royal Lancaster. No power or USBs by the bed. Pillows thin. Bed so so",2,2023,04,28
133,Fantasic City Break Experiance,"I highly recommend staying at the Royal Garden Hotel if you can,  book a garden view room overlooking Kensington gardens.  Room service was fantastic, food as well. Vyan who brought my breakfast for the last morning of my stay had a nice happy personality :)

The other room service staff members where friendly and polite (Emma and Gabby a couple of others I just didn't get their names)

When visiting the city of London I took the tube from Marble Arch, which is about 30-40 minutes walk depending on your walking speed.

I will certainly be booking again!

The only negative thing is my room was near the elevators and being a light sleeper you can hear the elevator motors 

",5,2023,04,27
133,Room was very very small!,Everything was great except the size of the room.  It was so small we didn't have room to walk around our luggage.  This cast a long shadow on our stay and I am very sorry I chose this hotel.  There are many better choices!,2,2023,04,26
133,Great lunch!,"Perfect for pur Easter lunch! 
Everyone at the restaurant was super kind and attentive to details and focused to deliver a great service. 

I would definitely recommend it for a pleased and not too formal meal! ",5,2023,04,26
133,"Beautiful hotel, great location, poor room comfort.","The hotel and location were excellent! I cannot review the restaurants because I only dined for breakfast which was just ok. The rooms were exceptionally clean and lovely, however, the beds were hard and did not have a top sheet. There was only a very heavy blanked which served as a bedspread. It was unsanitary and too warm for sleeping. I‚Äôve never stayed at a hotel without sheets! ",2,2023,04,25
133,Great service !,FILIPINO WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION-UK was  well looked after by Abdell and his team last weekend.  The Westminster suite was suitable for our purpose  and the food was delicious and well presented.  Thank you RGH for your hospitality! ,5,2023,04,25
133,"Pristine rooms, unparalleled location, unacceptable breakfast experience","We staid in a room overlooking Kensington Gardens that has been recently refurbished, and just sitting inside taking in the view at any time of the day proved to be a joy in its own right. Location central and convenient, The one serious blemish was our breakfast experience: long waiting lines (while tables were available!), overwhelmed staff, occasional glass shortages... Unacceptable for a hotel at this level, and perfectly avoidable with better procedures in place.",4,2023,04,25
133,Stay with royal view,"Perfect hotel for business and leisure trips. Top location, good access to public transportation. The renovated rooms are really nice - aks for them! Friendly staff, good food and a beautiful view over Kensington Park.",5,2023,04,24
133,Disappointed üòû,"Hi I normally don't give reviews but I was encouraged by my partner and the hotel staff itself ! 

On my arrival the conceige didn't want to take my bags I saw him take other people's bags I thought is it becoz if my colour ü§î I don't like pulling the racist card . Or was I not dressed wiht designer brands maybe I didn't look right to him. I walked in with my bags and at the desk I met 2 indian people at the front desk thinking ok I am south african indian British and maybe it  will be good. It was not first they looked at me no smiles or welcome or greeting. They said they could not find my room etc I told them I can show u . They found it after calling for help . I was given my key without telling me anything about the hotel as it was my first time. They just dumped the key and sent me packing. I just kept quiet and didn't say a word although it hurt me why was I treated like that and during that day I saw how they were treating people of different colour to a certain std. The next day I got up  early for breakfast to avoid those staff as I was traumiaed by the treatment . The breakfast staff and the organ resturant staff were so nice. 

This morning I was awoken at 7am with room service that I ordered for 9am and to top it all it was the wrong order . The waitress was so nice I had to calm her down and tell her dont worry about it . The cleaner who cleaned my room was really sweet and nice. I really liked the  food in origin resturant and also the piano man I git to speak to him very friendly guy . I have 2 more nights  here just wishing it was over. 

I love the location its near to everything . But I dnt think I will come back due to the atmosphere and aura of the place honestly.  

Thank you ",2,2023,04,22
133,Spectacular hotel - great for a family trip,"We can't recommend this hotel enough, we had a spectacular week long stay.  Our room was a larger room overlooking the park on the third floor.  It was close to the street and street noise did not bother us a bit.  The room was extremely spacious!  Surprisingly spacious for a London hotel, we had a king bed, pull out sofa, table and a small area with a seat and desk.  The sofa bed was very comfortable for a 12 year old, who loved having her own space.  The primary bathroom was huge and well appointed.  It was great to have the half bath when we were trying to get ready.  The main bed was very comfortable, with great pillows. 

The location is fantastic!  Close to the High Street Kensington stop on the tube and a bus stop right out front. It made it incredibly easy to get around.  It's an easy walk to S. Kensington museums.  And of course you have Kensington Palace and Hyde Park right outside.  

Service at the hotel was fantastic.  Everyone was really friendly and helpful.  We were able to store our bags our last day before we headed out. 

Breakfast was ok, but repetitive.  We all found something we liked and the orange juice and smoothies were the real highlight.  As were the croissants!    We had dinner at Origin and it was really good, very happy with the quality and the service. 

We were so comfortable and happy, we hated to leave! ",5,2023,04,16
133,"Excellent hotel, but what's with the breakfast price?","I made my fourth visit to the lovely Royal Garden Hotel, after a gap caused by the age of Covid! I love the hotel. I had friends in the neighborhood and got to know the area well. It's one of the most attractive and convenient in London. The hotel itself is excellent: comfortable room (I had a garden room), and pleasant and efficient staff. My one quibble is that I used to enjoy the breakfast and would generally take a room rate which included breakfast. For this visit, I found that the rate including breakfast were basically the room rate plus the regular (too high) cost of breakfast, which was ¬£28-¬£31 pounds. I also used to like the room service breakfast, but now there is a 12.5% service charge for room service. That is too expensive. However, knowing the neighborhood as I do, I found that the Marks and Spencer Food Hall, practically across the road, offers very nice breakfast options and a comfortable seating area. And for a full English breakfast, Cafe Phillies, a few blocks away, has one of the best full English breakfasts in London, at ¬£14 pounds, half the price of the hotel's rate. So, I look forward to visiting the Royal Garden again but hope they do something about those ridiculous breakfast costs!",4,2023,04,13
133,"Thank you John, Jim and Steve!","Had dinner in Origin with some work colleagues. Nice traditional British cuisine and attentive service. We will be back to try the Min Jiang which has views over Kensington Gardens. 

John, Jim and Steve on the Concierge team were a pleasure to speak with and secured the last table in Piano Bar for us.",5,2023,04,09
133,Back on the right track,"We have stayed at the RGH many times over the past 15 years or so. There have been a few ups and downs recently due mainly to the dreaded virus, but we are very pleased to report that the hotel is certainly back on the right track. We stayed for two nights at the beginning of April in a Garden Room on the second floor. The room appeared to have been recently refurbished and was bright and spacious with a very comfortable bed !!
Check in and out were hassle free, the staff were lovely, the breakfasts very good.
All in all a very enjoyable stay - just like it used to be
Well done RGH, you have regained our 'favourite London hotel' accolade !!! ",5,2023,04,09
133,A great hotel in a fantastic location. Consider this hotel for family stays.,"We have just returned from a three night stay at Royal Garden and was pleasantly surprised. 
We were familiar with the location after previously staying at another hotel on Kensington High Street so when we found this hotel at a great rate we were thrilled. 
The hotel lobby was inviting, if a little dated, and the staff were really friendly and helpful. We arrived before check in and were happy to leave our bags with concierge until we arrived later in the evening. 
On our return, the bags had already been taken up to our room which was fantastic and saved us a lot of hassle - a great touch. 
The room, for myself, my husband and two teenagers, was extremely spacious. We were wowed with the size in fact. 
There was a super king bed and a pull out sofa bed, which was already made up. 
Even with the sofa bed pulled out, where was still lots of room. The room was very well equipped with an additional occasional chair and a desk which could also be used for a dressing table due to its concealed mirror. 
The bathroom was also very big with a shower cubical and a full size bath. The bath products were Penhaligan‚Äôs which was a nice touch. 
The shower head in the shower cubical was a little strange. The rain shower head arm was a little too long so it made you feel claustrophobic as your nose felt pressed up against the glass or wall. We decided to ditch that and just use the shower attachment instead, which worked much better. 
Our only issue was the sofa bed. It wasn‚Äôt comfortable at all. With the room being so large, they could easily fit two beds in instead, which would be a godsend for families and a real selling point. 
The location was an absolute winner. Right in the edge of the park, it was a perfect spot. We love staying in this area as there is a true high street where you can pick up lunch snacks, a coffee or clothes at the stores. 

All I be all, it was a great hotel in a fantastic location. 
We‚Äôll stay here again, I‚Äôm sure.",5,2023,04,05
133,Royal Garden hotel where you feel like royalty.,"We were so surprised when we were told that we had been upgraded to a suite (thanks Hotwire). The suite (236) was amazing with the view of Kensington Gardens. I am germaphobic but this place was immaculate. Quality from the floors to the sheets. The bathroom was as big as the room I am currently in at the Hotel Indigo Kensington (avoid Indigo). The staff was exceptional. I regret no having dinner at the hotel. This is definitely the best hotel I have stayed at.
This hotel I  highly recommend. My go to London Hotel from now on.",5,2023,04,05
133,Our new favorite London hotel!,"Wonderful location, quiet and we were lucky to be in a lovely refurbished room. Huge beautiful bathroom with big tub and separate shower, and heated floors! Lots of restaurants and shops right outside the door, as well as Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park.
Cannot wait to come back.",5,2023,04,01
133,Birthday weekend ,"Went for weekend first time at this hotel, will definitely go back. Great location we had Palace view, rooms clean staff very helpful  and pleasant.  Overall great experience. Loved the piano bar, easy located for getting round Central London.",5,2023,04,01
133,Poor Experience,"This is our second visit to this hotel and we choose it mainly for the location.
 Only one positive,unfortunately, which was the view and being at the back of the hotel meant it was much quieter.  
The negatives are endless.  We had an old room with the hardest bed, there is firm and then ‚ÄúI might as well be sleeping on the floor‚Äù!  The bathroom was old with rusty fittings.  Getting back from the theatre we wanted a cup of tea only to find out the kettle wasn‚Äôt working.  This took over 30 minutes and two phone calls to get replaced.  The television didn‚Äôt work just a blank white screen.  They offered to send up an engineer but it was 7.30 in the morning so we declined.  The fan was noisy but the room was stuffy without it on.  
Breakfast was terrible.  The food was cold and it wasn‚Äôt until we had sat down with our plates, 15 minutes at least after arriving, that we were told we could have a fried or boiled egg.  The toast was soggy.  The coffee was lukewarm.  Service was non existent.  Then to top it all off they tried to charge us a discretionary ¬£7 service charge.  What service?  We did challenge it and it was removed.
The receptionist was surly. didn‚Äôt ask if we had a nice time when we left.  We told her even though we weren‚Äôt asked that there had been problems but clearly the word sorry isn‚Äôt in her vocabulary.  

",2,2023,03,28
133,Highly recommended for a romantic weekend ,Amazing 5 star hotel and arguably in one of the best locations London can offer. We stayed overnight for a (very) special occasion after a West End show. It's worth the 20 minute tube ride from Theatreland  to wake up next to Kensington Gardens. The Piano bar had a good vibe.Just the right side of corny.  It's not cheap but in our opinion better value than the Park Lane hotels on  the other side. The staff were faultless. I would highly recommend it for special occasions or if the business is paying ,5,2023,03,26
133,Disappointing,"I‚Äôve stayed here before and had a great experience, but I‚Äôve just spent 3 nights here and had the exact opposite experience this time around. The reception and concierge staff were a real let down and just stare at you when you walk past them! When staying at a four star hotel I‚Äôm used to a smile or at least a ‚Äúwelcome back‚Äù when you return to the hotel from a day out, not just a blank expression. The room we were in, a ‚Äòclassic double‚Äô was well designed, clean and comfortable, but the TV was an ancient LG lcd and the remote was so old that the indicators had been rubbed off the buttons and it was faulty. We had it replaced but the replacement was faulty as well. The TV channels were free to air only, not even cable channels, again a disappointment considering it‚Äôs a for star hotel. I‚Äôll think twice about staying here again, the hotel charges high room rates but seems to rely on its past reputation rather than maintaining four star service.",2,2023,03,25
133,Beware before booking,"The key thing to know is there are refurbished rooms and non refurbished rooms (same rate) at this hotel and they are wildly different in comfort and experience!

Negative - 
I stayed in an old room first trip and then requested a newer room as I was staying for more than a week. The reception staff member was visibly frustrated at my request and from that point I could not have felt less welcome. 
If you get an old room they are small and a bit grimy.
The beds are also rock hard so beware! 
Overall not a pleasant stay considering the five star status.

Positive -
New/ refurbished rooms are large and clean. 
Concierge was helpful 
Location is great",2,2023,03,23
133,I have been robbed in this hotel!!!,"I have been robbed during my stay in this Hotel. My wife forgot her purse with jewels inside the security box and when we got the purse back all the jewels have been robbed. 

So far, the hotel has only pass this case to insurance and with no response after more than 1 month.

I don‚Äôt recommend this hotel.",1,2023,03,20
133,Not a friendly hotel with small kids with prams.,"This hotel located near to the Kensington Palace Garden you can have a lovely walk to the Hyde park, many restaurants and shops nearby. 
Family room was actually nice and comfy. 
Receptionist was helpful and friendly. 
Breakfast was good, only the trouble is they were so keen to clear the tables even if we weren‚Äôt done having breakfast yet. 
Housekeepers are friendly. 
The concierge guys wasn‚Äôt helpful when we got our luggage. 
The ramp outside the main door is pointless, wasn‚Äôt sure if it was open at all and it was full of umbrellas hanging on it, so families with prams has to use the steeps and carry the luggage, no one seems to offer to use it every time we‚Äôll go outside.",4,2023,03,15
133,Great location but not very clean,"The hotel is right next door to Kensington Palace (which is closed now btw). And is within walking distance to V&A Museum, Harrods and Notting Hill. There are many restaurants and a Whole Foods nearby.
We booked a ‚Äúpalace view‚Äù double room but were reminded it was not newly decorated. So we were upgraded to a renovated room with a comfortable sofa but faced the street. London drivers love to honk. Every morning I was woken up by honking, plus noises by neighbours. Appreciate the hotel‚Äôs effort to add some wall paneling and a rug to alleviate the noise problem ‚Äì but walls and floors are quite thin. 
Being a 5-star establishment and post-covid, I was astonished there were actual dust bunnies at the top shelf in the closet. No, the top shelf was not that high ‚Äì it was my eye level. Told the front desk about it, was reassured it would be taken care of ‚Äì But nothing happened the 3 nights we stayed. No, we didn‚Äôt bother again. Housekeeping staff didn‚Äôt find it odd we put our staff on window sill, on the sofa but leave the top shelf empty? Also, one day we came back to find the toilet was not cleaned. Stains were still there. Hmmm‚Ä¶
There is no safe in the room. And we found the kettle inside closet (next to clothes) arrangement dangerous. So we moved the whole tray out. Good thing they have many sockets near the desk.
We tried the gym which is in the same building but outside the door. Great array of equipment.
We didn‚Äôt try the restaurants.",4,2023,03,08
133,Spoilt the 5 Star experience on the small things,"Arjun and sirjoi were excellent in checking in and customer relations. Clean hotel and lovely experience generally. Need more water on the room than just 1. My last part of hotel didn't end well as asked for extension to 1pm check out as was running late. Staff member was dismissive and said they wouldn't as too busy and housekeeping would come at 1 to get me out. I felt I was being escorted out. It could have been done better. 

Housekeeping and other staff were nice

Otherwise a 5 star experience.",3,2023,03,04
133,Good value for pleasant room,"Had a few nights in a classic room which I paid the same as Premier Inn. Small room but had everything in it that you need. Did not eat at the hotel as there are so many cafes and restaurants nearby that are better value for money. Would recommend for a short stay as bed comfortable, quiet and well kept Hotel. Excellent location.",5,2023,02,27
133,Excellent service,This is the best hotel we ever go everything is clean and a very great servie also nice peaceful place cause its near garden also and the best part of all this is my every morning service cause the lady called *Vyan* she makes my morning more joy and more greatful with her smile üå∑üå∑thanks alot for the great experience appreciate it,5,2023,02,26
133,Lovely to be back.,"My husband and I noticed some lovely changes in the hotel, since our last pre-covid visit. We loved our smart, clean & comfortable room and we were both transfixed by the view of Kensington Gardens & Palace, with also views reaching The Shard and The London Eye. The breakast was great with my husband saying his cooked breakfast was tasty and filling. I had the granola cereal & a few patisseries which tasted delicious and were freshly baked. The reception and breakfast staff were welcoming and friendly. We chose this hotel for the location, as were were seeing a show at The Albert Hall, which is a very short walk away, but we would choose this hotel anyway regardless of what activities or attractions we were planning, as there is a bus stop right outside the hotel & the Kensington High Street Tube Station is also a short walk away. Fully recommended. We hope to visit again soon. ",5,2023,02,12
133,Average!,"My recent stay at the Royal Garden Hotel London was just okay. Although it was a bit far from the main attractions, it was near Hyde Park and in a peaceful area. However, I wasn't impressed with the value for money, and the rooms could use some upgrades.",3,2023,02,12
133,"A clinical garden, but good value for money","Stayed for one night before moving to another hotel. We got a good rate at ¬£170 per night, room only; good value for a 5 star hotel.

Straightforward check-in and out.

Staff were  pleasant and helpful throughout.

Room was newly decorated and very well cleaned. The only negative for us was that the bed was too hard for our liking. At the right price, this was good value for money.",4,2023,02,07
133,Good service,"Last week I stayed at Royal Hotel and it was a very plesant time. We meet Mohib, he gave us very good room with a nice views  and he was very kind . 10/10 service. Will definitely come back again only cos of him.",5,2023,02,07
133,Friendly staff,A few days ago I was in London and I stayed in Royal Garden Hotel and I want to say that I was impressed by all the staff specifically Mohib Khan who was very friendly and extremely helpful.  Also the room was very comfortable in every way. ,5,2023,01,31
133,Perfect place to stay for a special occasion ,This is amazing hotel with beautiful views of Hyde Park was a perfect place to stay for the occasion. The staff were all amazingly friendly and helpful. The room was lovely and spacious. I will definitely be staying here again ,5,2023,01,28
133,Fabulous place to stay for a week in London,"Stayed here for a work conference and was very pleasantly surprised with the hotel. We stayed 4 days afterward for fun. First they could not have been more accommodating. Gave me a free upgrade. Helped with any question/concern I had. Both the front desk and the concierge were excellent. Second, great location next door to Kensington Palace. The restaurants right around the hotel are amazing.  The whole neighborhood is upscale. The bus stop is across the street and the train station for the tube is a 5 minute walk. There is a Whole Foods on way to tube and there is a little bodega across the street.  Everything we wanted access to was 15-25 min bus or tube ride. Was so easy to navigate every location using GoogleMaps. Third, the room was very nice and comfortable. Was recently redone and looked brand new. Had everything we needed. The breakfast was also very good.  Overall this is a great place to stay especially for the price.",5,2023,01,16
133,"Wonderful stay, couldn‚Äôt fault it","From the warm welcome and complementary room upgrade, to the wonderful attentive staff (big shout out to reception and concierge!) to the food and entertainment- the whole experience was first class, and the location just perfect!!! Wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to go back!",5,2023,01,14
133,Unique experience,"It is a unique experience in terms of staff attention, meals and guest care. The rooms are excellent of a level that only this hotel can offer. I think it is 100% recommended for any area, whether it's work, vacations or just to have a good time in London.",5,2023,01,14
133,can't beat the location,"nice hotel, with an even nicer location, right next to kensignton gardens.  the rooms are tiny, but no more than any other hotel in london.  only gripe was that it was absolutely impossible to speak to someone at the front desk without waiting for absolutely ages.  and the aircon broke down during the height of the summer heatwave, but i think many buildings suffered the same fate.",4,2023,01,13
133,Flawless!,"Stayed here for new years eve and was given a complimentary upgrade by Viviana on check in, this was such a lovely start to a new year. The hotel and staff are amazing in this establishment, would recommend this place always - 10/10!",5,2023,01,09
133,Nice,"Good hotel , good location , nice staff .room service is fine and overall erything was good .............................they gave us our room sonnet which was perfect. 
And we stayed for about 11days 
And in front of the hotel is bus station",4,2023,01,09
133,"Overall good experience, few niggles","Lovely, welcoming staff and decor in lobby very stylish. Had a garden facing room that was large and comfortable. Couple of downsides. Coffee bags produced weak unpleasant coffee after steeping for 10 minutes. Room was very warm even with window open (on restrictor). Aircon would not go below 22 degrees. Shower stall door opens inwards so extremely difficult to get in/out and close door without pushing yourself against wall. Lots of noise from corridor as housekeeping started early and doors bang when closed. Piano bar staff were excellent. Pianist was good but so loud that conversation was not possible and we sat as far as we could from piano. Overall great decor and staff but few niggles.",4,2023,01,07
133,Origin is outstanding ,"Room was great, Origin Restaurant was outstanding, food was top quality and Kaseem was a fabulous host who made us feel very welcome with excellent levels of service. Highly recommended and will be returning very soon",5,2023,01,05
133,Gentle staff and a real 5 star experience ,"Very gentle staff who can let you feel and experience a real 5 star treatment in this hotel. Its located in a nice area practically surrounded with some restaurants,  convenience shop, bus stop, and an underground train station. The breakfast was nice with most options that we usually demand at breakfast. The croissants offered at the breakfast are so fresh as well as the other baked items. Also having a fresh orange juice making machine was a nice thing. One thing can be improved is the way of proposing the service charge by the waiters at the breakfast which is basucally an optional thing but not so clear to the guest that its optional.

",5,2023,01,05
133,Xmas 22,"Good hotel stayed previously, customer service at reception poor and following a fault with payment being charged twice they where unhelpful to resolve swiftly, bar staff and room service staff very nice , management not so great",3,2023,01,04
133,Excellent two nights stay,"Stayed for two nights in the week prior to Christmas, 8 adults and a baby.

Rooms were very good and my wife and I had an excellent nights sleep.

We ate twice in the hotel‚Äôs restaurant and also enjoyed a meal in the Chinese restaurant. All the meals were excellent and the staff very attentive.

We also sampled both bars although the piano bar was closed on the first evening. The bar staff were very friendly and the ladies enjoyed their cocktails.

We also enjoyed walks around Hyde Park and afternoon tea at Harrods. 

Overall I would highly recommend the hotel and its facilities.",5,2023,01,02
133,Restaurant Review,"My review is on the Origen Kensington restaurant in the hotel. I went with a friend for Christmas Eve, and we had a fabulous experience. We were also celebrating a belated 75th Birthday and they were so nice in helping us do this in exquisite style and grace!
From the cocktail and mocktail, both were great, to the delicious appetizers, the server Anna was so attentive and kind. The main course was out of this world, so kudos to the Chef and team!
They brought us a chocolate raspberry cake, with Happy Belated Birthday written on the plate! 
With much Gratitude to Anna and all the team at Origen Kensington, we will be back. HappyNew Year!",5,2022,12,28
133,Origin Restaurant,"Did not stay at the hotel, but thoroughly enjoyed a pre-Christmas meal at the hotel restaurant (Origin) with friends. A relatively large group of 9 which did not phase the staff at all, nor slow the service down. Excellent food (the Boston rib was cooked exactly as requested) and a good selection of cocktails, wines and craft beers. Knowledgeable, friendly and professional staff who were attentive but not overbearing. Stylish decor which added to the ambience and atmosphere. Highly recommend!",5,2022,12,23
133,Incredible dining experience ,"Amazing food in the Origins resteraunt, my friends and I had a great experience. The service was fantastic, Mario was super attentive throughout. We had a mix of the menu, the Boston rib, prawns, crab cakes and the venison were delicious. I will be back again to sample more of the menu. Thank you so much to the team for making it such a wonderful experience.",5,2022,12,20
133,Royal Garden Hotel - right next to Kensington Palace,"-one night stay at Royal Garden Hotel  - got upgraded to a room on higher floor with nice view of Hyde Park
-very spacious room, modern design inside, large bathtub
-efficient check-in/ front desk
-recommend booking restaurant in advance as was fully booked for dinner at Min Jiang",5,2022,12,18
133,Wonderful weekend getaway,"Had a wonderful time at the Royal Garden Hotel last weekend. Debra was amazing and took very good care of our reservation. We checked in to one of the new refurbished rooms - I love the set up and decorations - the panorama window facing Hyde park are breathtaking! Juan from check in was super friendly and confirmed all the amenities to us, so we didn‚Äôt have to worry about a thing. We enjoyed dinner in the evening - the origin Kensington offers a lovely menu with many vegan friendly options and an impressive wine collection.
Breakfast was also served at the origin - you can find everything you want including fresh pressed juices and lovely freshly baked pastries. Tamara was very lovely too - and I‚Äôm not just saying that because she got the same name as me :)
Thank you Royal Garden Hotel team - we really enjoyed our stay with you - if you become dog friendly we can come more often :D",5,2022,12,13
133,Origin at Kensington,Lovely to be back at this restaurant for the six course Taster Menu.  The three of us thought the food was fantastic and memorable (see photo).  Also it was great value.  The restaurant is much cosier as a result of the refurbishment and as a result the atmosphere reflected this.  The new staff are delightful and extremely helpful which really added to the evening.  We‚Äôre looking forward to eating there again soon.,5,2022,12,13
133,Perfection,"We have stayed here several times and have never been disappointed,,the staff have a way of making you feel special, we had an amazing view of the park and palace, the room was spotless, and lovely and warm, it was very cold outside and we woke to snow, only one thing breakfast was no longer white table cloths and serviettes, but self service, I suppose this is what others are doing, but with the Royal Garden it was classy with things before the change, but this did not distract from the quality of food on offer, it was really good, but I don‚Äôt really like getting up and down, possible tomorrow I can ask the waiting staff to serve my breakfast I am sure it won‚Äôt be a problem, I look for ward to my next stay, every member of staff are happy to help.",5,2022,12,12
133,Wouldn‚Äôt recommend.,"Arrived at 14:00 for check in. Ended up having a 40 minute wait in the lobby (were offered hot drinks) as the room wasn‚Äôt clean, so they had to send the team up to do it whilst we waited. Freezing cold, difficult to adjust the settings and even after half an hour it hasn‚Äôt warmed up. The minibar is empty. The room is much smaller than the advertisement suggests and are very basic (think more like travel lodge). Room smells very strongly of bleach because it‚Äôs been speed cleaned, rather than done in advance. View out of the window is a dirty old moss coated roof, very grubby. Not impressed. Definitely not 5*. ",2,2022,12,03
133,The Origin Restaurant,"We are aware that there are a number of excellent reviews of the Origin Restaurant on this site - this was our experience.
After a three-year covid break, returning to the ground floor restaurant at the Royal Garden Hotel was quite a shock.  In place of the relaxed and cosy room full of dining guests where we had previously lunched on numerous occasions there is now an empty ‚Äòmodern‚Äô bleak, characterless and austere area on which a lot of money seems to have been spent in order to reduce any atmosphere to zero.
Unaware of this new format a party of seven of us attended what turned out to be a ‚ÄòBasil Fawlty Masterclass‚Äô for Brunch at the Origin Restaurant in the Royal Garden Hotel. 
Pencils and Paper were not provided so please excuse any omissions.
1.	Ensure that any evidence of a booking is untraceable when the host calls to check details prior to the date of the reservation - this will give the impression that you are massively overbooked and he is lucky to even be able to get a table.
2.	Provide two ladies in the cloakroom - one to look after the numbered coat hangers and the other the corresponding numbered tickets to give to the guest.  It is important to ensure that the tickets are well shuffled so that it takes at least five minutes to find the correct one for each hanger so that arrivals in the restaurant are well spaced - even though only three other tables are occupied and no other diners are expected.
3.	Place tables as close to the wall as possible so that waiting staff are able only to serve across the table or by leaning across another guest.
4.	Only supply at the most one menu between three guests even though you have more than enough for one each.
5.	Put as many adjectives and foreign words on the menu as possible.   ie. Shakshuka, Laksa, Mac & Cheese [V], Blythburgh farm free-range pork ‚Äì ensure that there is no translation or explanation of any item or, for example, which cut of pork etc.  Not a single vegetable is permitted in any of the courses and use as much bread, brioche, bagel etc. in as many recipes as possible.  Any sauce or gravy should be minimal.
6.	Take the food order on a scrap of paper to ensure that the kitchen misreads it and at least one member of the party doesn‚Äôt get their main course ‚Äì when they complain it must eventually arrive as everyone else is finishing theirs.  If wine is ordered pour a small quantity for the host to taste and then serve the other guests without returning to top up the hosts‚Äô glass.   If red wine, make sure that it is served ice cold and kept in an ice bucket.
7.	Provide a ‚Äòmusician‚Äô to play loud enough to ensure that no conversation is possible - when asked to reduce the volume do so and then slowly increase it again.  Ignore any further requests to turn it down.   This drives all diners out and the staff can go home early!
8.	Add or leave off at least one item from the bill when you present it at the end of the meal.
Basil would have been proud!
We will not be going back.

133,Disappointed stressful food situation,"We have been coming here for 5 years running pre covid which was always excellent service but unfortunately this year we were very disappointed with the disorganised chaotic breakfast service both mornings of our stay, long waiting time for table. No food left in self service trays, repeatedly asking for tea crockery and glasses, we expect a better standard service for your highly hotel. We have outstanding praise for bar staff in the Piano bar which was run exceptionally smoothly by the Hungarian bar manager. The entertainment in the bar room was outstanding.Room was excellent, rooms very clean. Hopefully you will be able to rectify this major breakfast issue as this was I only negative experience during our stay. ",3,2022,11,27
133,Perfect stay - exceeded expectations ,"Booked for 1 night for our wedding anniversary, and booked a meal in the original resturant.  From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome and like we were the only people staying I'd emailed ahead to ask if they could do anything for our anniversary, just a small gesture but they went above and beyond.  They upgraded our room to a garden deluxe whicj looked over Hyde park an Kensington Palace, this was completely unexpected and we were most grateful, they also added special touches to our meal which they didn't have to do, but chose to, which made the stay even more special having that personal touch.  Food was outstanding 'I would urge anyone to have the shepherds pie, outstanding! 
Classy and professional and worth every penny. Thanks for making our weekend! ",5,2022,11,27
133,Two night stay,"Due to having an operation in london we chose this hotel for location and value.. reception staff were polite and upgraded our room to one of the refurbished ones overlooking the park. 
Bed was a little hard, but all in all a comfy nights sleep for the both of us.",4,2022,11,22
133,Could do better,"Have stayed a few times. Nice to have breakfast back on the ground floor with a beautiful view of the park. 
Hotel apparently has been refurbished but still feels a bit dated. 
Confused reception staff every time we went. Not sure what happened with booking. But we‚Äôll never know. Tried to ask for extra money at checkout. 
Also they‚Äôre promoting WhatsApp everywhere but ignored my messages 
Pillows unbearably thin as was the duvet.",3,2022,11,21
133,Very good with one caveat,"Well located, clean and welcoming hotel. Excellently sized twin room, with modern bathroom, fridge and tea and coffee making facilities. 4th floor view was of High Street Kensington but none the worse for that, and good noise insulation. Breakfast good quality buffet, in a nice room with a view over the park/gardens but both mornings service was chaotic; staff (and there are many) are polite and really keen to do well but overall the restaurant at breakfast appears to lack organisation. Should be a quick fix, but looking at previous reviews it seems this is a long-standing problem. Wouldn‚Äôt put us off returning, and hopefully give 5 stars next time",4,2022,11,21
133,Affordable Luxury Adjacent to Kensington Palace,"The Royal Garden is a wonderful choice on Kensington High Street in a leafy London neighborhood alongside Kensington Park. Spacious, well-appointed rooms, a good breakfast and exceptional staff add up to a consistently outstanding experience.",5,2022,11,21
133,Amazing stay!,"Have just returned from the most amazing nights stay at the Royal Garden Hotel and had to write a review for those who may be considering staying here. 

From the moment we walked in, we were treated like absolute royalty. Every staff member we encountered, from the doormen, to Christine in reservations, to Felicity the manager who escorted us to our room and gave us a tour, were just lovely and so welcoming. 

I made the team aware that it was my mums birthday, and in the room was a chocolate cake, a basket of fruit, a bottle of champagne, and a handwritten note from the general manager, Oliver, wishing my mum a happy birthday and a great stay at the hotel. 

The room was stunning and huge. We were given a park suite with an interconnecting garden twin room - it was more like a two bedroom apartment! The most amazing thing about the room was the view, looking out to Hyde Park and the London skyline was amazing! 

The location of the hotel was a huge plus as we were visiting Hyde Park winter wonderland, which was a short 5 minute taxi ride away. 

We chose to have room service breakfast which was really lovely and very tasty. 

Check out time is at 12pm, however the lady on reception extended this to 2pm which was very much appreciated after a busy night walking around Hyde Park. 

All in all, our stay was truly amazing and will be remembered for years to come, and we will definitely be back!",5,2022,11,19
133,"Not a first choice for the future, but ok. ","Nice hotel room, clean and comfortable, room service prompt.. Piano bar a great evening however seating very uncomfortable. Only 2 out of 4 lifts were working during all 3 days there, this meant waiting several minutes to get to and from your room. Great location but for us there is better hotels in the area for the price. ",4,2022,11,13
133,Amazing meal,"We found this new fantastic restaurant in Royal Garden Hotel 
So helpful kind and considerate 
The food was superb 
Service tremendous 
Wines wonderful 
Really could not have been better 
Thanks so very much",5,2022,11,12
133,"OK hotel, but go elsewhere for breakfast","Nice large rooms, great view. Very disappointing and overpriced breakfast with horrible service. First day we nearly finished our breakfast before the coffee arrived, but they were quick with the 7 ¬£ service charge (that we did not accept) that they add to an already pre-payed breakfast. We had a similar experience the next day. It is a mystery to us that a 5 star hotell can provide such bad service and then still charge for the extra ‚Äúservice‚Äù. There are restaurants right across the street that serve breakfast. 
2 out of 4 elevators were down most of the time.",3,2022,11,12
133,A Gem in the middle of it all.,"A Gem in the Centre of London! We stayed in this hotel recently as it was a perfect location for us. 

We stay in hotels regularly with work, but this was personal and one of the most enjoyable experiences we have had for a long time from the time we arrived to the time we left. So much so we plan on going back to enjoy it again. 

The whole presentation here is on point. 

The front of house team cannot do enough for you and only too willing to help and include a smile too. 

Now! The bedroom - we were on the 4th floor and it was cracking. From opening the door and seeing the view for us which was over the Royal Parks, was fantastic. The working area was an excellent size the split level floor was lovely and really splits the room well. 

The bed, large and inviting and did not disappoint as was incredibly comfy. 

I am a person that always puts the TV on ‚Ä¶.. not here, had no interest, was happy to watch the sunset and see it reflect on the BT Tower and other building to create a short little light show - brilliant. 

The bathroom was also well thought out and a pleasure to see a Bath which my partner took full advantage of and enjoyed. 

Tea/Coffee - it was ok, but would have expected some more premium given the rest of the hotel. A little fridge with a couple of waters was also greatly received. 

Access to London is easy from here also, underground is 5 mins away, Notting Hill just around the corner and a wonderful walk, High Street Ken well you‚Äôre right on it. The Albert Hall is also only a short 10 min stroll. 

We did not have time to explore the rest of the hotel but from a front of house and bedroom experience - we loved it. Everything here that makes London a great city.

Thank you team - Brilliant.",5,2022,11,09
133,Origin Kensington is one of the best meals I've ever had.,"Took my partner to Origin Kensington within the hotel for our anniversary and couldn't have been more impressed! 

We were catered for by friendly and courteous staff from the moment we walked through the door. 

We explained prior to arriving that it was a special occasion and everyone, from the bar to the kitchen staff, made us feel as though we were the most important people in the venue. 

The food was impeccable. Every plate that came out had so much flavour and it wasn't hard to tell that the ingredients were of the highest quality. 

I ordered the Shepherds Pie, which was brilliant, but the Nasi Goreng that my partner ordered was the real star of the show. Something I intend to order on my next visit. 

Origin highly exceeded my expectations and I currently recommending to everyone. 

High-quality, luxury food with a very reasonable price tag.",5,2022,11,08
133,Need to do better!,"The hotel needs to do better. We checked in at about 4pm. The TV was broken. We reported it as we wanted to relax and watch Strictly. 2 hours late we are still waiting... we love this hotel and come here regularly, but this level of service is not acceptable. ",2,2022,11,05
133,Breakfast,"Wow! what a fantastic experience!

Booked at Business breakfast, actually booked for the incredible views but the food and service were outstanding.

Great value for money and already looking to book for dinner and take the family for Afternoon Tea, what a culinary hidden Gem?",5,2022,11,04
133,Charges to our room was a mistake,"Room was average but size was good. When we check out, there was a lunch and a breakfast charge on our bill which we did not do.  This 5star hotel does not  check when the client charges meals to the room from the bar/restaurant.  Guests beware! Check you bill thouroughly.",3,2022,10,29
133,"Do not stay here.. Expensive and any customer 
service... Non existent.",Absolutely awful...reception and the manager made us feel like 2nd class citizens.. The people next room complained that our TV was too loud... I am profoundly deaf.  The they sent two burly blokes to our room... How intimidating and  embarrassing! The manager that we spoke to the next morning.. 16th October... Basically could not be bothered... He looked down at us.  This room was nearly ¬£500for two nights... Expect more.... Will Never return.  Really. Really upsetting.  Stay away from this hotel,1,2022,10,16
133,What a great hotel!,"What a fantastic hotel in beautiful surroundings. We had a room with a view onto Kensington Park and it was just amazing. The room was clean and very stylish. The bed was super comfortable. Breakfast was tasty, fresh, and the service was quick and polite. We couldn‚Äôt ask for a better stay celebrating our Wedding Anniversary. Many thanks.",5,2022,10,16
133,NEVER 5 STARS,"First of all we were staying for a charity agm and banquet, as volunteers we needed to drive down from Yorkshire and as a consequence needed an extra night which we had to pay for ¬£280 bed & breakfast. Our room was 403 on the 4th floor, close to the lifts as my wife has mobility issues and we didn't want a long walk to the room. Spotlessly clean but VERY SMALL with no room to stand a case on a luggage rack, the only information for guests is via the TV screen, limited in many respects. There seemed to be no bar or coffee shop to get a drink outside of restaurant hours, the Piano bar was accessed via stairs which was an issue for us but we made it and seemed to be the only ones who did ! Our AGM luncheon was very nice with quality food via buffet service, all piping hot and the Banquet in the evening was, I have to say, excellent. Service a little slow/disjointed but a good night was had by all. BUT BREAKFAST on both days was an absolute disaster, everything was luke warm, no menus were offered and no way of knowing ""how it all worked"" a walk for juices, a walk for cereals and fruit etc, no toast on display, no idea on how to request anything from the kitchen. We asked for tea, coffee and mixed toast, the drinks arrived after a delay both luke warm I asked for hot coffee and was told it was busy and could take some time!! I had to attend a rehearsal for the agm so had to leave after a 25 minute wait for coffee and never received the toast. I made it clear to the waiter involved that I was unhappy. On day 2 the experience was no better we asked for toast and it never arrived, we asked for tea and coffee, it took forever and arrived luke warm. People at the next table ordered drinks as we sat down with our breakfast and were still waiting when we left. A hotel inspector should visit just for breakfast I guarantee they will lose 2 stars. A shameful, absolute shambles.",2,2022,10,11
133,How nice to return here after several years,"A very friendly and warm welcome from a team who care about their guests and are proud of where they work.  Excellent, newly refurbished bedroom, with a birds eye view of bustling High Street Kensington.  Spacious, well appointed bathroom with all the amenities you would expect at 5 star.  Complete peace and quiet in the room and a great night's sleep.  Restaurant has very recently been re-imagined opening up morning views to Kensington Gardens - good breakfast choice offered by smiling staff who are still getting used to their new surroundings. The 10th Floor restaurant and bar is worth visiting at sunset for wonderful views across London and Oriental cuisine,  The piano bar is still looking for its new identity - but I am sure it will soon be just right  as the hotel's management is clearly very 'hands on' and want to offer the best in hospitality.  It was a pleasure to return here to find quality is still their top priority.",5,2022,10,08
133,"Friendly staff, great service","We went as a family to celebrate my MUMS heavenly birthday here, she loved this hotel for many years, a firm family favourite, the staff were kind everywhere we went, lovely cake & champers left in both rooms, we had coffee in the Origin restaurant & the staff showed empathy, comfortable but small classic rooms although refurbished & new, lovely concierge, just everything was brilliant thank you for having us, keep up the great work üåπ",5,2022,10,06
133,Beyond amazing - Origin Restaurant,"Found this hidden brand new gem in the heart of Kensington, the Origin restaurant, at the Royal Garden hotel - we had a blast! 
Out of this world cocktail - Reggie blew out mind. 
Amazing starters tickled our taste buds and we are satisfied. The head Chef, John, came out to see how we were going. What an excellent customer service!
Crab cakes and the most delicious pork bites ever are worth a try. 
Friendly staff and relaxing atmosphere, we'll be back. Thank you, Origin Kensington!",5,2022,10,01
133,Terrific stay! Exceptional service! Hospitality truly at its finest.,"Absolutely terrific stay. From checkin to checkout, the hotel epitomized hospitality at its finest. From the front office team to the gentleman at concierge, each individual went above and beyond in terms of hospitality. A very special thank you to Mr Juan Porcella, he truly made our stay an unforgettable one. A very elegant and genuine individual who helped make our stay that much better.",5,2022,09,23
133,What has happened to this hotel,"We had no real welcome when we arrived, the receptionist kept moving us back from one desk to another and had little to no conversation. We have stayed here before a few times so didn‚Äôt ask about the restaurant, breakfast or the bar at check in. However, I was a little puzzled as the entrance where I thought the bar and restaurant was is now a wall. I asked about this at reception and they explained that the bar and restaurant were being refurbished. This was never mentioned on check in or when booking the hotel room. We fancied a drink and asked at reception where the bar was, only to be told there was no bar open at 3:30 pm and we‚Äôd have to wait till 5:30 pm which I think is very poor in a five star hotel. The bar that they‚Äôre using is very dark and dingy and I guess it‚Äôs for late night drinking rather than at 5:30 pm and is really not suitable for pre dinner drinks. The Aircon in the room was awful, just blowing out room temperature air which isn‚Äôt great given it‚Äôs quite warm at the moment. They are serving the breakfast in one of their conference rooms and the buffet breakfast was ok, but really not a five star hotel standard. At Check out, we are we‚Äôre asked how our stay was and I said not great, it was clear the receptionist wasn‚Äôt really listening to me and completely ignored what I had said. I doubt we will come back to this hotel following  this visit as it‚Äôs not cheap which is okay if you are getting what you pay for, but at this hotel sadly it‚Äôs not the case anymore.",2,2022,09,04
133,Dre,Dreadful 2day visit check in no greeting welcome or smile no air conditioning no volume on t v no fan for room Abysmal Gone downhill Regular guest for years but this visit with my daughter was awful Telephone to reception and housekeeping never answered Beyond Belief,1,2022,08,23
133,Its not what it used to be!!!,"I've said at the Royal garden a good few times, granted not for around 5 years but this place is not what it used to be, by that I mean special, stopping at RGH used to a real treat, no it's just an average London hotel.
I understand the restaurant is being refurbed but that is no excuse for the breakfast that is being provided, I've had better service, comfort and food at motorway service station, the whole hotel is tied!",2,2022,08,23
133,It was ok! Everything was very small.,"Booked this hotel for two nights, Friday and Saturday.  On check in the receptionist was ok, no conversation and was indifferent.  We had a very, very small room and bed which was very uncomfortable but It was very clean, pillows lacked support and were paper thin.

What I found strange was that we were able to walk into the hotel, off the street several times and on each occasion into the lift, past up to 10 members of staff and not one would acknowledge us or ask if we stayed at the hotel? Poor security and guest service! 

We chose not to go for the breakfast due to the price‚Ä¶ there are plenty of places within walking distance of the hotel so this wasn‚Äôt an issue.

The hotel is in a great location and perfect to walk around the park and Kensington High Street.  Not sure if I‚Äôd stay again‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm undecided.  The lobby gave the impression that the hotel was grand, but the rooms weren‚Äôt.",3,2022,08,15
133,Lovely stay but ruined wheel,"This hotel is wonderful. The staff are really attentive, especially the concierge team. Rooms were really nice, clean and comfortable. The pillows could be a little fuller as they disappear when you put your head down. A leisurely stroll through the park and we were in Oxford St ready for a days shopping. 

The only downside was we booked our rooms with garden views, my room got upgraded (slightly bigger room) but I lost my room with a view and our second room could just about see the gardens. We tend to have breakfast at Cafe Concerto just down the road so didn‚Äôt experience the restaurants. Unbeknown to us at the time, they charge for everything, even the dusty old bowl of nuts at the bar, don‚Äôt be shy is asking for a decent bowl as you‚Äôre paying ¬£2.75 for them 

The only real issue, and it was a big problem, was the car park. Before I drove down there (underground car park), I was told it was a tight fit but really! Damaged a wheel so really not happy. Realised it was a real problem when there were only two other cars down there. If you stay here and drive anything other than a mini (I have a 4 series BMW) park somewhere else as the hotel will take no responsibility at all but will quickly demand ¬£90 for two days for the privilege of using the car park.  I heard stories of many other guests damaging wheels. Really poor design, tight turns and raised curbs that could easily be resolved with rubberised curbing. 

If not for the wheel I would have offered a 5 rating",4,2022,08,15
133,Rude service no AC in rooms run,"I have been staying at this hotel for years sadly to say that things have changed with management staff and service within the hotel.
I booked a stay for 3 weeks in the hotel and since day one they had problems with the air conditioning  
That they were not able to fix or handle keep in mind this is a will know 5 star hotel, who should have someone on site to fix
I have complained many time asking for a solution with fort desk and management. Their response was of  you don‚Äôt like it leave the hotel when speaking to the manager he promised that the issues will be solved it has not yet been solved I asked to be moved to another room in the hotel where air conditioning was working they refused stating that you room is the cheapest stay within that category we can‚Äôt do anything.
I was looking forward to my post COVID holiday in london and in the hotel however this hotel is just going under
Part of the experience is service and service is bad  here what kind of hotel would ask the gust to simply leave after the payment was payed in full for 3 weeks
Simply disappointing",1,2022,08,10
133,Hell summer 2022,"We are experiencing the worst travel in summer 2022 with this hotel, everything is super BAD. 
The quality of the service, the rooms, the bathroom has a smell, they don't change the linen sheet of the bed daily, the internet is disconnected suddenly 

AND the most painful supersize that the AC went down and we stayed for 3 nights with no AC, no solution, no refund or any alternatives.. 

IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE STAY EVER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. 
NOT recommend it at all",1,2022,08,09
133,Good hotel,"We booked 2 rooms here for our family of 4 and stayed for 5 nights. I had reached out to the Hotel a few times prior to our travel and always found them prompt in their response. Our flight was arriving early and I had requested an early check in for one of the rooms. They were very kind to accommodate us. 
The rooms itself are quite large (by London standards) and the Hotel is very well located on Kensington High Street - very near the Tube and near scores of great Coffee, Breakfast and meal options. The Hotel is right next to Kensington Gardens and it was great to go for a run and walk around there.
Rooms were nice and overlooking the Kensington High Street. We were quite pleased with the Housekeeping and they were happy to deliver any additional amenities we required. I also found the Concierge and the team (who helped hail cabs, etc) very helpful. We didn't have Breakfast included and didn't eat at the Hotel - so cant comment on the food.
All in all - a good stay with friendly staff.",5,2022,07,18
133,The most horrible stay ever,"Very old fashioned rooms
No luxury at all
Air con not working; room temperature around 40 degrees
Very poor service
Breakfast served in an old shabby conference room
Piano bar closed
Very jnfriendly staff
Never ever again in my life",1,2022,07,16
133,Avoid : underwhelming !,"Probably on of the most disappointing experiences in my life. No mini-bar ( no go !) , no shower ( you have to shower in a bathtube wich is rather high step-in) , Aircon weak, Breakfast self-service ( even for coffee !) , dry chicken sausages and very low quality eggs but 5 (!) people walking around telling you that you have to leave at 10.30. Afternoon : no bar open (!?) No bed-side table for me aso : Avoid !! At this price you find easily a better place to stay !",1,2022,07,16
133,Met expectations,"Met expectations. Clean modern and functional. Great location. We visited for a gig at Hammersmith Apollo .rooms very clean and quite spacious for London. Staff all cheery and helpful.bathrooms good and clean, nice toiletries. Great location and good value.",5,2022,07,13
133,What a disappointment!,"I booked this hotel for 1 night as the location looked great, and it was. The entrance hall is impressive and all the staff are friendly and polite. Unfortunately that's where it ends. We had a double room which was very small and over the piano bar which we could hear until 1am. The bed was hard and uncomfortable and the pillows were atrocious. I didn't complain about them as we didn't get to bed until midnight and I couldn't face trying to wait for new pillows at that time. This hotel has a 5* rating so I assumed the bed and pillows would be top notch? We had booked breakfast which is always a nice treat at a 5* hotel, but unfortunately not at this one! We got there at 9am, so not late and they had run out of coffee!!!! The breakfast selection was poor and was very slow to be refreshed, I even had to ask for a tea bag. The staff were polite but most of them didn't seem to have a clue what to do or how to handle customers. The breakfast manager was polite and apologetic but unfortunately our breakfast experience was ruined with constantly having to ask for items and get up and down waiting for items to be refreshed. The manager did eventually offer us a packed lunch and refunded the breakfast cost which we appreciated . After checking out we just needed a taxi to take us across London, but were told by the doorman that he couldn't get one as they can't get through to the front of the hotel?? It didn't look blocked to us? So after all the disappointment of this pretty expensive hotel experience (over ¬£450 for 1 night!), we walked away dragging our cases to find our own taxi. I can't believe this is a 5* hotel, we didn't even get a 3* experience.",2,2022,07,03
133,A room you couldn't swing a mouse in.,"The garden room with a view is what I reserved. The room, that looked nothing like the photo on the website, was so tiny that if ever two people were to occupy it they would either have to be joined at the hip or lilliputian. There literally was no room to put my suitcase down and open it except on the bed. Of course I asked for a change and of course I was told that there was nothing available. A bit disingenuous especially at the high price paid.
The bed was comfortable, the bathroom compact but fine and the television complicated to access and disappointing in its selection of channels which were all British. 
All of the staff were uniformly lovely with a standout doorman named Jason. 
Had the room been in keeping with what was promoted, I would have rated this property more than just average and it would be a cold day in Hades before I pay 30 GBP + for a breakfast that can be had at literally less than one half of the price at one of London's best brasseries a short walk away, namely The Ivy and even less at a myriad of places a few yards away.",3,2022,07,03
133,Zero comprehensive billing,"Booking was a confused mess. The reservation department only confused it more. After an hour on the phone, it was all cleared up. Now I am being charge for 2 rooms when I only used one and the reservation folks are still messing things up. It is an okay hotel in a great location but it is run by folks who are eager to scam you out of your money and actual service is non-existent.",1,2022,06,27
133,Very enjoyable stay,"Booked a family suite while attending a charity event.
The hotel is in a great location, has good amenities and excellent staff. 
The family suite was spacious and comfortable. Great selection for breakfast, served on the 10th floor with lovely views over Kensington Palace gardens.
Highly recommended.",5,2022,06,25
133,Ms Dulia Prado,"Booked Two double occupancy rooms for 18 June 2022.
It was a huge relief to be able to check-in at much earlier time, Rooms we‚Äôre ready at 12:30pm. Front desk staff were very helpful.
Will be back again.",5,2022,06,20
133,Appalling service,I've booked to stay at RGH for our formal charity event months ago for accommodation on 18th June 22. RGH staff promised me I could check in at 11am and today the hotel staff were arrogant! Appalling service and bad attitude!!,1,2022,06,18
133,Disappointing...,"The only good thing about the hotel are the staff members who are attentive and do their best to provide a good experience in a very messy/run down hotel. After two years closed due to the pandemic, the hotel is not what it used to be. Perhaps, when all the renovations are completed it will get back to what it was. Currently, the breakfast room and the best rooms (with a view to the park) are being refurbished. The TV in our room was old with horrible/cheap channels (no Netflix or similar) and the remote control did not work properly. We had to wait in line to have (a very average) breakfast as the temporary breakfast room cannot cope with the number of guests. The Estonian lady at the breakfast reception was lovely though and did her best to make the experience less bad. Conclusion: At Royal Garden you will pay the fare of a 5 star hotel and will have the experience of a 3 star one. I would not recommend that you stay there, at least until they upgrade the premises.",2,2022,06,14
133,Spectacular breakfast spot with pleasant rooms,"It‚Äôs a good hotel, with lovely views of the park and across London. I‚Äôd be happy to stay again but wouldn‚Äôt rush back, especially for the price paid. 
The room was well presented and bathroom was very impressive, but the alarm clock and tv both were tired and poorly functioning. The front door wasn‚Äôt working and you had to use the side door. 
I understand the hotel is being refurbished so this may well be addressed. 
Breakfast is on the 10th floor restaurant. It is undoubtedly a spectacular location for breakfast with incredible views. However the hot breakfast offer was a bit limited and staff were quite busy and therefore not that attentive. Repeated requests for coffee took some time. 
A good hotel in London",4,2022,05,08
133,Beautiful villas,"Fiona is possibly the best hotel manager I have ever come across, she is friendly, professional and extremely helpful.

Royal Garden Villas are managed extremely well and I have absolutely nothing bad to say.",5,2022,04,14
133,The Hotel that smiles!,"This is our second visit to this lovely hotel. 
The staff are all such lovely people! 
They all smile and genuinely take an interest in their customers.

We were sight seeing and it was so helpful that we could drop our luggage off at the hotel before setting off for the day.

Breakfast was lovely with again smiling attentive staff.
Room lovely and clean with gorgeous Penhaligons toiletries.

My only criticism was the pillows, they were so flat! 

But other than this minor negative it‚Äôs beautiful and it‚Äôs a hotel thats got something so right, a quality so important, particularly after the Pandemic.

It truly is a Hotel that knows how to smile.

How lovely is that!",4,2022,04,10
133,Ambiguous guidance regarding NCP car park ticket machines and the online pre-booking process.,"This review is about the NCP car park not hotel services. 
Please be aware that the advice given if you prebook your parking space does not match up with the information provided on the ticket machine.
Please do not put your ticket in the machine by the -2 level lift entry foot exit.
You should drive up to barrier and pop your ticket in that machine.
I am waiting to get my extra payment reimbursed by NCP.",1,2021,10,17
133,Wonderful Location,"This is my first choice of properties for business stays in London. It is adjacent to Kensington Gardens and the Palace. It is a short trip to the motorway and relatively speaking, not that bad a ride to Heathrow. 

It still has that sophisticated English feel to it throughout the property. The front desk staff is very helpful, and the staff at the restaurant is very attentive. The breakfast buffet is world class, and nothing beats the bottomless supply of fresh strawberries. 

The rooms are quiet, well designed and maintained, and have above average square footage for a London hotel. The view on the upper floors of Kensington Gardens with the skyline in the background is breathtaking. While the concierge does his best, getting a cab on a rainy morning is always quite the challenge!  

When I arrive from the States exhausted from a red eye, I always feel at home in the comfort of checking into this property. If you enjoy walking, this is the perfect location for seeing one of the best areas London has to offer. 

The neighborhood is phenomenal, and oozes with a sense of history. I would highly recommend a walk through Kensington Garden and to Royal Albert Hall, which is located a short walk down the High Street.",5,2021,09,24
133,Hit and miss,"We stayed here for one night as we were going to the theatre.  All staff were absolutely lovely, friendly and helpful.  I would not class the rooms as 5*, they were very dated with chipped furniture and the bath was badly chipped with an old-fashioned tiny shower head over it.  There were nice Penhaligon toiletries in the bathroom though.  The bedding was of very poor quality, the pillows were old and almost flat and the quilt was very thin so we got cold in the night.  The heating was very hit and miss too, maybe they were saving money as the hotel was almost empty according to the receptionist.  We did have a lovely view of Kensington Palace though.  I also thought they were rather mean with the teabags, just 2 in the room so we had to choose between tea on our arrival or the next morning.  Due to the coronavirus situation, the hotel was almost empty but we were asked if we wanted to pay for an upgrade.  I would have thought that they would have automatically upgraded customers who hadn't cancelled as a thank you.  

The food at breakfast was of a high quality but I was very disconcerted to see a customer at the breakfast buffet wearing pyjamas (a fully grown man)!  I did wonder if he had washed himself that morning before coming down to breakfast and how hygenic it was.  I feel the hotel should have had a word with him and asked him to get dressed.

I probably wouldn't stay here again as there is a nearby 5* hotel (the Milestone) which is so far superior, I would go there next time.",3,2020,05,01
133,Wonderful hotel with the best of London,"Come to this hotel a lot for work and personal trips, and it's always a great experience. Staff are friendly and quick to respond, the area is nice to walk around for restaurants and shopping, and area is open later than most spots in London. Having access to the park for runs or walks is also nice, and it's at a good location for dealing with London traffic, although a bit less accessible to public transport. The restaurants are high quality.",5,2020,04,03
133,Incredibly helpful staff and wonderful service - 2nd return trip for business event,"This was the second time in two years we have used the Royal Garden Hotel as an event production base, staying for nearly 3 weeks and using the majority of the lower ground meeting spaces and booking close to 90x rooms for the crew and staff. Two years ago I was incredibly grateful for all of their help in making a very stressful event run so smoothly, and the experience this time was equally fantastic. From my initial enquiry with them in December 2019 regarding rates and availability through to my last email comms with Bettina a couple of weeks ago about invoices [I know, this is a very overdue review!] every member of the hotel staff have been courteous, professional and kind. Their sense of good humour when dealing with our crazy requests was noticed by all of our crew and helped our morale hugely. I would like to thank them all for making our stay so easy and welcoming, and I cannot begin to imagine the amount of work that they all put in behind the scenes every day to make the whole operation run so smoothly. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone considering a high end hotel with a personal touch [be it for business or leisure purposes], based right in the heart of London and near to all of its amenities 

Particular thanks - and apologies for those whose names I have forgotten and not listed here, it is my poor memory at fault! - must go to the legend that is Alan Robinson in Operations for looking after us throughout the duration, the great team of Surina Chand & Alexandru Caramida from Reception for calmly dealing with our never ending room requests/tweaks/additions, and of course Huong for overseeing our entire room reservation grid and being so positive when faced with our every request. Final thanks must go to Bettina Sanders, Senior Conference & Events Manager, who handled our booking two years ago as well. I was delighted for the opportunity to work with her again as she is so calm and unflappable, and really made the hotel part of the event feel very effortless. 

Thank you all again, and hopefully see you soon!",5,2020,03,31

133,Rugby International Weekend,"We love this hotel, with a warm welcome and service from all the staff. Worth paying the premium for the garden view over Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. We were out and about for the rugby international and theatre, and apart from the room, only really used the breakfast facility - great choice and attentive staff. Enjoyed a good walk around Hyde Park and then to Twickenham starting at the nearby High Street Kensington Tube Station. A lovely weekend - we look forward to visiting again.",5,2020,03,10

133,40th Anniversary Celebrations ,"My husband and I stayed for 1 night to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary. The hotel is in a fabulous  position with some rooms overlooking Hyde Park, it is only  a 10 minute walk to the Royal Albert Hall, perfect. The tube station is just down the road, and there is a bus stop directly outside. The hospitality here is second to none. All staff we met were so helpful, to ensure we had a memorable time. The hotel is very clean, we ate in the Park Terrace restaurant,  overlooking the park the food was great, with a nice atmosphere. We then went to the piano bar, this is superb, lovely cocktails, upbeat pianist , with great music, and lots up dancing. Our room was an upgrade overlooking the park, clean , a good size, with everything we needed. The kindness didn't stop there, flowers, and truffles with a lovely note were left in our room.we have such lovely memories of our stay in the Royal Garden Hotel. I can't recommend enough . The breakfast choice is vast, the best we have seen. Omellettes etc. cooked fresh for you. I would love to stay here  if we visit London again. If you are looking for a great hotel, this is the one. I really do mean all staff were so welcoming,  absolute credit to you.Thank you for an amazing, memorable stay.",5,2020,03,01

133,5 Stars in an excellent location with wonderful staff.,"This hotel is in an excellent location. Next to the best park in London, opposite Whole Foods (good or bad) and 5 mins from the tube. What makes this place though is the staff. Always ready and attentive, that cannot do enough for you. The reception is always fully staffed with reception / concierge or porters, that it is a pleasure form the moment you arrive.
The location is great, and if you are lucky enough to get a park room, it has the best views. 
Also there is the added bonus of one of the best Chinese restaurants in London on the 10th floor, Min Jiang, with a vast just for that.
If you are coming form abroad, you cannot find abbey example of British hospitality.",5,2020,02,27

133,Amazing Value,"I recently stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel a number of times for short stays over a period of a a few weeks. I was very impressed by this hotel for the money charged. 

Service is generally excellent and the exec rooms are spacious and the hotel feels very safe. The rooms are quiet and the guests very pleasant. 

I didn't eat at the signature Chinese restaurant but did eat both at the bar/ lounge and the downstairs restaurant. The dining areas lack atmosphere but I had an excellent main course in the restaurant, with more indifferent food at the lounge/ bar.

The location is excellent for tourists - being at the top of High St Ken. Loads of shops and restaurants are on the doorstep and easy access to many of the main sights, museums etc.",4,2020,02,24
133,GREAT STAY,"My husband and I stayed just one night at this hotel and chose it for it's location, as we were going to see an evening Cirque De Soleil show at The Royal Albert Hall.  The staff were friendly and welcoming.  We arrived at the hotel early but our room was not yet available, so we left our bags with them and went out shopping at Kensington High Street.  It was not long before we had a phone call to say our room was now ready.  We were shown to our room, with our luggage already there for us.  Our Garden room was very comfortable and spacious with a view of Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. Breakfast was impressive.  There are a variety of cereals and lots of fresh fruit.  My husband had the buffet style cooked breakfast, which he says was hot and delicious. The tube station is just up the road and a bus stop right outside the hotel.  This was our first time at this hotel but will definatley be our hotel of choice from now on when visiting London. Fully recommend.",5,2020,02,24

We booked the family package so had unlimited movies, extensive room service platter, stunning breakfast and then hire of scooters for a trip round the park. Little things made a big difference- the receptionist was super friendly to the children, the restaurant staff put the pancake sauces on the side in case the kids didn‚Äôt like them. The view was also amazing.
Thank you.",5,2020,02,20

The room was clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. The breakfast is excellent and the variety of items available is extensive.

From the person at the door, to reception at check in, to the room service staff, and everyone else.. service with a smile. My wife was so pleased with the breakfast and flowers and chocolates we got this morning that I couldn‚Äôt put a price on her smile.. very heart warming..Thank you to Benjamin for organising all of this and ALL his colleagues...super job. Definatley be staying again and will recommend this hotel experience to everyone.",5,2020,02,10
133,Sensational,"Always 5 Star in every way. I would highly recommend the Royal Gardens Hotel to anyone wanting a special stay. The staff are always so hospital, nothing is ever too much. From the moment of arrival you‚Äôre made to feel at home. Well that‚Äôs if you have someone looking after you 24/7, a selection of some of the best food in the city, at your home!",5,2020,02,07
133,Excellent Hotel,"We normally meet up with friends at this time of year and stay together nearby, but we have often walked by the Royal Garden and my wife had commented we should try this sometime, so I booked in this year as a surprise for her birthday. It worked very well - especially since she thought we were staying somewhere else!  The staff were excellent right from the word go, being greeted upon arrival, with the luggage taken care of and were given a lovely, spacious room, spotlessly clean overlooking Kensington Palace. After returning from the theatre in the evening, there were chocolates and a bottle of wine waiting  for her or her with a personal birthday message.  A very nice touch which was very much appreciated.  We did not get chance to try the restaurants since we were meeting friends each day, but we would like to do so in future. Overall, we had a most enjoyable experience and would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2020,02,05
133,Time after time exceptional stay again,"We have stayed at this hotel on many occasions and keep coming back all because of the excellent staff and their outstanding hospitality.

This stay was to have a family get together and celebrate two birthdays, with a little help from the restautrant manager Giovanni and his deputy Marco they excelled in delivering what can only be described as a great memory, attached is a lovely hand created birthday cake which we didn't expect at all, the finer touches make for a perfect evening and a reason to come back.

As we book direct with the inhouse reservation team they offer great Royaly Rewards, upgrades for which we had to a suite, also a request for a Kensington Palce facing bedroom higher up, they also accommadated which is perfect, attention to detail delivered. The rooms were so clean, fresh and comfortable, very well looked after by the housekeeping and maintenance team.

Everywhere we went we found very happy genuine staff who wanted to assist, the consierge in particual a tall gentleman was really helpful and polite but so real with personality, the experience from arrival to departure lives up to not only a 5 star hotel but to a hotel built on people values, after all staying away you want to be looked after.

The breakfast and range with exceptional quality was so delicious you really cant go without trying out, dont forget to meet the weekend chef who cooks fresh to order, he's got such a personality, say hello, we do and so enjoy each time we dine there.

On our stay this weekend we even met the Executive Head Chef Steve Munkley who took time out to say hello, this is hospitality at the highest level and a privelage.

All in all a really great stay and experience, thank you team Royal Gardens",5,2020,02,04
133,Yet another very enjoyable visit,We have stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel many times over the past ten years or so and the standard show no sign of slipping. We had a 9th floor Garden Room on this visit. Very spacious with panoramic views over Kensington Palace Gardens and the London skyline beyond. Breakfast was plentiful and well presented as usual. However it isn't the superb location or facilities which bring us back time after time to this hotel but the genuine warmth and friendliness of the staff throughout the hotel which is their real asset.  ,5,2020,02,04
133,"Staff were all smiley, but fake and unhelpful.","Booked for two, you only had us down for one. You did fix this  quickly and without fuss.  We only had one towel. We get a phone call asking if everything was okay. We said but we only have one towel and asked for one to be sent up. I was told it would be up shortly. About 15 minutes later we get another call asking the same question. We said yes, still waiting on the towel. We had plans for the evening so approx two hours after we arrived we went out. We weren't able to shower beforehand, only one towel.  There was a second towel by the time we got back around 23:00, no idea when it was delivered.

We wanted to have a  nice bath before we left but couldn't get it to work. After breakfast  we asked at reception if they didn't mind having someone show us. They said they'll send someone right up. No one showed.
",1,2020,02,03
133,Superb Stay,"Our stay was just perfect.  we had a great welcome on arrival and a surprise in the room, an upgrade, of chocolates for my birthday.  The breakfast was superb, possibly one of the best in our travels round India & Asia and dinner in Park Terrace was excellent.
We look forward to another visit and hope the rates will be as good.

Thank you all.    ",5,2020,02,03
133,The best hotel in London,"I always enjoy my stay at The Royal Garden, their location is ideal, facilities excellent and the staff are phenomenal! Rooms are a generous size, considering London standards. Whenever I travel to London, this is the only place I stay at.",5,2020,02,03
133,Great Travelzoo deal,"Visited with the Travelzoo deal and it was worth it. Not sure otherwise. Lots of breakfast choice, bed comfy, very nice bathroom, had a view over Kensington Palace.

Staff were nice. The lifts were a little slow, left luggage a little disorganised but that maybe just isolated to our experiences.",4,2020,02,02
133,Highly Recommended,"We would highly recommend this hotel. Professional staff, excellent service and with our travelzoo offer good value for money.
Close to the underground, plenty of shops to hand and a good choice of restaurants and pubs in the neighbourhood.
",5,2020,01,29
133,Anniversary weekend,"For an anniversary weekend in London with a little extravagance this hotel does not disappoint. The rooms are clean, airy and spacious with all the nice little touches you expect from a 5 star hotel. The breakfast option, although may seem a little pricey, is very good. Eggs cooked whilst you wait in the way you like them. Fresh fruit and yoghurts that are continuously topped up. Even the separate section for those that are gluten intolerant had a large selection of options. 

The staff are polite, attentive and nothing is too much of an inconvenience. We asked for different pillows that were slightly firmer, which were placed on our bed for when we returned. 

The new Piano bar, which is located above reception, if you want a drink a little bit of music it is a ‚Äòmust‚Äô visit and doesn‚Äôt disappoint with live music in a relaxed atmosphere. 

Location is fantastic, less than 5 min walk to the nearest tube station with the hotel situated right next to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. 

",5,2020,01,29
133,Great location -,"Royal Garden is ideally located for business and leisure activities in the heart of London. Easy access to Theater, Parks, and terrific dining.  The staff is happy to be of service if you ask, but seem a little hesitant to anticipate the needs of guests or worse to ask if they can be of service. 
",3,2020,01,29
133,London Weekend,"Arrival was at 9am and our room was ready excellent. Room was spacious, clea, super shower. Location ideal, underground very near, bus stop outside.
Had a meal in the hotel which was excellent, breakfast choice of buffet or a la carte included in the price  .",5,2020,01,29
133,Little Gem,Great location as we were at the Albert Hall. We were able to check-in to our room at 10am this was a real bonus. The staff were very attentive and the hotel was great value for money. Excellent breakfast we will be back. ,5,2020,01,28
133,Excellent Weekend,"The Hotel is exceptionally well run, it starts when you arrive and are welcomed to the Hotel. The food was awesome, the breakfast was second to none and served with a smile. Great location with many shops, bars and restaurants close to the hotel. ",5,2020,01,28
133,Great hotel in London,"Just returned from a fab weekend at the Royal Garden Hotel with my husband and son. The location is superb and the staff could not do enough for you, everyone we met was so friendly and made us feel very special. There is a Piano bar which was great fun, it was lovely to pop into on our way back from dinner and hear some live music in a relaxed atmosphere.
The bedroom itself was very well appointed and had breathtaking views over London ‚Äì I could sit and watch that view all day! In the morning we had one of the best breakfasts ever, there was so much choice and great quality ‚Äì my son loved the waffles! All in all a great family stay in the capital.",5,2020,01,27
133,Fantastic Night!!,We spent a fantastic night at the Royal Garden Hotel last Saturday. We took some close relatives to Min Jiang where we ate like royalty. Both food and service were wonderful and we loved the speciality duck and dim sum. The service team were delightful and even the restaurant manager took the time to make us feel welcome and explain the menus to us. We had only planned to visit Min Jiang before returning home but on the way out in the lobby of the hotel we heard the sound of music coming from above us. Looking up we noticed the Piano Bar and decided to pay a visit for a last drink. Needless to say we ended up spending the rest of the night in the bar which is super cool and has live pianists playing great tunes. It was busy and a great atmosphere I‚Äôd highly recommend both Min Jiang and Piano Bar. I have visited the hotel before and really like what they have done with the new bar‚Äì we will be back!!,5,2020,01,26
133,Always a joy,"Very little to add here to my previoius reviews.  The hotel remains my favourite of all time. The whole stay was great - room, service, and food were all great. I now regard many of the staff as friends.  Everyone is so lovely to me, I am almost ""blown away"". As before, my companion for part of my stay was treated possibly better than royalty! ",5,2020,01,26
133,Ideal for Business Travelers,"Unbeatable location in Kensington. Well-maintained common areas, clean and spacious rooms. First-class products for breakfast with several menu selections, including English, Continental and Middle East. The breakfast space is never crowded. Room design is very neutral, which is good when traveling for business, but lacks something special and memorable for the guests who are on leisure trips. Staff is great, guest-oriented, easy-to-communicate and helpful.",5,2020,01,23
133,Christmas family holidays at Royal Garden Hotel,Absolutely fantastic London Family holiday destination. Centrally situated. Our family are all adults. So we enjoyed every bit of it. Only breakfast options are limited.  Within walking distance to the Metro station. Variety of restaurants and shopping located around the Hotel. ,5,2020,01,22
133,Best value five star hotel in London,"Great location and great service. The rooms are a good size and whilst the bathrooms in the entry level rooms are shower-over-bath, the water pressure is really good and the bathrooms themselves are very spacious. It is not as swanky as five star deluxe hotels such as the the Savoy, the Ritz or the Four Seasons, but it is a well run, well kept, luxury hotel and only half their price. Now that I've discovered it, I will be returning regularly.",5,2020,01,22
133,Love this hotel,"Stayed a few times over the last year.  I love this hotel and I am quite fussy where I stay.  Rooms are a good size and very clean, staff are lovely and the breakfast is amazing.  This time however we were disappointed that Bertie's Bar, where you could go and have a quiet drink and relax before bed, is now Piano Bar with extremely loud music which continued until around midnight.  Apart from this, I would highly recommend this hotel.  ",5,2020,01,21
133,Kensington weekend break,We normally stay near regents park but decided on the royal Garden hotel. This was a good choice as it really easy to get to all the main museums and the saatchi gallery.  The breakfast was excellent and served in an relaxed atmosphere. ,5,2020,01,21
133,Very Nice Stay,"We were introduced to the hotel by Disney Concierge Collection and enjoyed our stay. The location is excellent, next to Kensington Palace and near public transportation. The staff in the hotel and restaurant coiuld not have been better. The restaurant food for breakfast, lunch and dinner was excellent. 
The only issue was check in. We arrived early directly form the airport and expected a wait. We were told the room was being made up and the front desk would call where ready. We enjoyed lunch in the restaurant and waited about 2.5 hours to inquire. The manager was holding a room until it was made up as a king. We went with the manager to the room and determined the room was fine as it was made up. Understandable issue in a holiday week. 
Should the opportunity arise, we will stay here again.",5,2020,01,19
133,Second stay,"For our second visit to the Royal Garden we chose a suite as we were with our daughter and felt this would be the best option for 3 adults.The third bed was a sofa bed which my daughter found quite uncomfortable so next time we would look at a different option. 
The location is superb and the Park View rooms are excellent.
Also wouldn‚Äôt chose a room on the 9th floor as the restaurant is directly above and noisy until it closes but thankfully wasn‚Äôt too late.
Breakfast was excellent with lots of choice.
All staff we encountered were excellent and very friendly.

",5,2020,01,18
133,"Great location ,but not a five star experience!","I stayed there for two days ,not really value for money . The wait for room service even for little things like dental kit could mean an excruciating waiting time . Half the elevators weren‚Äôt working . ",4,2020,01,18
133,Best Reasonably priced hotel in Kensington for quality and service,"A proper hotel with all the mod cons for people accustomed to the kind of real service and standard of hotels only found in Asia.  Good bed, pillows, sheets and towels. Proper bathroom. Airconditioning. Turn down service at night. Proper cleaning. Ability to make tea and coffee, and even a cereal bowl and mugs with spoons, and glasses in the mini bar.",5,2020,01,13
133,"Good hotel, but room a bit noisy","We stayed at the Royal Garden through a great Travelzoo offer. The hotel is well situated just five minutes from High Street Kensington tube station. All staff that we had dealings with were excellent as was the breakfast. The room was probably a four star standard, being a ‚Äòbasic‚Äô room (Queen) for this hotel. The only downside was the road noise and also the noise of the wind, on a rather blowy night, as the window was rather draughty. Overall, we enjoyed our short stay, but I‚Äôm not sure that I would have a ‚Äòcity view‚Äô room again.",4,2020,01,12
133,A winter stay in London,"Love the hotel due to its location / the accommodation / service and the wonderful breakfasts
The staff are friendly in every dept from the doorman reception concierge and restaurant

I could not really fault the rooms nor room service albeit I had to ask three times in one night for more tea and coffee bags.

",4,2020,01,11
133,Great position - great hotel.,"We spent two nights here and enjoyed our stay. We booked an ordinary room but asked for a high floor and we were not dissappointed. The room, although small was very attractively kitted out with a window seat, very clean with a refurbished bathroom with shower over bath and great quality toiletries. As we were on the 8th floor the view over the city was spectacular. We were welcomed to the hotel and shown to our room, and had all the facilities explained to us - quite a nice touch.

We ate in the Park Terrace restaurant and the quality of dinner was excellent, and the prices in our view were very reasonable. Breakfast was served in the same restaurant; very extensive and freshly cooked food to order - no dried up buffet here!

The hotel is in a first class location a short walk from the tube backing onto the palace gardens. Walk round the corner and have a leisurely walk up Kensington Palace Gardens road to admire a road full of palatial mansions!

One of our (now) favourite hotels in London and we look forward to our next stay.",5,2020,01,11
133,Car Park Shocking!,"The car park is far too tight to get down if you have a medium to large car! I scraped my alloy wheels and asked for NCP to pay for the repairs which they have said no, even though they know its tight, that their have been complaints and apparently there is a sign warning you about it. Very poor customer service. car park is not in great condition either. I would avoid!!!",3,2020,01,08
133,Excellent weekend stay near to many tourist sites,"Stayed here on a Saturday night using a deal via Travelzoo. Had a great stay, it's an excellent hotel ideally located right next to Kensington Palace with the Royal Albert Hall within easy walking distance. The staff were very friendly and helpful and made us most welcome. ",5,2020,01,08
133,Royal Garden,"Excellent friendly & helpful staff. Good restaurant, lovely food, but a bit expensive. Rooms a bit small for the price, but comfortable. Excellent position for The Royal Albert Hall. Sleep somewhat disrupted by noisy guests, (but that's not the hotel's fault).",4,2020,01,08
133,"Good location, dirty room","Booked this hotel for 3 nights, good location with a number of buses virtually at the door step and a short walk to the train station. We even walked the 2km to Harrods!
The service was good and the staff were professional and helpful, but the room was dated and run down. The carpet had stains and was dirty,",3,2020,01,08
133,Comfort and Excellent Service,"It is always a pleasure to stay at this lovely hotel.  The staff are friendly, helpful and efficient and the rooms are comfortable with an excellent view from the Garden Rooms.  We have stayed many times and will stay many more.  The food at the Park Terrace is wonderful.  The cocktails are devine and all in all a very pleasurable experience.",5,2020,01,07
133,Weekend stay in London,"A very comfortable and conveniently located hotel. Warm welcome from friendly staff.
Great breakfast.Also had a lovely dinner in the Park Terrace restaurant.
Will stay there again when next visiting London.",5,2020,01,07
133,Royal garden hotel,"Royal garden hotel nice hotel with nice location but some rooms are so small, choose the garden room it‚Äôs big enough and good for families as well , Location great for shopping just steps from the stores ",5,2020,01,07
133,The hotel to be chosen,"I had a wonderful stay at the hotel on my honeymoon. Every single staff members was so friendly and helpful which was something more than I expected. I chose the hotel for the location on my reservation but now I have experienced such a nice stay, I will definitely recommend it to my friends and family!",5,2020,01,07
133,Great Service from start to finish,"I want to say that it was such a pleasure to work with the amazing team at the Royal Garden Hotel.  Huong, Begona and Eleonora were fantastic.  Their professionalism, your fantastic service and the warmth was to me invaluable with such a short notice and it was with everyone from the first telephone call with Huong until now so my very very best recommendation to all of them.  This experience with you makes my work much easier!",5,2020,01,06
133,One of the Best,Lovely hotel in the perfect location. Has always been a favorite for the last 30+ years. Exemplary staff and service! Excellent rooms and room service. Reception staff went out of her way to make me feel very welcome!,5,2020,01,06
133,Would love to come back!,"It was a great place to stay with children and the breakfast was excellent.  The complimentary food and flick package went down very well and was a nice touch (part of the family package we booked).  The park suite was fantastic with plenty of room and a lovely view of Hyde Park.   It really was a perfect stay, excellent value for money and we would love to come back.  ",5,2020,01,06
133,A hotel with a 5-star service and accommodation at an affordable price!,"Location: Kensington High Street and near Kensington Palace
The hotel is near many shops and restaurants. It is close to the Kensington High Street underground.

133,Mixed,"Some of the staff were friendly and helpful; others were aloof.

Beds too soft.

Felt brushed off by some members of concierge.

Location however, is excellent! Views of Kensington Park, lovely shops in the area, 24 hour convenience store across the hotel.",3,2020,01,02
133,Christmas Stay,Excellent as always. The hotel team are a credit to this first class hotel. From the moment we arrived to a warm welcome (as usual) it felt like coming home.Our garden room on the 9th floor with the view over Hyde Park was 1st class in every aspect and the hotels' facilities provide a welcome oasis from the hustle and bustle of the west end.,5,2020,01,01
133,Excellent Hotel,Stayed here for 2 days from 27 - 29 December.   When I booked I was given an upgrade as it was our anniversary. Serena at reception was very polite and welcoming. The room was wonderful - overlooking Kensington Gardens.   It was very clean and had everything you would want. Even had underfloor heating in the bathroom which was lovely!   In the evening we were left chocolates which I thought was a beautiful gesture.    Breakfast was superb.  In fact it was perhaps the best breakfast I have had in London (much better than the Cavendish Hotel).  They addressed me by my name which I have never had before.  Very professional!  There was so much choice of food and it was beautifully presented.   Unfortunately I did not remember the name of the waiters but they were so polite and nothing was too much trouble.  I must admit I was sad to leave such a lovely hotel but if I ever have to go back to this area of London then this is the hotel I would definitely return to.   Thank you to all the Royal Garden Staff for a lovely two days.,5,2019,12,30
133,A Christmas to remember,"Our family of four spent Christmas 2019 in the Royal Garden Hotel. Was part of a 10 day stay in the hotel for my wife and I and our 18 and 21 year old daughters. 

We had two rooms conjoined on the High St wing. Perfect size and combination. Terrific view down the busy high street with beautiful Christmas lights. Room amenities excellent and special mention of cleaning personnel who did an amazing job throughout our stay. 

Hotel was busy with Christmas. I have stayed here at least two times a year over the past ten years and could tell this was a hectic time for staff. Overall, they are exceptional in all areas. 

Park Terrace breakfast always a highlight!  

Front office staff brilliant. Helped us so much throughout. 

Will be back!",5,2019,12,30
133,Peter of the Park Terrace,"Peter on the wait staff is the best in London. Courteous, patient and attentive, he is a fantastic ambassador for the hotel and the epitome of high quality service. The food in the Park Terrace is also excellent. ",5,2019,12,29
133,When visiting the Albert Hall for an evening concert,Just one night stay. We found all the staff we encountered very helpful. The room: Bed was very comfortable. Nice view of Kensington Gardens and Palace from Room 710. TV was dated. Most other things okay. Park terrace restaurant below average. Needs a make over and improved menu.,3,2019,12,28
133,Nights stay,"Our stay was in connection with a night at the Royal Albert Hall which is a 10 minute walk away, so very convenient for this venue. Whilst the exterior of the hotel is a little dull the interior is quite the opposite. Lovely room overlooking Kensington Gardens and the Palace. Excellent breakfast. All the staff we met were most helpful and courteous.",5,2019,12,28
133,My London Home,"Love the Royal Garden Hotel!  The location is phenomenal and the staff couldn‚Äôt be more helpful.  It‚Äôs in a perfect location‚Äîjust far enough away from the touristy crowds, but easy to get anywhere by any means of transportation.  Have stayed here three times in the past two years and loved it each time!",5,2019,12,26
133,"Great location , really helpful concierge...","Really nice room, the free water is in the fridge and the kettle is hidden in desk. The location is perfect and over breakfast you look over Kensington park. 
My main reason for the review is the great help we received from the concierge as we had left our bag there and got stuck on the other side of town. The concierge sent our bag via a taxi to the restaurant we were at without any hassle which really saved our day. ",5,2019,12,25
133,"Functionally excellent, but tired","We stay here from time to time because it has good staff and an excellent Chinese restaurant on the top floor. The beds are very comfortable and the linens are of high quality but the furnishings are generally on their last legs, with woodwork covered in scratches and interiors that have been past their prime for a while now. Think of it as a well located four star hotel with five star service and you won‚Äôt be disappointed.",4,2019,12,25
133,Not a 5 Star Hotel - Premier Inn would have been better,"First impressions where good, arrived early to the hotel and our room was ready, so bonus. Staff also were very friendly. Go to our room to drop the bags off, so we can head for our planned day out. The room is tiny and old, nowhere near 5 star standard, it really needs an overhaul. We were out all day and headed back both shattered, needing a good nights sleeps. However the bed was small but most of all uncomfortable, that along with awful pillows, had possibly the worst nights sleep. The morning we go to have a shower ready for breakfast and we realise we only have 1 set of towels, they were quick to bring some more to the room but again another thing against them. The breakfast it self was nice, we had it included as part of the stay but i would never of paid the ¬£25 per person had it not been included, extremely over priced. 
Overall a very disappointing stay, that had so much promise but just did not live anywhere near up to expectations. I do not think I would return here.",2,2019,12,24
133,Good value 5 star hotel,Ideal hotel for Royal Albert Hall. NCP car park underneath. Book parking online to save a lot of money. Staff very welcoming and breakfast is one of the better ones we have had. Kensington is a great place to shop and you can stretch your legs in the Palace Gardens or Holland Park ,4,2019,12,24
133,Exceptional,"We love this hotel. Staff are superb, breakfast is excellent with many choices for my kids and for us with nothing too much effort for us. At reception and on entry to the hotel staff were so friendly - even offering my son a fresh mince pie which he scoffed down! Would happily come here again. ",5,2019,12,24
133,Always Reliable,The Royal Garden is my favorite place to stay in London. It is immaculate and comfortable. Staff is very friendly and the room service menu is very good. Location is very convenient for my business meetings.,5,2019,12,23
133,London Trip with Kids,Stayed here a few times now and the staff are superb. The location is great with easy access to Leicester square etc. The rooms are spacious and the breakfast/dinner terrace is welcoming to kids. A great hotel and we will be back next year.,5,2019,12,23
133,Love this hotel. Staff are so friendly and great location,"Stayed here on a Saturday night as we were
Going to the Royal Albert Hall the next day. It is a great location to explore that area of London and also a short bus hop to the West end.
Staff were amazing. From checking in,
Concierge and the rest of the front desk. 
",5,2019,12,23
133,Outstanding Overnighter,"Literally had a brief overnight stay here last weekend. Checked in at 8.00pm and checked out at midday the following day! Had a superb dinner in the Park Terrace Restaurant and finished with a couple of cheeky G&T's up in Bertie's Bar. 
Woke to find a stunning view from the room overlooking Kensington Palace.
We encountered doormen, reception staff, waiters, bar tenders, room service staff and every person we had contact with were polite, friendly and an absolute credit to the hotel. We hope to come back in the Spring and have a longer stay this time.
Thank you again and wishing you all a very happy Christmas.",5,2019,12,22
133,Good location and nice rooms,Everything was good and staff is very kind.  Would like softer towels and updated iphone docks. Also my room had thin walls and i could hear the woman next door coughing constantly.  Felt bad for her but it kept me up. ,4,2019,12,22
133,A lovey Xmas Stay,"It was lovely to return to the Royal Garden Hotel for a 2 night stay just before Xmas.  Once again, the hotel delivered.  Great room, beautiful view, everything clean and comfortable.  The staff are always so friendly and helpful at this hotel and again, they all went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed.  

Breakfast was delicious and I also had lunch in the Park Terrace on 2 occasions.  The food was superb and the service first class!

I highly recommend this hotel - I return time and again.  It is classy, elegant, exceptional service, good value, clean, comfortable rooms, lovely views, great location, and even has secure parking at a very favourable rate - especially for London.  Nothing is too much trouble - the staff are always lovely.  It is always a pleasure to return here - as I will be doing next year!

This 2 day break was effectively my Xmas break at what is a difficult time for me.  I was able to enjoy a festive break without it being over the top and without xmas thrown in my face at every turn.  It was just lovely.  My thanks again to all the staff.",5,2019,12,22
133,A great location and nice & friendly staff,"Highly recommended
Ensure your breakfast is included as they made a couple of mistakes.
very good location, ensure visiting Kensington Palace next to the hotel.
Taxis take long to offload and load people so allow time.",5,2019,12,22
133,Great location and breakfast ,I was only here 1 night but really enjoyed my stay. It‚Äôs adjacent to Hyde Park so had time for Arun around the park. The room was small but clean and quiet. The breakfast was very good quality with good service. Would come back.,4,2019,12,20
133,Five Star,"It's a great location and although we haven't stayed here for a while we will be back again. The staff were are all five star and the room very comfortable with Hyde Park views, although we could have done with some firmer pillows. The phone call the day before we arrived with a thank you for booking direct was a nice touch.",5,2019,12,20
133,Royal Garden Hotel,Staff courteous and friendly. Food in Berties bar delicious. Always stay here when in London as the high standards are always maintained at this hotel. Wonderful selection at breakfast time and bed rooms well appointed and comfortable.,5,2019,12,20

133,Welcoming and comfortable.,"Great staff throughout the hotel, made it very welcoming and friendly. The lovely room was well appointed with a slightly raised seating area that we liked. The bed was very comfortable which is always a bonus! All in all, a very good one night stay.",5,2019,12,18
133,Great hotel with lovely rooms and marvellous restaurants,Went to the Royal Garden to celebrate Christmas with friends. The rooms were lovely and restaurants excellent. All of the staff were very friendly and we would definitely return. The only slight down-side was the temperature of the water in the bathrooms was hit and miss in the evenings.,5,2019,12,16
133,Excellent place. Can‚Äôt fault it,"All I can say is what a lovely place this is. The room had a queen bed and wasn‚Äôt the largest but was an adequate size. The bathroom was lovely with a tub and shower. The breakfast was out of this world with lots of choice to offer including cooked and continental as well as freshly made waffles with syrup. The hotel is close to South Kensington tube station so is a good base to explore London. 

The bar has a good selection of drinks with some nice snacks as a complement. 

Will definitely stay again in the future. ",5,2019,12,16
133,Overall a Great stay and wonderful staff,"Lovely week end with the family in Kensington.

133,Amazing hotel and Astonishing Service!,"Stayed here often and our favourite hotel in London and on this occasion has a special celebration which was particularly made special by the ownership and personal care of Felicity one of the Managers at the Hotel. 

Felicity - Thank you for being there for us and means a lot for this special occasion and you need all the recognition in the world. 

",5,2019,12,15
133,Great Location,"A great location with access to everything you might need in London.  Walking distance to many shops and restaurants, and friendly and helpful staff.  Hyde Park is right next door, so great for walks, runs, and children friendly.",4,2019,12,14

133,A Christmas stay to visit Witer Woder Land,"The hotel was well placed to visit it Central London, bus stop right out side with buses going to most of the places you want to go to..
I only wanted Bacon and Tomatoes for breakfast,  I got 2o rashers 1 tomatoe that would have been on a full English Breakfast. I felt a bit cheated, otherwise everyting was very good",5,2019,12,13
133,Royal Garden  Kensington,"For all you people out there who have not found this hotel then read on 
I stay here as it‚Äôs so relaxed wonderful staff and greet always what ever your needs you will be treated as someone special 
Any need or problem is sorted ASAP and any special request sorted the porters are exceptional in this area you try getting to Millwall for a Friday night kick off no problem to these chaps 
I find the roms top quality and the breakfast choice a delight ",5,2019,12,12
133,Perfectly positioned,"A superb choice for any visit to London. Easily accessible if like me you are coming from the west by car. Only drawback is the incredibly tight access to the NCP car park below the hotel. My car is wide and low and the tight spiral access was nerve wracking! Back to the hotel itself...great food, facilities and really good attentive staff from the reception, concierge, doorman, service staff and notably the chambermaid who was charming.",5,2019,12,12
133,Would definitely recommend this hotel!,Staff were friendly and accommodating and the facilities were fantastic! The rooms were clean and the shower was great too! Everything you could need and so close to all of the shops and also the tube station!,5,2019,12,10
133,THERE IS NO WHERE BETTER FOR US!,"Hotel, staff and location is just fantastic we stay at the Royal Garden Hotel about 2 - 4 times a year as we like to visit the Royal Albert Hall and it is in walking distance, as is all locations we like to visit, and great bus service to west end etc  just outside the main entrance. The hotel staff are all very friendly, extremely polite and professional and nothing is ever too much trouble. We also eat at least one or twice in Park Terrace restaurant and the food is always great along with the staff whom we have come to know. Also the breakfast is excellent with a very comprehensive menu for all.  The rooms are spotlessly clean and always ready for us when we arrive. Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and looking forward to our return visits next year which have already been booked.

",5,2019,12,10
133,Annual London Stay,The Royal Garden Hotel is an excellent choice with first class service and staff are fantastically helpful. We return year on year as the hotel is an excellent choice and a fantastic location. We are always looked after with and attended to immediately. It is a high class hotel at very competitive rates.  ,5,2019,12,09
133,Wonderful Base for Visiting London,"Have been a return customer to this hotel for years. Wonderful location, this hotel provides its guests with a very high level of service. Situated directly behind Kensington Palace, minutes from HSK shopping, Tube and restaurants. We had one incident regarding the restaurant, which was out of the usual for the Royal Garden.  Went to have an afternoon drink and the hostess told us there was no seating available - they were serving high tea but lots of empty tables. ‚ÄúSuggested‚Äù we go elsewhere, which we did. Across the street to the Goat Tavern and enjoyed a couple of festive drinks at half the cost. Otherwise - another great stay here and looking forward to returning again in 2020. ",4,2019,12,09
133,Overnight Stay at Royal Farden Hotel,The hotel looked amazing decked out for Christmas. The staff were pleasant and very helpful from the moment we stepped through the door. This was part of a Birthday gift from my family together with a trip to theatre. A memorable occasion ,5,2019,12,09
133,Always excellent,"I stay here regularly when I visit London to see my daughter as it represents good value for money, is comfortable with great amenities and friendly staff. Perfect location for Hyde Park and Royal Albert Hall with great areas for shopping and eating. Love ir!",5,2019,12,08
133,Disappointing ,"We arrived for our booked afternoon tea on time and was greeted by a member of staff who asked if we had booked,
She seemed a little lost and asked again if we had booked.
Then I surmise a senior member of staff arrived and checked our booking and apologised for the confusion.
We were shown a table and offered a selection of teas.
We selected our chosen teas and was disappointed to be served with a teapot that was chipped on the spout.
Sandwiches arrived, 4 selections each of a finger type, plus a mini sausage roll for me, (1 vegetation option)
Then the cake selection, one cake stand each comprising of 2 x Mini Scones each, 2 x slices of chocolate and sponge cake and 2 x mini Xmas cakes.
I was truly disappointed with the standard of the cakes, Scones was ok but the rest was dry.
As for the sandwiches I left the hotel hungry, 4 x finger sandwiches equal 1 x full sandwich.
I also do not agree with a service charge being added to my bill, yes the waiting staff was attentive, constantly moving my cup and teapot when i dared to move it to a position I was comfortable with.
All in all I would not rebook with this hotel, perhaps I have been spoiled by having afternoon tea at the Ritz??????
Definitely worth the extra money. Pure class.

",3,2019,12,07
133,British tradition ,"Stayed for 4 nights during the WTM exhibition .
This is not the first time I am staying in this hotel .
Few characters :
Good location , polite and professional service ,specious rooms mainly the ones overlooking the Kensington palace and the park .
These rooms are  more quiet and preferred over the rooms facing High  street Kensington.  Breakfast is rich as well as the oriental restaurant located on the 10th floor .
Hotel is very recommended .",4,2019,12,06
133,ANNUAL BIRTHDAY TREAT,"My daughter and I both have a birthday in December so we get together and come to London for a little bit of shopping, then afternoon tea and end up with a show of some sort.
We came to the  Royal Garden Hotel last year and were so thrilled with it.  We loved the look, the feel and the ambiance.  A lovely gentleman sat and played the piano throughout.  The staff were attentive and the whole experience was wonderful.
So we came again this year.  The gentleman piano player was absent, sadly.  The staff were far less attentive or communicative and the ritual of choosing ones tea had changed too.
The sandwiches were wonderful, except for the turkey one which had nothing about it.
The cakes, apart from the scones had to be shared i.e. cut in half.
The top fancy layer of cakes were not easy to cut, nor were they that thrilling tastewise.
We did enjoy it but were disappointed that it did not live up to our previous experience and therefore for next year we may be looking for an alternative venue.",4,2019,12,06
133,Incredible Afternoon Tea!,"Recently brought my mother and daughter (11) to afternoon tea here.  It was absolutely magical.  The theme is based after Queen Victoria and was presented and explained beautifully by the staff.
Generous and delicious food and tea!
A very special treat if you are looking to spoil someone.",5,2019,12,06
133,Great location for visiting the gardens and the Palace and the 2 art galleries,"Would strongly recommend the hotel with the only issue being having to queue for a long time to get seated for breakfast but I'm sure they will have sorted that out as I imagine a number of guests would have commented on this.
Staff very friendly and efficient - rooms very clean and comfortable.",4,2019,12,06
133,Stayed for 2 day business conference.,"Excellent stay. There was a short queue at check in, so some more staff instantly appeared to resolve this. I was give a warm and genuine welcome, all details of my conference and the hotel were explained in a clear and concise manner. The room was slightly bigger than expected for this price in London, it was well appointed, spotlessly clean and the d√©cor made it feel like home. Breakfast was good and checkout was the same painless and pleasant experience as check in. The location is excellent for all London has to offer. Staying here you must go for a walk in Hyde Park, which is just next door. Congratulations to all staff I encountered over my two days at your hotel, you all made the stay very easy and enjoyable.",5,2019,12,05
133,First class service throughout,"From the greeting when we arrived, to our departure, every single member of staff was first class. 
The room was very spacious, comfortable and spotlessly clean ..... AND there was an illuminated, magnified mirror in the bathroom, full marks for understanding that lady guests need decent lighting in the bathroom (takes the guesswork out of applying make-up)!
Breakfast was superb, excellent choice and again, great service from friendly, professional staff.
Only negative for us was the pillows were a bit soft but I'm sure that had we rung housekeeping they could have rectified that, we didn't so that tells you how big a deal it was and there was a bit of a mix-up when we settled our bill.  Again, this was rectified as soon as it was identified.  Would we stay again?  ABSOLUTELY!",5,2019,12,04
133,Just Spectacular,This is our third stay at the Royal Garden Hotel and we have two children 8 & 10. The hotel is very family friendly and is adjacent to the gardens which is really great. On two occasions we have been given free room upgrades.. this time to the Royal Suite which was bigger than the average apartment! Top hotel cant recommend more especially if you want to walk to the Albert Hall or one of the museums. ,5,2019,12,04
133,Weekend in London,"A wonderful hotel with very friendly staff. We booked directly and was more than rewarded for doing so.
Excellent food both for breakfast and tea. We will be back next year. A great base to explore London. ",5,2019,12,04
133,A solid 4 Star Hotel and a very pleasant stay.,"Stayed for 3 nights with partner who was on business trip. Our room wasn't ready at 3.30pm  and they provided free teas while we waited.  They insisted on bringing the luggage to our room for us but kept us waiting half an hour for it. After chasing it 3 times and threatening to fetch it myself it finally came! 

The rooms are really nice, the bed was good, the bathroom facilities were excellent and we didn't want for anything.  Staff were all professional and helpful at all times.

 The breakfasts were plentiful and the service good although not, imho,  worth ¬£25. I had lots of fruit. If there was 1 thing I really liked and rate as a 5 star it was the top quality breakfast sausages. Excellent. 

 I did not like the way that anyone could access the lifts from the reception included to go up to the Skybar. Most hotels have floor security built into passes these days and you would expect that from any good hotel what's the rating. 

The Skybar is excellent for food and drinks. 

Also 1 of the 4 lifts was out of service the whole time I was there which is not really 5 star either. Actually,  who has rated it 5 star? If you set your expectations at high 4 star you will have a really great time.  ",4,2019,12,03
133,Disappointing,There are too many fabulous hotels in London to chose from - one poor experience with staff can ruin a trip - not worth the ¬£$$ when there are so many others with great hospitality. I ended up leaving the hotel after 6 nights to another hotel... very disappointing!,2,2019,12,03
133,good,"the room too small

Service very good

Value Expensive 
Location very good  Close to buses and close to underground 
Safe area
Close to shopping centers and Restaurants and supermarket
Near Hyde Park
Sleep Quality	excellent
",3,2019,12,03
133,Fantastic family experience in London,"The staff at Royal Garden is incredibly family oriented. We got a tent at the room for our 3yr old and she loved it, on top of connected rooms with extended family and perks for kids. Location is also very good.",5,2019,12,02
133,Another good stay,"We stay here annually as we go to an event nearby.The service , cleanliness etc are always good.Only one thing we would suggest- a choice of pillows.  The ones provided were so soft that we had to put cushions underneath!!",4,2019,12,02
133,Royal Garden Hotel London,"Overall a decent hotel who had its best times in the 80tees.
Some staff is working there for a long time which creates the feeling of don‚Äôt care anymore. My room size was perfect but the furniture is very tired. My bathroom was recently renovated and this made a big difference.",3,2019,12,01
133,Not a 5 start hotel,Upon arriving at this hotel I had great expectations however the check in service was poor and I asked for an upgrade to be told the hotel was fully booked. I have just checked reservations at there are plenty of rooms available. The room is small basic and looks out over Kensington so is noisy . Not a good start to a 2 day shopping trip with my friend who I am treating for Xmas!,1,2019,11,29
133,A very pleasant 3 night stay,We were upgraded to a Suite with our Royalty Rewards programme. The room was excellent with a superb view over the Park and we thoroughly enjoyed our three night stay. Dan and his hall porter team were very helpful. Thank you to all.,4,2019,11,28
133,London‚Äôs Best!,"The Royal Garden.  London‚Äôs best kept secret.  The staff courteous, helpful and friendly.  You feel like you‚Äôre staying at the palace.  You‚Äôre treated so royally. As a visitor to London you want to be in a safe spot.  The Royal Garden is that!   ",5,2019,11,28
133,Feeling Royal at the Royal Garden,"Service here is absolutely spot on. felt like I mattered as a customer and enough couldn't be done to attend to me from the moment I stepped in the hotel to the moment I left. The staff are amazing, conscientious and engaging without being overwhelming. I didn't feel like I was being treated well because of my status but believe it is the genuine intention of all who work at the Royal Garden to treat every guest like visiting royalty. I would definitely stay here again. There is no expense spared here. from the pillows to the bathroom extra's. This is the first hotel that I have ever been able to get a full nights sleep in. I don't think I sleep so well at home :) ",5,2019,11,26
133,Wonderful Stay,"I booked a couple of rooms, both with a view of the park. Brilliant service by all staff and wonderful quality of rooms. 
We had an event at The Albert Hall and this hotel is located in a great spot for this, just a short walk from each other.",5,2019,11,26
133,Fantastic stay,"I loved the hotel and the room was huge and so magnificent!
We ordered room service and it was absolutely delicious! I will definitely be staying again! It was clean, great view and comfy space. They even made an effort to celebrate a birthday which was a special touch!",5,2019,11,25
133,Nice stay close to Kengsington Gardens,"Nice Hotel, very well located closed to Kensington Gardes
Nice staff ad good service at breakfast
Room was a bit small but clean and well organized - it would be nice to have bigger TV screens
I struggled at checkout to get information about the billing",4,2019,11,25
133,Still excellent,We have fined at the Park Terrace at the Royal Garden many times over the last 20 years and it is still excellent value. We were there for lunch and chose the 3 course set menu which at ¬£25 is such good value considering the position and quality of food. Exquisite presentation and outstanding service. Wonderful taste and could not fault anything. Always a pleasure and can not wait to return.,5,2019,11,25
133,Hopkins Law Equity Release Experience,"The hotel and staff are excellent, very comfortable beds and fabulous position. Food was also excellent. However, I am very disappointed that the wine we had pre booked and paid for was offered to everyone sat at the table (we were not hosting anyone) Clearly this is a training need, in that waiting staff need to be aware, who has pre booked beverages. I will not be pre ordering for any future events for this reason, which unfortunately will mean more work for the waiting staff.",5,2019,11,25
133,"Great Hotel, Fantastic Staff.","Just spent two nights here and what a fantastic stay. We had room 1009 which had a fabulous view of Kensington Palace and the grounds (see photo). But what made it such a great stay were the staff, such a friendly helpful team. From the doorman, to reception through to the staff at breakfast they team couldn‚Äôt do enough for you. Thank you so much we had a fantastic time.",5,2019,11,24
133,Great Hotel,"This is the best Hotel we have stayed in in London. Might be more expensive but the quality makes the cost worthwhile.
The Restaurants are great and the service is exceptional.
Very near to the Royal Albert Hall, and High Street Kensington tube station so it is very convenient for whatever you wish to do.",5,2019,11,24
133,Comfortable business hotel,"since more than 12 years I stay during all my journeys in the royal garden hotel. 
The logistic of the hotel is comfortable for business trips. The hotel owned a long experience on how to threat business persons compellingly. You don't feel that you have behind after al to necessary that you need. The staff help you in many ways, some times they anticipate what you need. From the hotel, you can reach al points in London quickly, by taxi or public transport. ",5,2019,11,24
133,Royal Gardens Hotel,"Truly lovely staff (at every level) who enhance every stay.  
Food is very good in the Park Terrace and Berties.
They recommend booking direct to take advantage of their loyalty programme; we were hoping from a room upgrade on our second stay, and although they tried very hard the hotel was full. The alternative was complimentary breakfast - thank you RGH it was a feast! ",5,2019,11,23
133,Royal Garden Stay,The staff was polite and friendly from check-in to check-out.  Would definitely come back to the Royal Garden Hotel.  Looking forward to the next trip back to London.  The hotel is located near multiple stores that are easily accessible.,5,2019,11,22
133,Birthday Treat,"Had a wonderful stay, the hotel and staff were exceptional the area was perfect. From the moment you walk into this hotel you are treated as special. We were given a room overlooking the gardens with far reaching views the food in the main restaurant was of a high class having had both dinner & breakfast.We would certainly stay here again.Regards Terry & Chris 

",5,2019,11,21
133,Best kept secret in London,"Very nice 5 star hotel,  fantastic location, walking distance to shops, Whole Foods supermarket and  trendy restaurants .  Staff was warm and helpful , impeccable rooms, we had a great winter experience.  I will recommend it to friends and will stay there on my next trip to London.",5,2019,11,20
133,Weekend with Wifey,"We saw this hotel when browsing online for a weekend in London, having stayed at the hotel previously we jumped at the chance to stay again and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, the location is fantastic with rooms overlooking Kensington Palace and Gardens, what more could you ask for",5,2019,11,20
133,A hotel fit for a Princess,"A little gem in the heart of Kensington, situated next to Kensington Palace and Kensington Gardens. This hotel brings tranquility and scenic views with the excitement and historic adventures that await in the heart of London as well.
This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve stayed here, however it is one of the most memorable as we stayed for nearly 2 weeks. 
Arriving at the hotel you are met by the smartly dressed concierge staff who are warm and welcoming, we took a particular shine to Karol who would gladly help with anything and always had a cheery smile on his face. 
The check in process was pretty simple enough and the front desk staff polite and friendly. Entering the room we were happily surprised by the space and the view of the park, we had a nice garden view room which had a lovely little seating area which was great to work from. Half way through our stay e had to change rooms which was our own fault as we had to extend the trip by an extra week and we moved to another lovely room, the executive room which had even more space and a view of the road looking into the multi million pound houses and embassies as well as the park which again was pleasant enough and quiet. I will say one thing about the rooms is that they seem to have different mattresses so if you are particular I advise to mention this on booking.
From the main entrance of the hotel you are directly on High Street Kensington  from which has a number of restaurants and shops to browse through and easy access to other parts of London.
As for the food and beverage, the room service food is good however I would say could do with a few more things on the menu and the Chinese restaurant on floor 10 is divine with views over London and the palace, however expect to dig deep into your pockets for this.
Overall a pleasant hotel, with a great location at a price that can be on the steeper side of the spectrum for the area.
The garden room is a must if you want to see William or Kate or your a big fan of the royals as this hotel has the private road next to the palace.
",5,2019,11,19
133,Royal experience,"My work as an event planner has taken me to hotels a lot in recent years and I have never had such great service from every departments. From the warm and almost royal greetings of the valets, concierges and reception, the patience and kindness  of the sales and banquet staff  throughout the whole process. I also want to say that I have never seen such a caring and friendly staff, always a step before our requests. We really felt a sincere and committed concern from all the people who were with us during this event.
The hotel is in a great location, the food was impeccable and a special mention for the fabulous Min Jiang experience! ",5,2019,11,19
133,Anniversary Visit to London,"From the minute we made our booking, the hotel went out of their way to make our visit special. Our room had a lovely view of the park & was very comfortable & kept spotlessly clean. We enjoyed our breakfasts each morning which were served with calm, quiet & friendly efficiency. Every single member of staff in the hotel goes out of their way to acknowledge their guests & accommodate their needs/wishes. Special thanks to Francisco who went out of his way to ensure we had a memorable stay. We‚Äôre definitely hoping to be back next year.",5,2019,11,19

133,Excellent hotel.  Surprising warmth and friendliness,Had a wonderful stay here. Was upgraded to a park suite on 4th floor with a gorgeous exquisite view overlooking Kensington Palace and gardens.  I would definitely return.

133,Awards Stay,Stayed overnight following some Industry Awards. The check in staff really friendly and wished us luck for the awards.Bedroom was basic - no iron !! Ideal venue for a large function.

133,The warmest of welcomes,Great location. Exceptional staff who always greet you with a smile. Have not stayed in this part of London before but will definitely return. Car park on site is good and the hotel is outside the congestion zone. ,5,2019,11,17
133,Best child friendly hotel we have ever been to!,"The hotel is brilliantly positioned. I have never been to a hotel that is more child friendly. The service from all the staff was also exceptional . I have to say the weekend breakfast buffet was simply out of this world.
We will certainly makes this our London hotel if choice . ",5,2019,11,16
133,Great location,"We love this hotel; room was small but adequate and faced Kensington Palace/ Gardens.

133,Business stay in London,"This place is fabulous. Every detail is attended to and the staff are friendly and competent. I have stayed here twice, both times for 4 days, and I would recommend it to anyone. On my last stay my room had a water leak while I was out. They were apologetic, gave me a new larger room and suggested this was a grave inconvenience. It was not at all, took 5 minutes to gather my belongings and move. In the new room was a plate full of fruit and a bottle of wine  they could not have been nicer. ",5,2019,11,16
133,cold room,we had to ask twice if our room was ready and had to ask twice to get heating on we sat in an ice box of a room in our coats for 2 hours the room got warm after breakfast the next day as we were leaving,2,2019,11,14
133,Top location.,Nice hotel in a super neighbourhood. Adjacent to Kensington Park for a nice walk or jog. Kensington High Street offers many different options from shopping to dining. Only 10/15min. ride into Piccadilly Circus.,5,2019,11,14
133,Wonderful weekend celebration stay,"Maybe because it was a special occasion for us but we were given a lovely room on floor 10 with great views over Kensington Palace and the gardens. The staff were extremely helpful, polite, friendly and very professional. Thank you we had a lovely stay at your lovely hotel.",5,2019,11,13
133,Short Stop,"Once again Royal Garden Hotel provided excellent accommodation and dining. Friendly and informative staff throughout. Always prepared to ensure your stay is as comfortable and stress free as possible. Their Business Centre operates 24/7 and open WiFi for guests proves a valuable resource when travelling for business. Very comfortable bed and room with everything you need for a short stopover. Breakfast is well presented and cooked to order made all the more enjoyable with clear views over Kensington Park. A visit to Bertie's Bar is recommended. I look forward to future visits to enjoy working my way through the whisky list and try the Min Jiang Chinese Restaurant which looked an inviting place to eat with views over towards central London.

133,"Friendly five stars, good value and well located","Admittedly I had booked during a special offer period, but this was excellent value for a five-star hotel and the staff were lovely. Conveniently situated in Kensington High Street and right on the Palace Gardens, this offers comfort and excellent facilities. If you book directly with the hotel, a tranche of benefits such as room upgrades comes into play and added a lot of value. We would stay there again.",5,2019,11,12
133,"In need of an overhaul, feels tired",As lovely venue with amazing staff. Sadly the building and rooms feel very tired. It appears it's long overdue for rennovation. Suggest a review of the price point on the food and drink as it's currently priced at near Michelin costs with the quality of a diner.,3,2019,11,12
133,Lovely hotel,Lovely weekend spent at this hotel. Great location as right next door to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. Rooms were to a high standard and the service was excellent from the moment we arrived until our departure. Requests also accommodated. Will definitely return. ,5,2019,11,12

Only about 15 mins in a taxi from LHR. Will hopefully get to visit this hotel again for business or pleasure",5,2019,11,12
133,Friday Night Stay,Overall a fantastic hotel with very good staff in all areas of the Hotel. Would highly recommend this Hotel as it is close to the underground station so easy to get to other parts of London. Nice location alongside Kensington Palace and the High Street nearby had a good selection of shops and restaurants.,5,2019,11,11
133,Well appointed property limited by poor room size,They make the best of what they have but the room size in this property leaves a lot to be desired.  Decent facilities and service but left feeling short changed by the room itself.  Many two and three star properties have larger rooms if less well equipped.,3,2019,11,11
133,Great location,Great location just beside the highstreet and Kensington Gardens park which is lovely for a quiet walk away from the busy city. Fantastic breakfast too. A room at the back of the hotel is a quiet option. ,4,2019,11,11
133,"Great location, lovely breakfast. Some minor issues.","Great location. Lovely staff. Excellent breakfast. We had a problem with our room size and the fact that it had been set up for one person which was rather disappointing as my husband and I were staying. Having said that the manager did try to resolve our concerns and on the whole, a five star experience. ",4,2019,11,11
133,Great stay for London,We come from Windsor- UNITED kingdom AND IF YOU WANT AN EXCELLENT HOTEL TO STAY IN THIS IS THE ONE. From the welcome we got all the way through to all the staff in the hotel during our stay made us feel special,5,2019,11,11
133,London break,We love staying at Royal Garden hotel  everything is spot on we find this hotel is easy access to where we need to be this trip was an awards  for a company we own so for once not leisure as it usually is,5,2019,11,10
133,Great service and breakfast,"Staff is very friendly, hotel is very nice and breakfast is amazing. Rooms are quite small and not very modern. Blanket is thin and temperature was cold even with the heat on. However the service is great and breakfast with a lot of choices (avocado toasts, gluten-free bar, granola yogurt etc)",4,2019,11,08
133,Pricey but very classy,"Stayed for one night on a business trip. Thank goodness the company was paying! The rooms are fine - more comfortable than stylish, which is the way you want it. The front desk service was top-notch - I'd particularly like to thank Felicity and Noemie for helping me out with a self-inflicted problem with my booking.

The conference dinner was surprisingly good, too.",5,2019,11,07
133,Stay here,"Unbeatable location. What makes it really exceptional is the staff - very friendly, very professional. It‚Äôs already good value for London, the rooms are kind of generic hotel style but the people who work there are so welcoming it feels more like a luxury experience. Book direct, they bump you up.",5,2019,11,07
133,A beautiful hotel,"What a fantastic hotel! The hotel itself is well decorated, and the rooms (and bathroom) are spacious and well presented. A lovely warm welcome on check in with every member of staff that I came in to contact with going above and beyond! A very rare find in hotels in London! Will definitely be coming back!",5,2019,11,06
133,Our home away from home in London,"Over the past few years we have stayed at The Royal Garden on many occasions and we have never been unsatisfied.
As the title would suggest it has become very much our 'home away from home'. The location is superb, amenities excellent and our room/suite has always been impeccably well presented, However, most important to us when we visit somewhere is customer service and The Royal garden certainly doesn't disappoint.
I can honestly say the welcome is the most genuine we have received in any hotel. Always greeted with warmth and kindness.
We always book directly with the hotel and have benefited from a complimentary upgrade on the last couple of visits so a huge thank you to the reservations team.
See you again soon in about a week/
",5,2019,11,04
133,Beautiful hotel,Lovely hotel staff make you feel very welcome and well looked after. The breakfast room service is excellent and a must try experience and there is certainly more food than you could eat.  Enjoyed my stay,5,2019,11,01
133,Amazing,"Everything was perfect ,, the service and staff. Price is good compared to the service and amazing location. All facilities all close by. On the opposite side, there is supermarket, salon, pharmacy and many other shops. The street has all shops for shopping. ",5,2019,11,01
133,Another great stay at the RGH,"Great hotel, very friendly staff, nice food. As always, we will be back soon! London without the Royal Garden Hotel would not be the same. I'm particulary happy with the friendliness of the staff, the nice and functional rooms and the wonderful breakfast buffet.",5,2019,11,01
133,Amazing Stay,"I had booked a room for my Husbands Birthday as we were going to see Chris De Burgh at the Royal Albert Hall. Had a wonderful surprise when Reception told us we had our room upgraded to a Suite.  Our Room was amazing, over looking the Park, complete with complementary Champagne and Chocolates. They had even organised VIP Tickets at the Theatre for us.
The Reception staff are very welcoming.
We had lunch in the Park Terrace Restaurant and the food and services was excellent.
After the show we had cocktails in Bertie's Bar and again the staff were friendly and efficient.
We had a wonderful stay and would like to thank Aaron and all the staff for making our stay so memorable",5,2019,10,30
133,Joeanne,"AWFUL from start to finish. This hotel is completely disorganized and is at best a 3 star. It‚Äôs very dated and dull. The staff were badly turned out and seemed to go to any length to make things difficult. Having made a pre stay request of extra pillows and a quiet room, there are no pillows and we beside a room
That is being worked on as there has been banging all day.  There is no response from customer service on any request and we even asked if we could change hotels. All ignored.  It has been a horrible horrible experience.",1,2019,10,29
133,"Great Location, Top Flight Hotel","This hotel is beautifully located right on the edge of Kensington Gardens. The entrance is quite awkward...not much room for pedestrians, shares an entrance for a car park, limited room for taxis, etc., but once you get inside it is quite lovely. We were upgraded because we had booked directly with the hotel as opposed to booking through Orbitz, and our room was very nice. We were offered a free bottle of wine, and even though we declined that, we still got a bottle of water and fruit. All of the staff that we encountered were friendly and helpful.

The breakfast room was extremely nice. The buffet was very good. The view was very nice. 

All in all, a great hotel experience. What's not to like? I'd go back in a heartbeat.",5,2019,10,28
133,"5 STARS! Excellent service, highly recommend!","This hotel was excellent.  The services is top notch.  The rooms are very comfortable and modern.  The breakfast was delicious and the staff went above and beyond to make sure you were satisfied.  The hotel is next to Kensington gardens and close to Hyde Park.  It is also very centrally located to restaurants, shops and the train.",5,2019,10,26
133,"Beyong expectation,","the hotel location, spacious room, great breakfast, water in room everyday, juice at reception, Very helpful staff, free extra bed when requested, shopping within walking distance, would definitely stay again",5,2019,10,25
133,Criminals operate in the car park below - be very careful!,Car broken into 1 hour after arriving and another guest‚Äôs vehicle too. I believe 4 other vehicles were broken into a few weeks before mine. Don‚Äôt leave your car in the car park below. Hotel itself is good and the location is amazing. ,3,2019,10,24
133,Love the gym,"This is a nice five star hotel in the centre of Kensington. Staff are friendly and attentive, the food is good and the rooms are spacious and clean with good views. The hidden gem that you have to hunt for on their website is the gym. This is a private membership gym under the hotel but guests can use it for free. It‚Äôs really well equipped, particularly for those interested in strength training and boxing. 
The hotel is located right next to the park and on a bustling high street with great pubs and shops
The conference facilities are excellent and well serviced ",5,2019,10,24
133,Wonderful birthday weekend,"Myself and my partner visited this lovely hotel as part of a belated birthday celebration for me. Neither of us had stayed here before, but it came highly recommended so we thought we'd try it and we are very glad we did.

Everything from the first interaction with the hotel (speaking with Dina in Reservations), to the moment we were leaving and two doormen, both inside and outside, offered to help us with our bags, was exceptional. We were upgraded to a Park Suite, offered complimentary cocktail vouchers and had a bottle of wine and 'happy birthday' chocolates waiting for us in the suite. These 'treats' were absolutely amazing and made us feel truly spoilt right away. The suite itself was beautiful and extremely spacious with loads of facilities and amenities. The view over Kensington Gardens/Palace was wonderful. Breakfast was great with a wide selection available and we enjoyed our cocktails in the Park Terrace restaurant.

Every member of staff we came across during the weekend was friendly and polite. A big thank you to the three ladies who saw to us at reception when we initially checked in, and when we returned later after lunch, who were all most welcoming, friendly and helpful - Maria, Felicity(?) and another lady whose name we unfortunately cant recall, but we think it began with A. Also considering the size of the hotel, the lifts are fast and smooth, which made a nice change! 

We thoroughly enjoyed our weekend stay at Royal Garden Hotel and I have no doubt that we will be returning again. Thank you for a lovely and memorable birthday!",5,2019,10,23
133,Excellent Stau,Everyone very helpful particularly as the underground at High Street Kensington was out of operation and we had to re-plan all our journeys.  Will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone.  The location is excellent and buses run from right outside the hotel,5,2019,10,22
133,Expected more,"This hotel looks completely different to the photographs online, the view was poor and the rooms were very old fashioned it had a ipod speaker but for the iphone 4 only?! The towels smelt like kitchen grease and 
The room was very small and for a queen room I thought the bed would be bigger. 
I was quite disappointed to be honest as this wasn‚Äôt  a cheap hotel and wanted a luxurious hotel for my birthday, which it wasnt. ",2,2019,10,22
133,Excellent Choice,"A first class hotel in a superb location adjacent to Kensington Palace and Gardens. Breakfast was excellent, with the Sunday front of house chef providing friendly and professional service to the very highest quality.

Access to the nearby tube and Kensington High Street was good, with the rooms being to a good standard.

The staff were exceptional throughout and complemented what was overall a really enjoyable stay.",5,2019,10,21
133,Excellent location,"Excellent location indeed, direct access to Kensington Garden and in the mid of High street shops, cafes and restaurants. I would definitely recommend it. One thing was the restaurant downstairs, they need to do something about ventilation ",5,2019,10,21
133,Over night stay for an awards night ,We stayed here for one night and had a fantastic room which was spacious and comfortable. Milton was extremely helpful as we turned up with lots of luggage. Room service was excellent and the food turned up piping hot and well presented. Great position to get to the tube etc. Highly recommend ,5,2019,10,21
133,5 Star throughout,"Staff, rooms, food, amenities,,,,,a fantastic hotel in a wonderful location in London beside the park. I have stayed at many 5 star hotels in London but this has to be the best all-rounder. Fantastic hotel ",5,2019,10,20
133,Great Hotel,"We've been coming here for years and still enjoy staying!  The rooms are good, clean, and the restaurant is very good. There is also an asin restaurant on the 10th floor with great food. Just behind the hotel is the Kensington Palace with a museum, etc.",5,2019,10,19
133,Best Hotel in London,"Whenever we are in London, we always try to stay in the Royal Garden Hotel. The staff are very friendly and always accommodating and can‚Äôt do enough for us. The atmosphere of the hotel is friendly from the minute you arrive. The location is great. We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,10,19
133,Excellent room with a view over Hyde Park,"First time at the London Garden, when we arrived we were upgraded to a garden view room for no apparent reason - nice touch. 7th floor with a great view of Hyde Park. All staff were very welcoming which is what you would expect for this type of hotel. Service was first class. the room was spacious with a sofa and a desk and the bathroom was well appointed. The hotel is getting a little dated with a lot of brown wood everywhere, very 1980's but it did not spoil our stay",4,2019,10,18
133,Trip to London,We have stayed here a number of times and always excellent. Great staff and excellent food and the perfect location for the Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park. There is a car pack under the hotel but very tight spiral drop to get there,5,2019,10,17
133,"Noisy room, friendly staff",The room was well appointed. The bathroom was very clean. Staff was friendly. The room was very noisy and I could hear everything that was going on in the hall and couldn‚Äôt fall asleep until after midnight. ,2,2019,10,16
133,Fab staff ,"Stayed here for a couple of days attending a conference being held in the hotel. Rooms are lovely and location is great. Breakfast very good but expensive. Shout out to the staff who were all super friendly and helpful, some of the nicest staff I‚Äôve come across in a UK hotel. ",5,2019,10,16
133,A number of issues but good Customer service helped compensate.,"A good hotel but a large difference from some old and tired rooms to brighter more up up to date rooms. The first King room offered on level two for a seven night stay was very bland (no pictures on the wall nothing) and it looked out at the wall of a building. A number of other smaller issues but our room was upgraded two levels and the customer service in relation to other issues was excellent. 
Would probably use again but would be sure of getting the room I would expect before travelling across the world.",4,2019,10,16
133,Jonathan B,"Absolutely fabulous not pretentious hotel and the service was excellent .Central location  for the West End museums, shopping and restaurants.To step out into Kensington Gardens on the door step is a gem in the Capital.",5,2019,10,15
133,Amazing Escape,"Would highly recommend a visit, Lovely well thought out rooms, friendly staff great food. You could forget u were in London . View from our room was lovely. Exactly like the photos on the Web which is a rare. Berties Bar was really great and relaxing. ",5,2019,10,15
133,Great hotel in a convenient location,"This hotel is one of the best I have stayed in when over seas. Friendly staff, big rooms and spacious bathrooms which can be unusual in the UK. It is located near many shops and restaurants. Highly recommend. ",5,2019,10,15
133,"Very good, but only a very limited experience","I was a participant at an all-day business meeting.  I didn't stay here or have lunch here.

That said the conference facilities are excellent and the refreshments similar.  Certainly a hotel to consider.",5,2019,10,15
133,Great hotel and amazing location,"From the welcome arrival to departure, the staff never stop to impress. With their warm smiles and friendly conversations, you feel nothing but warm and sincere hospitality from the hotel. Love the size of the bedrooms along with amazing view of the park. What an amazing location! Can't wait to return soon...",5,2019,10,15
133,Good stay.,"Will use again definitely, great hotel and perfect conference venue. Bedroom very good and breakfast of good value. Liked the free newspaper provided. Like the area of London and will go back to that area.",4,2019,10,14
133,Good hotel,"Business trip, hotel stuff was nice, knowledgeable and helpful. Room was big and cleen. House keeping didn't always remembered to fill up coffee station. Food at conference was excellent.Overall very good experience",4,2019,10,14
133,ideal stay for the royal albert hall,"I came here with a friend to see Chris de Burg at the royal albert hall,  it was exactly 10 minutes walk,  from booking in we were showed our room,  wow it was beautiful,  we was on the 8th floor and we had an amazing room with great views,  en suite,  kettle with refreshments together with a small mini bar and fridge,  small settee.  
We went to the concert and came back and ordered a midnight feast because we hadn't eaten my word when it came it was fit for a king,  not sure what I expected maybe a tray with the sandwiches and desert on don't know but we got a table with 4 dishes with covers,  it came within 45 minutes and wow it was super!  we watched a little television before retiring and had a lie in,  we pressed the red button so we wouldn't get disturbed so we could have a lie in,  we obviously didn't want a breakfast because of what we ate the night before so we took it easy, had a bath a brew and left the room at 12 brilliant,  they told us where the underground was and our stay was over,  we will definatly be staying there again for the albert hall",5,2019,10,13
133,C,Very nice and clean hotel. Thank you for the room upgrade. The Chinese restaurant was superb abd so was the location next to Hyde Park. Nice pubs nearby and very good location for both business and tourism,5,2019,10,13
133,Nice but noisy for road rooms,"The staff is very friendly, but the rooms are noisy on the road side. Also, the choice is either no air or/heating or an infamous racket from the ventilation. The hotel is lacking some small corners to have private business discussions. It is also very expensive",3,2019,10,13
133,Good 5-Star Hotel at Supreme Location,"The location is superb. It is next to Kensington Palace, Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. A stroll in morning or evening in the park and gardens simply makes your stay more relaxed. The shopping in Kensington high street is amazing. 
The rooms are spacious, the service is good. One of the best hotels in London Kensington.",4,2019,10,12
133,London Visit and base for trip to Bristol,"Ideal location and very comfortable top London hotel. We used it as a base for a 2 day visit to meet friends, go to shows and to dine, plus some shopping. We are regular clients and use the hotel at least 3 times a year, as we live in Malta and love to visit London",5,2019,10,12
133,Superb,"A fantastic stay - very kindly booked in by Francine in Reservations who provided us with an exceptional service 
We were visiting to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday which concluded with a concert at the Royal Albert Hall - which is a 10 minute walk away along the Park
The hotel has so much history and all of the staff were delightful. The room was beautiful and perfectly appointed 
On Sunday we had breakfast in our room which was simply fabulous 
Thank you Royal Garden Hotel for a superb stay",5,2019,10,11
133,Very bad room size and bed not. comfortable,"My family came ahead of me as we are traveling from different origin and they refuse to give the room for them as it's under my name. My family offer to pay one night in advance so they get the room and refused., the room very small in size and bed is not comfortable. 
",3,2019,10,11
133,DoreenM,"I thoroughly enjoyed my seven-night stay at the Royal Garden Hotel.  The location is ideal--just two blocks from an underground station, a bus stop in front of the hotel door, and Kensington Gardens right outside the front door and Kensington Palace just a two-minute walk.  I was impressed with the hotel's wonderful details--heated towel rack, fluffy robe, slippers to use, a desk that turns into a mirrored vanity and roomy comfort.  ",5,2019,10,08
133,A great 5 star hotel,The staff were very friendly and attentive particularly for our young girls. The breakfast was the best buffet breakfast we have had in London. We would recommend the hotel. The only downfall is the very expensive NCP carpark.,5,2019,10,08
133,Three star masquerading as a five star,"Three star masquerading as a five star. 

The Royal Garden is OK, not a 5 Star. Seems to be in the class of a Hilton, nothing close to a Four Seasons or Ritz.

The room was tiny even buy London standards. While that can be forgiven the shoddy bordering on non-functional Internet and the room that smelled like someone had been smoking in it are unacceptable. Bed was old and you could feel the springs.

In a pinch for a business trip it will do, travel for vacation and enjoyment with a spouse I would look elsewhere. ",2,2019,10,06
133,"Lovely place, great staff","I was there to meet up with family and go to na coins eat at the Albert Hall. The family were their usual wonderful selves; the concert was wonderful. The hotel was well situated, extremely comfortable and met all our needs - from a great Chinese ;lunch to late night drinks in the barf. All of the staff were reallyh welcoming, helpful and friendly.",5,2019,10,03
133,Great one night stay,"I arrived the hotel in the morning after a long flight and was grateful for the early check-in.  The Front Office did give me an option to choose between a room on a higher floor with a better view if I waited til the current occupants left, or a no-view room on a lower floor, but as I was tired and only there for a night, I went with the no-view room.

The staff was very pleasant throughout my short stay, and even though the room was small, it was laid out well. The armchair and coffee table did get in the way a bit though. The mattress was great, but the pillows were only the very soft side. The huge safe fits a 15"" laptop easily. I liked the small but modern bathroom, and the water pressure was excellent.

If you want to be in the Kensington High Street area the hotel location is excellent, with a short walk to the tube, supermarket, restaurants and Kensington Gardens.",5,2019,10,03
133,Not 5 star,Nothing 5 star about it at all in my opinion. Room was small. Watered down toiletries. No charger available. Noisy at night . Wasn't made to feel welcome.  The ' taking deposit of ¬£50 ' policy makes you feel untrustworthy. Not welcoming at all .Only bonus was Concierge seemed friendly. But I would not recommend.,1,2019,10,01
133,Lovely staff! ,"Stayed one night in this gorgeous hotel, all staff smiled and showed an interest in our plans for the weekend.
Loved the girl on the desk to the restaurant, she was so sweet! 

Room was lovely and big. The only slight issue was the pillows were so flat. In hindsight I think I should have asked for extra pillows. 

Breakfast was really lovely with a huge choice served by attentive polite waiting staff.

We arrived in the morning and was able to leave our suitcase at hotel while we visited the city, they also offered to keep our luggage after checking out so we could continue with our trips planned.
We picked it up later that evening, I thought this was extremely helpful! 

It was a fabulous treat staying at this beautiful hotel, I‚Äôm keeping an eye out for the next deal available! ",5,2019,10,01
133,Amazing stay,"Booked online direct on the hotel website for a one night stay and arrived really late at about 2am in the morning. The staff could not have been more helpful despite the late hour and, because i booked online direct they gave me a room upgrade and other complementary benefits. Even room service at 2.30 am took just 10 minutes - amazing. 

Happy customer who will definitely stay here again when i need a room in London and will book directly with the hotel. Lets see if they can can repeat the same performance next time :)",5,2019,09,30
133,Lovely hotel in the middle of bustling Kensington,"We were going to an event at the Hilton Park Lane and the hotel contacted us to offer their services.  They offered an excellent room rate, paid for our taxi fares to the event.  All of the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. It was a bonus that the hotel was in Kensington High Street and Kensington Palace was a two minute walk away :-)",5,2019,09,30
133,perfect location - even better rooms,"This is a world class Hotel in a class of its own.

Location is perfect reign next door to Kensington Gardens with the local shops offering you all you need in terms of local pubs, restaurants and shops. There is a very good community feel to right outside which other parts of London does not offer. 
Staff very friendly and attentive. 

Thank you. ",5,2019,09,29
133,Baby next door,"Nice 10th floor room with adjoining doors to the next room. 
There was a baby in the next room who was awake and noisy from 4am onwards. Not a lot of sleep was had which was not good considering meetings the next day. ",3,2019,09,29
133,Brilliant Stay and Great Location,"What a nice property, room was in tip top shape, staff very responsive to needs, excellent breakfast. As stated great staff all around.   The location is great with lots of local convenience , close to Underground and shopping close by. Wonderful park for a walkabout.",5,2019,09,28
133,"Great hotel, Terrible WiFi","Not excessively friendly, but helpful. Location was great.  Close to all the shops, cafes, Whole Foods, tube and buses.  The restaurants are really good, the room service was pretty good.  WiFi was absolute trash.",4,2019,09,28
133,Everything you‚Äôd expect,"I‚Äôve stayed here several times and have always had a good experience.  The rooms are clean and comfortable, the staff is very helpful and the location is amazing.  An excellent choice for a nice hotel with Kensington palace just around the corner. ",5,2019,09,28
133,Excellent Service,We were upgraded to a Garden Room which was lovely overlooking the park and I would pay the extra next time. The staff could not have been friendly and accommodating and I can not speak highly enough about how efficient they were. ,5,2019,09,27
133,Lovely hotel but breakfast was a let down!,"Have stayed and eaten at the Royal Garden on a few occasions and have always had a great experience however on this occasion when it came to breakfast found it to be lacking!  Restaurant was at capacity when I came down at 10am so had to wait around 30 minutes, which was fine however the issue was that the staff started clearing all of the food away as soon as it got to 11am and there were still guests eating so although I managed to get everything I wanted just before they took it away there were others who came up afterwards looking for pastries to be told breakfast was over!  If this is the policy and you are seated late due to no fault of your own they should make you aware when seated that you should get what you want straight away as they clear it on the dot of 11am.",4,2019,09,24
133,6 star Hotel!,"Although we don‚Äôt stay in London very often, we stay at the Royal Garden whenever we are in town.
This was our 46th wedding anniversary and had booked a room overlooking Hyde Park. A lovely surprise when we found we‚Äôd been upgraded to a Suite overlooking the park with beautiful views. Even better, when we returned from a walk around the park we found a bottle of bubbly in our room as well!
Lovely room, brilliant staff and a nice breakfast the next morning. Not a cheap hotel but well worth the money and fully justifies the 5 star rating it holds.
Would we stay here again? Yes, without a doubt!",5,2019,09,24
133,"Terrific location, wonderful service","Located next to the expansive and wonderful Kensington Gardens and down the road from Harrods shopping street the Royal Garden is a quality hotel with clean and quiet rooms, and with a genuinely friendly team throughout.

Fantastic breakfast!!!",5,2019,09,24
133,My recent stay,"Hello,

I have several comments -

Pushing two single beds together does not constitute a King sized bed - especially as one of them was higher than the other.

I was told by guests services, that because I had booked direct they would place some fruit in my room upon arrival. On the second day, I called to ask where it was and there was an apology and two hours later it arrived - 3 bananas and an inedible peach.

Also, I had previously asked Guest services that since I'm a regular customer (this was my 3rd visit this year) whether I could get an early morning check-in. I was told that they would try. Then I never heard back. On arrival, I was told I'd be billed for two nights. I thought as a good-will gesture, you would just charge me for a half a day for the early check-in. Very disappointing. 

Please advise and give me your comments. My email address is lionelconway20@gmail.com

Best,
Lionel",3,2019,09,23
133,"a great place to be, location great","This hotel is in a perfect location for walking, eating and strolling in the parks.  The staff are helpful and friendly and the rooms are clean and roomy  Ask for an upgrade and you may get a view of London at night.",5,2019,09,23
133,Disappointing and dated hotel,"It's location next to Kensington Palace seems to be a selling point but really this hotel is not worth the money and there are better areas to stay. Our Queen room was extremely small and bland, poor soundproofing from a faulty window meant we could hear street noise and shouting well into the early hours of morning which woke us up. Housekeeping turn down didn't happen 2nd night so no water for us, insinuated we'd left the do not disturb light on (hadn't).
The decor is very dated, bland and scruffy especially in the dining room. Service in dining room was excellent and breakfast good. I would not class this as a 5 star hotel but it will survive because there are always enough people visiting London to fill the rooms, however, I will look elsewhere next time.

TOP TIPS
Travelling to/ from Gatwick Airport?  Outside of rush hour a cheap and easy option with great views is by bus and train. Buses from the front of the hotel go to Victoria Station (52) or better still to Clapham Junction railway station (49) then you can get a train to Gatwick. Tap in with debit contactless card on buses and at train stations.
You can walk through Kensington Palace Garden then into central London, it's a nice walk, easy and flat and took us about 15 minutes to walk to corner of Hyde Park/ Constitution Hill about another 15-20 to get to Piccadilly.
The Underground is pretty horrendous, noisy, very hot quite difficult to work out and usually lots of changes needed.",3,2019,09,23
133,Unique location with small rooms,"The location of the Royal Garden Hotel at the entry of Hyde Park next to Kensington Palace is unique. An excelent location to be and very well connected to the rest of the city via underground. Unless you have a garden view room, however, the rooms are very tiny. I had a king bed that looked more like a queen sized bed and walking around it was not in the realm of possibilities. This meant that I also had only a small desk. Bathroom was well equiped, but its always unfortunate if you have to shower in a bath tub in a 5-star hotel.",4,2019,09,23
133,Lovely hotel,Have stayed before during trips to London.  Great location on Kensington high street near the palace gates. Beautiful rooms that are spotless. Breakfast is delicious and service always amazing. Will be back in the near future (hopefully).,5,2019,09,22
133,Anniversary stay,"We have just returned from 1 night stay at this lovely hotel. The check in staff were very friendly and attentive and asked about our journey and plans for the day. Our room had a garden view overlooking Kensington palace which was gorgeous. We had previously advised the hotel we were staying for our wedding anniversary and we had a plate of chocolates waiting for us in the room which was a lovely touch. We absolutely loved the location of this hotel, Kensington gardens are beautiful and we really enjoyed strolling through them to get to Queensway tube (we found this was more direct than Kensington tube) we also loved walking through place green gardens that runs alongside the hotel and looking at all the stunning properties and cars! There are plenty of shops and restaurants on the high street if you need any food/drink/clothes or just to browse. Our package included a free welcome cocktail so we heading up to berties bar when it opened at 5pm for our free cocktail, this was brought out with olives and cashews. We then took the tube to the west end for a show and dinner. Breakfast was gorgeous! All the usual offerings but the quality of the food set this aside from the usual buffet, eggs were made to order, omelette station and pancakes were also freshly made. There was a great fruit selection and gluten free items on a separate area and also an al a carte menu to order from should you wish to. Check out was friendly and hassle free, all staff were extremely friendly and couldn‚Äôt do enough for you. We would certainly return! Thank you for a lovely stay :0)",5,2019,09,22
133,Best Hotel in London,I have stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel several times now and it‚Äôs my home away from home. 5 star hotel but with home comforts. The service is first class and I love the rooms. Going back in December and taking my family.,5,2019,09,20
133,Excellent location,"This was my third stay at the hotel and I‚Äôm already looking forward to next year. Although my room was smallish (even for one guest), the rest of the hotel and its amenities were impeccable. Of course, its main selling point is its location. ",4,2019,09,20
133,very disappointing,"Room was advertised as being ready for 2pm checkin, arrived at 3pm and room not ready, kept waiting for ages, handed a voucher for a free tea or coffee and a promise to come and collect us when room was ready. No one came to find us, returned to reception at 4.30pm, kept waiting for ages whilst concierge disappeared to back office. Eventually got to room to find it dirty with used glass mat on the floor. TV old and took ages to download welcome page whenever it was turned on",1,2019,09,18
133,our weekend,"Brilliant location.  One of the best hotels we have stayed in.  Very pleasant room, very well appointed. Breakfast was plentiful and good, catering for all tastes,  and the Min Jiang restaurant outstanding.",5,2019,09,17
133,Not what we expected froma 5 Star Hotel!,"-	Specifically asked for a nice room with a view and pointed out that it was our wedding anniversary and special trip to London
-	Upon arrival your staff seemed rather overwhelmed by more than 2 guests checking in
-	The whole process had the look and feel of hectic and stressed staff
-	We were told the room is not ready yet 
-	To come back at 14.00 hrs
-	But they would call us if the room became available sooner (we are waiting on that call now!)
-	We checked back at 14.30 hrs ‚Äì got put off again
-	Checked back at 15.15 hrs and where told ‚Äûyes ‚Äì but of course your room is ready‚Äú (which at that time sounded really dumb)
-	The room was tiny, the view nonexistent
-	No info on wifi ‚Äì upon calling down we were told nonsense information in poor english and had to call three times to finally get the proper info
-	Were in need of an iron ‚Äì ran in to a lady from housekeeping and asked her for it ‚Äì and were told to call housekeeping they would assist us
-	In a 5 star hotel I expect every one I run in to to be a proper point of contact
-	When checking out the lady asked us if we enjoyed our stay ‚Äì to which we replied ‚Ä¶ ‚Äûso so‚Äú ‚Äì and she then shrugged it off.

The chocolates delivered to our room were really the only pleasent thing we experienced. Thank you very much for that.

As for the room ‚Äì one would think that USB sockets would long since be standard feature in a 5star Hotel?

We booked direct! We were not treated special in any way! And your statements all over the hotel ‚Äûno two guests are the same‚Äú looks all good on paper ‚Äì unfortunately is not in the least bit reflected by either staff or hotel. We felt neither welcome nor looked after and certainly regretted every single pound spent there!

133,Royal Garden Hotel,"We have just enjoyed a two night break at The Royal Garden Hotel, so we could attend the BBC Proms in the Park event.  We booked two rooms, both of which were excellent.  It would have been great if they could have been on the same floor, but that wasn't possible.  Each had a sofa in, and one room had an amazing view of the park.  The bathrooms were modern and clean.  Each had a bath and a shower cubicle.  Although in one the shower ran a little bit slow.  
The hotel is well placed for Kensington Park, and Hyde Park.  The Natural History Museum and The Royal Albert Hall are also in easy distance.  We didn't use the car park or any other of the hotels facilities.  
The ambience of the hotel is elegance and quality, whilst retaining comfort and warmth.  There were plenty of lifts, and we never had to wait more than a minute.  Staff everywhere greeted us with a smile and a welcome.    
Each morning the rooms were made up, and turned down again at night.  Bottles of water were placed there, morning and night.  One room was also given a bowl of fruit on the first night which was a lovely touch.  There was plenty of tea, coffee and hot chocolate facilities in both rooms.  Although the coffee bags were not especially pleasant.  
Breakfast was excellent.  Plenty of choice from the hot selection, with fresh fried or poached eggs, or an omelette made to order.  Cereals and  the continental selection was also really good.    There was a menu from which you could also choose things  like kippers, or salmon if you wished to do so. 
The only complaint I have about the breakfast was the coffee wasn't nice at all, very bitter. 
As an additional touch there were also scooters available to loan, free.  This was a great idea, and my Grandson had a wonderful time on both days riding around the park on them.  The only issue we had was on the Friday night there was a lot of commotion in the early hours of the morning with what sounded like an argument outside, culminating in sirens and lots of shouting.  But that of course is not down to the hotel.

All in all, it was an excellent trip and I would return again.  ",5,2019,09,17
133,It was OK but very poor night's sleep,Room pillows were way to soft and made for a very poor night's sleep. Did not get the room we ordered and paid for.Staff very good and welcoming. Was encouraged to have breakfast in room as their restaurant is not big enough to accommodate all guests when the hotel is full. Cost us an extra ¬£6 for the privilege.,3,2019,09,17
133,Ideal Location,"The staff were so friendly and made you feel so welcome, nothing was too much trouble. It's an ideal base to explore London, minutes from Kensington Palace and Hyde Park. Breakfast had an excellent selection and if it wasn't there you only had to ask. Rooms were comfortable, quiet and very clean.",5,2019,09,17
133,Hashem Alsaif- Kuwait,"Excellent  Location,  high experince & frendally staff.
Many good shops nearby, under ground st. withen walking distance ,vairty of resturants in the area , the most important for me is the kingston park next door.",5,2019,09,17
133,Quick break,Excellent hotel we have stayed here before and will definitely be staying again. Good value clean and friendly. The hotel breakfast is very good the Resturant for dinner was excellent as was the Chinese Resturant on the 10th floor.,5,2019,09,16
133,Absolutely fantastic,"The Hotel gets better and better. Each time I stay, I am treated like royalty! All the staff greet me by name, and nothing is too much trouble for them. Various requests for in room ""extras"" are dealt with professionally and discretely, and my companion for part of this visit was certainly treated like a queen!  I come and stay regularly, and I shall keep returning. Many thanks to everybody.",5,2019,09,14
133,A great place to call home when visiting London,"A great hotel in a great location, convenient to Underground, Kensington Palace, Royal Albert Hall & museums.  Superb professional and friendly service from all staff, great breakfast, very nice rooms.  ",5,2019,09,12
133,Great Location!,"Stayed at the hotel during the London heatwave and wonderful to have the air conditioning! The staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful. The rooms were always clean and comfortable. Just found there telephone charges unusually high as well as their taxi rates. Great location.",4,2019,09,10
133,Great location in Kensington,"This is my second stay at the Royal Garden after several years. Hotel is located adjacent (with views) to Kensington Palace and facile access to London's underground transportation. Arrival was met promptly by staff who directed me to check-in personnel who efficiently assigned me to a very small room on the 5th floor. This room was smaller than the one I was assigned during my previous visit and with a lesser view of Kensington Gardens. Room also looked much more tired than when I visited previously - carpet could do with a wash. But everything was in good working order, viz. climate control, wifi etc. Bathroom hosted a shower in a bath tub that I think is unsafe for their more aged customers. Had lunch at the Min JIang - the food was very good but because it was Sunday, I was encouraged to leave early to accommodate other customers. Breakfast at the Park Terrace included offerings of Asian food but that was only remotely authentic - the English breakfast was as expected. Best virtue of the hotel was the staff (throughout the premises) who were professional, attentive and polite. Key issue for me would be value for the rates charged - expected more.",4,2019,09,10
133,Fabulous stay!,"My friend and I stayed here for a weekend catch up.
We had a great deal with Travelzoo which included a complimentary cocktail which was very welcome after an afternoon of shopping. 
Our high floor room was lovely with a small lounge area.
Breakfast was exceptional with a lovely range of gluten free options, the best I‚Äôve ever had.
Would highly recommend.

",5,2019,09,09
133,2nd visit and just as nice," Great hotel but if using the underground car park run by NCP is a very narrow  and like a corkscrew type  so watch wheel trims  if you do not want to drive in the middle of London bus stop right outside no 9 goes through theatre land ends at the Aldwych just perfect ",5,2019,09,09
133,Unpleasant,Noisy room and windows were not properly sealed. Staff were friendly and offered to help by many means but were not able to attain manager approval. Very unfortunate outcome from a 5 star rated hotel. Past experience at the hotel was better,3,2019,09,08
133,4 night stay well worth it,Service next to none. Breakfast was exceptional both in the restaurant and when served in the bedroom. Strolling round Kensington park a lovely way to start the day. Toiletries and bathrobes are lovely ,5,2019,09,07
133,Excellent stay,The organisation and management of The Royal Garden Hotel is excellent and staff are very helpful and friendly with nothing too much trouble. We enjoyed cocktails in Berties Bar and the Park Terrace has great food and service. The location overlooking Kensington gardens and close to the high street with a good selection of shops etc is perfect too. it is my hotel of choice when coming to London.,5,2019,09,06
133,‚ÄúCan‚Äôt wait to return‚Äù,"I really can‚Äôt say enough about this lovely hotel.  As a returning guest you are made to feel as if you are returning to your London home.  Everything from location, accommodation, food and staff are five star.  The Guest Services team, under the able stewardship of Aaron, make you feel as if any special requests are truly ‚Äúno problem‚Äù.  They appear to take real pleasure in making your stay memorable.  At times while travelling, one feels as if hospitality in it‚Äôs truest form has been lost.  I guarantee this will never happen at The Royal Garden.  I suggest you go to the hotel‚Äôs website when booking and you will become ‚Äúpart of their family‚Äù.",5,2019,09,06
133,Excellent accommodations and service,"We again chose to stay at the Royal Garden Hotel for three days at the end of August and were not disappointed.  Although we had a few hitches with the suite we received, the hotel was quick to solve all issues and ensure that we had a fantastic stay.  We would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who is looking for exemplary service from all aspects of the hotel.  We especially would like to thank Felicity and Vladimir for ensuring that our stay was great.",5,2019,09,04
133,Great hotel in a great location!,This hotel is excellent! My wife and I often stay here. The rooms are good. Service is good. Location (right next to Hyde Park) is fantastic! As regular guests they often upgrade our room too... and when we have eaten here the food is 5*.,5,2019,09,03
133,Will always go back,Lovely hotel with great staff and restaurants. It is great for location and for bus and underground links. Very family oriented and can‚Äôt do enough to help whether making a reservation or arranging a theatre trip. Will always go back.,4,2019,09,03
133,A Pleasant Stay.,"A memorable overnight stay in a warm and friendly hotel providing excellent service throughout. Our room was well appointed, quiet and clean with the hotel located so convenient overlooking Hyde Park / Kensington Gardens and being close to all the attractions of central London.  A wonderful experience.",5,2019,09,03
133,Wonderful stay,"We had a really fabulous stay for our tenth wedding anniversary. The staff in every part of the hotel were exceptional and highly trained, nothing was too much trouble. Our room was upgraded to a fabulous clean & spacious suite and as we had booked directly with the hotel, it meant we had some added extras such as cocktails in the bar and breakfast included. Parking is convenient and it is well situated for a stay in West London. Highly recommend this hotel, we will definitely be back.",5,2019,09,03
133,Fab Location,"Great Location, Very Handy for Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park,  Ideal location for Nottinghill and lots of good places to eat around about. The room had everything you need, was comfortable and quiet, The  food was a complete let down, we are vegan and there was little or no options, despite letting them know prior to arrival, and what we did manage to get wasn't great quality.",4,2019,09,03
133,Weekend break,"Lovely hotel in great location with friendly staff and superb facilities.
I would definitely go there again! 
When they discovered it was my birthday they brought me handmade luxury chocolates to my room...perfect touch üòä",5,2019,09,03
133,Weekend break,Lovely location with Kensington Garden views. Bus stops right outside hotel.  Excellent position for a 2 day break. We stayed to visit London Zoo and central London Extremely good service and nice food. The parks are excellent for walking.,5,2019,09,03
133,Home away from home,Another amazing stay at my home away from home!! i will definitely be back and would highly recommend the hotel. Have been staying there for over 10 years now and still receive the same excellent level of service and professionalism now as i did when i first stayed at the hotel way back then.,5,2019,09,01
133,Second stay and still a great,"One of the best locations next too the relaxing Hyde park . No stress with local transport within a swift in crowded walk and quick cabs in the area.
Stable and reliable WiFi for the teens.
Helpful and polite staff especially during our breakfast time.
We managed to complete our important schedule with ease and comfort.
Even had time to soak up some of the partying during the NottingHill Carnival thanks to the prime location. I can see us making use of the RoyalGarden Hotel again for a third visit.
",5,2019,08,31
133,Birthday celebration like royalty,"I booked the hotel as usual direct which gave a great option of wine or fresh fruit as a thanks, fruit was very welcome hiven the heatwave we were experiencing.

Arrived greeted by the consierge and the most helpful happy gent on reception who checked us in. This set the scene for what I will describe as being the very best hotel stay over ever, bold statement but it sums up how good this hotel is.

It was so good to meet Giovanni the restaurant & bar manager again, what an ambassador for the hotel, we were welcomed back so much it felt like we were part of the Royal Gardens family.

So this stay was a very important one as it was to celebrate a return to the UK and also a birthday, Giovanni helped me enormously arrange a special treat which I'm ever so grateful.

Our bedroom was on top floor and overlooked the royal gardens, very spectacular indeed, by this stage the hotel had already excelled but more to come.

That evening we had booked a special meal in their top floor Min Jiang restaurant, it was very busy but a beautiful table setting by the window overlooking the park and gardens was perfect, seems the team of managers arranged this special setting, half way through the meal our great friend Giovanni appeared and wished happy birthday, how pleasant and very thoughtful. The meal was out of this world, more on the Min Jiang review coming next.

That evening we went to Berites bar and again looked after so well by the great team. What was nice when we got back to the bedroom the evening house keeping team had completed the turn down facility and put bottled water on the bedside table, really nice traditional touch.

Breakfast the next morning was really excellent, the selection, freshness and availability was top rate in every respect, the restaurant team again made us and every other guest we saw very welcome.

Our day in the capital was great but when we got back to collect our luggage Giovanni was there to wish us a safe journey home, all these little thoughts combine into one large enjoyable stay, people with a personality make a difference and the Royal Gardens seriously make a difference in the world of hospitality.

We have another stay coming up in September which we all are very excited and looking forward to, for now a huge thanks to the complete team, everyone excelled in every way.

So as a traveller if you are reading my review and want more of my thoughts etc get in touch, I'm very happy to recommend this wonderful hotel.",5,2019,08,31
133,Our things went missing,"Not only our belongings went missing, they did not do anything about it. Just be careful if you choose to stay there. Also they gave us a twin room instead of a king room at the beginning and said they dont have available that night.",1,2019,08,30
133,Royal Garden,It was pleasure to stay at the royal garden hotel. Its highly recommended to stay at this hotel. The rooms were clean and big in terms of size. The staff were friendly. Finally this hotel is the best in its location. ,5,2019,08,30
133,"Excellent staff, comfortable room, great location","Lovely experience staying in this comfortable hotel.  The service was excellent, a friendly and efficient welcome at reception and I was extremely well cared for in the bar and at breakfast - much appreciated as I was, unexpectedly, travelling alone. Nothing was too much trouble. My room (8th floor) was very comfortable and really quiet. Great location.  My new favourite London hotel.",5,2019,08,29
133,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel , customer service ,cleanliness ,quality of food and rooms top notch .
Well positioned for Kensington and Hyde Parks .
The reward system for returning customers needs some sorting as this is the only element that ironically causes some frustration.",5,2019,08,29
133,50th birthday,Wonderful friendly helpful staff and accommodation  rooms were beautiful close to all amenities. Right by Kensington palace and gardens. Breakfast was delicious and the staff were very warm and friendly ,5,2019,08,28

133,Not so Royal!,"Great location friendly staff. Tired poor rooms, gym wasn't ideal, no pool.
We travelled from Australia and expected a little more. The room wasn't ready despite me paying for the extra night to book in early. Then the staff allowed builders into our room before clearing luggage. It was all a little Monty Python really.We were then moved into a similar room and offered free breakfast for the inconvenience. ",3,2019,08,27
133,"Fabulous hotel, great location and lovely staff","Our second visit to the Royal Garden hotel did not disappoint us in any way. From the moment we checked in with the very friendly and accommodating receptionist to the time we booked out with the helpful concierge this was a wonderful mini break. Once again we had spectacular views over Kensington Park, which made our stay extra special. We are already looking forward to staying here again. I would recommend this hotel without reservation, it‚Äôs lovely to feel so pampered and special, even if it was just for a weekend.
The breakfast was amazing once again. We sadly did not get to enjoy Bertie‚Äôs Bar as it was closed, but still enjoyed a lovely cocktail in the main restaurant.",5,2019,08,27
133,One of the best view in my life,"Starting with the fact that it is close to Kensington Castle, close to the subway and buses to move anywhere, places to shop and eat, the Hotel is very beautiful and its rooms very comfortable, near to the Notting Hill",5,2019,08,26
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"Keep returning here, not least because of the friendly, welcoming staff, delicious food and a delightful position next to Kensington Gardens. There is a quiet , peaceful bar where one can relax and enjoy  cocktails and beautifully cooked bar snacks",5,2019,08,24
133,Amazing stay,The hotel experience was splendid and amazing as it is located in a prime area. Which is suitable for families and their children. Next to the kingston park as well as restaurants and coffee shops. But rooms are little bit small. ,5,2019,08,22
133,The experience for the stuff it‚Äôs very bad in dealing with a customer," The hotel is good but the location is not good and the experience for the stuff in in in dealing with the customer it‚Äôs very very very weak And Dave didn‚Äôt respect for the customer the customer will pay to get the full service in the hotel but I didn‚Äôt see anything from the staff ",2,2019,08,21
133,Luxurious Hotel Stay,"Beautiful hotel and staff all very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was amazing and cocktails were fantastic. Only downside is it was just a little pricey for us, although perfect for a special occasion! ",4,2019,08,20
133,Always fab,"Great stay fantastic breakfast, large choice of items 2 types of Bevan , 3 types of sausages, eggs cooked to order, riendly helpful staff booked room on a high floor with views o we the news of Kensington palace ",5,2019,08,20
133,Our favourite London hotel.,We have visited London 2-3 times a year for the past ten years and have stayed at the RGH on virtually every occasion. The staff are wonderful and the location is perfect to enjoy the hustle and bustle of a city break   ,5,2019,08,19
133,Very fine place to stay,"We greatly enjoyed this top hotel that is located in a perfect location.  Very friendly staff.  No service seems too much.  The city is quickly accessible from the hotel, either by metro (5 minutes' walk) or on foot if you enjoy walking.  And the location right next to the park gives the opportunity to escape the bustle of the city.",5,2019,08,18
133,Amazing!,"My goodness. So luxurious. I felt so pampered. Garden view room was fantastic, and the breakfast was amazing. The buffet items were the best I've ever had, I would'v been more than satisfied if I didn't have any hot food (eggs etc.) because there was also a bar with gluten free and dairy free breads, cereals, granolas, milks, yogurts. Fantastic.",5,2019,08,17
133,Lovely hotel,"This is a lovely situated in front of Kensington Palace in one of the nicest parts of West London. Our room looked out over the Palace Gardens and had the normal coffee and tea facilities. One of the highlights of our stay was deciding to have breakfast served in our room, superb!",5,2019,08,14
133,London 4 nights,"Excellent hotel. We experienced a couple of very minor problems not worth mentioning but overall the entire stay was very good. Great location, very attentive staff, immaculate presentation. We would definitely stay there again!",5,2019,08,13
133,Excellent hotel for a short stay,"We had an excellent two-day stay at the hotel with the high point being the overall helpfulness of the staff starting with the check-in person who actually showed us to our room and the bar attendant who gave us better welcome drinks than would have been expected.  The breakfast was excellent with a good choice of food including a gluten-free / other diets section.  The location of the hotel is particularly good for access to the tube and buses and also to the park and Kensington in general.  

The room was clean and quiet, facing away from the main road, although two minor points for improvement were the pillows which were too thin and the WiFi which was unreliable.",5,2019,08,13
133,Very good.,"We have stayed a number of times at the Hotel and always obtained an upgraded room as we book direct and a Loyalty Member. Unfortunately the rooms were not available as no doubt already reserved??
Staff are always superb !",4,2019,08,12
133,Location and Service,"A very high and appropriate degree of service offered at this hotel but as one would expect for the costs associated.  Perfect location for walking to various sites as planned on our vacation. 

The breakfasts were absolutely wonderful.",5,2019,08,12
133,Ripoff fees and deducting cards multiple times,"My card was deducted multiple times to the value of 1000 pounds for 289.00 on booking.com 
Breakfast was poor, cold toast, bad service and dismissive staff.
The final insult was 42.00 for overnight parking, when it's free on the street. ",1,2019,08,11
133,Great Solo Location in Kensington,The hotel is right in the prime walkable/ joggable area of Kensington surrounded by shops and the park.   the room itself was a little small and the parking structure felt cramped (by california standards) but the staff was super positive and accommodating.   I‚Äôd stay there again if I was traveling solo but the size of the room I was in would be too small for two of us. ,4,2019,08,10
133,Great hotel,Had a very pleasant experience staying at this hotel. It is in an excellent location close to the high street. Excellent staff providing amazing service. Clean decent size room and comfy bed overlooking Hyde Park. Pretty good breakfast.,5,2019,08,09
133,Wonderful Hotel,"Loved everything about this hotel.  Location was perfect right next door to Kensington Palace, bus stops at front door, train station very close & plenty of good shops around hotel.  First hotel I have stayed at in London that has everything going for it.  Had a wonderful breakfast every morning with the best fruit and best cooked omelettes. Very comfortable bed & pillows and good shower.  Will stay there again and again.",5,2019,08,07
133,Nice Hotel,Had a lovely Visit hope to come back again the room was a bit small but adequate the facilities are fine as was the breakfast arrangements the staff at reception are superb and very friendly the location of the hotel was excellent,5,2019,08,07
133,Great place to stay in London.,"We booked this hotel through travelzoo, it was a bargain. Hotel is located in a great place, we were treated like royalty by all members of staff that we encountered. We had a great room with a fantastic view over Kensington garden & palace, relaxing with lovely linens & towels , truly 5 star. Breakfast had just about everything  on offer, the chef that cooks the eggs to order, does a brilliant job.Would recommend & would stay here again.",5,2019,08,05
133,Dinner and breakfast was very good with no issues accommodating vegan options,"We found the staff to be friendly and efficient.

. Will definitely stay here again in the near future. ",5,2019,08,05
133,Highly recommended,"My wife and I stayed at Royal Garden Hotel from 30 - 31 July and we wanted to take this opportunity to thank all the staff for providing such a memorable visit. In the 18 years that my we have been coming to London, this hotel is head and shoulders above the others we have stayed in. 

All the staff, from Naomi on reception, to the Concierge, the staff in the restaurant and the staff in Bertie's bar, provided a wonderful service and our room was lovely",5,2019,08,02
133,EXCELLENT HOTEL,"The hotel is so ideally situated, and with transport links so close by, it makes all parts of London very accessible.  Also great shopping opportunities in the immediate vicinity and super restaurants.",5,2019,07,31
133,See my advice,"We felt unhappy and disappointed experience in your service, In first night your staff advise me ti0change the room for unfair condition, and same at the last night. This make me and my son feeling very disappointed. we hope your management may improve it.

133,Excellent hotel in Kensington,"Wonderful hotel, great location, large rooms, great customer service. We found the location to be excellent, right by Hyde Park. Customer service was excellent, prompt and very efficient. Rooms very good and spacious",5,2019,07,30
133,Fine hotel in wonderful location next to (actually in) Hyde Park and near Kensington Palace,"A well-run hotel with nice rooms and exceptionally well-trained staff. As a single female traveller, I feel very secure and well looked after at this hotel. At other hotels, I have experienced being invisible or considered unimportant, and being fobbed off with inferior rooms, but not at the Royal Garden. My husband likes staying there too, especially as the food is good (including authentic Singapore style cooking). The location is so convenient for visits to London and you can walk to many places from the hotel. Weather permitting, we walk across Hyde Park to the hotel from Paddington Station, where we arrive on the train. I highly recommend this hotel. It is a cut above.",5,2019,07,30
133,NOT CELIAC FRIENDLY OR EVEN INTERESTED,"We stayed at this hotel for a week.  Our breakfast was included, but not really.  On the first morning my daughter and I (both Celiac) ordered 2 eggs easy over with crispy bacon.  Every other restaurant we visited during our London trip would explain they had an open kitchen, but would take every precaution and use a fresh skillet rather than the usual grill.  Not the Royal Garden!  They explained they had an open kitchen and COULD NOT COOK US ANYTHING.  They directed us to some individually wrapped muffins and that was it for service.  My advice is to avoid the extremely lazy male waiters who informed us there were no more muffins, only to have a waitress bring out a pile of muffins.

I have never received this pathetic level of service in any hotel in my world travels to Romania, Nigeria, the Philippines, Qatar, or anywhere else.  They should be ashamed!

IF YOU HAVE CELIAC OR GLUTEN ALLERGY AVOID AT ALL COST!  This was the worst hotel restaurant I have ever had the misfortune to visit.

They clearly do not value their customers.  I recommend that you as a potential customer to not value them.",3,2019,07,28

133,Excellent Location,"The Hotel and ist Services are top notch. If the Mayor of London and the Government did something to reduce pollution in London and in the area in general, this hotel would be my second home. Unfortunately, air quality in the area is as bad as it's always have been, so I had to limit my stay to the bare essentials.",5,2019,07,21
133,Fabulous!,"This is a wonderful hotel, with wonderful staff, comfortable rooms, great views, and a great location.

133,Amateur Hotelƒ∫ike place.,"The place shouldn't be allowed to be called as a ""Hotel"". Appallingly amateur, uneducated,incompetent staff. The fact that this place has a licence to run as a hotel is alarming about how the UK authorities are distributing these licences. Possible to write details but at the end of the day the result is certainly avoid this place. Spend the night in the park next to it but don't stay here.",1,2019,07,14

I liked the room first time i got it was very good view and extra space to sit enjoy the evenings. Yes, second time i did not get the same room, may be due to high occupancy, thats fine.  Overall good experience.  Yes, wanted  to stay again from 12th to 17t July, but due to high occupancy i had to stay in some other hotel.  
Thanks",4,2019,07,11
133,Loved the personal touches,"First stay at the Royal Garden and very impressed.  I booked directly and joined the Rewards scheme which gave us a complimentary bottle of wine in our room.
The welcome card was beyond anything I could have expected  - I was in London for BST at Hyde Park and Lionel Richie was performing.  My welcome card in the room had a picture of Lionel Richie with the lyrics from one of his songs adapted for me! Staff service also a credit to the hotel.  Great location too!",5,2019,07,09

",5,2019,07,09
133,What a mix up,"Given a 1st floor room for one person with no view for my husbands 80th birthday gift.  We were eventually moved to a much nicer room on the 8th floor with a view.  Staff excellent once they realised a mistake had happened, although a mistake that should not have occurred.",4,2019,07,08
133,Not the Best,"Restaurants...Min Jiang closed.  Bertie Bar empty and uninviting.  Park Terrace...terrible drink.
Room...comfortable.
Concierge...pleasant, but charged a $25 vig for calling for a car for us.
Location...basically ok, but awkward to walk in and out of hotel...no walkway...needed to weave in and out of cars to get to/from the door.
Would not recommend.",3,2019,07,07
133,Very rude stuff and rooms in need  of updating,"This hotel used to be fantastic but standards have drastically declined. The staff were rude, hair on towels, hair in the bed. I had to buy a bottle of antibacterial spray. Shocking for a 5-star hotel. ",2,2019,07,06

133,A 5 star experience,Friendly excellent service at this luxury hotel. The queen rooms are compact but excellently equipped. My request for a special pillow was met in full. The quality of the room service food was outstanding,5,2019,07,02
133,Better than the Royal Garden Hotel has a Buckingham Palace address,"Right on the park,walking distance to the tubes,1st class rooms and services.On the street after midnight ,with everyone else coming back from the Yankees/Red Sox game and other places because this area is alive at that hour.Good safe location,excellent hotel.",5,2019,07,02

We dined at several locations in the hotel and were not disappointed with the quality of the food or the service we received from the staff.
",5,2019,06,30
133,Afternoon tea,"We had the Queen Victoria afternoon tea which was delicious.
The service was professional and not rushed.
The piano playing was lovely in the background.
It was a blistering hot day and the air con was very welcome!
I asked ahead to have plain scones which they accommodated and were delicious.
The beef tea, I asked to be replaced with something else. They offered mushroom, which was full of flavour. 
The afternoon tea was wonderful and great value for money.
Just to be aware, some teas have a supplement attached, they do not replenish anything and you only get one of every sweet treat between two!",5,2019,06,29
133,Overpriced and really a 4 star,"Apart from breakfast which was excellent, I would rate RGH Kensington as a low level 4 star hotel.

The pillows were poor and offered no comfort whatsoever.

The heating/air con system was old and very noisy

The selection of movies was very poor",3,2019,06,29

133,Quick visit to London,First visit to London.  Stayed 3 nights at Royal Garden Hotel.  Very friendly and helpful staff especially the concierge.  Rooms were quite comfortable. The location was very convenient with a bus stop right in front of the hotel.,5,2019,06,25
133,Not as good as last time,My wife and I had a king room which was not all that spacious. The furniture in room 304 is beginning to look tired. WiFi did not work in the room throughout our stay. We left to go sightseeing on our first morning at 10am and when we returned at 3pm our room had not been made up. This was inconvenient as we were leaving for a concert at Wembley at 4.30. In comparison to our previous visit our overall feeling was one of disappointment and although we love the location of the hotel we are unlikely to return.,4,2019,06,25
133,Good hotel all round,Hotel was clean with friendly professional staff. Rooms were a good size (we had a king) and breakfast was particularly good. The location is excellent for Hyde Park and nearby shopping with easy access into the city via the tube or walking. ,4,2019,06,24
133,Great place to stay for getting around,"Kensington High Street is a shoppers paradise and this hotel is so well situated for may sights.  We were attending the Royal Albert Hall for a concert which was only a short stroll through the nearby park. The park is also a great walk, it is huge and really pleasant.  The grounds are lovely near the tea room. The hotel was good, breakfast excellent, staff courteous.  We asked to change rooms as we originally overlooked the High Street but managed to get view of the park. Would stay there again.",4,2019,06,23
133,Afternoon tea ,"Make sure you book....we are so glad we did, pleasantly surprised by the array of savouries and sweet treats. Just allow more than enough time to enjoy this treat (at least 2hours) definitely recommend!!",5,2019,06,23
133,Excellent,"Excellent, clean , very friendly staff in all areas. Very good location with London bus right in front the hotel. Many restaurants and shops around.overlooking the Hyde park or the lively high street Kensington.",4,2019,06,22
133,rude reception staff,Very very poor service for a hotel costing this much The staff at reception were rude (not everyone) The entire service/process lacks in professionalism and good planning and management. The process of booking the rooms is lacking in transparency and there is always a confusion over payment and when this needs to be made. Needs better trained staff which are more competent. The price of the rooms is very high and it should not have this kind of issues. The issues are basic to any business especially leisure industry. Overall very poor and lack of professionalism from staff booking the rooms.,2,2019,06,22
133,Mediocre hotel with beautiful surroundings and bad management,"The good part was that our room was ok (good size, clean) and we had a beautiful view of the park. The position of the hotel is great, having all you might desire at walkable distance. But if you want to leave with a good impression avoid the restaurant. Our first bad impression at the restaurant was with the manager Giovany, who insisted to explain to us how great is him and his team at the moment when we raised a complaint about the food. Anyway, our second experience was much worse. The director of food, John insisted to explain to us that he has spent a lifetime in the business, he is right and we are wrong and his way is the best way. Long story short instead to enjoy our meal we had to listen to him for a while and even if he literally was there to apologies his body language and attitude was disrespectful. To conclude, we will never recommend this hotel or return.",2,2019,06,22
133,Best of London,"The location of the hotel is perfect, right on Kensington high street and next to the Park. The staff are friendly and helpful and go out of their way to help you. The hotel is also kid friendly with special giveaways for them on check-in. The only issue is with the age of the rooms - they now need an up-grade. Overall a great experience.",4,2019,06,22
133,Need to just check room !,Great stay fantastic friendly staff just let down by mini bar not re stocked from previous guest and dirty. At a premium price per night 5 x hotel not really good enough. Would stay again it's a fantastic hotel.,5,2019,06,22
133,Bad experience!,Extremely bad service. Staff are impolite. We got stuck in the outside elevator and it took them 20mins to help us out. Duty manager was careless about our complaints. Will never stay/recommend this hotel again.,1,2019,06,21
133,Amazing Hotel,"We just came back from a ten day stay at the Royal Garden Hotel and I can't say enough good things about the property. We arrived early at the hotel and we couldn't check in until 2PM so we went out for a lunch and a quick walk around the park but the hotel held onto our luggage. They gave my daughter a cute red backpack with puzzles, toys, and a list of restaurants and places that are child friendly near the hotel.  

We had the breakfast pre paid and I was delighted we did. The breakfast presentation and service was outstanding.  Already missing the pork sausage, fresh fruit and omelettes. My daughter is a picky eater and she found something to eat every single day.  We also had dinner our first night in town and the steaks were. delicious. Plus I can't say enough things about their chocolate cake. It was to die for.  You can't beat the location. There are a ton of shops, the Underground is nearby, tons of restaurants plus the double bonus which is Hyde Park next door were you can rent bicycles (if you have little ones the hotel will lend you a scooter free !), rent a little boat and go around the Serpentine, plus there are tons of walking paths, gardens and things to do around the park. 

We will be back. I can't say enough things about this hotel. We loved the staff, the rooms, the service, the turndown service. It was top notch! Every single penny we paid was well worth it. AND I want to add, book directly thru the hotel's website. Tons of perks included! ",5,2019,06,20
133,Weekend Break with the Family,Fantastic stay in all regards. It made a weekend break extra special and our visiting guests were also made to feel very special. All the staff went the extra mile for us. In particular the reception manager who fixed up the weekend package and Guest services who constantly made us feel at ease with the hotel. The Park terrace food and service in Berties Bar was of the highest standard. WE WILL BE BACK!!,5,2019,06,18
133,Fantastic Hotel,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. It is beautiful, the service is impeccable and it is in a fantastic location, adjacent to Kensington Park. The sleeping rooms are very comfortable and we had a gorgeous view of the park. It has everything I have been looking for and more. I had also held a business meeting here a few months ago and everyone raved about it. Bettina Sandner is a pleasure to work with.",5,2019,06,17
133,Lovely staff,"We had a great welcome by Noemie on the reception desk on arrival. Our room was on the 10th floor overlooking Kensington gardens which was wonderful. Very clean bathroom and bedroom and lovely Penhaligan toiletries.....
All of the staff were very helpful, and Mick the concierge was marvellous. He was also knowledgeable concerning my husband‚Äôs questions about the England Football team stay in the hotel in 1966!!
Very good choice at breakfast to suit all tastes. 
Hotel is in a good location, and all types of restaurants around it if you wish to explore.",4,2019,06,17
133,Great location,"Friendly efficient staff, good sized rooms, great location for visiting London
Lots of staff in all areas meant we didn‚Äôt ever need to queue
Easy walk to tube and Hyde park
Be careful with underground car park not suitable for large SUV
",4,2019,06,17
133,"A little disappointed, room very tired","First impressions of the hotel are good, however the room was disappointing with carpets being badly stained and the mini bar not adequately filled, I felt I was going to be charged for stuff I hadn't had. The room also had electrical issues, I had to complain about the power sockets and the USB charging point didn't work for my phone. I was a double room, but again had to complain as the room was only set up for one person, tea and coffee for one, bathrobe one, towels one, etc etc. 
Also I was given a price for parking from the hotel at ¬£50 for 24 hours, when it is only actually ¬£42, so despite having a 50% discount code from the hotel, I still paid more than 50% at ¬£25. 
Food and drinks prices as you would expect I guess from a London hotel, VERY high.",3,2019,06,16
133,Excellent Place to stay in London,"The Royal Garden Hotel is a top-notch, outstanding level of service hotel with a most excellent breakfast buffet! The location is wonderful, right at Kensington Park and a short walk to the Palace. The staff made us feel very much at home and provided outstanding service from curb-side greeting to accommodating our requests. This is one of the few places that I would ever want to stay in again! Very comfortable beds, great views of the park and great location, very attentive staff!",5,2019,06,15
133,CAS Contemporary Art Trip,Twenty Two Art enthusiasts came to view and learn about Contemporary Art and artists in London.  The hotel was a very enjoyable stay and convenient by Coach to our areas of visit.  The staff was exceptional and the attention to detail was very good.  ,5,2019,06,15
133,Good for a quick overnight,"We stayed for one night after a cruise before flying home. The hotel had our room ready by the time we arrived at 9 am which we really appreciate. We were able to drop off our stuff and head out for a great day in London. The hotel is in a great area of Kensington with gardens, restaurants and many modes of transportation to get you to other parts of London. We faced the main road which was very noisy, so ask for a room facing the park. ",4,2019,06,14
133,Great,"A pleasure coming here. Great rooms, lovely breakfast and a couple of great restaurants as well. Superb location. A stroll along Hyde Park and your right at Buckingham Palace.
The hotel have book of its history - we asked for it - hoping to buy it. The staff gave it for free. A nice gesture.",5,2019,06,14
133,Payment on check in follow up.,"So re policy on check in  beware!!! So they pre auth the full room amount on check in plus a 100 deposit, that does not clear back to your bank account for 3-5 days , they then charge you the room rate at check out, so in essence you pay double for 3-5 after check out....I checked out Sunday and my pre auth clears tomorrow! So ‚Ç¨1200 from my account for a 2 night stay. 

Never ever have I heard of this with the hundreds of hotels I've stayed in , the reply from the manager is that it's normal practice! Absolutely not...normal practice is to do a small nominal amount on the card or just prepay room. What a crazy policy!!!!",1,2019,06,13
133,Highly Recommended,"I would highly recommend the Royal Garden Hotel; great accommodations, friendly staff and it's in a fantastic location!  I was in town for business, but I would choose the Royal Garden for a personal stay on a future visit since it is in such a great location.",5,2019,06,13
133,Disappointing,"As i explained in last email the pre blocking of full payment and deposit is something i have never come across ..and a deposit!??? A 5* behaving like a 3* !! The rooms were also --4* and not a 5* start standard , it smelled stale of lingering cigarettes.  Staff are very nice,  location was great and also great rate I secured but check in policy very disappointing ",3,2019,06,11

133,"Queen's rooms are meant for one , not two.","Booked a room with Queen's bed on booking.com which was stated to be for 2 , but found that it was so small (by the way, we are 2 small built individuals) , that it was actually meant for one , which hotel staff confirmed to me. In addition, the television was extremely small, placed in an awkward position in one corner of the room and didn""t work !!Hotel staff advise guests to book direct on their website. Toilet flushes not so good.

Location is excellent and service on the whole good.",3,2019,06,10

We were given a tray of jars filled with various teas that we could select from; sandwiches, scones and desserts, with refills of sandwiches offered to us (and happily accepted); crisp table linen; very nice china; wonderful professional service; piano player with relaxing music; and all next door to Kensington Palace. Made for a lovely ending to a busy day of the V&A, KP, Notthing Hill shopping.  Also not nearly as expensive as the Ritz and other hotels. ",5,2019,06,09
133,A fabulous hotel that cares,A fabulous hotel where the staff go out of their way to ensure you have an enjoyable stay. Beautiful room in a fantastic location. We will be recommending this hotel to family and friends and will definitely go back soon. ,5,2019,06,08
133,A Great Experience At The Royal Garden Hotel,"We booked our reservation for the Royal Garden Hotel in London through our Disney Vacation Club membership and it worked out really well.  The hotel is located in Kensington Square, right around the corner from Kensington Palace and the beautiful park and gardens.  We spent lots of time exploring this area.  The hotel offers a free breakfast buffet which is really amazing.  And the accommodations and the staff are definitely 5-star luxury level in quality and service.  I hope we get to go back again.",5,2019,06,06

Amazing location at high street Kensington. Only few steps from Kensington palace gardens, 5 mins walk from High street Kensington underground station.
Shops, restaurants and cafes are righ across the street.
Rooms are perfect, friendly yet professional staff.
Definitely it will be on top of my list when visiting London next time ",4,2019,06,04
133,Warm friendly welcome,We arrived at the hotel to a warm and friendly welcome. We were personally shown to our room by the hotel receptionist. This was a lovely personal touch by the hotel staff which made us feel welcomed and relaxed. The room was luxurious and immaculate and the warm heated floor in the bathroom topped off the attention to detail in the room. I would highly recommend this hotel and we will definitely stay here again.,5,2019,06,04
133,Superb comfort & stunning garden views,"Besides the hotel being conveniently situated, the service is top class.  All staff are extremely professional, friendly and willing to render assistance. Our room was beautifully appointed with the accent on comfort.  It was indeed a pleasure not to have a shower located in a bath, so typical of British hotels.  The proximity to beautiful and tranquil gardens is definitely a plus, as one could escape the hustle and bustle of city life so easily.  Although pricey, it does offer value for money - we'll be back!!",5,2019,06,04
133,Great family stay,"A one night stay with two of our children (8 & 5). The hotel staff are amazing, customer service second to none. They were so accommodating to the children, with awesome back packs filled with goodies for them when we arrived. We did the family flicks thing, opting for room service & a movie which the kids loved and the ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù were great, the fish fingers & Toblerone dip (obvs not in combination) worthy of particular mention. Our booking was upgraded - we booked direct & the suite really added to the whole experience for our children. Breakfast was amazing too, children being children opting for combinations not on the menu, had their every whim tended to (just as a treat of course) Anyway, to sum up, great hotel ideally located for Natural History Museum & Science Museum, awesome staff, great service & great food , we‚Äôll definitely be back. 5 Stars ‚≠êÔ∏è",5,2019,06,02
133,A great stay,"We really enjoyed staying at The Royal Garden hotel with its great position right next to Hyde Park and conveniently close to great shops and the Royal Albert Hall.

133,Jane,"A wonderful hotel in a beautiful location that is quiet. So easy to walk or get a tube to any of central London. Restaurant great for all meals and I personally recommend their coffee. I‚Äôm an Australian and we are very fussy with our coffee. It‚Äôs a ritual like the Italians. 
It‚Äôs my home from home whilst in London. ",5,2019,06,01
133,"Good, but expected more","The hotel itself was nice. We stayed here for 7 nights and I think our favorite thing about it was the breakfast options. The fruit in the morning was amazing and there was such a wide variety of foods that I don't suspect anyone could complain about it. We also did afternoon tea at the hotel one of the days and the food offered was very good. Some other things that we loved about the hotel was the heated towel racks and the complimentary bottled water left in the mini fridge. These little things definitely made us enjoy our stay more.  

Our room, however, was severely dated and had big carpet stains on the floor, the bathtub kept plugging up, and was on the smaller size. The first day I asked if our room could be switched to another and the check in staff explained that the hotel was fully booked so we'd have to stay in that room. I was really disappointed because I was expecting a much nicer room considering that it was a 5 star hotel. Understandably, the things that i mentioned are in fact small issues, but when you are staying in a 'luxury hotel' you kind of expect a certain level of comfort while staying there. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, but i think it just fell slightly short of our expectations. ",4,2019,05,31
133,GOOD,position of room overlooking the park. Enjoyed the separate living room area to relax. waiters helpful. Breakfast too much butter in scrambled eggs. Convenient ^position for buses and Kensington High street. Enjoyed walks in the park.,4,2019,05,30

The location  is superb, right on Kensinton High St and near the tube station. Kensington Gardens andPalace are just across the road.
It's a rather plain building but with elegant public rooms and lobby. The NCP carpark under the hotel has the tightest circular ramp I have ever seen  tho' the carpark is a reasonable price with the discount from the hotel. 
The rooms were large and comfortable with a safe , a locked fridge, and an enormous bathroom with both bath and shower. The shower was an ultrmodern one where we could not work out the knob to change from rainshower head to handheld shower, and the housekeeper had some difficulty too, but was very nice about her wetted hair after she had shown us.
The breakfast was superb  and taken in a very pleasant dining room overlooking Kensington Gardens.
It is not a cheap hotel, but good value for what we got and for such nice staff.",5,2019,05,29
133,family stay,myself and my two children recently stayed at the hotel on a repeat visit an yet again the service was excellent. the children had use of the micro scooters and a helpful explorer pack. The trip was fantastic made all the more special by our stay at this lovely and special hotel. will return again soon.,5,2019,05,29
133,The perfect city retreat,"Everything about this hotel is perfect, location,  view, room comfort, and especially the service. The breakfast buffet was delicious and varied. The room was  large with beautiful view of Hyde Park.. There were many fine restaurants and shops close by. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,05,29
133,Amazing evening ,"We had dinner at the restaurant on my birthday trip in London. It was a perfect evening, starting with the cocktails (the Singapore sling was better then the original at The Raffles) very friendly staff and the food was outstanding. As a chef and former executive chef of The Peninsula HGK and the Jianguo Hotel in Beijing I'm very picky with Chinese food but thr Beijing Duck we had was the best outside of mainland I ever had. Congrats to the whole team, we will be back inAugust„ÄÇ ",5,2019,05,29
133,Superb Hotel in a Superb Location,"I am running out of amazing things to say about this hotel! From the minute you walk in you feel special. The staff are truly fantastic. The hotel itself is first class. Everywhere and everything is absolutely immaculate. The rooms are very comfortable and have always been quiet. The beds are extremely comfortable. We really love it here! On this visit we enjoyed a couple of visits to Bertie‚Äôs bar which is very comfortable and has a lovely atmosphere. We have always thought the breakfast is impressive so, for the first time, we decided to have dinner in the Park Restaurant. Wow! We both had three courses and the food was amazing in both taste and presentation. The chef should be commended. We both love food and were blown away by our meal. We cannot recommended it highly enough! Yet another reason to return to the wonderful Royal Garden Hotel.",5,2019,05,28
133,Memorable Experience,"The overall experience is great.  The location is just beside the Kensington Palace.  The hotel is overlooking the Hyde Park.  You can just take a walk or jog anytime of the day. The bus stop is in front of the hotel & Train station a block away.  There are lots of restaurants & shops around the hotel.  But most of all the hotel is very clean, staff are very accommodating & helpful.  I will recommend the hotel to friends & relatives.",5,2019,05,28
133,Excellent hotel,"The best hotel,one can dare to dream for himself, best location, excellent rooms, great breakfast, clean, friendly staff. Definitely  will come back. great value for money. superb service.This is the third time staying in this hotel.",5,2019,05,28
133,Fantastic 5* Break,"Fantastic hotel. Great location for the museums our main purpose was the Dior exhibition at the V&A which is a 10-15 minute stroll away. Outstanding service, amazing breakfast, room a little standard but we had booked a standard room so as expected and we did have a park view so can‚Äôt complain it was very clean and all staff were lovely, welcoming and efficient. ",5,2019,05,28
133,Excellent hotel,"On arrival we were greeted by a very friendly, efficient receptionist. She made us feel welcome and special. 
On entry to our room, we had a spectacular view of Kensington gardens. The bed linen was spotlessly white, clean and fresh. The towels in the bathroom were fluffy and smelt beautiful. The bathroom itself was modern and immaculate. 
The restaurant staff were courteous and knowledgeable about the ingredients on the menu. The food was delicious, flavoursome and well presented. 
The ‚Äúturn down‚Äù service is totally indulgent but is a real treat on return from an evening out. Loved it. 
The whole experience leaves you feeling pampered, safe and special. 

Thank you.",5,2019,05,27
133,Don't stay on 10th floor,"The hotel is nice and central. However 10 floor rooms smell like Chinese kitchen due to the restaurant on th10th floor. The restaurant is very good though but each time I walked into my room (1001), the smell is consuming and my cloths even smelled liked Chinese food the second day.",4,2019,05,27
133,Simply simply lovely,A great location and lovely staff who made my stay perfect.  The common areas are kept spotless.  The bedrooms are spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable.  I look forward to staying here again soon. ,5,2019,05,27
133,comfortable relaxing hotel,"We stayed for one night this week as we went to a concert  at The Royal Albert Hall (10 minutes walk away).
We enjoyed our stay and found the staff to be attentive but not over bearing.
The bed and bedding was extremely and the room a decent size.  The coffee in the room was lovely.
All in all a great stay and we would return.",4,2019,05,26
133,Our best stay at this wonderful 5* hotel in Kensington,"As a family we returned to this wonderful hotel to enjoy a spring break, the team were so friendly and efficient on arrival, taking us to our bedrooms which as a surprise were upgraded complimentary, a really nice touch and one that's really appreciated. The views were stunning indeed in a beautiful sunny day it showed Kensington gardens in a  great light so a perfect location to be based in for the break.

We went for lunch and met Giovanni the restaurant manager, its so nice to be able to chat and catch up with such good people at the hotel, it was even nicer that throughout the stay Giovanni's team recognised us and also welcomed us back, there are so many nice pleasant staff at this hotel its very unique and very much liked.

Breakfast was just perfect, the selection, the quality and above all the excellent service, we were really spoilt throughout our stay, there is nothing better than a good start to the day than breakfast in a lovely dining room with plenty of natural daylight.

Something nice was the turn down service of the evening in the bedroom, extra bottles of water / glasses by our bedside, pure luxury.

On departure the receptionist was really polite and interested to know did we have a good stay, which we definitely did, it was our best since staying at this lovely 5* hotel in the heart of Kensington.

We've got more stays at this hotel booked so keep following my reviews but for now a massive thanks to the team, the manager and the family who own the hotel you all know how to look after guests, pure hospitality.",5,2019,05,26
133,Adequate hotel just noisy with room doors along corridor banging shut,"A perfectly adequate hotel in a great location for Kensington palace and Hyde park.  However we had road noise which can be annoying but it was the constant banging shut of doors in the corridor that was most annoying. It‚Äôs impossible to shut the door without making a noise. We are travelling and this has been the least favourite of our trip so far.  
The room is a good size with a great bathroom (shower and bath). Room service great and prompt too.   ",3,2019,05,26
133,Great location.,"We booked this hotel for its proximity to The Royal Albert Hall and we were not disappointed.  We had a good room with a view overlooking Hyde Park.  Staff friendly and efficient, room spotless amd well equipped. Breakfast good.  Cost for the above ¬£380

Ate lunch at Min Jiang on 10th floor.  Spectacular views over London.  Food disappointing and we thought overpriced.  Would not return to Min Jiang.",4,2019,05,26
133,"Perfect location, ambience and a wonderful rooftop restaurant !!!","Good Ambience, Good Room and Good Food in a perfect location....What else does one need??
Some areas of improvement .....Service at the roof top restaurant needs to pick up, when the restaurant and bar is full.
And lastly, pillows in the rooms need not be so soft, that you need three pillows one on top of the other to feel comfortable....",4,2019,05,26
133,Excellent Service,"Stayed one night whilst in London to visit the Chelsea Flower Show. Excellent welcome, good room and super quality buffet breakfast. Highlight was the level of service and superb cocktails at Bertie‚Äôs Bar. Convenient position next to Hyde Park. Would recommend hiring bikes to see around the park which is literally next door.",5,2019,05,25
133,"Excellent Hotel, perfect location","Over the past 2 months, I have stayed in two other nearby Kensington hotels both more expensive but neither compared to the Royal Garden, lovely room overlooking the park, excellent location, the staff were always polite and not overbearing. We shall not bother looking for anything better.",5,2019,05,24
133,Enjoyable Break at Royal Garden,"I've visited the Royal Garden several times over the years, once again had a most enjoyable stay.  I was delighted to win a free night courtesy of competition in 2018 and added 4 days to this for a short break(with reasonable rate via contact with the Marketing Manager)  My stay in a Garden Room was perfect with a stunning view and pleased with services and amenities throughout the hotel.  I found the staff generally to be most professional  and also friendly and helpful.   The quality of meals/beverage was as impressive as usual, all in all a great stay!",5,2019,05,24
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at this lovely hotel.  Beautiful room and outstanding service.  Would come again at any time.  Staff was also very friendly,  helpful and professional.  Can really recommend this hotel.",5,2019,05,24
133,"Excellent value on Kensington Gardens with a high level of service, facilities and comfort","Excellent hotel in a top area, on the gardens, very comfortable, well laid-out and appointed rooms.  Good beds.  Fine gym.  Friendly and professional staff.  
Great Chinese restaurant in house.
Other restaurants and room service not exceptional.",4,2019,05,24
133,Excellent: Would always stay there when in London,"The staff are friendly, the hotel rooms are exceptionally clean, and the hotel is well located especially for visits to the Royal Albert Hall. We also love the 'Garden' rooms overlooking the park, and have not found better value for money in a London hotel",5,2019,05,23
133,Disappointed with service at breakfast,"Having told our friends, who were staying at the hotel with us, that the breakfast we had previously here was one of the best we have had in London, our experience on Sunday morning totally belied this point.

Yes, the food selection was good.  However, the service was appalling.  Maybe they did not have enough staff?   But, this excuse is not good enough for a 5-star hotel, just by Hyde Park.

We had to ask for tea and coffee, after sitting for ten minutes.  This arrived twenty minutes later!  We asked for toast, this took an age.

When I went up to the buffet, there were no baked beans.  I asked if we could have some.  This took ages.

I ordered two fried eggs.  I think the chef got confused as he gave me one.  When I said I had asked for two, he tried to put an egg on my plate which was clearly very undercooked.  I only had one!

Very, very disappointing after our last visit.

The rooms are lovely and comfortable.",4,2019,05,22
133,Lovely hotel with great views,It‚Äôs always nice to stay here and walk around Kensington Palace & Gardens. A great hotel. All the staff are welcoming and friendly. The hotel bar is a nice place to stop for pre-dinner or post dinner drinks! ,5,2019,05,22
133,Fabulous,"Stayed here at the beginning of May and everything was excellent from start to finish.  All the staff were very courteous, helpful and friendly.  We had a queen room overlooking Kensington High Street which was very clean and well maintained.  We had afternoon tea which was very good and had a drink in Berties bar at the end of the evening.  The breakfast the next morning was also excellent with plenty of choice of cereals, breads, croissants, pastries and also hot food made to order.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,05,22
133,Lovely Hotel,Had a great stay at a hotel with excelent service and kind staff. The only minus must be hard beds and a bit small room for a Queens room. The location is spot on for shopping and activities as a nice run in Hyde Park.,5,2019,05,21
133,Exceptional Hotel in great location,"From start to finish as always we received a first class service with excellent facilities. Breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner was very good with plenty to choose from. Berties Bar is also a must. When in London this has been our hotel of choice for some years & will continue to be so for many years to come. Congratulations to all the staff that make our stay so relaxing and enjoyable.",5,2019,05,21
133,Excellent Hotel,We travelled with two small children and were made very welcome at the Royal Garden. We were upgraded to a Park Suite on the eight floor so had lots of room and the most amazing view of Kensington Gardens and the London Skyline. Breakfast was very good and the children were made a fuss of by all the staff. Kensington Gardens which is just next door to the hotel is great for a run around and there are lots of eating options on Kensington High Street. Both Spaghetti House and Memories of India were very good and family friendly. Overall a super hotel in a great location. Couldn‚Äôt be happier with our stay.,5,2019,05,21
133,A lovely place to stay in London,"My partner booked one night here as a birthday treat for me and she chose well!
Booked in efficiently by welcoming receptionist and allocated a ""Queen Double"" room on the fifth floor. Unfortunately not a view over the Royal Park but of the High Street but not an issue.
Room was not huge but spotless and very well appointed and contemporary. Bathroom and shower were excellent and a very comfortable bed. Traffic noise not intrusive due to effective insulation and no sounds from adjoining rooms.
We had cocktails in the Bertie Bar but the experience was slightly marred by a group of ""business"" guests from overseas in jeans and t-shirts loudly discussing their use of recreational drugs, so we decamped back to our room.
Good night's sleep and so to breakfast which was excellent.  One of the best buffet breakfasts that I have had in a hotel and I've had a few! Service exemplary and huge range of choice to cover all preferences. Chef cooked my eggs to order then a waiter brought my black pudding (delicious) to the table. Another kept our tea cups topped up.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, it's a hotel with very high standards, well trained staff and 5 star service.  Fantastic location for the Parks, museums, Royal Albert Hall etc.
Would love to stay here again.",5,2019,05,19
133,International business travellers beware!,"Hot breakfast was cold when served and I was charged for breakfast despite it being included in the price. Eventually solved but not without a fight. 
Payment at this hotel is a pain!
This hotel will not give a receipt to claim back from your employer in your local currency despite offering for you to pay in it! So you don‚Äôt know how much you actually paid. No separate credit card receipt is given except the hotel statement with a blocked card no. So you need to provide your personal credit card bill to your employer to prove payment...very inconvenient!
If you need an easy to deal with hotel, choose a different one.",2,2019,05,19
133,2 day stay in London prior to embarking on cruise,"This hotel stay was included in the price of the cruise, so my rating on the value category is skewed to excellent..

Nicely appointed hotel with excellent, in-hotel dining (I only had breakfast) and several dining options within walking distance of the hotel.  Only downside for my wife is lack of counter space for toiletries in the bathroom and poor lighting at the make-up mirror.",4,2019,05,19
133,Happy break,"Will stay here again. We loved the view from our Garden View Room. Service was excellent, breakfast well worth the money. We have decided that this is the Hotel we will come back to time and time again. ",5,2019,05,19
133,Next visit We will stay in another hotel,"Bad WiFi
Waiting 90 (!) minutes for our room after check in time. Luggage was promised then to be in the room but wasn‚Äôt 
Omelet at breakfast not good, contains a lot more than 2 eggs but not tasty and too dry",2,2019,05,19
133,"""Left hungry""","When your breakfast doesn't come after 45 minutes and you ask for it to be taken off the bill and the response is ""but you didn't pay for it, your company did"" really doesn't cut it! Also a huff from the receptionist when asking for a bottle of water straight after she already had to perform the same request from the person in front of me isn't great, she shouldn't have felt put out by that request as she so clearly did, I think there's a lack of care and empathy amongst staff which surprises me in a higher star of hotel.",3,2019,05,17
133,Best Hotel for a London Trip,"I have been to this hotel very often and I love it. Very friendly staff, nice rooms and a great location.
You feel very comfortable there and the breakfast is highly recommended.
I will definitely come back again :) ",5,2019,05,17
133,Trip to London,"Stayed at this hotel for two nights! Our room overlooked Kensington Palace, couldn't ask for better.  Room service was very good even had bed turned down at night and a bottle of water provided. Transportation from here into the West End was by No 9 bus (directly outside hotel). Breakfast was okay, but not for a five star hotel!  We had a cocktail in the bar - it was very good.  Had a good experience! Thank you.",5,2019,05,16
133,Holiday in London,"I spent a wonderful time at this hotel.  The room is spacious with comfortable beds and seating area. I found the staff very helpful and friendly.  The breakfast was delicious with lots of choices. However, some days it took too long to serve the breakfast. 
Overall,  very nice hotel a bit overpriced. ",4,2019,05,15
133,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel in a great position next to Kensington gardens .
Staff very efficient and eager to please . Early check in helpfully accommodated .
Great breakfasts either continental or cooked . Extensive room service menu .",5,2019,05,15
133,Expected better,"Stayed in less well known branded hotels and had better quality for less money. Would I book this hotel again, in short no as I believe it falls short of the services that its name and reviews suggest. ",3,2019,05,14
133,Wonderful Experience,This hotel is all that you would expect and more.  The staff could not do enough for you.  They all have a smile and are very welcoming.  The facility is very comfortable.  They will assist you with any needs you may have.,5,2019,05,14
133,Wonderful Place,"Everything about the Royal Garden Hotel was wonderful, it has such a friendly atmosphere, the staff couldn't do enough for us and the breakfast was the best ever!
Would highly recommend this hotel for the location and the staff ",5,2019,05,14
133,Wonderful stay with so many special touches to make it one to remember! ,"Our family of four stayed on Saturday night - it was our first weekend visit to London with visits to museums and a birthday Theatre trip for our eldest daughter. On check in (which was early!) we were presented with backpacks filled with goodies for the children which they loved! Our room (and amazing bathroom) was lovely and the view over Kensington High Street was great. Members of staff were so attentive and all wished our daughter a happy birthday which made her feel 
Very special. There was absolutely no noise at night either so we all had a great sleep. Breakfast was delicious and again the service really made this stay stand out from the usual. The location of this hotel is perfect for visiting so many attractions, and the service and amenities make it a definite for a return from us. Thanks all. The Kershaw family ",5,2019,05,13
133,Stay on 10-12 may,"Problems on check in, split my stay between two rooms one on first floor for the Friday one on sixth floor for the Saturday. Obviously we said ok we will take the sixth floor. Only to be told no someone has already checked in to that room for 4 days. Weird as that was our room for the second night. Bit of a bad start. This error caused the key for the room to disable half way through the stay. Room could do with a deep clean as a bit dusty. Cleaner took wine glass from room and didn‚Äôt replace so only had one. Small things I know but 5 star hotel? Not 5 star treatment. My partner and I discussed and on an expected 5 star we‚Äôd give 6/10",3,2019,05,13
133,Wonderful hotel,"The Royal Garden Hotel has been our accomodation of choice for a couple of years now. The service and the staff are just wonderful, as are the dining facilities. The beds and the updated bathrooms are excellent, but the rooms itself could use some TLC as well. The location is terrific as well as the entire city of London is at ars lenght. Highlt recommended.",5,2019,05,13
133,To expensive,"The room we got was rather small, the carpet not very clean, had dirty spots, the price too high in relation to the small room, the  breakfast was OK, the staff was very friendly. The location of the hotel faces a very busy street, but only a few steps away from Albert Hall. ",3,2019,05,13
133,"Location, location, location...","This is a good hotel situated in a great location for anyone that wants to visit West London - right next to Kensington Palace, a tube station 50 metres away, good shopping and eating / drinking options on your doorstep.
I only stayed one night, with my daughter, as we were attending a concert at the Royal Albert Hall a short walk away.  I didn‚Äôt use the restaurant or bar so my review is based purely on the room.
The rooms are a good size and the bed was huge, the bathroom was lovely with a separate shower and bath.  
So why only the 4* and not 5 - other reviews have mentioned words like opulent but that was not my experience, it could have been luxurious but a few tired edges made it not the case.
On checking in there was food left by a previous guest in the mini bar fridge, and opening the drawer with the non-refrigerated items in there was a layer of dust (for a hotel to be 5* I do expect to be able to do the white glove test!) this (food in the fridge) was rectified when I mentioned it when heading out.  The towels and particularly the bathrobes were past their best - a bit hard and scratchy from repeated washing.  Definitely not show stoppers but not what you expect from a 5* hotel.
A good hotel, great location and all the staff I spoke to were pleasant and helpful.  I would definitely stay again.
",4,2019,05,12
133,Great location for museums and renting bikes!,"Lovely hotel, we stayed on the 10th floor with an amazing view.  Staff all friendly and great breakfast in the morning - everything you want .. full English, Fruit, pastries, waffles, eggs all ways, continental ... and lots of specials.

Very nice Bertie‚Äôs bar , good cocktails and it stays open till late 2am ish 

It I had to critique one thing it would be no tea and coffee in the room.
Great stay - we will definitely book again.  Also very close to the tube station",5,2019,05,12
133,Anniversary ,"Stayed here for two nights , lovely clean hotel in a lovely location. Room nice and had a bath an good shower.Had a deal with Travel Zoo which meant we saved on cost as it‚Äôs a little expensive but hay it was a special occasion ",4,2019,05,12
133,"Fabulous hotel, ready to accommodate anything you need and the views are spectacular!","What a find! Next door to Kensington Palace, overlooking the park and right next door to Kate, what could be better? The staff was gracious, the room designed with a special minimalism that was both adequate and comfortable in every way possible. I will stay here many times again and recommend it to friends who want to get away from the bustle of London to an almost Zen retreat. That view, just amazing!",5,2019,05,11
133,The most perfect hotel,"We visit London 3 to 4 times a year and always stay at the royal garden, perfect location for royal Albert hall, shopping, buses to West end, restaurants etc. The rooms are spacious, spotlessly clean, bedding changed everyday, staff just wonderfully friendly and helpful. The park terrace restaurant is highly commendable which we always visit for breakfast and dinner and even Inbetween ! We have just returned from a visit 2nd to 4th May and look forward to our next visit in October.",5,2019,05,11
133,Very average,"Room quality is not great, outdated and not on or with most five star hotels I have recently stayed in. Staff were not great either, I think they have a lot of work to do to meet growing international standards. ",3,2019,05,11
133,Beyond my expectations,"I experienced a service that was efficient, responsive and definitely customer focused. Every touch point echoed the companies brand values. My King Garden Room was pleasant and perfectly appointed for my needs. Next time, I may try out a suite! Great location in the heart of Kensington and great service. Already highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,05,10
133,"Excellent Hotel, a very pleasurable stay.","Our stay at this hotel was everything it could be.  The staff were warm, welcoming, friendly and helpful.  Rooms were of a very high standard and the beds comfortable.  Their was everything we needed for an enjoyable stay.  Berties bar was a lovely place to relax and wind down after a busy day.  Breakfast was delicious and the service excellent.",5,2019,05,10
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"A modern plush, yet understated haven of opulence I enjoyed whilst we worked on the Royal Wedding of Harold and Megan for Australia's Channel 7 The Project. The management went out of their way to meet our needs.",5,2019,05,07
133,Anniversary Treat,"Lovely hotel good room. Slept well nice bed. All room amenities. Staff in all parts of the hotel were helpful and friendly. Breakfast on the Sunday was great buffet style and everything you could want.
",5,2019,05,07
133,5 star experience,A true 5 star hotel from the staff to the rooms. Excellent location on the corner of Hyde park and walking distance to Kensington Palace and the Tube. Every employee I encountered went above and beyond to assist me in anything I needed. Will definitely stay here again. ,5,2019,05,06
133,Review,"The room was nice, clean and quiet.  The staff is pleasant and helpful.  It's in the heart of kensington so walking to the palace or finding food is great as well.  It was very nice and i will likely stay there again ",4,2019,05,06
133,Good service and ok rooms,"The hotel has helpful, and mostly friendly staff (depends on who you meet). The service is impeccable and the breakfast is excellent, although the latter may be somewhat confusing the first day. On the weekends they have a breakfast buffet, while in the weekdays you have to order from the menu if you want for example omelette or pancakes. The rooms are quite ok. We had a queen size bed and a standard room where it is no space for anything else than a bed and a desk (no sofa). But the rooms are clean and, as I said, quite ok. In principle I am no fan of carpet flooring, but it is difficult to get around that when you are in England. The hotel deserves 4.5 on Tripadvisor's measurement, but it is impossible to give half points, therefore I only give 4. Overall, I pull down because the room is ""just"" ok, and that some FEW staffmembers were perceived as rude. Anyway, I like to go back to the Royal Garden Hotel one day.",4,2019,05,05
133,Excellent locale and room!,"Excellent place to stay in London. Bus stop right outside the hotel that leads you to several key places, including the Victoria and Albert museum and British museum. Just 2-3 blocks away is Whole Foods and the High Kensington tube stop. The room itself was terrific (I would strongly suggest getting at least a superior size room, which is perfect for two people). Staff was great and helpful. No real complaints, except that you have to go outside the building in order to get to the gym. But the gym itself was excellent for a hotel, so it's worth the minor inconvenience. Overall, highly recommended. Definitely would stay here again!",5,2019,05,05
133,"Comfortable room, very clean and quiet","Lovely hotel, friendly staff, great breakfast. Great location for the Royal Albert Hall. Bertie's bar had a great atmosphere which is sometimes missing at Hotels. Rooms at the rear of the Hotel overlooking Kensington palace were lovely and quiet had a great nights sleep. Bed's really comfortable.",5,2019,05,05
133,The finest hotel I have ever stayed in,"Quite simply, the Royal Garden is the finest hotel I have ever stayed in,  It had been on my ""bucket list"" since I was a small boy (I shall be sixty next birthday).  The whole experience from start to finish was incredible.  I prepaid for a garden room, and the rate was very reasonable for central London. A chauffeur driven Mercedes was arranged (at a cost) to and from Gatwick Airport. Check-in was swift, the room was superbly furnished (precisely to my requests) and I actually slept well !  There was no traffic noise at all as the room overlooked Kensington Gardens and a private road.  All the staff were incredibly kind and efficient.  There are too many to name them all, but I must give special mention to the concierge team - especially Steve Condron, Stephen Dart and David Cotter. Three lovely men, determined to make my stay special.  Yolande McCourt in the Business Centre, together with her colleagues, came to my rescue as my laptop was being repaired in Guernsey !  Francisco (Lobby Ambassador) was kindness itself, and I was privileged to meet the General Manager, Oliver Bateman.  Food, drinks, and service all round were great. I shall be returning !",5,2019,05,02
133,I loved my morning runs in Hude park,"Perfectly located hotel on High Street Kensington, just next to Hyde Park. I started every day with a run in the park then breakfast at the hotel overlooking the park. I was upgraded to a room overlooking the park which made my experience even better. The staff and friendly and professional. And you can walk almost everywhere from the hotel.",5,2019,05,02
133,"Perfect location for parks, shopping and museums!","This hotel ticked all the boxes for us....we loved the proximity to Kensington Gardens, in one direction, shops and restaurants in the other!
Next time (!) we will book a room with a garden view, though our room overlooking the High Street was also fine.
Also, it is a stone's throw from The Albert Hall, so convenient for a performance.
",5,2019,05,02
133,A favourite peaceful hotel in heart of London,"Excellent stafff. Spotlessly clean hotel. Fellow guests can be inconsiderate of noise from corridor. 
Queen rooms are bit small but well appointed and fine for comfortable nights sleep if travelling solo or short stay. ",5,2019,05,02
133,Good hotel but room for improvement,We stayed recently for the weekend. The check in was quick and the reception staff were really good on getting a room as soon as became available. Because I stayed there before and had cooked breakfast to order I suggested to my husband to stay there as he likes English breakfast to order instead of having the food sitting on trays under heat lamps getting dried. Soon enough we found out that on weekends the breakfast is on self service basis including the hot food. But the worst part is that they have a counter to cook omelettes and the smell of fat is overwhelming. My clothes and my hair got impregnated with the smell and I had to wash my hair again as I didn‚Äôt want to go to a theatre matinee smelling like I‚Äôve been working all day in the kitchen. Next day we had breakfast in the room which was good. Hotel doesn‚Äôt seem to have many staff in housekeeping as the rooms can take a long time to be cleaned. ,3,2019,05,01
133,Lovely hotel,"A lovely stay in a fabulous hotel,amazing views from our 10th floor room. Breakfast was delicious and all staff couldn't do enough to help us. Would definitely stay again. 
Just a shame tubes weren't running to High St Kensington for our stay.",5,2019,04,30
133,Enjoyable Stay!,"Enjoyable stay, at a very friendly, welcoming hotel. Ideal if you intend to visit Kensington and Knightsbridge, but, with a bus stop right outside and a tube nearby, you can be in the centre of London in no time at all!
",4,2019,04,30
133,Weekend stay at the Royal Garden,"We enjoyed our stay overall although they need to up their game at breakfast time with the speed of service. Excuse given was that it was the weekend, surely a 5* hotel should be geared up for this? The breakfast room wasn't full. However the guy I spoke to was lovely and brought our drinks straight away after we had waited 15 mins and halfway through our breakfast. Rooms fine but could do with extra pillows and no ironing facilities available in room. Very clean though and service from staff throughout hotel was outstanding. Very friendly. Hotel is a fantastic location in Kensington, right next to the park and easy access across London.",3,2019,04,30
133,Amazing Stay,"We stayed here for a family wedding. The room was very nice with good facilities and the service was excellent: the staff were extremely friendly. The best part of this hotel is the location in Kensington, near to Hyde Park.  

Would definitely recommend.",5,2019,04,29
133,A great hotel for a weekend break in the capital,From the moment that we arrived we felt as though the staff wanted to make our stay very special. The food in the Park Terrace was amazing. Our room was spotless and very comfortable. We will definitely be coming back to this excellent hotel.,5,2019,04,29
133,London at it‚Äôs best,"Easy to get all shopping as well as sightseeing. Knight bridge in walking distance not to mention the Kensington park in stone through distance.

Great experience at Ming Jiang restaurant, delicious meal while seeing London with all lights on!
Highly recommended ",5,2019,04,29
133,Sensational as ever,"Amazing friendly staff. Sensational value for money. Clean and spacious rooms. What more could you want. I didn‚Äôt try the restaurant this time around but have in the past. Personally I‚Äôd consider it up there with the best. If you‚Äôre staying at the hotel, definitely eat there. You won‚Äôt regret it!",5,2019,04,28
133,Function," Turned an important family occasion into a truly memorable event for all concerned and I shall have no hesitation in recommending the venue to others.handled everything in such a professional and charming manner, ",5,2019,04,27
133,Just friendly and relaxing,"The staff were so welcoming and we felt at home straight away. We went on a Travelzoo deal which was incredible value for what we got.
Our room was lovely and high floor as I requested. Beds comfy and bathroom very nice. No noise from adjoining rooms. Didnt even here the plumbing.
Excellent location next to Kensington Gardens and our room overlooked Kensington Palace.
Breakfast was lovely and we had a pre-theatre dinner which was very good.
Best thing about the hotel as has been said before, are the staff. So lovely and so helpful. They should get a bonus. 
Thankyou all for a lovely stay",5,2019,04,27
133,Fab hotel in a fab location!,"Great hotel in a great location, right in the heart of Kensington with the Palace and Hyde Park on your doorstep.  Lots of good bars and restaurants within walking distance.  My husband and I chose this hotel as we were attending a concert at the Royal Albert Hall, which is a 10 min walk away.  We were on the 7th floor with a room overlooking the Palace, lovely.  Only downside was the noise from the A/C, even when turned off there was still a continuous noise.",5,2019,04,26
133,Beyond excellent!,The Hotel was excellent and I will mark it down for the negligence of the kitchen staff as I found a piece of plastic at the bottom of my soup bowl and I was not offered a discount or even an apology.,5,2019,04,25
133,A wonderful Weekend,"This was our first weekend away for a very long time, and it was important to us that it went well. This it certainly did, and the Royal Garden Hotel made it possible. The room was very comfortable, though a little small for a 5-day visit. It made up for this with a marvellous view of Kensington Palace, and the hotel's location was just right for getting around town, while skirting round the street protests which had threatened to spoil our time.",4,2019,04,25
133,"Great hotel, lovely views","Great hotel in an ideal location with lovely views of Hyde Park, Kensington Palace and the London skyline. Our room was quiet and very clean with large windows to admire the view and had all the amenities you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The staff were friendly and Housekeeping prompt when I made a request.",5,2019,04,24
133,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed here for three nights last week.
2 adults one child 9 years old.
Staff were lovely very pleasant and efficient.
Room was very spacious and clean.
Bathroom and amenities also great.
Delicious breakfast set us up for the day,we didn't eat in the hotel apart from breakfast.
Made our daughter very welcome with a complimentary kids back bag and a few activities she loved.
They have scooters you can borrow as the hotel right next door to Kensington Gardens.
We would definitely stay here again on our next visit to London,keep us the good work Royal Garden staff!
 ",5,2019,04,24
133,"Perfect location, high standards, friendly staff","We love this hotel and visit it a few times a year as the location is perfect, the rooms are beautiful with high standards of cleanliness and comfort and the staff are very friendly and accommodating.",5,2019,04,24
133,Lovely Easter weekend at the Royal Garden Hotel,"It has been a number of years since we stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel and my wife and I decided to return on this occasion due mainly to two reasons; a great offer by booking directly with the hotel and secondly, the consistently excellent reviews the hotel was receiving on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed. Even before arriving, I received a courtesy call from Aaron from guest services, who wanted to see if there was anything he could do to help plan or make our stay memorable - such a nice touch! 
From arrival at the hotel to departure, we found all staff friendly and engaging - and Aaron had even left a chilled complimentary bottle of wine with a note in our room on arrival. Im sorry I didn't get the chance during our stay to thank him personally for that.
We booked a garden room with expansive views over Kensington Gardens which was lovely, particularly over the sunny easter weekend with so much going on in the gardens including a giant Lindt Easter bunny hunt in the grounds of Kensington Palace. We enjoyed complimentary breakfast every morning and despite being very busy, didn't have to wait to be seated. Again we experienced good engagement with staff, who remembered us on subsequent mornings.
The hotel is so convenient to many atttractions and apart from the park, High Street Kensington is right outside with shopping to rival Oxford Street. On Easter Sunday we took a tube ride out  to Kew Gardens which is located in another lovely suburb of London and given the sunny weather, a nice way to spend the day when the shops were closed.
The Royal Garden is a 5 star hotel, but more than just the facilities and quality of accommodation, it has a team of staff who work hard to make guests feel relaxed and welcome and based on our experience, they succeeded.
We won't wait so long to return again.",5,2019,04,23
133,Great location and services,"Great location of the hotel, next to Hyde Park, a few minutes by bus to city center.
Nice and very competent staff everywhere in the hotel, from reception, room services, concierge to breakfast & bar.",4,2019,04,23
133,Staying at the Royal Garden,"I have been using the facilities in this hotel for 47 years especially the former ""Lobby bar"". I have stayed in the rooms less frequently but I am so used to it that I cannot bring myself to try adifferent hotel!",5,2019,04,23
133,Theatre Trip,"Just fabulous. Staff, room and food cannot be faulted. The room we had was on the ninth floor with the most fantastic views. Nothing was too much trouble. The restaurant was great and breakfast the best we have ever had!",5,2019,04,22
133,Details lose you a star,"We wanted to stay in London near the Royal Albert Hall as were attending a concert so this hotel seemed the best option. However the first thing that we had to do was find a car park as the height restriction meant we couldnt park there.

So after parking a few hundred yards away we arrive at the hotel and the recptionist was very good except where I pointed out that breakfast should be included as per the conversation I had when booking the rooms and it took a good 5 minutes for her to return and confirm my being correct. the room was not ready at 12 noon so we left our luggage and went to the concert. 

On arriving back we taken to our room by the receptionist and found our luggage already there. nice touch.

The room was quite expensive as I requested a view of hyde park and this was not a disappointment - although the room layout of the sofa  facing the wrong way lessened the impact.

Having popped into the restaurant and told no need to book we were told when we returned that it was full but we could eat in the bar area off a different menu - not good.

The food is reviewed here - fish fingers in a sandwich and home made crisps was expensive, small portion and the crisps were mostly green - not good.
The pasta dish however was great. So a bit hit and miss.  The service was very good.

The room was as you imagined for the price and 5 stars well appointed, clean and had a great view of the park, albeit we were on the corner of the building so the view was worse of all for us as were near the road.

The desk was not big enough to have the kettle and implements on so were stored in the tiny drawer at the base of the desk which was awkward to access and worse to put things away.

Breakfast on day one was good with staff being attentive and the food excellent

Breakfast on day two entailed a wait of 5 minutes with other guests to be seated, staff run off their feet clearing tables as there was obviously no contingent for what was a fully booked hotel the night before. Food was again good but we had our tea and coffee delivered just as we were leaving after 30 minute wait.

Just a couple of things which you would expect this hotel to get right: the welcoming top hatter didnt say hello once even though we entered and exited the hotel on numerous occasions. The biscuits to go with the tea and coffee were not replenished. The two used wine glasses were replaced by tumblers. 

Overall we enjoyed our hotel stay but we dont consider the price/5 stars warranted for what we got so its not an automatic re-book next time we are concert going.",4,2019,04,22
133,Memorable birthday stay,"I chose The Royal Garden Hotel as having stayed there before I knew the service and quality of stay would be excellent.

This stay was to celebrate a friends special birthday and we were both treated fabulously by the staff. The afternoon tea was delicious as was an evening meal. My friend was delighted with the surprise and the care taken for her birthday.

All the staff are friendly, efficient and it is a delight to stay here as they make the very high standards the hotel has. I'd booked a garden room this time and we had a fabulous view over Kensington gardens as well as more room with a sitting area.

I look forward to returning to The Royal Garden as it is my favourite hotel in London.",5,2019,04,21
133,Beautiful hotel in excellent location,"Excellent and helpful staff, location is right next to a large Wholefoods and a few minutes walk from the tube.  Adjacent to the park provides great views.  Staff was very kind and helpful.  Rooms were clean and decent sized and good value compared to other hotels in the area.  I will definitely stay here again.",5,2019,04,21
133,The Royal Garden makes you feel truly royal......,"I have stayed at many five star hotels in London, but what makes this hotel unique is the staff.  Of course the rooms are  beautifully equipped, with many overlooking Kensington Gardens and the home of Prince William.  The location is perfect for sightseeing, with an on site public garage (discounted rate for guests) and a bus stop right in front of the hotel if needed.  The meals, from breakfast through dinner,  are elegant , tasty and beautifully presented.  What makes this hotel stand out among the rest is the staff.  From the moment you arrive you are greeted with a smile and a sincere welcome.  At breakfast a server remembered us from a previous visit a year ago and came over to say ‚Äúwelcome back‚Äù.  Aaron, the Guest Services Manager is always available for any questions you might have.  He is knowledgeable and has a genuine interest in his guests.  A stay at the Royal Garden never disappoints and enhances any visit to London.",5,2019,04,20
133,Fantastic birthday stay,"Excellent service. Beautiful hotel and excellent location. Personalised birthday touches appreciated. Breakfast excellent. Would thoroughly recommend. Staff welcoming and attentive. Nothing seems too much trouble.

133,Perfect location,"Chose this hotel for our first visit to the Royal Albert Hall and it was a perfect choice , only a short walk away. 
Very courteous staff and the quietest hotel room we have ever stayed in, very comfortable bed and beautiful bathroom. 
There are lots of lovely places to walk around the hotel and admire the beautiful homes and architecture, the sunken garden at Kensington Palace was stunning in the spring sunshine. 
We didn‚Äôt book direct but wished we had as I believe breakfast would have been included..,...but hopefully next time we will do this.",5,2019,04,20
133,Royal Garden Hotel - First Time Stayers,"Very welcoming and clean hotel with a well catered staff that made it hard to check-out.  Beds and pillows could have been a bit better (pillow a bit fuller and bed a bit softer) but overall, a very good experience.  The concierge (esp Stephen) was exceptional - great recommendations and assistance!",5,2019,04,18

133,Very nice stay,"i did not mention this ... i should have. i stayed in 419.
There were constantly a smell of tobacco smoke in the room. Dont know where it came from.
And this comment field ""it must have at least 200 Carters."" when i submitted the above
What is that? I have just tried to help you  improve your service and business. Find an other It-supplier.",3,2019,04,17
133,Wonderful Hotel in a Great Location and with an Excellent Staff,"The Royal Garden Hotel is conveniently located next to Kensington Palace.  It's only a few blocks from the High Street Kensington metro station.  There are shops and restaurants close to the hotel.  Also, it's nice having the Kesington Gardens next to the hotel if you want to go for a run or take a stroll.

The staff was extremely friendly throughout our stay.  They showed us to our room after we checked in.  We were fortunate to have a room on the top floor with a beautiful view overlooking Kensington Palace.  The staff also checked on the status of the metro system during our stay, even though we didn't proactively request this.  Our room was clean and nice with a king bed, a small seating area with two chairs, and a spacious bathroom with both a large tub and a walk-in shower.  The room had robes, slippers, and tea service, which included an electric tea kettle and teas, coffee, and hot chocolate.  The bed was on the firmer side.  The pillows were flatter, but there were several in the room if you want to double-up.  The room also included a switch where you can illuminate a light in the hallway to let the cleaning staff know if you want privacy or if you want your room serviced.

Our package included the full English breakfast, which included an assortment of foods including eggs cooked to your liking, different varieties of sausage and bacon, pastries, yogurt, fresh fruit, cheeses, cereals, toast, beverages, etc.  We had an early check-out on our departure day so we could catch our flight.  We called room service the evening before and they prepared a boxed breakfast which was available at the front desk when we departed.  It was complimentary since breakfast was part of our package.

We used the metro system to travel from the airport to our hotel, as well as throughout our stay in London.  We bought a metro card and placed 30 pounds on the card, which was enough for our four day stay.  From the airport, we used the Piccadilly line, got off at the South Kensington station and switched to the Circle line, which then took us to the High Street Kensington station.  This took about 40 minutes or so.  The hotel is then about a short 5-minute walk from the High Street Kensington station.  Please be aware that if you use the metro system to travel to and from the airport, you will likely need to carry your bags up a few flight of stairs in the metro stations.

Overall, we had a wonderful stay at this hotel, and it was a great value for the price we paid.",5,2019,04,14
133,"Amazing, children welcome",A lovey hotel in a great location. Convenient for Kensington Palace and Kensington High Street.

133,Comfortable hotel stay,Comfortable hotel in a great location in London.  Next to Kensington palace and royal parks.  The bed was very comfortable which helped to get a good nights sleep.  A hearty breakfast was available with plenty of fresh food to choose from. ,4,2019,04,14
133,"Luxury hotel, great location","Stayed here for one night as a treat. The receptionist stated that there was a technical issue with the room we had booked and instead they were putting us in 2 interconnecting rooms instead! We were on the top floor (10) with an amazing view of Kensington gardens. The rooms were spacious and luxurious. The staff were professional and really friendly and helpful. We enjoyed a relaxing drink in Bertie‚Äôs Bar in the evening.

Breakfast is served in the ground floor park terrace lounge. Hot and cold buffet breakfast is available and you have a chef at the station cooking waffles and eggs to order- all are very nice.

When in Kensington treat yourself to a stay in this beautiful hotel.",5,2019,04,13
133,Excellent for family and couples,"Easy access to F&B and retail shops around as well to metro/tube station.  some rooms overseing Hyde Park and Just 2bminutes walk to the Hyde Park.

133,My go-to place when in London,"I‚Äôm a regular at the Royal Garden Hotel (so much so that TripAdvisor doesn‚Äôt let me post a review after each stay due to its minimum time period between reviews!). 

To put it simply: this is my go-to hotel when in London. It ticks all the boxes for me:

- Fantastic location
- Well-maintained rooms 
- Good gym
- And, most importantly, highly courteous and competent staff that truly make you feel welcome time and again.

I‚Äôm already looking forward to my next stay here.",5,2019,04,11
133,Great location,A really nice hotel situated in front of Kensington Palace and close to all the main London Shops makes this a good choice.

133,RGH,"A very comfortable stay, and an excellent upgrade to a king room, with a 20% discount at the restaurant and a bottle of bubbly to welcome us.  We are looking forward to our next visit.

133,Excellent stay with outstanding service,"What a great location, and our room overlooked Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace. Room and facilities were first class. Service everywhere was excellent.

133,Great location,"Have to say the location is great, but you want to maks sure you get the park side room even if you pay a bit more. Breakfast is good, booked at booing.com at reasonable price.
Take your every morning jog at the park is a fantastic experience. ",5,2019,04,02
133,Great Stay,"Had a great stay at the hotel - my room was not ready when I checked in and I was given a complimentay coffee.  I had a great room overlooking the park (Room 647) and the breakfast was excellent - the gentleman serving me couldn't do enough for me and the quality of the food was excellent.  All the staff in the hotel were so helpful - from checking-in, Berties Bar, cleaning staff and the staff at breakfast.  I really enjoyed my stay here and will definitely come again.

133,Weekend in London,"We booked to take our 8 & 10 year old daughters to go to London and watch Matilda the musical. We decided to book into the Royal Garden Hotel as an upgrade to the usual hotel we stay in round the corner and we are so glad we did !
Wow, what an experience from the moment we entered the hotel the staff could not have been more helpful and obliging. We had also been lucky enough to be complimentary upgraded on our room giving us the penthouse suite which is just huge and pure luxury. Our every whim has been catered for and the engagement from every team member has been exceptional.
Thank you to the fabulous Royal Garden Hotel for creating family memories for us that will stay with us forever - We will definitely be coming back.",5,2019,03,30
133,Now I understand the high ratings,"The Royal Garden is perfectly located on a prime Kensington street that puts the Kensington Gardens at your doorstep and lots of window shopping, restaurants and other tourist activities minutes away. Despite the convenient location, I believe the Royal Garden deserves 5 stars because it‚Äôs well-trained, service oriented staff. Yes, the rooms are nicely acquainted (although small which is typical). The check-in process is seamless, the housekeeping staff is thorough and the room service is divine. I highly recommend the Royal Garden if location and service is important to you. ",5,2019,03,29
133,Gouging pricing and nomservice,We could not get home to our apartment because of an armed incident close by this hotel which closed off nearby roads. Despite a room rate of some $400 well above online and general rates and no double beds the person checking us in had no sympathy with our plight and treated us as if we were an inconvenience . She understandably charged the room rate plus $65 to my credit card but then demanded ID despite our being local residents.  Being gouged and treated badly makes me believe that the management really don‚Äôt care. I tried to find a way to complain from the room or online without success. Avoid even if there is an armed incident,1,2019,03,27
133,Always a first class experience,"I attend an annual event at this luxurious hotel and always great myself to an overnight stay. The 5* luxury starts as soon as the car stops - car door opened, luggage unloaded and carried inside. The staff are polite and friendly, but maintain their professionalism. This year, I had booked 3 Queen Rooms, but On our arrival, only 2 rooms were ready so we were offered complimentary tea while we waited.
The rooms are well set out, with a queen size bed, comfortable seating and desk with technical input for computer etcetc. There is also a decent sized ensuite bathroom. The mini bar is well stocked, but be aware, drinks are quite pricey - only the water is complimentary.
Breakfast is as fancy as you like - a choice of cereals, fruit, yoghurts, pastries, rolls, meats and cheese for those that like a continental breakfast and everything from a full English to beans on toast for those who want to indulge.
This glorious hotel on the edge of Kensington Palace gardens is ideal for a special occasion.",5,2019,03,27
133,Excellent location,"We stayed here for the weekend last week,great location on Kensington high street,we were going to the Royal Albert hall,very handy,very comfortable room,our room was facing on to Kensington high street,which is very busy,but we heard nothing in the room,could not fault this hotel in any way.

133,Our Favourite Hotel,"Stayed for a second time at this amazing hotel. We had asked for a quiet room at the end of a corridor with a view of Kensington Gardens if possible. We were given the most amazing room with a extra large bed and a lounge area overlooking the gardens on the 6th floor - such a fabulous rooms. 

Check in was smooth and professional even though we arrived early and we were shown to our room by Mia who was so welcoming and friendly.

 Breakfast at the Royal Garden is fantastic too a huge range of items on offer , 3 types of sausage and 3 types of bacon eggs cooked to order we were looked after so well by Guisy.

Thank you to the Royal Garden we had a brilliant weekend and can't wait to come back.",5,2019,03,25
133,"Good Location, superb Breakfast","I have seen the hotel on many occasions and have wanted to stay for a while as it always looks busy. Booked direct with the hotel and got a good rate I believe. Pre booked the parking under the hotel, through the hotel website link which did not work well. We arrived early and found the room ready which was a great bonus. Nice room overlooking the park. Tea and coffee provided in room. Room was clean and tidy. Shower door is fitted the wrong way so access for anyone over supermodel size is difficult. There is a shower in the bath, but not ideal.  Overall an ok experience. ",4,2019,03,25
133,A Bit disappointed,"Great location but far from the main attractions which was fine so no turists.
Lots of shopping and restaurants nearby.
We had to call 3 times so they would Mae the sofa bed for my kid.
The sheets were dirty with black stains .
The remite control didn‚Äôt work .
Not what you expect from a hotel this pricy.
But besides that everything was very comfortable.
Would stay here again .
Great window view .",4,2019,03,24
133,Made my stay,"I could not wish for a better stay with helpful and friendly staff who could not do enough for us. The breakfast was a real treat with top quality food all the way. The room was immaculately turned out and very comfortable. The manager of Berties bar was helpful and friendly even at a late hour. I would find it difficult find a better hotel.

133,Too expensive for lack of comfort,"The breakfast was great, but the bed was awful. matras too hard, pillows too soft en the blanket too thin... freezing in the room... I was in this hotel for a conference and the room was payed for by my boss. But i would not have spent high price for this lousy sleep comfort.",3,2019,03,22
133,london wedding,while the hotel was comfortable and the staff very welcoming the front rooms were rather affected by traffic noise at night due mainly to revving sports cars and the room supplies rather short. berties bar was booked for a function and there was no other suitable lounge.,4,2019,03,21
133,Great value,"Very good quality/price ratio
Very friendly and helpful staff
Impeccable wide room
My room had a fantastic view on the Park

133,Our first stay here and an excellent one!!!,"Mrs.Electric and myself love to go to gigs. It is deeply embedded in our DNA. We had booked to see Loreena McKennitt at the Royal Albert Hall on 13th March and our usual boltholes were not available. in actual fact we were on our way home from another gig when we received an email telling us of this hotel. It was such a strange coincidence that we booked our stay on the way home. It also proves that your smartphone listens to and tracks your every movement and word even when you have set it up not to.I knew it was going to be a fantastic stay as I had erroneously booked a twin room and the two ladies who I spoke to were very helpful in rectifying my mistake. 
We arrived for our stay and were immediately delighted by what we found. We were checked in superbly by Lelde who also showed up to our room. We liked both her and the room immediately The room had very crisp clean lines in a quite modern style and plenty of wood to make it feel homely.The bed was superb. We had only been in our room for about 20 minutes when there was a discreet knock on our door and Romero arrived with a very nice gift. So far so good. and it continued to be good right the way through our stay until we left the following day. We also liked the bar area and were very well looked after by the three Gentlemen on duty that night. And to be honest, any bar that offers cashew nuts as snacks is going to score very highly indeed. 

Breakfast. Superb. We were welcomed and shown to a vacant table by Kamila, who didn't laugh (too much...haha) at my limited Polish. Our hostess at breakfast was a really great lady named Audrey. She was so friendly and professional and had a sense of humour too. Now for those of you who think that the name 'Audrey' might refer to a senior aunt somewhere, you can forget that straight away. She was young and lovely. And as we met her only a week ago, I would guess that she still is....( another wonderful export from Hungary!)
The food was cooked very nicely and i realized quite early on that my latest attempt at dieting wasn't going to start until the following day.... I continued with cereal, toast, dried fruits...it was a comprehensive meal. In fact I looked like I was 4 months pregnant when I arrived and 8 months pregnant by the time we left our table. And yes, I am a guy...lol.
Our breakfast was concluded by having a lovely conversation with the previously mentioned Kamila and also Marco, and last but not least, Amonella who has obviously traveled in her time ( a great Italian export !). 
And then it was time to go home. We were checked out by Lelde and even though we had only spoke to Maria on reception briefly, even she was smiling and waving goodbye. What a wonderful and superb group of people. Friendly, well presented and professional. And also with a sense of humour. Well done!!
The hotel is on major bus routes and there is a bus stop literally outside of the hotel that will drop you outside the Royal Albert Hall. It's just two stops. 
As for the hotel? Take a look at the phenomenal  number of 5 star reviews. This has been another one. We felt the love !!!",5,2019,03,20
133,An excellent and luxurious short break in London,"As a treat, my Wife and I decided to visit London for a weekend, and we stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel.  This was the fourth visit to this hotel, and the second visit booking a Park Suite.  The suite is excellent and well serviced with separate dining area, lounge, sitting area and bedroom, as well as a large, immaculate bathroom.  Upon our arrival we were met with friendliness and enthusiasm by all the staff.  Car parking was no issue either by use of the Valet parking service. We dined at the Park Terrace restaurant from the A La Carte menu, which was a delight.  As we were celebrating my wife's birthday, the staff delivered little gifts of chocolates and managed to source exactly the required Champagne I requested for the suite.  I would recommend a stay in the Park Suite at the wonderful Royal Garden Hotel.....The finest views in London!",5,2019,03,20
133,Nice Relaxing Place to get away,"It is a really nice hotel; not hype; for real.
They treat you like you're someone important and famous, even if your a nobody like me.
The English breakfast is very tasty and a good value.
Dinner at either restruant is exquisite, next time I'll pre-order the duck.
The place is centrally located and it is easy to get to central London and elsewhere.",5,2019,03,19
133,Lovely stay,"We stayed at The Royal Garden for one night in February on a bed and breakfast basis. We were very impressed with both our  room and service. The staff were very attentive and helpful and I have to say a big thanks to Phil in the security department who managed to find my lost sunglasses and get them posted safely back to me without charge. The breakfast was excellent with a wide selection of choices and cooked to a high standard. In all our stay was good value for money and very enjoyable, we look forward to visiting again very soon,",5,2019,03,19
133,Great Location,"Stayed here numerous times in the past, and have got two further bookings coming up.

Breakfast was lovely with a continental buffet as well as cooked options. 
Would most definitely return to this hotel. ",5,2019,03,19
133,"GREAT LOCATION, ATTENTION TO DETAIL SOMETIMES NEEDED","We stayed here for 3 nights and on checking in were offered a late checkout of 4pm which we were delighted to accept.  On the day of checking out we were telephoned, while visiting the V&A, to say we should have checked out at 12.  We advised we were offered a late checkout and it was disappointng that had not been noted.  On two occasions we arrived at the room to find the keycard was not working which was irritating as you just want to relax and not have to go and queue at Reception for another card..  Reception acknowledged there can be an issue with the cards. We had the standard room which was small but comfortable.  We had the option to pay to upgrade. We had dinner in the hotel one night which was excellent.  The breakfast overall was good and there is a lovely view from the dining room over Kensington Gardens..  Service was very slow on the Sunday morning compared to previous mornings and we had to chase for coffee, toast etc which was a pity as 5 star should always be 5 star service too.  The hotel is in a good location to walk to the museums, Albert Hall, Chelsea and Knightsbridge.  You could also take a lovely long walk through Hyde Park to Oxford Street.  Buses are readily available and there is a tube station minutes away.  We had a good deal on the hotel and I dont think it warranted any more than we paid. ",3,2019,03,18
133,birthday at the royal garden hotel,"A wonderful location with our rooms overlooking Kensington  Castle,and Kensington Gardens.The rooms were absolutely first class,and the food was outstanding.We had breakfast,lunch,and dinner in the Park terrace.The quality of the food could not be faulted,and the service excellent.All the staff were very friendly and could not do enough for our party.

133,The Royal.Garden,"We love this.hotel. This was our fourth visit inside 3 months and again it didn't disappoint.  The wonderful staff are so friendly and helpful, warmly greeting us in the spacious reception area.   At check in we were again given an upgrade courtesy of the royal rewards scheme which requires you to book direct with the hotel.

We took advantage of the 'reclaim your Sunday's offer again. This gives breakfast and Sunday lunch in the Park Terrace Restaurant. Both were superb and the staff again friendly and efficient.  We were seated overlooking Kensington Palace Gardens and Hyde Park and the room was large and spacious with plenty of room between table's.  Again the bedroom has fantastic views of the Park and London.  Also with the deal is a 2 hour checkout extension which we used to the full. It's terrific value. Were already looking forward to another visit very soon.",5,2019,03,17
133,Wonderful Stay,"Spent another visit at this great hotel whose position provides access to so many London amenitiies. (Royal Albert Hall, Kensington Park & Palace, Knightsbride and so much more). The staff are so friendly & courteous. Bedroom had a good view over the park and so clean. I do believe the breakfast buffet is limited for the cost, smoked bacon was rock hard and no wholebran breakfast cerial. Toast is provided so quickly, it is cold by the time that you are ready to eat it.",4,2019,03,17
133,Mr & Mrs,"Spent our 46th wedding anniversary her.

133,Very pleasant stay,"We stayed one night, room only. 
Ideally situated for Royal Albert Hall, just a short walk away. Right next to Hyde park and Kensington palace.

Reception good, fast check in and nice staff. 

Room was ideal for a couple, not the biggest but perfect for one night.
Loads of towels, toiletries, flannels, etc.
Safe in room, complimentary water in the fridge. Good standard of decor.

When we returned to the room at night, the bed had been tuned down and we had chocolate truffles left as a birthday treat.

Would recommend. Expensive, but not unexpected given the fab location.

133,Royal Garden,"I booked this hotel for myself, my husband, daughter, son in law and their 2 teenage children to celebrate my husband's 60th birthday.  It is a beautiful hotel, well located a short walk from Hyde Park and many other attractions.  There is a nearby tube station if you need one.  The rooms were spacious and well maintained.  We checked in and headed out for the afternoon.  That first evening we had booked to eat in the Min Jiang Chinese restaurant and we were not disappointed.  The service we received from our waiter was fantastic - he was efficient and courteous but also with a great sense of humour which made for a lovely relaxing meal.  Breakfast both mornings was lovely.  A great choice to cover all tastes.  The next evening meal was in Bertie's Bar which again was very tasty though the menu was limited.  Again, service was great.  To summarise - lovely hotel with lovely staff and in a great location.",5,2019,03,06

133,Well placed luxury hotel with excellent service,"We had an overnight stay as part of a Theatre Break gift. The location is excellent, literally next door to Kensington Gardens and associated attractions. The hotel itself is very well appointed and the room was excellent. The Tea and Coffee bits n pieces seemed to be replenished a couple of times a day. Breakfast was excellent, one of the best I've had. Finally, I stupidly left my keys in the room when we left. I was already on the train home when I discovered this. Needless to say, they sent the keys to my home address via recorded delivery and I had them back in under 2 days... all with no charge. Excellent service",5,2019,03,04
133,"Great location, great staff","Had the pleasure of staying here for a two night business trip as it was recommended by a friend - glad it was as it was a great place to stay, from the well appointed rooms to the customer service the staff showed from minute one.
Would definitely recommend staying here - just wish I had had more time to explore the great surrounding area",5,2019,03,03
133,A wonderful hotel as always,"We have stayed at this hotel several times and we are always pleased. The rooms are always spotlessly clean and comfortable.
Staff are so helpful and friendly in all areas of the hotel. Food is delicious.The hotel is in a fantastic position. We would be hard pressed to find anything negative to say about this hotel. I think the negative reviewer was staying at a different hotel !",5,2019,03,03

133,Stay,Andreea was very helpful at front desk with my booking. I had made an error at time of booking she fixed everything for my stay. I was charged breakfast for two people instead of one for 2/3 days. Although I explained what I meant on my order form. Room service was not helpful at all phone wise. Reception was the best. Hotel comfort was great. ,4,2019,03,02
133,NOT GOOD!,"PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS HOTEL! I was told a price for an upgrade to the Garden Suite by Tony & as am about to book that price with him, he changed his mind and demanded almost 7 times the price for that same upgrade, all in a 30 minutes conversation . So Unprofessional including the supervisor who was doubting my truth, he kept saying (if Tony did say that to you, if , if) implying I was lying. NOT GOOD the whole vibes of even trying to book with this hotel. Their front people at reservation are a complete letdown & Disappointment!! Take your money elsewhere, so many Other hotels with great & genuine deals !",1,2019,02,28
133,Great Stay and Very Convenient,We had a great stay at the hotel.  Very convenient and ideally located if looking to stay around Kensington and in close proximity to everything.  Perfect for a long weekend and we look forward to coming back on a future trip.  . ,5,2019,02,26

Huge congratulations to the Manager and his whole team for going the extra mile to make our stay such a wonderful and enjoyable occasion.",5,2019,02,26
133,Really good,It was great for our weekend visiting london with the kids.  We had dinner in the room and watching a movie In the morning we got some free scooters from the hotel and went to the park for a walk. Perfect weekend. ,5,2019,02,26
133,Staff make the stay extra special,"We regularly visit London and recently decided to treat ourselves to a stay a the Royal Garden Hotel for the first time last year, since then we have returned as the hotel is not just a great location, more than that, the staff have made our stays feel really special. The staff really do make this much more than hotel, but they add to the magical experience of staying in London. Even the staff in the downstairs bar, who‚Äôs dismissive nature and extremely slow service forced us to enjoy a slower pace and had the unexpected twist of a thoroughly enjoyable night.

Our most recent trip was made unforgettable as we were fortunate to receive ‚Äúa random gift of kindness‚Äù put together by their pastry chef. The thought and detail put into our gift was extraordinary and we were overwhelmed by the generosity of this amazing lady. 

Overall there is nothing that is too much trouble and is much more than somewhere to get a good nights sleep, but somewhere we love to be when in London.",5,2019,02,26
133,London 5 star hotel that‚Äôs family friendly!!,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel for two nights. On arrival we were greeted by the very friendly staff and check in was quick and smooth. We stayed in an Executive Suite, which was very spacious with excellent views of Kensington Palace. We also had our two children with us who were excited to find gifts from the hotel waiting for them! Breakfast to the room was very good with lots to choose from! On our second day we booked an evening reservation at the hotels oriental restaurant Min Jiang. The food was excellent and lived up to its high reviews! After dinner we went back to our room to find the hotel staff had erected a tent in the corner of the room for the children (also mum & dad:) to play in! The children loved it. Parking is easy as there is an NCP carpark under the hotel. We have been fortunate to stay in many 5 star London hotels eg Hilton park lane, Langham, Intercontinental park lane, Westbury Mayfair etc.. The aforementioned hotels are very plush. The Royal Garden Hotel does not quite have the same wow factor once inside its lobby, however in my opinion it holds its own with the above hotels as it is still a luxury hotel but it‚Äôs attitude towards children is the best I‚Äôve seen as the hotel makes their visit special too!
With all best wishes

133,Great Kensington Location,"Terrific location immediately adjacent to Kensington Gardens and on the High Street.  Staff very pleasant and accommodating. Got the impression that several members of staff were in Management Training programs, but enthusiasm made up for any missteps. This hotel perhaps made famous by the Lennon/Yoko Love-In is well run and  a pleasant business-man's venue.  Breakfast is a bit pricey, but so is everything in London.  Convenient location for my purposes would cause me to come back...no questions asked.",5,2019,02,25
133,Top Class Hotel,"Excellent hotel the service is faultless, we have visited before and couldn't fault it then but this visit they made a plate of chocolate truffles with Happy Birthday written on the plate and this morning in breakfast an arrangement of muffins and candle brought to the table they are so tentative it means a lot to children.
Rooms are immaculate and extremely comfortable.

133,Excellent Hotel with Friendly Staff,"Recently stayed for one night at the hotel and it couldn't have been a better stay (apart from maybe a room overlooking the park). The staff were friendly and extremely helpful and despite the room overlooking Kensington High Street, we heard very little noise. The breakfast was delicious and plentiful and again all the staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The real bonus was the bus stop right outside the hotel with the number 9 going all the way to theatres in The Strand/Covent Garden which meant we could ditch the tube. Would recommend particularly if the reduced price offer is still on.",5,2019,02,21
133,Having a Wonderful Stay,"The rooms are very comfortable. The staff and service understated but very conscientious. The surrounding neighborhood has plenty of shops and places to eat. Beautiful Hyde Park is right next door. We have chosen to stretch our legs a bit and walk many places, but most will find a short cab ride a more convenient option to other areas of the city. We are not regular visitors to London, but will be more than happy to book again at the Royal Garden when we return.",5,2019,02,20

Close to the Tube and bus lines, and many first-rate shops and cafes are nearby. Service was very friendly and helpful.  My only (small) caveat is that the stall shower is somewhat complex to operate, so some instructions ought to be provided in the room.  The breakfast room is beautiful, spacious and comfortable, and food is first-rate.",5,2019,02,12

133,Disappointing room,"Room and tap water too cold
Unable to regulate these
Room rather small wouldn‚Äôt have wanted to spend more than one night in this room
Helpful staff who kindly stored our luggage for a few hours
Expensive breakfast",3,2019,02,12
133,Royal garden hotel,"Excellent hotel, fab facilities. Great staff, friendly and polite. Bertie,s bar was brilliant and lovely atmosphere. Would recommend hotel. Lovely location and very close to royal albert hall. The selection of food for room service was extensive. Steak sandwich was delicious and room service was very easy to use. ",5,2019,02,12

Perfect for business travel, lots of food and bar choices and the real point of difference, is the staff. Have a total can do approach and are friendly, engaging and helpful. ",5,2019,02,12
133,Just Perfect!!,"Rooms were comfortable and clean! All high end products through the room and hotel, all staff were warm and welcoming. I stayed for business purposes in which the hotel was conveniently located near High Street Kensington tube station which is easy to navigate and easy to pick up connecting trains.",5,2019,02,10
133,Great facility. Awesome hospitality,"Great facility. Awesome hospitality.

The location is great. Close to all the action, but also a bit remote with lots of things around.

The rooms are very nice and housekeeping is intense.

Very convenient also in terms of transportation.",5,2019,02,10
133,Timeless and classy hotel,"Comfortable, clean and some of the friendliest staff I‚Äôve encountered in hotels (coming from an ex hotel manager!). Wonderful selection for breakfast.
In a fabulous location.

133,Dr. Almoqbel,thanks. comfortable accommodation & great location close the gardens and tourist places. next the metro station and buses stopes the hotels is classic and has great meeting rooms and banquet hall >be sure your moor has a garden view,5,2019,02,09
133,Noisy rooms towards Kensington High Street,"Arrived late to the hotel. Got room 724 (7th floor towards Kensington High Street). Went straight to bed and tried to sleep. Thought the window was open as the noise from the street was soo loud. Got a hotel technician come to the room. We could both conclude that the window was closed, but the window/building lacked sufficient isolation. Tried to sleep again. Impossible. At 2 am I went down to the reception and got a new quiet room (towards Hyde Park). Fall asleep at 3 am. Puh!

In the morning I had a serious talk with the hotel manager, Nathalie.

I don‚Äôt believe this is the first time a customer complains about a room towards Kensington High Street at this hotel. Beeing a five star hotel with the rate they charge this is completely unacceptable! I have not received any compensation and today‚Äôs working day has been spoiled.",1,2019,02,07
133,Best Hotel around Kensington,"Booked a few days at the Royal Garden Hotel over the internet so was not sure what to expect. All my fears disappeared, just entering the lobby you are impressed. We had booked a Queens room overlooking the high street
but was offered an upgrade for a few pounds as we wanted a view of the Kensington gardens. The receptionist was very polite as expected and explained where everything was plus escorted my partner and myself to our room instead take the lift to your room. The room 440 overlooked the gardens we wanted also a view of Kensington palace wow.  The room was fantastic very big with settee, large window big kings bed. Normal tea coffee facilities, 
Big TV, fridge, large sliding wardrobe with plenty of hangers, safe.  Very large bathroom, separated shower.
Complementary newspapers,  Room very clean, hotel very good housekeeping everywhere.
Breakfast was to die for you name it they made it for you, plus a very good buffet starter.  All staff was a credit to the hotel.  The hotel being on the high street was excellent for all shops, restaurants if you wanted to eat out.
We were dissapointed we had to leave and return home.  Taxi to Kings cross from the hotel about ¬£20.
Their was lots of interesting buildings around the hotel in a mile radius.  Underground tube about  3 minutes walk from hotel. Can not speak highly enough 5 stars.  

",5,2019,02,07
133,6 night stay,"Beautiful hotel, staff was friendly and attentive.  Rooms clean.  Location, phenomenal !
When you eat breakfast ( free breakfast for one person per room) you have a beautiful view of Kensington Park.  Weekend breakfast buffet was wonderful with home made omelets, waffles etc. 
The room was very small, there was a closet, but if you wanted to store folded clothing, there was  only one drawer in the desk to use., no place to put your suitcases so we lined them up by the door and they were always ""in the way"".  My husband and I had to take turns getting dressed as"" floor room"" was so small. .  
Bathroom washcloths were scarce, if you got them delivered one day, you did not get any the next day.  I even went out  to the laundry cart (in the hall ) to get some and there were none to be found.   Mattress was only barely acceptable.
In the elevators there is a sign that tells you the option to upgrade your room, one person in our group did that at a price of 40pounds extra per night, and they were happy with that upgrade.",3,2019,02,06
133,One night stay at the Royal Garden Hotel,"This hotel is excellent in every way. We booked direct for one night and were treated like returning guests. In addition to complimentary this and that we were upgraded to a top floor room overlooking Kensington Palace.
The Room, Service, Dinner and Breakfast were all first rate. All of the staff seemed to have a sixth sense as to when to ask if we needed anything - they were never continually in your face. K.R. 04/02/2019",5,2019,02,04
133,nIce place in the Center of London,"There are few places in London with affordable price, excellent service and prime location. This hotel is one of a few. Located near Royal Parks, Albert Hall and Harrods it affords everything in a near distance that a tourist could wish.",5,2019,02,02
133,Perfect service in a perfect place,"From the moment of arrival, through the 2-night stay to the time for departure,. all the staff were very helpful and courteous, the rooms were lovely and the dining and bar experiences top-rate. Highly recommended.",5,2019,02,02
133,Business conference ,"3 nights at this excellent hotel. Very comfortable rooms, excellent restaurant food and super business facilities. Ideally located near to Hyde Park for lovely walks. Thoroughly recommended. The hotel fitness centre is good but when busy seems tight for space. ",5,2019,02,01
133,Conference Stay,this hotel is in a great location. i was look after by great staff.  There is a good gym but it is busy with non-resident members.  The room is smalll but well- appointed and very clean.  Breakfast was excellent.,5,2019,02,01
133,Perfect spot in London,"Very good location in London: whether you are traveling for leisure or business, this is a great place to stay: very well communicated transport wise, lots of restaurants and shops at your doorstep and great quality in the hotel.  ",4,2019,02,01
133,The best service and the nicest london hotel,"I have stayed at the royal garden hotel on many trips to london. The rooms are spacious and the food is delicious. The staff from the reception, to the concierge to house keeping are the most professional and accommodating team I‚Äôve seen in london. For some reason my WiFi wasn‚Äôt working on my apple phone and Sergio (I think that was his name, he‚Äôs otherwise known as the IT guru) fixed it so that it worked perfectly. The double Stephan team at the concierge desk were just so kind and helpful. I recommend this hotel so highly, especially if you want to be treated en par with the royalty who live next door :-)",5,2019,02,01
133,Lovely stay ,"Great spacious room, with wonderful view of Kensington Gardens and London Skyline.
Great bar in hotel and breakfast very good. 
Walkkng distance from lots of restaurants and bars. Found a great little piano bar very close. People gathered round piano singing and others dancing. ",5,2019,01,31
133,Great Hotel,"The hotel had excellent service and large comfortable rooms in a fantastic location on the edge of Hyde Park. The size of the rooms meant that our children 8 and 11 yrs  were able to sleep in our room on a sofa bed, this meant we did not have to get an extra room - in my experience this size of room is not usual in London. My husband and son also loved the complimentary scooters , they toured the park on them! The area has  plenty of museums, shopping and dining within an easy walk. ",5,2019,01,31
133,No fuss luxury in a warm environment,"If you are looking for perfect service in a functional but warm environment, look no further. I have been coming to the Royal Garden Hotel for many years and think it offers the best value for money in a central London location. Its modern interiors work because they have been designed with the guests using them in mind. Combined with the impeccable service and a very nice personalising programme if one books directly, I always hate to leave the place again. However, do not expect a romantic Laura-Ashley style place, it is a modernist building after all. Also the restaurants can be highly recommended. The Min Jiang on the 10th floor is one of the best Chinese restaurants I know and the Park Terrace on the ground floor serves very nice afternoon tea and is also perfect for lunch and dinner with a view into Kensington Gardens.",5,2019,01,30
133,"Fabulous location, very clean very comfortable room,  great staff. Thank you Katia and Anna for making our stay perfect!","The location is perfect. I lived in London for thirty years and only left 7 months ago to live in New York, so I know my city really well. This is a far better location than in the very centre of London which is noisy and crammed with people. Kensington is still central but feels more like a city neighbourhood. You have the gorgeous Kensington Palace Gardens right behind the hotel and you are only a 30 minute walk in one direction to Notting Hill and Portobello Market, and a 30 minute walk in the other direction to Natural History Museum and the wonderful V&A Museum. A walk around the back streets of this area will reward you will cobble stone mews and Georgian, Edwardian and Victorian architecture. You are also a short walk from the Royal Albert Hall and the gilded Prince Albert Memorial. There are lots of shops and restaurants and bars.  The tube train for High Street Kensington is a 5 minute walk from the hotel and there are lots of buses and taxis. We had a large room at the back of the hotel. It was a beautiful room with wood panelling, huge picture window, large and very comfortable bed. The bathroom had separate shower and deep bathtub and bathrobes. Everything was very clean and the room was quiet as there aren‚Äôt any roads at the back of the hotel, just the park. Free newspaper delivered to the room each morning, hairdryer, a large safe which easily held my SLR camera as well as everything else. They will bring an iron and ironing board to your room on request. A flatscreen TV, free wi-fi, room service menus etc. The staff are fabulous. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. It‚Äôs impressive because this is a large hotel. Katia and Anna on the front desk were great and really helped us. You also have the Ivy Kensington restaurant about 15 doors from the hotel opposite the tube station, that‚Äôs a great place for dinner, the Chinese restaurant in the hotel is supposed to be one of the best in London. Definitely recommend this hotel. My husband was here on business, I came along to catch up with friends. Great for business and holiday.",5,2019,01,30
133,a weekend in London,"Great hotel: very handy location for many major London key sites, top performing services, high calibre people, overall quality.   Have stayed here many times, and shall do so again.  Good attention to detail",5,2019,01,30
133,Amazing Family Weekend at The Royal Garden,"Having completed our trip this weekend, I would highly recommend this hotel for truly exemplary service.

From the moment we checked in, until the moment we left the hotel, every single staff member we came into contact with, was outstanding.  I have never encountered such charming staff ‚Äì nothing was too much trouble for anyone and there was such thoughtful detail in the customer service and attention to detail, that we truly were overwhelmed.

On check-in my daughter was handed a little red backpack, filled with treats ‚Äì she was delighted.  The teepee addition to our room for her teddy bears to hang out in was utterly fabulous and when a staff member arrived holding a teddy bear for her, as well as chocolate truffles and a large bottle of water for myself and my Mother, we were just blown away.  The hotel also provided us with free movies for the weekend ‚Äì another delightful and unexpected touch that delighted my daughter in particular.

The egg chef at breakfast made a huge fuss of my daughter ‚Äì even asking me politely whether she could have ice-cream with her waffles for breakfast ‚Äì you can only imagine her delight!  I think she spoke to him personally every morning as a result!

Smaller but noteworthy details included everyone calling us by name ‚Äì Katie was always called by her name and I was always addressed as Mrs Cooper ‚Äì from the front desk, to concierge, to the restaurant and bar.  I commented in the bar how cheerful everyone in the hotel was ‚Äì utterly wonderful to see.

The room was spacious and well equipped and we were very impressed with the bathroom also and amenities provided.  It was charming to wake up also, to a view over the park every day.

Our room was fantastic, the hotel‚Äôs location is wonderful and we were hugely impressed with both the breakfast buffet and also dining in The Park Terrace on Friday evening ‚Äì fabulous food.  We went to Maggie Jones on Saturday evening as we had reservations already but it didn‚Äôt compare in either food or atmosphere to the evening we had in the hotel on Friday ‚Äì lesson learned, next time we will dine in every evening!

We were lucky with the weather and managed to get out to see both Kensington Palace, the Natural History Museum and finally Harrods on Sunday.

It really was such a wonderful weekend.  I have stayed all over the World, including many 5 star hotels in London (the Savoy, the Dorchester etc) ‚Äì never have I been so well looked after and in such a personal and professional manner.

The staff at the hotel played a huge part in ensuring we really did, have the best time we possibly could.  The hotel should be extremely proud of their team.  I can see why you are rated so highly for family stays in London and I will certainly return with my daughter, my husband and my son in due course.",5,2019,01,29
133,Disappointing,"I have stayed at the Royal Garden many times over the years, but have to say the last stay for six nights total (two trips of three nights) was disappointing. Aside from a mix up over the room I had booked which was eventually resolved but at great inconvenience, it feels like this hotel is so busy that unless you are deemed a VIP, you just don't matter. For example, at breakfast the waitress walked away WHILE I was talking to her, to assist an ''important'' looking family that had walked in. On another occasion, when we asked to be seated alongside one of the window tables instead of the busy central aisle, we were VERY grudgingly given the table. 
Most of the reception staff are lovely, but a few were unpleasant like it was an effort to assist this perceived ''lowly guest''.
On the positive side, the hotel location is excellent on Ken High Street, and having the adjacent park to walk in and relax in is a huge bonus. 
The rooms are nice, very clean, bed is very comfortable, however rooms are not same as advertised eg: some king rooms don't have a separate shower. Also have very little cupboard space. Depending on location, some rooms face into others so you have to keep curtains closed for privacy. Our one room had no filter curtains and the sun shone full blast into room, so had to keep the heavy block out curtains closed from early afternoon so was like being in a cave. Awful!
Breakfast is good (besides rude waitresses), with lots of choices.
Parking is outrageously expensive with no subsidy for hotel guests.
I really used to love this hotel but given the myriad of hotel options that London offers, in this price range, its unlikely I will be back.",3,2019,01,29
133,Gala Dinner,"A lovely hotel, well situated. The staff were very polite and helpful, the concierge even let my wife keep the slippers from the room. :-)  Drinks at the bar were comparable for London. As we attended a function we cannot comment on the restaurants. One minus was the car park (NCP), it was very expensive and the hotel does not have an agreement with them.Overall though, we had a lovely time.",4,2019,01,29
133,Perfect venue,"Stayed here again, always a joy.  Excellent welcome from the reception staff (good to see Alexandru again), Mai did a great job.  Room lovely, breakfast amazing (good to see Peter again) and Afternoon Tea was incredible.  Great selection of teas and plenty of sandwiches and cakes, no skimping on quantities.  Looking forward to next visit.",5,2019,01,28
133,Excellent,"An excellent venue who had thought of all of the necessary requirements for our clients. Quality of food, service and details were of the highest standard. Rooms were clean and comfortable. I would have no concerns about recommending the hotel.",5,2019,01,28
133,Business Stay,"Excellent location and very friendly, professional service. Very good breakfast and even an option to have it brought to your room at no extra cost. Room was very small though and on a long business trip, it was difficult to store luggage effectively and not enough room to have an ironing board out to iron your shirts.",5,2019,01,27
133,Excellent Stay,"Spent a week at the hotel for a conference. Really great staff, friendly and helpful. Room was comfortable. Food was excellent. Great location as well for getting out and about. Check in and Check out was really easy and quick. ",5,2019,01,27
133,Excellent ,We only stayed the one night but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Fantastic views across the park and over the city. Staff were incredibly helpful. Breakfast was excellent and we will definitely stay again.,5,2019,01,27
133,Egg Rip Off,"This hotel is not bad for London. The rooms are a decent size, modern and clean, and the staff are good. The reason I can‚Äôt recommend you go is simple. Royal Garden offered me a complementary room service breakfast - great idea as I had morning business meetings to attend. They give you a docket with no pricing structure or description of what you are ordering. So I decided I would have an extra egg - once I checked out and advised I had nothing extra to pay - I received an email stating that my extra egg incurred a ¬£5.50 charge ! Yep that‚Äôs right ¬£5.50 for an egg Please don‚Äôt get ripped off like me & stay somewhere else ",1,2019,01,27
133,Slightly underwhelmed,"We have stayed here before when attending events at the Royal Albert Hall, thought we had picked up a bargain this time but not, 25% off Queen Room like the one pictured - like the one we had last time? No -  got an ordinary standard room so no bargain offer booking direct with hotel, I do feel a little cheated, explained to hotel not what expected and....nothing. I could have booked similar double room at half the cost a few hundred yards down the road and will next time we go to London.",3,2019,01,25
133,Another excellent stay,"We have stayed here on several occasions when going to concerts at the Royal Albert Hall and have never been disappointed. By booking direct you are offered a reward such as a room upgrade, complimentary bottle of wine etc which is always very welcoming. In addition they frequently have a 'flash sale' which is always worth looking out for if you are on their mailing list. The food in the main restaurant is very good but this time we had our breakfast via room service and would recommend the express breakfast - a beverage, croissant and a pastry for ¬£9.50 and there is no tray charge, so excellent value.The rooms are all well equipped and have Penhaligon toiletries (Quercus). The main plus point however are the staff who we have found to be uniformly friendly and helpfulOur only problem is we have found the mattresses a bit on the firm side for our liking but that is a matter of personal taste. ",5,2019,01,24
133,perfect 10 day stay.,"Just a note of thanks to all at The Royal Garden for exceptional service on our recent stay with you.A special thank you to Youssara for our delightful room upgrade and to Valadimir and his team for his warm reception on arrival.
We have stayed at the Royal Garden several times before and it never dissapoints us.
These people are VERY good at what they do! And so make it impossible to consider staying anywhere else in London.
Looking forward to our next visit.

Kind regards.
Patrick & Lynda",5,2019,01,24
133,Overnight stay,"We had a single night in a garden suite and it was superb a very luxurious and decadent treat to ourselves 
The views were great overlooking the gardens at Kensington and the room was spacious with all the necessary items for a wonderful stay. Our only disappointment were the pillows that were too soft even with 3 but this is personal choice
Booking in swift and checking out also smooth. We had breakfast in the room which was delightful if a little too expensive but we wanted to treat ourselves. Ate a pre show meal in the restaurant which was nice
A real contender for one of our top 3 London hotels. We chose for the closeness to the Albert Hall which was a short walk. I think we will return soon ",5,2019,01,23
133,What a superb experience,"It can't  be very often when a reviewer runs out of superlatives. Simply everything about this hotel was superb. From the booking,  the reception, the fabulous cleanliness everywhere. The complimentary cocktail explained by its creator in the bar was delicious as was breakfast the following day. 
Did I mention the excellent location. 
Can't recommend it highly enough. ",5,2019,01,23
133,Just the same only better!,"I stayed here a couple of years ago and was interested to see if it had maintained its reputation. It's a Great location right next to Kensington Gardens. Friendly professional staff who go over and above to make ones stay comfortable and stress free. We had a lovely room on the 10th floor which overlooked the mews and the Palace and gardens. Great room service with huge portions, although quite expensive for what we had. Good tasty food. Bertie's bar doesn't open on Sunday evening but the terrace is ok for the last nightcap. First class breakfast with good quality produce. Only downside was the streaky bacon was really and I mean REALLY salty. Shame as the rest of the meal was spot on. Loved our stay we will be back soon.",5,2019,01,23
133,Best Staff There Is,"The location is incredible. We asked for a nice view when booking our rooms and they delivered! Our room had a view of the famous Hyde Park as well as the Kensington Palace! Breakfast menu was top notch and breakfast service was fast. However what made our stay so amazing was how professional the staff was. They truly went above and beyond! With anything we wanted to tour they would give their own personal expertise advice and after they would acquire the tickets or at least book it for us. They even went as far as buying our train tickets to the airport! Room service was very dilegent. We needed to leave the hotel at 6:00 in the morning so we asked room service to pack up a breakfast. We were woken up to the largest to go box I have ever seen! The bar is also nice and has an impressive cocktail menu. The rooms for a 5-star hotel aren‚Äôt anything to write at home about. Although the cleanliness was just fine, the actual style wasn‚Äôt as pretty as other 5-star hotels and even a couple of boutique hotels I have stayed at. The bathrooms at least are completely modern and not missing anything necessary. What makes me want to return again when I go back to London is how amazing the Staff was. To all all the Concierges whom I‚Äôve had the pleasure talking to: Andrei, Steve, Stephen and Mick, you gentlemen made my stay truly royal!",5,2019,01,23
133,"Wonderful, stylish and relaxed hotel","We have stayed here many times and it never fails to meet our expectations.  It is very stylish with extremely comfortable rooms, some overlooking Kensington Palace.  It couldn't be better sited for shopping, restaurants, public transport, walking in Kensington Gardens or Holland Park and within easy walking distance of many museums including V and A.  The staff are first rate and professional, and nothing is too much trouble.  An extremely relaxing experience.",5,2019,01,23
133,Review,Great location. Has car park but very tight to negotiate entry. Comfortable room. Friendly staff.Park Terrace - great meal. Handy bus route. Close to underground. Queen rooms are a bit small. Good cocktails.,4,2019,01,22
133,1 night stay,Fantastic experience from FOH team to room standards.My daughters birthday and they made her feel very special.Fantastic service throughout the hotel.Also great food in the Ming Yin restaurant with fantastic views over the park,5,2019,01,22
133,Bad bedrooms fopr central London and price you pay,"The location is great and the hotel looks good. view from top floor is amazing but when it comes to the bedroom, then it is not good given the price you pay and the hotel aimed standards - bathtub is old fashioned, no decent shampoo/bath gel (actually 1 mixing both...), small rooms...better value around with hotel chains.",1,2019,01,20
133,Perfect,"We stayed at The Royal Garden for the first time whilst visiting London to see Cirque de Soleil at The Royal Albert Hall. The hotel is perfectly located for this, ¬£5 taxi ride from the front of the hotel. The staff in the hotel are brilliant, nothing was too much trouble. Our room was perfect, over looking the gardens and London. We had breakfast in our room, this was brought on a trolley which doubled up as a table, we sat and ate with a fantastic view. Unfortunately we dined at the Royal Albert Hall so didn‚Äôt try the hotel restaurant, we look forward to returning to try this. Our stay was perfect, well done Royal Garden.",5,2019,01,20
133,The place to stay in Kensington,This is a lovely venue next to Kensington Gardens. It definitely deserves a 5 * rating. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. The rooms are well equipped and comfortable and breakfast is excellent.,5,2019,01,19
133,Narrow parking at Royal Garden Hotel,"We booked parking here as we were going to the Royal Albert Hall for a show.
The price for 6 hours was ¬£15.95 which we thought was reasonable.

However, if you have a long car, like ourselves a Ford S Max, it is a nightmare to access this and the entrance is a a corkscrew descent with very very little room to turn. If you have a mini or similar then you will be OK, we however, ended up with scratches on the side of our car.
Also be aware that there are two levels and we did not notice this, so it took some time to find the car.
Otherwise, with the exception of the above it was good value and location.",5,2019,01,19
133,Wonderful hotel,"From the minute I walked in to the minute I left I felt like it offered a five star service. The staff were friendly, helpful and incredibly courteous.The room was lovely, spacious and comfortable I would recommend and definitely come back ",5,2019,01,19
133,Excellent 5 Star Hotel,"We would rate this hotel as the best hotel we have stayed in London.
Very friendly service from all the staff and a superb room extremely well appointed.
Good location in Kensington right next to the park and a few minutes walk to the tube and on Kensington High Street.",5,2019,01,18
133,Awful,So this is a five star hotel in Central London? The room was cupboard size.  When we entered it was freezing cold.  We ran the temperature control on maximum all night and it was still cold in the morning.  The room service menu had food stains.  Nothing like what we expected- very disappointing.,1,2019,01,18
133,Royal Tea for birthday treat,"A really lovely treat following a visit to Kensington Palace. 

Champagne followed by strawberries in balsamic and piles of delicious sandwiches with bread of my choice;  as many scones as you can eat (not many !) with sultanas or cinnamon with thick cream and variety of jams.  Leave room for lots of little cakes (not too sweet and surprisingly light given their look).  All washed down with as much tea as you can drink:  a large variety from Earl Grey to highly fragrant fruit tea, as well as gun metal and flower teas.  I was very boring being very thirsty and settled for English Breakfast !

The service was exemplary with explanations of everything as well as charm. The only thing we weren't offered more of was the champagne !",5,2019,01,17
133,Love this hotel!!,"Stayed there before and will come back again. Friendly and worm staff. Rommy and cosy bedrooms. Exceptional!! Home away from home. Highly recommended. Close to the tube, whole food market, shopping, restaurants.",5,2019,01,17
133,Wonderful hotel,Excellent stay . Staff were all very kind and considerate.quality of food was very good . Early check in which was fantastic . Staff just seem to go the extra mile for guests. Complimentary bottle of wine was a very nice touch,5,2019,01,17
133,Just great ,"Really nice hotel in a fantastic location. Room was good and bed very comfortable. I loved the pillows. 
Room overlooked Kensington Palace which is beautiful. I recommend the tour of the palace and the princess Diana exhibition. 

Staff at the hotel were great and super friendly and 5 star stay and treatment all the way. 
If you have a Mercedes saloon or bigger, I suggest paying a bit extra and valet park. 
Going down to that NCP car park can only be described as the tunnel of doom. It felt like forever and scratched my alloys a few times. Coming back up was not so bad however. 
Overall a great stay, 15 minute Uber from the west end and will definitely be staying there again. 
Breakfast also great. ",5,2019,01,15
133,Love the comforts of the Royal Garden,"Almost always stay here when I'm in London. The staff is so warm, welcoming, and attentive to your needs. From the check in staff who escort you to your room upon arrival, to the concierge who will help you secure dinner reservations for a large group at the last minute. They go above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need. Should also mention that I often travel alone and I feel safe and secure at this property. Would highly recommend it.",5,2019,01,15
133,Mr & Mrs,"We went ten days before Christmas for two nights. We have visited London a lot but without doubt this was the best hotel we have stayed. All the staff were excellent & very friendly, nothing was too much trouble. Our booking included breakfast which was one of the best we have had. On the Sunday morning it was a buffet & the chef was there to cook your eggs to your exact preference. On the Monday morning there was still the continental buffet but the Cooked part of the breakfast was waiter/waitress service. In the reception there was a big basket of mince pies which were among some of the best I have tasted other than the ones my wife makes of course!!! We had a free cocktail also which we had in Bertie‚Äôs bar, you could have one from the menu although the bar manager was more than willing to tailor one to your taste. To get there by bus from Kings Cross catch the number thirty to Marble Arch & then from there number twenty three which goes right by the hotel. Thanks once again for an enjoyable stay & we will be definitely be back in the future. Hope this is helpful to potential future guests.",5,2019,01,15
133,Weekend in london,Lovely room with an amazing view of the park. Only bad thing was the bed wasnt as comfortable as we would like. The hotel itself is in a great location with pletty of shops as well as being very close to the underground. Friendly and welcoming staff ,4,2019,01,15
133,Another Excellent Stay,"I love this Hotel!  I've stayed here before and will stay here again, it's not the cheapest around but the service from staff and it's location make up for the extra few pounds.

I made a mess up with my original booking but the Hotel were happy to rectify this and shortly before my stay I received a telephone call to confirm my arrangements.  I prebooked the NCP car park underneath the hotel which is very convenient and my greeting when booking in was so friendly (thank you Neomie!) and she was then kind enough to show me to my room. 

I didn't eat dinner in the hotel this stay but did try out a cocktail in the bar which was very nice and again all bar staff were friendly and helpful.

The room (8th floor) overlooked the street, was quiet and had all I needed for a very comfortable one night stay.  Big fluffy towels, a comfortable bed and plenty of storage space.

I ordered the quick breakfast which was delivered to my room in the morning and, I think, it is a bargain at ¬£9.50.  Lovely hot coffee, orange juice, a big croissant with a selection of jams and a Danish pastry all delivered with a friendly smile at my requested time.  The same ordered at the chain coffee shop across the road I'm sure would have been more expensive and without the joy of sitting in my lovely room.

It's so lovely to be able to take a walk into Kensington Gardens which is right next door and The Royal Albert Hall, where I went in the evening, is just a 10 minute walk away.

Highly recommended, I will stay here again!",5,2019,01,14
133,A Lillie disappointing,Went specifically to go to Berties bar this was closed for a week not advertised on website we really love this hotel but feel the service was not up to the usual standard staff seemed a little uninterested in us in general,3,2019,01,13
133,Royal Garden,Excellent.  Have stayed before and it has always been good.  Location is perfect for our needs and the quality of rooms and service is what you would expect from a hotel of this prestige and price. We will stay again for a special occasion.,5,2019,01,10
133,"Great location, great value ","I‚Äôd stayed at the Royal Garden on my first trip to London at age 18. Although I‚Äôve been back to the city a few times since then, I hadn‚Äôt needed a hotel until my recent visit in December. It was very much as I remembered it (and it‚Äôs been quite a few years!) 

The lobby, hallways and rooms are kept spotless; everyone from the front desk staff to housekeeping, room service and the concierge is friendly, professional and helpful. The hotel‚Äôs location‚Äîliterally right in front of Kensington Palace‚Äîis very convenient and feels safe (which is important for a solo traveler). For the rate I paid, I was extremely satisfied. ",5,2019,01,09
133,Not recommended,"The rooms were not cleaned properly always dusty and the towels were always replaced with dirty ones, asked to change the pillows to harder one what I always got a softer ones and it is always noisy you can hear the housekeepers in the early morning chatting and slamming the doors. The location though is very convenient love the area but never again staying in this hotel ",2,2019,01,07
133,Weekend break.,Lovely weekend away at the Royal Garden Hotel. Great views of Kensington Gardens and it‚Äôs also in walking distance. There are also many restaurants nearby. The staff are very hospitable and showed us to our room which is a nice touch.,4,2019,01,06

We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2019,01,05
133,Modern hotel to a preferential location!,"The hotel is on the Hyde Park, that makes it location very special! It is also close about 5minutes walk to High Street Kensigton station. Furthemore, the area is a quiet nice area, away from crowds in the centre of London. The room has enough space for our family, the only thing missing was some more storage space. With large windows, it was luminous and with nice view. The personnel was very helpful and assist us to any request. The food was very delicious at the Min Jiang restaurant! ",5,2019,01,04
133,NEW YEAR STAY,"Standard rooms are very small with just a small standard double bed, view from some rooms is poor, however 10th floor restaurant has good view over London. Great position for Royal Albert Hall, otherwise 25 pounds for taxi to theatre. Overall not a bad stay.",4,2019,01,04

133,"Brilliant, once in a lifetime experience",The accommodation in this hotel was of the highest quality and located centrally to all the sites.  The parks and Kessington palace nearby was such added bonus. We felt the hotel was placed in the middle of country but actually we are in the busiest city in the world. Will definitely be back. ,5,2019,01,03

133,Mr C Comer,"I am a Singaporean resident, my most recent stay at the RG was in December 2018 between Boxing Day and NY Eve. It was especially memorable as it was Christmas and for a change it was a non business visit and I was accompanied by my wife. The superb reservations team headed up by Tim had taken the nature of my trip into account and the fact that it was not the usual business visit but one to relax and enjoy, they went out of their way to welcome us during a very very busy Christmas period which made our stay that extra bit special, no request was too much. Thanks to all involved. See you in a few weeks.

133,"Fantastic location, will definitely stay again!","What a great location! Literally right next door to Kensington Palace, and on the Kensington High Street for all the great shops within 5-10 min walk! Breakfast was great (impressed that they serve Asian food like congee and bak kut teh! but it is owned by a Malaysian owner, I think). We arrived very early (about 9am) and they let us check in, which is not common when you normally arrive at hotels! The room was clean and spacious. We'll definitely stay here again!",5,2019,01,03

133,Lovely Hotel - Great Location,"Beautiful clean well located hotel. The staff were friendly and attentive. Our room was on the 6th floor over looking the High Street and not Kensington Palace, however the view was a fantastic City scape. The breakfast was as good as it gets, good quality and so much choice - some cooked to order if required. The `Egg Chef` was a joy, making fresh egg dishes including waffles, omelettes etc. obviously happy in his work. The best thing for my partner was the opportunity to have a `Bloody Mary` at breakfast! The breakfast room does overlook the park, which is also close to Hyde Park 
Lots of eateries, bars and a tube station on the door step.",5,2019,01,02
133,An absolute pleasure,"I highly recommend the hotel with exceptional attention to detail in all departments.The hotel enjoys an excellent position adjacent to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park with our garden room having wonderful views of London.A warm welcome is always assured with excellent, helpful staff in all departments.The Park Terrace menu both breakfast and dinner compliment the experience of staying in this hotel with high standards but not stuffy.",5,2019,01,02

133,Best for any repeat Visitor to London,"Ideally located on Kensington High Street, beside Kensington Gardens and the palace. Whilst i would not describe this as an ideal destination hotel for a first time visitor to London, its the perfect place to stay for those who are familiar with Londons restaurants, bars, parks and shopping. The staff , many of whom look tenured and are familiar from visits over the years are all very good. The rooms overlooking the park ( Parkview) are worth the premium, the room service food quality is outstanding.",5,2018,12,27
133,Enjoy London with Royal Gardens,i do recommend Royal Gardens for my Friends.... relay it is in the hart of London we reach all the pleases in smooth and no time ...we enjoy our 6 days so much ... and we visit almost the Historical places... diffidently we will be back        ,5,2018,12,27

133,Bed was not comfortable ,I enjoyed my stay here. The staff is lovely and the 24 hr room service is convenient especially when you‚Äôre jet lagged. The toiletries are nice although there wasn‚Äôt any hair conditioner. The bed was not comfortable at all though. The pillows are quite thin so I would need all four to get adjusted. ,4,2018,12,25
133,üëçüèº,"I really enjoyed my stay, loved the place, the staff were amazing the food was really good and the service was excellent. I recommend the hotel for families as well, Christmas atmosphere was nice. Thank you for the good service.",5,2018,12,24
133,Truly exceptional !,"Absolutely love this hotel.  Staff are very welcoming and nothing is too much trouble.  Went into Bertie's Bar and the staff remembered us from the previous year and even remembered our drinks, they are very friendly and attentive.  Also ate at the Terrace 
Restaurant and the Min Ying on the 10th floor.  Cannot fault any of the service, food or staff in any area of this hotel.  Absolutely fantastic stay.  Thank you.",5,2018,12,23
133,The Hotel has a lovely ambience!,The staff are not only warm and welcoming but they show an interest in knowing who you are and where you are from and they are willing to share their own stories too.The hotel is spacious and light and is set in a great location.  Our room looked onto the Royal Palace which was a fantastic view!,5,2018,12,23
133,Lovely and lush hotel. Would definitely recommend this one just wish it was more affordable price wise!,"I treated myself to this lovely hotel in Kensington for a night only. And it was pricey even though breakfast was included. Unfortunately I missed the Black Friday deal! The gym within the complex is good too, had a good workout there. 

Service was great from when I arrived to reception and a lady was nice enough to walk me to my room to make sure everything was all okay. 

I ordered room service in the evening and I had omelette with chips and it was tasty. Very quick too when my meal arrived. 

I had breakfast in bed on the 22/12/18 as it was my 40th birthday after all! Very minor problem that my eggs were not runny as I had requested but nevertheless I can‚Äôt complain too much as I couldn‚Äôt really fault this hotel.
 
The WiFi is also good too within the hotel. 

I invited my friend to the hotel to get lunch and we had the two and three course meals and I have to say all dishes were lovely and tasty. 

I‚Äôm definitely coming to this hotel again as the location is perfect with shops, restaurants literally on the doorstep.

I hope if they reduce the room rates then myself and my friends can afford to stay here in the future.",5,2018,12,23
133,A really great place to enjoy London.,"We have stayed here before, the rooms are always clean, well appointed and comfortable. Great view of the park, within walking distance of so many attractions. A really excellent base for visiting London. ",5,2018,12,22
133,avoid Bertie's bar,"Reception on arrival and departure very good ,The staff in Berti's bar had no social skills and would be more suited to a job as a doorman at a night club ,I could go on but what's the point . Food in the terrace retaurant was good and the service was fine .",4,2018,12,21
133,Totally Outstanding,"
We have just returned home from our celebration stay at the Royal Garden Hotel.
I cannot speak too highly about the overall service which can only be described as ‚Äúoutstanding‚Äù.
Absolutely every department must be congratulated on their first class customer service.
The communication from all involved in organising our stay was perfect and was executed faultlessly.
Our rooms were excellent, with many 5 star touches, ours was upgraded, Thankyou.
The staff during our stay were superb, from check in, housekeeping, bar service, all restaurant staff but in particular the staff in the Park Terrace who attended to us superbly.
I can only remember one name, Giusy, who really made us welcome but all staff were equally superb.
We also dined in Min Jiang restaurant which was a truly memorable experience.
My wife had a wonderful birthday.
We will obviously recommend your hotel at every opportunity.
Once again thank you all.
Best Regards

133,Christmas weekend stay,"We booked the Royal Garden Hotel for location for a show at Royal Albert Hall & lucky to get a travel zoo deal.
The location was fabulous for the Christmas lights, Hyde Park (Winter Wonderland) & the Royal Albert Hall plus of course Kensington Shops.
This was a true 5 star hotel, the staff were all excellent & couldn't be more attentive, we had a queen room (705) on 7th floor overlooking Kensington Garden that was perfect & had everything you could need for a weekend break (robes, tea/coffee, safe, mini bar (free water), ac, quality toiletries etc).
We got cocktail vouchers included & had a lovely time in Bertie's Bar watching everyone coming & going it was very relaxed & chilled atmosphere.
We came back to turn down service & a note to advise breakfast times can be busy between 9.30 & 11.00 on Sundays but took a chance & was pleasantly surprised how civilised, clean & efficient the staff were, food was fresh & perfectly cooked, it had every thing could wish for with egg station & toast & tea/coffee brought to your table (¬£25 pp but was included in our deal).
We had late check out (1pm) which meant we could have a nice stroll in Hyde park to walk of breakfast.
We pre booked the NCP car park under the hotel ¬£40 for 24hrs but just meant it was safe & convenient for us, it was very narrow to go down the ramp in SUV but no worries once down.
Just a little recommendation for a lovely little Italian restaurant outside the hotel opposite (Spaghetti House).

133,"Nice hotel, friendly stuff, excellent location","Noisy customers at weekends, though. Most of the staff are very friendly and managers very good at solving whatever issues may arise. Also most of the staff are long term, so if you are a frequent guest they tend to remember you and the general service is outstanding. Something could be done about the noise room doors make when closing",4,2018,12,18
133,Good service,"Good service, only have to ask staff once and they remembered,  and everything went well including the car parking no waste of time in our stay. Breakfast is 25 a head. My 4 yr old had free breakfast. Will go again.",5,2018,12,18

Easy to get cabs and fabulous location. Looking forward to coming back!,5,2018,12,16
133,Amazing ,We‚Äôve stayed here many a time in the past . This hotel has to be one of the best run in London.

Well done Royal garden hotel ,5,2018,12,16

133,Wonderful Royal Garden Hotel,"As always we had a wonderful stay. The staff are excellent- nothing is too much trouble, the food is very good and everywhere is spotlessly clean.

133,Superb venue - they go the extra mile,This hotel is amazing. Great location. More importantly the staff make you feel special nothing is too much trouble.

133,Great location - faultless service,"Excellent service from the moment I booked the room. Not sure if it was because I booked direct with the hotel, but I got a courtesy call a couple of days before I was due to travel to confirm the time I wanted to check in, asking me if we were doing anything special during our stay and offering a complimentary gift (wine or fruit in the room, or complimentary breakfast).

The efficient and friendly service continued as soon as we arrive, with every member of staff. The complimentary gift came with a card hoping that we enjoyed the tennis (an event at the Royal Albert Hall that we came up to London for) - nice touch. Another nice touch was the turn down service, where they also switched the lights to a soft glow and the radio to a soft music station - very welcoming!

The room itself was not huge, but was well appointed, clean and comfortable, with all the facilities you could ask for. Wide selection in the breakfast buffet, of good quality, although I found the full English selection a bit on the dry side. 

Location was excellent, right on the High Street within walking distance of the Royal Albert Hall, and all the shops & restaurants around Kensington. But for all that, it‚Äôs the service that would bring us back to this hotel - recommended.",5,2018,12,10
133,Wonderful experience,From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome in this lovely hotel.  Room was large and very clean.  Breakfast was very good  and had a good selection encompassing all tastes.

133,Overall a good experience,"However, sometimes the staff at the Park Terrace (the restaurant) were not as accommodating with children as I would have hoped.

Our key contact Bettina Sandner has always done a brilliant job of liaising between ourselves and the hotel staff, pitching in with quick solutions when we've faced challenged and being highly organised and lovely to deal with. The food has been wonderful with a creative and tasty menu - thank you chef - and serving and bar staff and other management really pleasant. We also used the hotel's AV service this time and had a great experience with this too. For this reason the events have gone really smoothly on the night and we've had great feedback from guests, without exception.",5,2018,12,08
133,More then wonderful,It was our first time in London and my friend booked this hotel as a surprise for my family and to be honest with you I was very impressed by the level of hospitality provided by staff. Room was a bit small for a family of 4 but had the most outstanding view. Concierge and reception team were outstanding. Breakfast in Park Terrace was beyond expectations. Breakfast manager Valva was so accommodating to my little boy as she kept checking on us if we are comfortable and looked after through out all our time while we were having breakfast and then we come back for a cup of tea later she advised us where to go for a walk and recommended to visit Science museum which was a perfect place for my naughty little ones!

133,Afternoon Tea,"My friend and I met here for a catch up and to try their afternoon tea. I was quite late due to the traffic and the staff were very helpful and understanding about it. We started with a nice glass of champagne and strawberries with balsamic vinegar. The sandwiches were quite nice and we were asked if we would like some more, which we did. The scones were delicious, but the pastries weren‚Äôt up to the standard of lots of the other top London hotels. Some of the little slices of cake were very dry. And the rest weren‚Äôt very inspiring. We stayed where we were and had a couple of cocktails each which were very tasty. Overall it was quite a nice afternoon.",4,2018,11,29
133,Security issues,"Hotel security is low, no extra locks on the doors, anyone can take the elevators to any floor, room service came direclty after i‚Äôve checked in to the room which was bizarre and a friend of mine in another room said that the room service opened the room‚Äôs door on her after knocking without waiting for her response ",2,2018,11,29

133,Fantastic Hotel,"Recently visited the Royal Garden on Kensington High Street.
Hotel is ideally located on edge of Hyde Park and only a few minutes walk from Kensington Palace and Royal Albert Hall.
The hotel is one of the friendliest I've stayed at in visiting London - all staff - whatever their job are friendly and helpful and go out of their way to ensure your stay is thoroughly enjoyable.
Stay in a King Room which was very spacious, well equipped and with a large bathroom with walk in shower. Our room actually overlooked the High Street but the soundproofing is so good you hear no noise from the busy road outside
Got a great deal on the room which made it great value for money 
Would definitely return here again on my next trip to London",5,2018,11,28
133,Superb stay in every way ,"We have just returned from a one night stay at this hotel and was more than pleasantly surprised! Being a 5 star hotel we expected it to be of a certain standard... and it delivered, but the big surprise came from the staff. Every single member of staff we came into contact with was friendly, helpful and incredibly nice. As seasoned travellers we have seen the good, bad and ugly and so the standard of customer service was noticeably high. 

A special mention needs to go out to Alejandro who greets every guest as they enter and leave the hotel. His welcome is a great introduction to the rest of the team and he does this without being OTT or annoying. Our server at breakfast was a delight and David the Concierge was also great. 

The whole stay was fabulous and definitely made all the better by the staff. We would recommend the hotel without hesitation and look forward to returning again. ",5,2018,11,28

Very convenient location a few blocks from High Street Kensington tube station & bus stop in front, to travel quickly to any London destination.  Very large Whole Foods 1 block away.  Many restaurants to walk to or short tube ride away.  We would definitely stay here again.       ",5,2018,11,28

133,Thanksgiving in London,"I am not happy with my stay,room was 22 sqmeters but designed much worse then smaller rooms ,very difficult to place the luggage and move in the room, room and the hotel in general was not clean enough, probably they are saving workforce, I booked through Booking.com . and my feeling is that the hotel acts different to customers booking direct with the hotel. so I am not satisfied at all.",3,2018,11,27
133,Another good year,"15th annual pilgrimage to London in late November and always at the RGH, the hotel never fails us, the staff are friendly and helpful and the hotel is always immaculately presented.  A great location on the edge of Kengsington High Street with easy bus or tube access in to the West End",4,2018,11,27
133,Great location!,"The location is wonderful- very well located with regards to shops and restaurants. The staff is generally friendly and the rooms are nice. It is pricey though! I will definitely stay again, the location is too good to pass, as are the freshly made waffles at breakfast.",5,2018,11,26
133,Very pleasant stay,"We stayed here for two nights whilst we had to be in London and it was all very good. The hotel called the evening before we arrived to see if there was anything extra they could arrange for us and whether there was anything special we needed. The staff were friendly yet professional, the room was very comfortable and nicely presented and the bathroom was a good size. The buffet breakfast was good, although the cooked English breakfast was slightly disappointing. I would stay here again.",5,2018,11,26

133,"Royal Garden, Kensington.","A well appointed hotel, with all the amenities any business guest, family or travels could require. Comfortable rooms, with good facilities. Rooms are quiet, with good heating/ventilation. Good selection of bars, and dining rooms for those who don't want to venture back out at the end of the day. Parking is available at a cost, but well positioned for the Underground, and buses. Taxi's available from the front door.  ",5,2018,11,26
133,Good,"Good hotel , locstional and functional. Could do with some consistency in turn down service.  Airport car is booked via consierge service and was informed that it was gbp85 . Cheapest car is a Mercedes . So was surprised that reception charged another gbp5 service fee . ",4,2018,11,25

133,Perfect,"Superb hotel in a perfect location. Hotel staff from checkin to departure were absolutely impeccable with their service. Rooms were spotlessly clean with large comfy beds.

133,Great central London hotel,"Clean, comfortable, large rooms. Very friendly and efficient staff. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel. Only slight weakness is that the breakfast could be slightly nicer quality and the Min Jiang restaurant is quite expensive for what it is.",5,2018,11,21
133,What a wonderful place,"Very accommodating and friendly staff. They went the extra mile for us without us even asking. Hope to return again soon. We had the executive suit for 4 of us. The main bed is absolutely massive, could fit everyone on the bed. The sofa bed is a double. I didn't realise this so we had asked for an additional bed. Plenty of space.",5,2018,11,20
133,Great hotel and location,"Although expensive we have a lovely week at the Royal Garden Hotel. The staff were second to none and the location was perfect, we would definitely stay here again. We had an executive room for 2 adults and 2 children (9,12) and it was a little small.",5,2018,11,20
133,Business at Imperial,Stayed two nights at the Royal Garden for some work I had at Imperial College.  The hotel was in a great location at the corner of the park and was a short walk to the college.  Was easy to find with a tube stop near by and plenty of places to pick to eat.,5,2018,11,20
133,Good hotel,"Great location and good service. Like many 5star in London, they still can learn from the service in say the Waldorf Astoria in New York or the Amstel in Amsterdam. Apart from that, for London they still have best value for money when it comes to the more luxurious hotels",4,2018,11,18
133,Royal Dining at Royal Garden Hotel,"Its a top business class hotel in high street Kensington, opposite Milestone Hotel and just next to both Hide Park and Royal Kensington Palace. They have couple of restaurants but I experienced the main at the ground floor as well as the Chines restaurant. Very nice view towards Hide Park. Excellent food beverages. Staff is so professional with great level of demeanour and very much helpful.",5,2018,11,17
133,All hotels should be run like this one,"8 years since I stayed here and on checking in I was welcomed back, it was the hotel who told me the length since I had last stayed ! I used to stay here more regularly and I'm pleased to say its still a truly great hotel, staff are professional but not obsequious and the whole property is classy. Great location etc etc 
Can't say anymore as its just a fab proper experience of a central city hotel.",5,2018,11,17
133,The only hotel to stay in London.,"If you book direct, they will treat you like a VIP and make note of the things you like. For example a bottle of Red wine or fruit bowl in your room, complimentary.Also, i had mentioned that some herbal teas would be nice and on my last visit, a selection of teas was left in my ( upgraded) room. very much appreciated.",5,2018,11,16
133,Great Hotel,"Great hotel and location, Clean, great hospitality and very good service. Friendly staff.but make sure to choose the bigger queen room or book the king size room. And better to have it not on the main road.  ",4,2018,11,15
133,Nice 4 day stay,"I was nicely surprised by the staff and hospitality skills. So polite and not intrusive - always there, but very discrete. And the room maintenance maid was fabulous - new linens every day (now I feel sorry for not leaving a tip!). ",5,2018,11,15
133,5 Star hotel,"Shown to our room by receptionist, lovely accommodation and nice bathroom with walk in shower. City view but very quiet. Large wall hung TV, free wifi, radio alarm clock with USB charger and comfortable seats. To the rear there are park view rooms available. Breakfast, although expensive (ie London prices!) was really good with continental or full English and I think had oriental options but could not of course understand this part of the menu written in ""symbols"" - breakfast room overlooks the park behind hotel. First class hotel. Convenient location 5 minutes walk from High Street Kensington.",5,2018,11,14
133,Strange Experience On Extension Request For A Night,"Dear Sir,
I am staying in the hotel now enjoying a good view overlooking Hyde Park.
Unfortunately I have a really bad experience over the reception counter because I change my returning plan and extend one more day with my son here, so I am requesting an extension night with the same room, they relied to me that all the rooms in the hotel are sold out! 
Suddenly I realised that I may tried to book it online and luckily I got the same Garden View Room by online booking, so I made it immediately!  Now I AM GOING TO PACK MY SUITCASE AND GET DOWN TO THE LOBBY AND CHECK IN AGAIN!
I am really extremely upset with this experience and services I never have throughout my traveling in London UK!!!   Very very disappointed and upset!!!",1,2018,11,14
133,AWESOME EXPERIENCE,All staff from the get go were very helpful and courteous. Ming is a delight for dinner. Best Peking Duck in London! !!! Chambermaid service was great and quick I asked for irin and board and was delivered in under 5 minutes. ,5,2018,11,12
133,Special Occasion stay,This hotel has a great location and as such is very good value. We booked a standard 'street view' room but still had a view towards Kensington Palace and Gardens.  The room was comfortable and appealing with a high standard of cleanliness throughout; excellent AC/climate control. During our 4 night stay we visited both Bertie's Bar and the Park Terrace Restaurant twice.  On each occasion the service was very friendly and attentive; the young lady who greeted us in the restaurant took great care of us and even organised a complimentary birthday cake for my mother's birthday. The quality of the food and prices make the restaurant a realistic dining option in the area.  We will definitely return to this hotel during future visits to London.,5,2018,11,12
133,Excellent. The room was just beautiful with a delighted view,Nothing more to say but encouraging you to persevere in good service an attention. Location fantastic and superb treatment form the personal. Me cans√© de escribir en ingl√©s as√≠ que se lo digo en espa√±ol. Mi experiencia en el hotel fue muy buena.,5,2018,11,12
133,"Location, location, location","Booked 6 rooms here for a weekend with colleagues to celebrate exam results.  Hotel contacted us before arrival to check details and put complimentary bottles of wine in each room.  Upon arrival we all got free cocktails too, had a great view and with the palace being your neighbours we had the pleasure of seeing Prince Harry and Meghan as well as Prince William and Catherine leave for the cenotaph on Sunday morning from the kerbside.",5,2018,11,12
133,Gasping for a fresh cuppa!,"We went as a birthday treat for afternoon tea.  We were part of a large group seated on a long table, unfortunately we only had one waiter so service did take a while.  What was very disappointing was that only one pot of tea was served throughout the whole time we were there, we were given hot water at the beginning to top the pots up which was fine.  However, there was a gap of about 30 minutes between the sandwiches and cake so a fresh pot of tea would have been appreciated but all that was brought out was more hot water so we only had stewed tea to wash our scones and cakes down!",3,2018,11,11
133,Just perfect,Finding a hotel in London can be a difficult and pricey challenge. This was my first stay at Royal Garden and it exceeded expectations on all levels. This is what a hotel should be - guest oriented service - friendly smiles altering. Comfortable rooms - thanks for the high floor with Kensington Garden views - tasty food in the restaurant and a great location. The hotel rewards guests for booking direct - lots of welcome touches. This was a great experience - to be repeated....,5,2018,11,11
133,A great place to stay,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Royal Garden.  Our room was great and had a good view of the Kensington Palace Gardens.  Staff was very friendly, warm, and helpful.  Two thumbs up!  Highly recommended and will definitely come again.",5,2018,11,10

133,Five star experience - old building,"I stay here on a regular basis, since i travel with work. Service is in top. The building is very 80 feel. I was granted free beverage upon arrival, i listed my preferred brand on the phone, I received a different type when i was there. That was a bit of a disappointment. I have maybe stayed 10-12 times at the hotel, and yet it seems every time that the front disk cannot see that i have been there before, which is odd. ",4,2018,11,09
133,Good value  great location staff brilliant  amazing hotel,The hotel  wonderfull position overlooking kensington  park next to the palace 10 mins from  the royal Albert hall luvly  restaurant staff  made us so welcome  even the cleaning  maids were very friendly and helpful  the  overal feeling   every one seemed to care ,5,2018,11,08
133,Royal Garden Hotel in London - comfortable top quality combined with personal and friendly service,Royal Garden Hotel - a welcoming hotel on Kensington High Street right between the charming residential Kensington and the beautiful and relaxing Kensington Garden and Hyde Park. The hotel is big enough to offer every kind of comfort and good food and small enough to serve their guests in a personal and friendly way. Several conveniant bus lines and the underground close to the hotel as well as nice shopping posibilities. Two outstanding restaurants in the hotel and many smaller high quality restaurants close by the hotel..,5,2018,11,07

133,Superb,"I visited this hotel for lunch time award ceremony, the function room and facilities like cloakroom were excellently managed by very polite staff.

133,5 Star Experience in Heart of South Kensington ,"Have just spent 8 days at the Royal Garden and love this hotel. The staff are second to none in London. Helpful, knowledgeable about area restaurants, tours, shopping, what‚Äôs on in London. Rooms are comfy with a large bathroom fully equipped with high end products - bonus is a fairly good hairdryer as well. In-house dining and Bertie‚Äôs Bar for nightcaps to unwind (highly recommend G&T‚Äôs). Situated behind Kensington Palace, Hyde Park, bus stop in front and a five minute walk to High Street Kensington tube...a great base to explore London. Can‚Äôt wait to go back in February 2019 ",5,2018,11,06

133,Royal treatment indeed,"Starting with the telephone call two days in a advance of my arrival to see how my stay might be enhanced, the attention to ensuring my stay was a good one was exceptional. The service and the full English breakfast were great but it‚Äôs the garden view that steals the show.",5,2018,11,05
133,75th birthday treat in a great hotel,"Stayed here for one night for a family visit to London to celebrate my dad's 75th birthday.Hotel is in a fantastic location - walking distance to shops, restaurants and tourist attractions including Kensington Palace and the Royal Albert Hall.Staff at the hotel were great - able to help with any enquiry and always willing to help.Rooms were of a good size for a short stay and had everything I needed. Only minor negative comment was that the duvet on the bed was very thin and I was verging on being cold during the night.Overall a fantastic family stay and my dad described his weekend as magical! ",5,2018,11,03
133,Enjoyed our 8 night stay!!,"We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel.  The location is unbeatable as it's next to Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and just down the road are shops, cafes, a tube station and bus stops.  The staff were helpful and pleasant.  Our room had a view of the gardens, was compact, but very comfortable and the robes were great to use during our stay.  If we returned to London would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,11,03
133,Firtst Class at a good price,I paid $100 via Priceline for a room overlooking Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. Walking distance to Hyde Park where you can walk or rent bikes. Easy acces to tubes and plenty of restaurants for all tastes. Fantastic deal!,5,2018,11,01
133,Living next door to the Royals,This hotel is literally next door to Kensington Palace.  With our Garden room we had a beautiful view of the Kensington gardens and the London landscape.  Situated right near the underground and surrounded by some very good local restaurants.  Would definitely stay here again.  We got the breakfast package which worked out well but you don't need it since there are so many places around it you want to explore.  Rooms are compact but nicely done.  ,5,2018,11,01
133,Beautiful park views,"We have now stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel three times, and have loved every visit. The staff are universally courteous and attentive, and the location is ideal. We have had garden view rooms on each of our visits, and this time, the fall colors through the huge picture window were stunning. This will be our hotel choice whenever we visit London.",5,2018,11,01
133,A pleasant short stay,"The hotel is very nice with excellent professional staff. My room was small but comfortable and clean. The only negative thing was feather bedding. All my pillows and thin duvet were feather which nowadays in time of alergies is really surprising. I think they would have exchanged my pillow have I asked but I came to the room so late I dind't want to bother anyone anymore.
Therwise a pleasant stay.",4,2018,11,01
133,One of the best in London,"Ideal hotel if you‚Äôre in or around Kensington or spending time around Hyde Park.

Hotel itself is great and staff couldn‚Äôt be more helpful. Good views in majority of the higher floor rooms and a varied room service menu.

Daily maid and turn down service as you would expect. Would highly recommend breakfast in the room - fantastic quality.",4,2018,10,31

133,"Good location, excellent customer service: good value for area.",We stayed here overnight while attending a charity ball: we really just wanted somewhere to get dressed for the ball and sleep afterwards. Staff were helpful and friendly without being obsequious. Our room was small but well-appointed and clean with a lovely view. Good-quality high-thread-count sheets and a comfortable bed made for a good night's sleep. Bathroom was fine. We were on a B&B tariff and had a very nice breakfast the following morning in the dining room. We will be staying here again in a few weeks.,4,2018,10,31
133,Short Stay,The room was nice. There was Squeaky floor boards which is annoying. As I don't expect that from 5* star hotel.Staff are pleasant and nice. Always friendly and smiling.There was English breakfast included- that was at a good standard.,4,2018,10,30

133,Our favourite London Hotel,"Our recent visit was for our 20th wedding anniversary. As usual we were warmly welcomed back and had a lovely stay.
The best rooms for us are the ‚ÄúGarden Rooms‚Äù with views up Hyde Park and the City skyline. We had room 941 which had superb views, must be the best views in London. Rooms are large and comfortable with modern bathrooms including a walk in shower. Room servicing is controlled by a red or green light which you control, so no inconvenient disturbances.
 On arrival we had a complementary bottle of wine and chocolates to celebrate our anniversary, a lovely touch.
Breakfast was excellent, table service for hot food most days and hot buffet at week-end, also an impressive cold buffet every day.
Unfortunately we did not get to use Berties bar, it was closed each afternoon and all day Sunday.
We had a lovely meal in the Min Jiang 10th floor restaurant, fantastic city views from the bar and dining area. This does get busy so pre booking is strongly advised.
Parking is available underneath the hotel if required, get a code when you book a room for a discount (its an NCP).
We can genuinely recommend Royal Garden, it`s our favourite London hotel.
Needless to say, we will be back.",5,2018,10,27
133,Always warm and friendly,"Terrific especially with Autumn colours. Vladimir, Front office Manager is very helpful and has very kindly compensated us for our next trip in view of previous challenge. The staff are always first rate!",5,2018,10,27
133,Royal garden Hotel,"Fabulous  hotel and friendly staff, and they take care of the families. Also all the services near the hotel and the bus station just in the main entrance of thee hotel. Really I enjoyed the stay in royal garden Hotel. And next time I will book the same 100 %",5,2018,10,27

133,perfect location,A great hotel taking into account some London hotels. perfect location with great views across the park.good vibe locally. very helpful and friendly staff. i would definitely be returning in the future,4,2018,10,26
133,Quality surroundings and anticipation of needs!,I loved my 1 night stay at the hotel. The staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful. The view of the park was fantastic and worth the extra money to watch the moon rise over the London Eye in the evening. The team in the Park Terrace restaurant were fantastic - their anticipation of needs was spookily good! The food was not rushed to the table but that absolutely suited me. I would most definitely return. ,5,2018,10,26
133,Great hotel and helpful staff v,"Here for a work meeting. Aside from the top location it‚Äôs the staff that take this place from the ordinary to the exceptional. Reception, waiting , meeting room, concierge. All went the extra mile. And it‚Äôs great value for central London. ",5,2018,10,26
133,Leisure Trip,"Great Hotel in Great location. Outstanding garden room overlooking the park. Easy walk to Herriods, but took about 30 minutes. Great restaurants nearby. One of the best restaurants in London within walking distance. ",5,2018,10,25
133,Comfortable stay,"I stayed over for one night. From what I saw and experienced, the hotel offers exceptional facilities and service. The room was incredibly clean upon arrival, and it was evident that all staff at the hotel are hard-working.",5,2018,10,25
133,Lovely hotel but did not receive what we had paid for.,"The hotel was beautiful and from the beginning we were treated like royalty by all of the staff (with the exception of the rude staff outside, only catering to people arriving or leaving in expensive looking vehicles.)

We had paid extra to have a room with a view of the Palace Gardens so the room itself was around ¬£300 for the night, however, we were put on a room on the first floor with an (awful) ""view"" of the royal gardens, and we could not see much as it was blocked out by the trees and their branches so this was a little annoying especially seeming as we had paid upwards of ¬£100 extra for a view that we simply did not get.
 
The room itself was very dusty, I had woken up with a layer of dust on top of my phone and other items in the room and this really played up with my allergies but an anti-histamine later and all was good but the dust could be a problem for serious allergy sufferers. Prices are extortionate for pretty much everything as is the usual with a 5* hotel, in reality, it's just another way to make money by overpricing everything.

They stay/sleep itself was great and me nor my partner could hear a noise throughout the night and it was very quiet and peaceful and the room was cosy and easy to rest in. The staff were wonderful and punctual and catered to our every request swiftly.

The reason this review is only two stars was simply due to the fact we did not get the room view we had paid for and this really irritated me and this was to be a highlight of our stay, the hotel is great, but make sure you're actually getting what you're paying for and what is advertised.",2,2018,10,24
133,A Right Royal View!,We booked the Royal Garden Hotel via a deal on Travelzoo and got exceptional value for a hotel of this quality in this location. The hotel is situated on Kensington High Street and our room had views of Kensington Palace and Gardens. The breakfast was amazing and we were also treated to a complimentary cocktail! A special shout out to both Paloma and Lucy on reception who provided a high level of customer service ,5,2018,10,24

133,A Home Away from Home,The Royal Garden is always a special place for us and our recent trip was awesome.  The staff at the hotel are outstanding and go the extra mile to learn about our likes and allergies.  What a great help they were to keep me healthy during our visit.  The rooms are very comfortable and we always feel at home.  The location is perfect for getting around the city and there are plenty of great restuarants nearby.,5,2018,10,21
133,"Big name, little else...","After concert party at Bertie‚Äôs bar.. service slow and uncooperative, food wanting in quality and quantity although quite expensive, not a good choice.
The hotel itself has many stairs and few elevators, somewhat unpleasant but elegant and centrally located, rooms comfortable.",3,2018,10,21
133,Luxury hotel in Kensington,"The hotel has an incredibly helpful staff.  The rooms are well appointed and very spacious compared to others we have stayed in throughout Europe.  Breakfast was included for us and it was wonderful with both a continental offering and menu options.  The salmon and scrambled eggs was my go to breakfast every day of our stay. The Asian restaurant, Ming Ji on the tenth floor was a treat. It offers a great view of the historic sites on the Thames and beautiful city lights. It is conveniently located near the High Street Kensington metro stop and Kensington Palace.  Shopping close by is mostly affordable chain boutiques and there are a few pubs (owned by Green King) that were fun to visit.  We met a couple at a West End theatre who lived in London for six years and wanted to recommend a hotel to us and it turned out to be the Royal Garden Hotel!! We could not have asked for a nicer stay.",5,2018,10,21
133,"Great location, comfortable rooms, expectedly better from staff","Property is great, amazing onsite Resturant, however front desk staff not helpful.

133,Business ,"Prestigious Hotel

Location is a unique location, well trained staff as usual.

Perfect for Royal Albert Hall venue.","Staff were most accommodating, most enjoyable, the view from our bedroom breath taking.perfect location for Royal Albert Hall.breakfast so copious. We cannot faulted it , spacious bath in our bathroom which I love . ",5,2018,10,19
133,Second visit to the Royal Garden Hotel,"Royal Garden Hotel was superb and generously gave us a bottle of wine in the room and also received an  upgrade with the room which was unexpected. We were going to the Royal Albert Hall so great to be able to walk there and also so near Kensington Gardens. Only stayed one night, but did not want to leave.",5,2018,10,18
133,Excellent location,"This is an excellent modern hotel ideally located in a lovely neighborhood next to a large park, Kensington Palace, lots of shops and restaurants and a tube station.  The room was well appointed and comfortable.  Breakfast was included and you could order hot dishes from a menu or a buffet with fruit, pastries, cheese, etc.  There were a couple of service fails - such as not having the room made up one day until really late - but overall, it was a great option with good staff and a lot less expensive than most other London 5 star hotels.",5,2018,10,18
133,Recent stay,This was our first visit to the hotel. We chose the hotel primarily for its location close to Royal Albert Hall as we were going to a concert there. It was excellent in all respects.  Would definitely staff again.,5,2018,10,18
133,Trip to London,"high floor garden room was lovely on 9th floor  excellent customer service and throughout very welcomewe were offered an upgrade as returning customers would recommend all friends and family to this hotel , perfectly placed to see London sights.  ",5,2018,10,18
133,Another very enjoyable stay,We have stayed at the RGH many times over the past ten years and have never had any cause to complain or to feel that the very high standard of hospitality had slipped.  Any minor mishaps have always been dealt with quickly and without fuss.Wonderful staff and superb location.,5,2018,10,17
133,2nd visit,Would have preferred a queen bed but overall a very nice stayExcellent location and very high standards all roundReally good local restaurants and very good public transport especially esp bus serviceWould come back again,5,2018,10,17
133,Good,"The room is very clean, and the bed is soft, I have a good dream.The hotel's location is good, the transportation is convenient.Serve is good. Food is very tasty.Next time will also chose your hotel.",5,2018,10,16
133,Great hotel,"I stay at the Royal Garden every time I travel to London and will definitely be back again next year!  The staff is professional, but courteous and efficient.  The facilities are very good and the rooms are extremely comfortable.  Highly recommended!",5,2018,10,16
133,Where 5 Star means just that!,"I found this to be an excellent hotel - well deserving of its 5 Star Rating. From my arrival where a porter greeted me and helped with my case - and didn't hover for a tip - to check-in - when I was given an upgrade - to checkout - I couldn't find fault. My bedroom overlooked Kensington High Street but there wasn't any traffic noise. Though the room was not huge it was exceptionally well designed and extremely comfortable - with everything a discerning guest could wish.  I had a delicious early evening meal in 'Bertie's Bar' which was very reasonably priced.   The 24 hour room service menu was very comprehensive.   I ordered breakfast to arrive between 10.00 and 10.15 and sure enough it arrived at 10.07.   A delicious breakfast - with everything I had ordered present and correct - which is not always easy in a large hotel.   Concierge's desk was very well staffed and exceptionally helpful as was all the staff in this hotel.   There is an underground car park and two restaurants.  Yes the room rate is a little pricey but I booked well in advance which made it less expensive and considering the central and beautiful location - near shops and underground and beside Kensington Gardens - it was cheap at the price.   Most other hotels in this area cannot compete -  on price, standard or service.   I will definitely stay here again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend unreservedly.",5,2018,10,16
133,Nice Hotel - Good Location,"Nice location in the city based on where I was going. The room walls are very thin however, so I was woken up each morning by noise in the hallway from the maid service.  Otherwise the accommodations were decent.  ",4,2018,10,16
133,Green feelings in the heart of Kensington,Large windows overlooking Kensington Park make you feel under the shade of the huge trees while sitting and comfortably sipping your (absolutely fantastic) cappuccino at breakfast or in your room (if you're lucky enough to have a room overlooking the park).,4,2018,10,16
133,Enjoyed our staff at RGH,"Traveling for work, my wife and I stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel. It's a really nice hotel right next to Kensington Palace and Hyde Park. A little far from the main London downtown, but there are amply shops and restaurants and ways to get to see the sights.  ",4,2018,10,15
133,Birthday Trip,"We stayed Friday 12th October, had a lovely clean and spacious room. The staff were very friendly on reception. We had dinner at Min Jiang in the evening which was excellent, we had a few drinks in the bar before we were seated at our table. There was a great atmosphere and waiting staff were brilliant. ",5,2018,10,15
133,Another Super Stay ,"One of my favorite hotels when passing through London.
Very conveniently located and a few hundred meters from High Street Kensington station giving you access to the underground.
Bus stop right in front of hotel door.
Many cafes and eating places within a stones throw from the hotel. 
The rooms depending on which option you pay for are all comfortable and well laid out.  
Bathroom amenities use the Penhaligons 
range which is very nice.
Tea,coffee and water in the rooms. 
A nice plus is the plug points have been upgraded to accommodate cell phone cable chargers which is convenient.  
A nice, comfortable stay.
Ask for a room overlooking the park for great views. ",5,2018,10,14
133,Fantastic Hotel,"Could not fault the hotel one bit. Exceptional service from all employees, food, the location, cleanliness of the room and hotel on general. Worthy of the five stars. We had a wonderful weekend. The toiletries are top notch, breakfast choice is amazing. Thank you.",5,2018,10,14
133,Martin saved the day,"Thank you to Martin in conferencing who looked after our event.  Couldn'd fault the customer service we received from Martin and his team. Such a shame the same could not be said of the service at breakfast.  Staff were rude, unhelpful and it appeared to be no body's role to get hot drinks or take a hot food order! Incorrect spelling of St James' suite (they spell it St James's suite) was just annoying! Has no one ever mentioned that it's grammatically incorrect?!!",3,2018,10,14
133,Very comfortable,"This hotel is particularly well suited for a short business stay. Service is excellent, breakfast was great and in a very quiet atmosphere. The place is perfect for discret client meetings. Proximity of Hyde park helps a lot for your early morning running!",5,2018,10,14
133,Wonderful experience,I could not have enjoyed the location more. A nice London experience required simply walking into Kensington Park just to the left of the hotel and a nice urban experience on the Kensington High Street to the the right of the hotel. ,5,2018,10,12
133,Excellent Stay,"Thanks for the usual great experience! Looking forward to see you all next time. Great locations, super view! Still loving the charming staff welcome and availability. No question, there will be another time to visit you!",5,2018,10,12
133,Another fantastic stay!!,"I just wanted to thank you again for another wonderful stay. From the early check-in, the room with a view of the Palace and the vouchers for dining at Park Terrace (which again was a culinary triumph). You have excelled in every single way. We are now loyalists and look forward to our next stay. Thank-you!",5,2018,10,11
133,Fantastic view to the garden,"We very pleased with the hotel, our room with view to the park was very nice and spacious, and to all friendly staff. Seems very professionally.We ordered dinner to the room, and it was fantastic, so in fact we did it twice.We will be back.",5,2018,10,11
133,Garden view is lovely,"A lovely hotel with welcoming and friendly staff.  We were recommended this hotel by a friend and told to book a garden view room.  Whilst the view was wonderful, the room was quite small for the price you pay.  I also find it frustrating that 5 star hotels do not provide an iron and ironing board in your room.  It's not just a matter of cost but convenience; I just wanted to quickly iron something and head out.",4,2018,10,09
133,Royal Garden Hotel stay,"The hotel is the perfect location to the underground and for walking to great spots in London.  Also close to great places to eat like the Ivy for dinner, Ole & Steen for a quick breakfast and also close to Whole Foods!",5,2018,10,09
133,Amazing Hotel and Staff,By Far this has been my favorite hotel in London. We've hosted 4 awards ceremonies and each time the hotels blows our mind with their great service. Bettina and all of the staff at the hotel are always there to ensure we need everything we need. Nothing is too small of a need for them. I am at awe with the great service they offer. This is my hotel of choice each time I travel to London.,5,2018,10,09
133,TOP NOTCH HOTEL,"Room small but typical of central London. Very elegant hotel, brilliant location. Everything felt clean, polished and professional. Bed a bit small but very clean bedding. Location brilliant for Royal Albert Hall and Ken Hight St.",4,2018,10,09
133,Very good experience,"I would definitely stay here again. Really nice hotel and the staff is very friendly. The breakfast was perfect, the location was good, and I couldn't say anything but positive feedback. They also have a nice gym. ",5,2018,10,09
133,Kensington Garden Welcoming and Comfortable Hotel,"The Royal Garden Hotel is conveniently right next to Kensington Palace and the Gardens.  It was such a treat to have ready access to both.  In addition, the hotel was spotless and staff very helpful and compassionate.  The food was not especially memorable but the service was great.  It would have been nice to have movies on demand or a smart tv connection as well as usb ports.  Otherwise, the room were comfortable and up to date although a little small.",4,2018,10,09
133,Perfect base.,"Our room was on the 10th floor over looking Kensington Palace, a beautiful view. My only slight negatives would be the pillows were far too soft but I'm sure if I bothered to phone reception they would have given me firmer pillows and the breakfast although a fantastic choice could have been a little hotter.Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,10,09
133,Excellent Hospitality,"We were treated like royalty for the duration of our stay. We really apprecaite the kind and friendly staff.  We were so impressed how prepared everyone was for our shabbos accomadations.  Everything was excellent, the rooms, the staff, the location.  For a conference in Central London, especially focussing on consular work, as our was, this was the perfect location. We wish we had brough the kids with us.  Keep up the great work. We will definitely recommend this hotel to others who need to say in downtown London.",5,2018,10,09
133,Fantastic place,"Loved my stay. The rooms are well-designed for business travel and equipped with USB and American outlets. The staff is polite and helpful. The location is great for walking, public transportation and food options. ",5,2018,10,09
133,Outstanding for Business and Pleasure,"My wife and I just stayed at the Royal Garden for a week while attending a conference in London. It is an excellent hotel for small conferences and my wife liked the Kensington location for shopping and sightseeing. I travel a good bit in the U.S. and stay at major hotels in larger cities, and this can compete with the best of them. Nice amenities, Wi-Fi throughout, quiet rooms, and very friendly staff. I couldn't ask for more.",5,2018,10,09
133,Exceptional Hotel,"Could not fault this hotel one bit - the location, the staff, the room, the breakfast - all exceptional.The choice for breakfast was brilliant - hot or cold.  The service from all staff I could not fault.",5,2018,10,09
133,Trip to London,"We really enjoyed our stay in the Royal Garden Hotel, great setting beside Hyde Park and very helpful pleasant staff.  My only disappointment was a lack of vegan and gluten free breakfast options.  Would recommend it to others.",5,2018,10,08
133,Fantastic personalised service,"We stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel in 2 interconnecting rooms as a family of 4 in September 2018. The rooms were comfortable, the location is very convenient and the service was outstanding. The staff made a big effort to make sure everything was personalised (unusual in such a large hotel). We had a function in Bertie's Bar for a group of friends and the staff at the bar were fabulous. ",5,2018,10,07
133,Nice location and good staff,"This is my first time in London, and I think this is a good city because the location of the hotel. I enjoyed walking through the garden/park in a sunny day! It is also walking distance to Portobello market. The service from the staff was excellent! The owner is from Singapore so the menu for room service is also very interesting.",4,2018,10,05
133,Astonishingly Magnificent,"The warmth and friendliness of the staff make this the best hotel to stay in London. The rooms are great, overlooking the palace gardens. The in-room dining was amazing too. I had a great nights sleep and can't wait to stay there again. I've recommended it to all of my colleagues. Thanks!",5,2018,10,05
133,EXCELLENT STAY AT THIS SUPER HOTEL,"We were very impressed following our weekend break at this hotel.  We travel to London several times a year and have stayed in various five star hotels but have on many occasions returned home a little disappointed.  This was not the case at the Royal Garden Hotel.  The reception and service offered at the hotel was first class. The receptionist Marie greeted us with a lovely welcome and escorted us to our room which was on the 8th floor overlooking Kensington Palace and park.  Our 'Queen' room was very clean, fresh and modern and although small was cleverly designed to offer everything you could possibly need even including a shower cap with additional hair band (its the small things that make a difference).  Following an excellent nights sleep we enjoyed a super breakfast with a large choice of continental and cooked food.  From a choice of 11 dishes of different fruits, two types of bacon, three types of sausages and a chef to cook eggs/omelette of your choice to name some of what was on offer, what more can anyone ask. We also enjoyed a drink before Dinner  in Bertie's Bar where we met our daughter who lives in London.  Overall very impressed and we will most definitely be returning.",5,2018,10,03
133,My 1st time experience in Royal Garden Hotel,"Location, room service food and room are good, especially the view of my room is overlooking the park , feel fresh and peaceful.  I will return to stay in Royal Garden Hotel again if I travel to London.",4,2018,10,03
133,"Comfortable, convenient and affordable","Well appointed hotel in a good location in Knightsbridge. Our room was comfortable and spacious with a lovely bathroom and the mini bar was well stocked (I have a pet hate for empty mini-bars.. I mean, what IS the point of that?). Convenient for a morning walk in Kensington park. Great staff.",4,2018,10,02
133,Anniversary,"Lovely hotel and very helpful staff. When booking i had mentioned that we were visiting for our 5th year anniversary, and they very knidly upgrades our room at no extra cost and also left a bottle of champagne and some chocolates in our room. Very nice touch. would definitly stay her again.",5,2018,10,01
133,Wonderful Stay,"It's rated five stars for a reason.  Great staff - friendly, helpful, and professional.  Rooms were excellent.  The location was perfect.  This trip was for our twin daughters' 16th birthday.  The staff went out of their way to make it special - including sending up birthday surprise sweets.",5,2018,09,30
133,Conference,I have stayed here several times over the past 2 years whilst attending Conference's and found it an excellent all round hotel. The only slight downside is that it is not central enough when trying to combine business meetings.,5,2018,09,30
133,Celebration Stay,"Excellent from check in, to check out. Perfect London location. Stunning room with equally stunning views. Breakfast very good,  cocktails in the bar......even better!!! Very friendly and helpful staff. Thank you for having us!",5,2018,09,29
133,Nice neighborhood,"We loved the hotel. The neighborhood was very nice with a Whole Foods, TK Maxx, nice restaurants, an underground stop, and a Big Bus hop on hop off stop. The rooms were clean and pleasant. The staff was very helpful.",5,2018,09,29
133,Perfect Hotel in London,I stayed for two nights at the hotel. Location is great and the staff was very professional and kind. Price performance is very good. You can walk the hyde park and spend some time. But if you are going for fun it's a little bit far to Soho district. I was there for business and my meetings are very near to hotel. The only thing that I don't like is my room view. Unfortunately I was looking to air ventilation system. You can choose upper floors for better view.,5,2018,09,28
133,Cheers at the Royal Garden,"A special treat in London.  Staying at the Royal Garden.  Great location.  Wonderful staff.  Room and dining fabulous. You feel like you‚Äôre at the palace.  Friendly, courteous, caring.  It‚Äôs an unforgettable vacation.",5,2018,09,27
133,Great option for hiring meeting rooms and conference rooms,"The hotel is in an excellent location, near Kensington High Street tube station and on several bus routes so easily accessible. We hired the mezzanine floor for our afternoon event and provided our guests with refreshments during the day. Bettina and the rest of the events team were superb - they were a pleasure to work with and you really did help our event to run seamlessly.",5,2018,09,27
133,Location,"This is a lovely hotel with a perfect location. The rooms are a very nice size and the hotel itself modern and lovely. It's a great location to stay if you love to stroll through the parks and head out to museums. Lots of shopping, Whole Foods and Tube stop nearby.
I only wish their bar stayed open later and they served breakfast later on Sunday. It is a very busy hotel so, if you like something more quaint this isn't for you.",4,2018,09,26
133,1night,"The hotel has an excellent location. Our room was on the 8th floor, with a miraculous view to London. The room facilites was ok, more than we needed. We loved the shower gel and the soap.Hotel has a really wide range of breakfast. We especially liked the greek yogurt.Highly recommend to everyone.",5,2018,09,26
133,Fabulous hotel in Kensington!,"The staff are very welcoming and nothing is ever too much trouble. We are a family of four and enjoy staying in the Executive Room which is spacious - the bathroom is very modern and immaculate. The hotel is very near the underground, next door to Kensington palace and a short walk to Hyde Park. This is always our first choice when staying in London.",5,2018,09,25
133,ONE OF LONDONS BEST HOTELS,"A great hotel, fantastic location with superb customer service. nothing was a problem to every member of staff, how hotels should be. Excellent restaurant food and service, overall a very enjoyable stay.",5,2018,09,25
133,Always a good stay,"I have a long history with this hotel and it never lets me down. This time I stayed in a standard room, it is a bit on the small side and I had a road view but it was very comfortable and perfectly clean and has everything in it you want, a variety of items in the mini bar, great products in the bathroom, great shower etc. And perfect staff all around, always willing to help. If you havent been before, you will love the location, many stores and places to eat around and the lovely Kensington Gardens are right there and the hotel will provide a picnic basket for you to take along. It is pricy but worth it for a treat.",4,2018,09,24
133,Does the job ,"Good, ordinary hotel offering good value for likeable price. 
Nothing spectacular at this hotel, but everything works and location with park view is uplifting. It‚Äôs like many other London hotels in this category. 
Good choice for business trip. ",3,2018,09,24
133,Royal times at the Royal Garden,On our first trip to London staying at the Royal Garden Hotel help to make the experience  fantastic. The staff was outstanding and the facility and location helped to make the time easy and truly memorable. The underground is near and Kensington Garden is immediately adjacent. Dining at Min Jiang is a must.,5,2018,09,23
133,High Street Kensington hotel,"A really superb location on High Street Kensington, great service - you can see that they have Asian roots, comfortable rooms, nice restaurant, morning papers, wi-fi - in short, everything I needed for a satisfying stay.",5,2018,09,21
133,Absolutely first class,"In comparison to some of the other high end hotels in London, I would rank this as one of the best I have stayed in.  It's obviously not cheap but I feel the pricing reflects the excellent service which the hotel offers.

The room was excellent with a great view of Hyde Park, staff were very helpful and friendly and the general feeling around the hotel is one of competence rather than pretence.

The only negative comment was that the room (and mainly the bathroom) had a mild smell of stale cigarette smoke.

I will be back!",5,2018,09,21
133,Great choice for London stay!,"Excellent place, location and professionalism combined with a reasonable pricing and very warm staffThe Chinese restaurant on the 10th floor is an experience in itself whilst enjoying wonderful views of the Hyde Park",5,2018,09,21
133,Lovely hotel in a great location,"Very friendly staff all efficient and helpful, lovely location for the west side of London.

133,Special occasion,I booked Royal Garden as a special occasion as I was proposing to my girlfriend. As a result the team very kindly upgraded us tus to a garden view room which made all the difference the morning after. Everyone was very helpful and the room was wonderful.,5,2018,09,18
133,Confortable Room,Very comfortable room and great location. Suits for leisure and business purposes. Very clean room with nice in room entertainment channels. I would recommend this hotel to others regardless they are in town for leisure or business purposes.,5,2018,09,17
133,Good,"Morning Call Service was excellent.  Located well for the business purpose.  Meals are good enough to enjoy.  Overall, we all enjoyed staying in your hotel and were satisfied enough.  We took a limo service, that was not good enough for driving skills and direction-knowledge.",4,2018,09,15
133,Superb,"Stayed here several times & it never fails to impress. All the staff are fantastic. Arriving at the hotel & literally just give your car key to the concierge & they take care of it without hesitation. At Burties bar again the staff are fantastic & everything is possible, if chocolate at 1am!!! The breakfast also fantastic.

I wouldn‚Äôt stop at another hotel.",5,2018,09,14
133,Weekend stay,"Great service, the team were so accommodating and went the extra mile to make sure our 6 year old and three year old had a great stay! The location was perfect and the food was very good. Thank you (o: ",5,2018,09,14
133,Another great stay,"I spent two nights at the Royal Garden Hotel.

I‚Äôm a regular at the hotel and this was another great stay. The hiccups that I experienced - one lift not working for the entire stay, and some pre-booking requests not fulfilled - were made up by the ever courteous and professional staff. This is by far the defining feature of the hotel.

I look forward to my next stay here.",5,2018,09,13
133,old guests,"we were your guests since quite a long time, but this time we noticed a reduced performance as far as our usual suite is concerned : first the corridor wasn't too clean, then in the suite there was no complimentary water on the night tables, also when expressly requested to the service lady.In the past we always had fresh flowers in the room, now it's just a small orchid. Also in the bathroom it used to be with a big orchid flower on the basins, nothing now. no more magazines neither.",4,2018,09,13
133,Great hotel but dont rush to refund holding deposit!,"Great hotel for location in Kensington. Clean rooms, fairly good view of the palace. 

Breakfast silly expensive even for London and plenty of local eateries so don‚Äôt waste money!

Holding deposit on credit card 3 days after check out, not impressed....",4,2018,09,12
133,Not What was Promised,Unfortunately failed to deliver in relation to advertising and price paid.  Staff unfriendly and did not deliver even on basic items such as morning newspaper.  Room very small and promise of views of city and park did not eventuate.  Toiletries sub-standard.,2,2018,09,12
133,Bad experience ,"The worst hotel on earth, people at the reception are NOT friendly at all. They take money without explaining what is it for. A transaction of 461 GBP deducted from my visa at 2 AM, I called the reception, they don‚Äôt know why and what is it for. Just a bad experience. I don‚Äôt recommend it at all.",1,2018,09,11
133,Top marks for royal garden hotel,"Absolutely fantastic hotel. This will now become my 'go to' hotel. Nothing was too much trouble for the very friendly, happy and helpful staff. The bed was possibly the most comfortable i have been in and the rooms were spacious. Complimentary wine was delicious and my daughter and her friend had complimentary films in their room which was a nice touch. definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2018,09,11
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"Very disappointed with the view from the room for it looks out to the air cond vents. Dinner at Min Jiang is excellent, especially the Peking Duck. All the hotel staffs are extremely friendly. I would still return and stay at the Hotel on my next visit to London. ",4,2018,09,11
133,AVOID THIS HOTEL,"Stayed here last week for two nights, have stayed many times before and mentioned this on check in but was not offered an upgrade, free breakfast not even a bowl of fruit - talk about loyalty! I was put on the seventh floor where for 48 hours I had to endure a sporadic wifi service which every two minutes cut out. This happened in the corridors of the seventh floor as well but not at ground level. My complaints to the staff resulted in nothing except an offer to move me to another room 12 HOURS BEFORE MY DEPARTURE! I confirmed wifi problems on the seventh floor when I mentioned it to one of the housekeeping staff who agreed with me. Also, one should note the room decor is very tired and shabby and I found dirty glasses and dishes as well as an electric kettle which would not siwtch off (potentially dangerous). I WILL NEVER STAY AGAIN.",1,2018,09,10
133,Easy Access to Royal Albert Hall ,"We stayed here for a night pre the Last Night at the Proms and it is simply the best location. We drove- easy to get to, valet parking, right next to Regents Park and very good value. Staff were fantastic, the room was clean and beds very comfortable. Bar was great and cocktails good value. Definitely will stay here again as so easy to get to Albert Hall. ",5,2018,09,09
133,A gifted one night stay,"After a 3 week European tour & 2 weeks touring Great Britain we were gifted our final night at Royal Garden. What an experience after having spent so many nights in Hotels with no Air Conditioning & 35 Degree temperatures it was heaven. The Staff were incredible; the food was the best we had experienced & the room could not be faulted. We would rate our stay as the best we have experienced having travelled to several countries including Asia, South Pacific, Hawaii, New Zealand & Australia. We were so fortunate to be gifted such a wonderful place to spend our last night before returning home. Management should be proud of the standard which they present.",5,2018,09,08
133,Nice hotel,"This hotel is fancy and located in the center of London.  Such a location make the customer use Hide Park and Kenshington Park. Meanwhile, as everybody knows, the price for the rooms are quite high compare to other hotels.",4,2018,09,07
133,Disappointed,"I  have stayed here previously and was delighted on that occasion but this time had a very poor room for a 5* hotel. We had English breakfast which was not particularly good despite being cooked to order...it was all a but pink and wet but to be honest I would suggest having the continental buffet breakfast which was wonderful...very fresh, constantly replaced and delicious",3,2018,09,06
133,Fabulous Stay!,"Stayed at the hotel as part of a weekend to celebrate my mother‚Äôs 80th birthday and I can‚Äôt thank the staff at the hotel enough! They made it really special from the moment we arrived! We arrived early and our room was available, this was ever so helpful with an elderly relative! The concierge desk is amazing, within minutes of arriving our weekend was planned! From local knowledge of what public transport to take, to making dinner reservations and wonderful recommendations! 
There was a lovely surprise for mother in the room and that continued throughout our stay at the hotel! 
The Park Terrace restaurant is lovely! Breakfast was very quiet considering the hotel was full! We were seated immediately and could enjoy a tasty breakfast without any rush. We had dinner on the first night and the two course offer was great value! 
We had cocktails at Min Jiang which were good and the view is amazing! 
All in all the hotel could not have done any more for us. They were extremely respectful and professional and I would love to return!

133,"Location is key, elevators and smell is not","Loved the location, being right at the edge of Hyde Park with a great Chinese restaurant on the top floor.  Only issue are the elevators are a bit slow and the smell of strong cologne, perfumes strike the entire hotel.  Its the first time I mention smell for a hotel review but feel that it can be improved with some thought.  I liked the rooms and would stay here again.",4,2018,08,25
133,Takeaway Rubbish outside guest rooms....,"I booked this Hotel for our Wedding Anniversary and my Wife's Birthday!Takeaway rubbish is left outside their rooms by guests after consumption. The smell is disgusting and permeates the corridors and lift lobbies! ....otherwise the staff are excellent, the food and drinks are very good and the room was very clean and well equipped!",3,2018,08,23
133,Great Kensington location,"We love the Royal Garden Hotel and have stayed many times.  We did 2 stays this trip: 6 nights, away 2 days, then returned for 1 night.  The first stay was excellent as usual.  The staff are friendly, accommodating, and very professional.  One lady working in the Park Terrace remembered us from last year.  We can't say enough good things about the staff in all parts of the hotel.  The location is extremely convenient, with a bus stop just outside, and the Underground just one stop away or a short walk.  We enjoyed our restaurant experiences, both Park Terrace and Min Jiang.  Min Jiang on level 10 has wonderful views over the park and to the city.  Definitely order the wood smoked duck.  One order makes 2 courses for 2 people.  We had a Garden room with king bed and it was very spacious with a wonderful view over Hyde Park.  On the downside, we made the booking for the 1 night return at the desk when we checked out from the first stay.  We requested a larger room and thought the GBP 505 rate was acceptable.  However, when we returned we found that we we getting the same type of room, but with a much higher tariff.  Our average tariff for the 6 night stay was GBP 294/night.  When we questioned the GBP 505/night, it was explained that this was Dubai summer holidays and peak rates apply.  Clearly there was a misunderstanding when we made the booking.The other peculiarity of the hotel is the guest name that appears on the TV.  When we stayed last year, although I made the booking in my name and paid with my credit card, my husband's name appeared on the TV.  He had presented his passport when checking in.  This year with the first stay, I was thrilled to see my name appear on the TV.  However, when we returned to the room later in the evening, there was my husband's name on the TV.  My husband thinks this is very amusing, however I find this quite insulting.  When I questioned reception about this peculiarity, it was explained that the booking system puts the accompanying guest on the TV, something that they were looking into but had not resolved.  There wasn't an explanation as to why my name had first appeared, then changed to my lucky husband's.  When we returned for the 1 night stay, my husband had made the booking, paid with his card, but again his name appeared on the TV, not myself as his accompanying guest.  It's a shame that this small criticism is something that I associate with this hotel which is otherwise our favourite London hotel.",5,2018,08,20
133,"Best Hotel, Staff and Very Family Friendly","I just stayed at the Royal Garden hotel for 2 weeks wtih my 8 year old twins and my parents. I was there for business, but my children and parents came as well. The staff could not have been kinder and more accomodating. I felt like we were at a family's home rather than a hotel. Everyone went out of their way to ensure we had what we needed at all times. A highlight is that the hotel has scooters and helmuts available for the kids, so they could ride the scooters in Hyde Park every day. Also, the kids menu was perfect for my kids. After long days in London sight seeing, they often just wanted room service and a movie. The chinese restaurant on the top floor was delicious too and the views amazing! I was concerned staying at a hotel for 2 weeks would be tough, but it was honestly hard to leave because we had such an amazing experience there. I highly recommend the hotel for the hotel itself, but also for the location.",5,2018,08,18

133,Excellent hotel perfectly located,"Excellent hotel in a fabulous location
Although at the more expensive level (as you might expect in such a prestige location in London!) - this hotel was a particularly comfortable family hotel. We were a couple but we were upgraded into a large suite overlooking Kensington Palace and Hyde Park, the room had everything one could ask for. Being on the edge of Hyde Park is also a great bonus as we could scoot/walk each day, it was particularly nice watching people taking a morning walk, some with their little doggies. The hotel is conveniently located for access to the West End .... Tea at the Ritz etc .... We would most certainly make a return visit!",5,2018,08,06
133,Great Location in London.,"Many times the house keeper in this hotel doesn‚Äôt wipe the tables in side the room unless you till them to do that and this make me so  frustrated because the kind of the bed sheets that you use made too many fabrics on the tables besides and  I have allergy  In my sinuses from them so either you should tell the housekeeper to clean the tables every time or you should change the kind of bedsheets ,  The second thing I hate in this hotel is the beverages  from in room dining   Or room service  The juice is there is very few there is no watermelon juice and another kind of juice is very few at not delicious.

Everything we asked for was done quickly and efficiently. I cannot fault this hotel in any way. 10/10 Bravo.",5,2018,08,04
133,Excellent family hotel in a great location,"Although very expensive (as everything is in London!) - this hotel was a particularly good family hotel. We had a room with a sofa bed, so 4 of us could sleep comfortably in the room, and the children were given lovely activity bags and stationary gifts to keep them occupied. Being on the edge of Hyde Park is also a huge bonus as we could scoot/walk each day and the Diana Memorial playground was a real hit. Walking distance to the museums as well.",5,2018,08,03
133,Disappointly below average ...,"We have just checked in and what a disappointment.

Cars parked all along the entrance, making it difficult to get into car park.

Check in and reception give a great impression.

We‚Äôd booke as part of a theatre break - and expected for the cost to be better.

The room is small (almost claustrophobic) as is the bathroom - hardly high glass luxury - the bed is small - we‚Äôre both tall. Hardly any milk and they want to charge for biscuits - something less expensive hotels would give for free.

Just after checking in we were called to ask if we were happy with the room - when I said no very disappointed - then told you paid for a queen room and the hotel is fully booked so nothing we can do - so what‚Äôs the point of calling to check.

Thankfully we‚Äôre only using as a base - save yourself some money - have had better budget rooms than this. ¬£250 for this - thanks but no thanks - wouldn‚Äôt recommend or return...

133,Hotel stay,The rooms have not been upgraded for quite some time. They need major refurbishment including the furniture and installation of bedeh for washing the private parts or a water hose. The shower is a bet small also.,3,2018,08,03
133,5 Star excellence with a friendly welcoming smile,"Not my first visit, but the first for me in a wheelchair with a companion. Not only were the staff absolutely 100% helpful, but the person I spoke to on the phone before my visit remembered me and asked if everything she had arranged worked out. There was nowhere I couldn't access by using the small lifts installed everywhere, or by someone taking me via another route. They could not have been more helpful.
The room was spotless and comfortable. They ensured I had a room with a walk-in shower. The revolving door has a button to slow down for wheelchair users. I can walk on level ground, and left the chair with the concierge every time we went to our room, and it was always brought out promptly.
We had one meal in our room. It was delivered promptly, the food was piping hot and excellent.
This is not a cheap hotel, but the service one gets, the helpfulness and friendly without being obsequious courtesy, and friendliness more than justifies the cost.  I would recommend this hotel without hesitation, and particularly for anyone disabled.
You made an important and memorable event I was attending not just possible, but easy and without fault, so I thank you. ",5,2018,08,01

Nice and helpful staff. Breakfast was really good, we enjoyed the English one.

It's only six tube stops from the London Eye.  We couldn't have been happier staying here for four nights.  The only negative was that the room was a wee bit small.

133,nice hotel but over priced,"This is a lovely hotel in a great location. the rooms are clean and well thought out in design with nearly all the amenities you would expect although I was surprised to find no iron or ironing board which I needed for my event that evening. the only offer was the valet at a charge. I was attending an event held at the hotel, the food was great although service shockingly bad. the waiting staff had clearly not been trained in service often leaning across me and then being told off by a supervisor in ear shot of the table! the bar staff where equally slow and disorganise with the barman taking ages to use the till, as if he hadn't been trained properly to work behind the bar at such a busy event. we were also rather surprised that the bar didn't have presseco at the cash bar. equally the wine served at the event was not pleasant with many guests commenting although perhaps this may have been the organisers budget! overall I think the price tag is too great for what is on offer compared to other similar hotels in London i've stayed at for far less.",3,2018,07,08

133,Great value and experience ,"I was pleasantly surprised to find the Royal Garden Hotel available and reasonably priced in summer in London.  Given that, my expectations were low.  I pleasantly surprised to find that it is a full service hotel and enjoyed nearly everything about our stay.  

We started with High Tea close to our arrival and it was as classy an affair as one would expect at one of the more well known places.  The food, the tea, the service and the view were excellent.  Our double deluxe room with a view was perfect for my daughter and myself.  It had a sitting area overlooking Hyde Park and a well appointed bath and shower.  My only complaint about the room was the bed.  I got pretty bad back aches after two nights in the twin bed I was sleeping in.  

We ordered room service for breakfast 3 mornings and it was pretty good. My daughter ordered hot breakfast each morning and enjoyed it. Mine was cold so not much to say about it.  

The hotel is on Kensington High Street by Kensington Palace.  It was easy to catch a bus or tube if you are looking for public transportation. It was a bit of a ride to most places that we were going, but I guess that could be true of many places in London.  ",5,2018,07,03
133,Fantastic views of Hyde park,"We stayed here in June for a birthday celebration with our children. We booked two luxury garden rooms, unfortunately we were on different floors and as the hotel was full, they were unable to move us. Fortunately one daughter is 18 so they were fine where they were.  The hotel has valet parking which we made use of, very useful.  Reception were very friendly and welcoming.
The rooms are large, bright and airy, and views are just amazing.  Comfortable bed, robes, good linen. 
Bathroom had a large bath, separate shower, and Penhaligon's toiletries.
We went out for dinner, but breakfast was great.
Hot buffet, with really good quality pork sausages.  Plenty fresh fruit and pastries.  Chef at the buffet for omelettes, poached eggs, as well as pancakes for the girls.
Waitering staff at breakfast were exceptionally friendly and professional.  We would definitely stay again in future, it was a delight from start to finish.",5,2018,06,30
133,Good experience ,"Good service but the atmosphere is a bit cold. Very well located with a stunning view of Hyde Park (make sure to have a view on the park and not on Kensington High Street).
It‚Äôs also a great hotel for business meetings. Rooms were clean but not very spacious. Not enough space in the cupboard and drawers, particularly when you stay for more than 10 days.
The breakfast buffet doesn‚Äôt have a lot of varieties except on weekends.. .
The waiters are in a hurry to pick up the plates as soon as the time of breakfast is over, which is not correct.
Room service menu suggests a diversity of food and Min Jiang is an excellent Chinese restaurant! 
High quality of the suggested afternoon teas.
Facilities: average. 
Overall : Good value for money.",4,2018,06,29

133,Over night stay at Royal Garden Hotel,"This stay was to celebrate dad's 80th birthday, when the family checked in the receptionist Gina was so efficient, great welcome personality, went through everything with us for the stay then took us up in the lift to the bedrooms, showed us the facilities and checked if everything was good for us, how impressive is the service, thanks Gina.

The views overlooking Kensington Palace and grounds are truely amazing, a recommendation to ask for a room at the rear its got great scenery.

The hotel is so clean tidy and fresh, what all 5* hotels should be like, the staff everywhere are so friendly and give the vibes they enjoy their jobs which reflects on the service provided.

Later in the afternoon a note appeared under the bedroom door to contact guest services so I rang down, a minute later a very polite lady arrived carrying a 'happy birthday' tray of chocolates, this must have come from Gina at reception asking are we here for a special reason, how good is this, massively impressed between reception and guest services excellent team work.

A very comfy stay that night so quiet and relaxing, bedrooms facilities very nice.

Next morning breakfast awaited, again the host was excellent, couldn't do enough to help, we were shown to a lovely table, within seconds a waiter appeared explained the layout of the breakfast and the menu, food ordered we went to the continental buffet, its the best I've ever seen, so fresh, great selection and quality, this you really do need to try, you wont be disappointed at all. The cooked English breakfast arrived and again didn't disappoint it was perfect.

At checkout the ladies on duty again full of smiles, did we enjoy our stay, certinly did and even nicer they asked.

All in all a very good stay and very impressed, thanks to the wonderful team, the manager should be very proud.",5,2018,06,21
133,London Vacation,The Royal Garden Hotel is an excellent hotel to stay. The staff is very courteous and professional. The location is amazing...it is right in front Kensington Palace and garden and is a family friendly place to visit. I will definitely be staying at the Royal Garden Hotel again.,5,2018,06,21
133,Always our London favourite!,"Perfectly positioned giving easy access to Kensington‚Äôs hot spots, Palace, green spaces and shopping with easy public transport to the tourist highlights of London combined with dependable comfort, style and friendly service. Never disappoints!",5,2018,06,20
133,Just great,This is a great hotel  check in  was excellent  and staff  where all nice and friendly room clean and nice size  got a great deal  so  look around  for any deals  great choice of breakfast location is spot on  near the tube  and a bus stop just outside  we got the number 10 bus to kings cross  and the coming back from the theatre at Covent  garden only 1 .50 each trip from now on bus for us I would stay again for sure ,5,2018,06,19
133,Weekend Break,"We had a wonderful stay in your hotel.  The view from 706 of Kensington Palace and Gardens was beautiful.  The staff were all very friendly and professional, and the room was spotless.  We would have not hesitation recommending this hotel.",5,2018,06,19
133,Unpleasant breakfast experience,"I have been attending FWA events at Royal Garden Hotel for many years. Service has always been exemplary and staff are professionally friendly. Our community has a good relationship with the hotel and its staff. 

However, in my stay of 9-11 June last week, breakfast with  family & business friends, was not pleasant. Because there were so many of us who stayed at the hotel, the lady breakfast manager & her staff kept moving our cups & cutlery to clear our tables. I was catching up with 12 guests so I moved around a bit to greet them but everytime I turned my back, she would clear up my table. 

This started on Saturday morning but on the Sunday morning, it was worse. This went on for about an hour. She was staring at all 12 of us. When I told the staff to not clear my table, his abrupt answer was that I had to speak to the manager because it was the manager‚Äôs instruction to clear my tables. I booked 2 rooms for myself and friends/grandchildren which should have been a pleasant weekend for them. It was unpleasant & embarrassing!

The events were perfect but the breakfast manager was unpleasant, always staring  rudely. I told her to leave us alone to have a peaceful breakfast. She said in her condescending way that I must have misunderstood and walked away. 

On reflection, I started questioning if it had a a racial element in it because it was only our group that was harassed all throughout breakfast. I reported this incident to Asst Reception Manager Natalie Andrews and advised her that I will file an official complaint.",3,2018,06,19
133,Wonderful hotel experience,We enjoyed a great two night stay at this wonderful hotel. The rooms were very comfortable with lots of small details to make them special. The staff could not be faulted....polite and very keen to welcome us to the hotel. The breakfast was amazing. Really enjoyed our stay ,5,2018,06,18
133,Wonderful stay with my 16 year old,"I had a wonderful stay last week (June 11-15) with my 16 year old son.  The room was a standard hotel room with twin beds and a nice bathroom (thick towels, robes and a nice shower). It was a very clean room and the beds were very comfortable.  The staff was also wonderful and very friendly.  Helpful from check-in onward.  My room had a garden view and the hotel literally overlooks the Palace.  The tube is less than 2 city blocks away and there are many restaurants in between.  There is a Whole Foods almost across the street ( a pint of Jersey ice cream every other night).  We were on the go from morning to night sight seeing so did not eat at the restaurants in the hotel.  It takes about 30 minutes to get to Westminster Abby and in tourist line after walking out of the hotel.  The area is safe and a really nice part of London. The nights were cool and we walked around Kensinton garden and area.  I hope to convince my wife to take a trip to London in September and will look at this hotel first.  I will not hesitate to stay here again and will try the Chinese restaurant on top of the hotel !  Thanks  ",5,2018,06,18
133,A Few Bells but no Whistles,"In a year or so I will forget that I stayed here. But we got a reasonable internet deal.

The location is good, by the parks and opposite High Street Kensington Underground. Shopping in the street is disappointing - when I was a student in the early seventies we came there to buy our afghan coats and loons in Kensington Market and ogle the black labelled baked bean cans in Biba - but it‚Äôs a shortish walk to Knightsbridge and handy for the Royal Albert Hall, the V&A and Natural History Museum.

Check-in was friendly. I rarely name individuals but Naemie (a trainee) was beyond excellent, especially as she had the job of explaining that our room would not be ready until three PM (usual check-in is from two). She was so charming to my wife and I that we really didn‚Äôt mind.

We eschewed the offer of a free tea or coffee by way of apology and instead invested quite a large sum of money in a couple of beers. The pianist was relaxing and the nibbles tasty.

We were upgraded to an executive room on the first floor. The view was of air conditioning pipes on the roof of the reception.

The room was sizeable with a seating area. The bathroom was cavernous with a separate shower. No complaints at all. The bed was comfortable and the wifi free.

There were no obvious USB sockets - may have been inside the desk - and no facilities for making a hot drink - is that too much to ask for, even without biscuits? There was a safe.

We had vouchers for free cocktails in Bertie‚Äôs Bar, which is a rather soulless, tired venue with nothing to encourage us to pay foo a second drink and stay; why drink in hotels when there are pubs?

There is no option to use the stairs (other than in emergencies), which we always do if on lower floors. The lifts are mandatory.

Breakfast was OK but not special. Certainly not worth ¬£25 (ours was included in the room rate). Do we really need yoghurts in plastic pots these days? 

The Australian cricket team were eating breakfast alongside us. They had been playing at the Kennington Oval - maybe it was a mistake to end up staying in Kensington.

The Royal Garden lacks any feel of luxury, exclusivity or character. Probably best for a business (or sporting) stay. 

If it ticks the ‚ÄòFive Star‚Äô boxes it must be because:

It is a big property in an expensive part of town
It has men outside in purple top hats
The bar prices are high, but you get posh nibbles
There is no tea and coffee tray in the room (premium people don‚Äôt brew up for themselves and would rather pay ¬£15 for a cuppa from room service)
There is a concierge 
Outside the bar there is a smartly dressed person to greet you, rather than the waiting staff
People who haven‚Äôt been inside think it is fancier than it actually is.

The Royal Garden is OK. But that is probably ‚Äòdamning with faint praise‚Äô.",4,2018,06,18
133,Royal Garden Experience,This is my third time staying at this exceptional hotel property. The Kensington Park views from my window offer a relaxing experience. Service is prompt and the staff acknowledges each customer with polite and friendly exchanges. ,5,2018,06,18
133,Our home away from home in London,"The Royal Garden is a simply wonderful hotel - for us a true home away from home. The friendliness of the staff, their attention to detail and the quality of the accommodation and the food and beverage service make it a pleasure to stay. The hotel is the perfect venue for visiting London, on business or for pleasure.",5,2018,06,17
133,Just book it!,"Stunning, amazing fantastic, fabulous, superb, outstanding ...... I could go on, but then you may say I am getting boring!  This is my favourite hotel .......ever!  I love staying here for the wonderful friendly service from all staff who work here.  Kamil gave us a wonderful welcome at reception, Gina was so helpful too!  The room we were given was, well what can we say?..........Stunning, amazing fantastic, fabulous, superb, outstanding oh soooo comfy and we always sleep so well.  Thank you to the house keeping staff for preparing the room to such high standards, it is absolute luxury.  Just what you want when you come for a break away from the workload grind.  We really cannot wait to return.  so... hopefully we will see you all soon! x",5,2018,06,17
133,Good Location,"This was our 4th visit to Royal Garden Hotel. The location is fabulous and the staff very impressive. However, it‚Äôs all looking very tired now and in need of a makeover. Rooms bit shabby now and need updating to more modern standards. ",3,2018,06,17
133,Thank you for being my second Home,I enjoyed my stay and I will certainly come again . And I would highly recommend you to my relatives and friends. My special thanks to Mr Paul Sur whom has been very helpful . And to all the staff. Until next time . ,5,2018,06,17
133,Would not rush back,"I booked a Queen room which was described on the hotel website as ‚Äòluxurious‚Äô. This was not the case. The room was extremely small, so small that the bathroom door was a slide open to save space. The bed was a basic double and the decor was tired. On the plus side the bedsheets and bathroom were clean and there was a nice view of Kensington Palace Gardens from the window. I stay in London on business all of the time and picked this hotel as it was near the event I was attending and has rave reviews on booking sites. I would not rush back there based on this experience.",3,2018,06,16
133,Fabulous Location!!,"My husband and I stayed here in a garden view room with king bed and it was quite spacious. Everything you‚Äôd expect from a 5 star hotel, very clean, great shower, very friendly and courteous staff. The location is perfect, lovely gardens to walk through and so close to the tube. Nightly turndown service was a lovely touch. The only thing I would say is the quality of paper products in bathroom (tissues, toilet paper, facial wipes) was a bit disappointing, quite rough on your skin. Will definitely stay again though, but maybe just get a Queen room next time as we didn‚Äôt really spend a lot of time in our room as so much to do!! And we paid fir garden view but from first floor, not too much garden to see!!",4,2018,06,16
133,Got the best ever service from hotel staff,"Besides checking the box for all the good things one usually looks for - good location,  convenient transportation and clean room, the hotel service is just beyond excellence. I went to the concierge staff on questions about shopping,  food, things-to-do recommendation,  and they always gave me a great answer. As a business traveller I admit that I didn't do any planning ahead, but the staff is very patient to even design the route for me to catch the nearby attractions. To share more, I forgot to pick up my blazer from the dry clean shop opposite to the hotel, while I needed to head to airport and fly off. The hotel staff was so kind to offer me with a pick up service and mailed it back to me. This is what I call the service is beyond excellence,  even compared to many hotels with big brands. In addition to great service,  the hotel is right next to Kensington Park (which is connected to Hyde Park),  where I did a relaxing morning run after a perfect breakfast at restaurants around the corner. Overall a great stay for me and I will surely keep it for my stay in London. ",5,2018,06,16
133,In the heart of the action,"I've stayed here quite a few times now and am always glad to book in. The doorman is excellent smiling and helpful. The reception staff efficient and concerned. 
The rooms are quiet and very clean but the air con is a bit noisy and hard to control.
If you can get a room facing the park on the higher floors it has a pleasant view. The best thing of all though is the position near to shops a wonderful Whole Foods provides you with magnificent organic food and a short hop on bus or tube takes you to Knightsbridge for Harrods or South Kensington for the V and A or British Museum. ",4,2018,06,16
133,Home from home,"My favourite bit staying in London , is he chance to stay in my home from home , I‚Äôve been a regular guest for almost ten years now , repeat custom is the best recommendation any business can get . This is a cracking hotel , worth every penny ",5,2018,06,16
133,Loved it!,"Great location, very clean, staff warm, friendly, and very helpful. It is easy to get around, with Kensington palace within walking distance, and the bus stop is right out front from the hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel. A very pleasant experience for my first time in London. ",5,2018,06,14
133,Outstanding stay!!!,"Excellent Staff who find ways of making

133,Superb Hotel,"The Royal Garden Hotel does not disappoint for the quality of service and comfort. The cuisine is well prepared and a visit to both restaurants were a delight. The service provided is thoughtful with attention to detail, professional and friendly but not intrusive. ",5,2018,06,13
133,Family catch up,"Quality hotel that we managed to book on a special deal which included breakfast and cocktail vouchers. Have stayed here a few times before so expectation were high and we weren't disappointed!
The car park beneath the hotel is now an NCP car park. Driving to the hotel is worth considering for a one night stay as it is outside of the congestion charge zone and pre-booking the parking cost ¬£38 for 24 hours which for me was more convenient ( and cheaper) than rail travel.",5,2018,06,12
133,A nice place to stay,Stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel for a couple of nights for a business trip. The overall experience was very nice although it was a bit disappointing that I was not able to get checked in to my room at the advertised time.  The staff was very helpful and the bar was very nice as well as the room. Everything was clean and comfortable. ,4,2018,06,12
133,Great Hotel.,"Excellent hotel where the staff are extremely helpful, friendly and polite. Food is always great espically in the Min Jaing.

133,Our 50th Wedding anniversary celebration,"Excellent service and food. The room was adequate for our needs. We would recommend this Hotel for a function and for the quality of the food. Good place just for a meal, in particular in the Chinese restaurant on the 10th floor.",5,2018,06,12
133,"Great Stay,Great Service,Great Facilities","We stayed here for one Saturday night and were thoroughly satisfied with everything,from the moment we arrived to when we left it was great,as we had planned a packed week-end in London we didn't spend much time at the hotel which was a great shame and disappointment to us,will definitely leave more time to just enjoy the Hotel and surrounding area next time.",5,2018,06,12
133,"Good location, helpful and polite staff","The staff at the Reception was very friendly, knowledgeable, efficient and helpful. 
The room size was smaller than expected. 
The Chinese restaurant Min Jian was excellent. Room service and breakfast very good.
I recommend the hotel and will most probably return in the future ",5,2018,06,10
133,Always good,This is a great place to stay. Staff always very helpful with the ability to meet needs required. Housekeeping good and a quick turnaround. Rooms always clean. Even where you might find dust.  Good coffee in the tea and coffee gousing.,4,2018,06,10
133,Weekend visit to see Chicago ,"We stayed here on a Travelzoo deal and we were very impressed. The service was second to none, we had a small well appointed room with great views over Kensington gardens and palace.
Breakfast was of excellent quality as were the cocktails we had in Bertie‚Äôs bar.
Overall an excellent experience and this would be my hotel of choice when staying in London from now on.",5,2018,06,10
133,Ideal location,Lovely hotel situated alongside Kensington Gardens and close to some favorite shops as well as easy access to trains and buses. Fabulous staff who are keen to please. Enjoyed dining at the restaurant on ground level where we met up with family.,5,2018,06,10
133,Great stay for Royal Albert Hall Show,Awesome visit to London to see Bill Burr at the Royal Albert Hall. Hotel is a perfect stroll away from the venue. Hotel room (Kings Room) was absolutely perfect. All staff were brilliant and the morning breakfast was absolutely gorgeous. Can't say enough good things!,5,2018,06,09
133,Another fantatsic stay!!,"My third stay and again another fantastic experience. What a great hotel, modern rooms, great views, impeccable service, friendly welcoming staff and beautifully crafted cuisine. When booking direct, you can take advantage of their Royalty Rewards, where they reach out to you before your stay and can customize it based on your needs, just another example of how they accommodate to you.  Try their restaurants, Park Terrace is amazing, there is such a warm and relaxing vibe there, whether its for lunch or dinner, each course is a beautifully crafted work of art and reasonably priced. Min Jiang on the 10th floor offers award winning cuisine and sweeping views of the London landscape, a must for any visitor. This hotel is a gem in the Kensington area and I can't emphasize enough what a treat you are in for when you stay!! You will be pampered :)   ",5,2018,06,08
133,"Excellent Service, Excellent Location","My wife and I and my brother and his wife stayed here while attending ""Beating the Retreat"" in Whitehall and we thoroughly enjoyed our brief stay. From the moment we walked through the door the service was exceptional. Maria on reception deserves special mention as she was so helpful and made us so welcome. The rooms are very well appointed, clean and comfortable. We definitely intend to come back again.",5,2018,06,08
133,From Africa with Love,"I have never experienced such great, friendly, speedy, and just overall excellent service as I have at the Royal Gardens. It was central especially for someone coming from a different country. Staff are happy and helpful! Its a wonderful place to be your home away from home! Thank you Royal Gardens ",5,2018,06,07
133,Greate hotel,"Great clean and spacious room with clean and beautiful bathroom. Great location at Hyde Park and short walk to everything.
Excellent service.
Jeg var uheldig og fors√∏kte Hilton Green Park, men ser at det ikke er noe poeng √• fors√∏ke ett annet hotell.",5,2018,06,06
133,First time at Royal Gardens.,"Staff where helpful getting my room ready early after I arrived soaked.

Room was fine, though its the first time I've come across a key activated room, at first I thought the lights had blown till I spotted the activation reader behind the door.

Good location with the underground station 5m walk to the right as you leave, and the Albert hall 10m to the left (attended a concert).",4,2018,06,05
133,Excellent,"Wonderful experience, room was clean but for what it costs I would have expected a better room . overall it was a wonderful experience and the staff were so accommodating and polite , food was delicious but 1
¬£12 for a small glass of wine is far too expensive .",5,2018,06,05
133,Stay at the Royal Garden Hotel,"We always enjoy our stay at the Royal Garden Hotel. Over the many years we have been staying at this hotel, it still maintains it's standards, and we have another superb evening meal at the Ming Jiang restaurant. ",5,2018,06,05
133,Weekend Break,The Hotel location was super. The staff were very polite and friendly.  Rooms were spacious and extremely clean.  Would definitely stay here again when we visit London and would recommend the hotel to all our friends.,5,2018,06,05
133,Feeling at home,nice designed rooms . Beds are incredibly comfortable and breakfast really well served in a nice ambience. With Kensigton gardens just beside your feel like walking into your garden. All in all a very comfortable and enjoyable stay.,5,2018,06,05
133,Great hotel in the best location in London,Service and staff very good - rooms dated however. So many eating places and pubs in the near vicinity and a short bus ride to the main centre of London. Shopping is very close with all major department stores within walking distance. Very nice part of London.,4,2018,06,04
133,Short stay in London,"Going to see Art Garfunkel at Albert Hall,royal garden ideal for this as walkable , Hotel in a good position for underground as well besides a walk in the park
Our room was ideal on 8 th floor away from any traffic noise, though street is not to bad",4,2018,06,04
133,As you would expect,Good welcome. On 8th floor but Room was better than last time we stayed. Breakfast included was good but had better previously. Car park handy but expensive. Location good. Handy bus routes run from outside hotel. ,5,2018,06,03
133,London Business Trip,"When I went back to Hotel in the late evening, my room Card was not working any longer. Then I went to Lobby to ask for new card and then it was mentioned, that it looked like checked out already. I received then new card and when I went to my room it was not serviced. I never experienced that before in any other hotel. Also I asked then for new towels and it took me a 2nd call after 15 minutes and then finally I got them after 20 minutes. ",2,2018,06,03
133,May stay,Lovely hotel with lovely staff. I was very surprised with the view from my room which was amazing! The only negative I would have to comment on is that the hotel is quite expensive but this is to be expected in the location in London. I am going to book again for myself and my family at the end of the month so I will be seeing you all soon :),5,2018,06,03
133,Wonderful experience,"We only stayed for 2 nights, however it was a wonderful experience from the time we checked in, until the day we checked out. Loved the area as well are the close proximatekybto Oxford street for shopping. This hotel went beyond my expectation.",5,2018,06,03
133,SA,"Excellent hotel.  Third stay.  Great staff. 
Showers need to be more consistent.  
Great views and access to public transport.  A great vibe in the lobby.  Great concierge.  Breakfast was amazing with great views of the park.  ",5,2018,06,03
133,Perfect place to stay in London,"I completely agree with many of the reviews already posted on this hotel. Everything about it was perfect! My husband and I stayed 2 nights for our anniversary and from start to finish the hotel and staff made the trip incredible. It is in an incredible location right next to Kensington Palace and Hyde Park which makes for wonderful walks or jogs right out the front door. We took our walk further on to Harrods,  Buckingham Palace and then to Picadily Circus for a light lunch. We did take a taxi back since that was about a. 3 mile jaunt. But we loved it. We enjoyed a beautiful breakfast of eggs Benedict at the hotel before heading out on our walk. The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. Steve, the impeccable Conciege assisted with every question and we tried 2 of his restaurant suggestions, both of which were fantastic. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this lovely hotel. The room was very big and we had a park view. This is my favorite place to stay in London, with fantastic location, incredible comfortable room, excellent dining and maybe most important was the superior staff. I highly recommend the Royal Garden.",5,2018,06,02
133,An overnight stay at the Kensington Garden Hotel,"My wife and had an overnight stay as part of an anniversary present  from our son and his family. We are not used to staying at such high quality establishments, but we we were put very much at our ease and enjoyed the experience immensely. The room was very comfortable and the bathroom facilities were excellent. 
Again the staff were very helpful at breakfast time and the food was excellent. When it came to checking out it was efficient and friendly. Congratulation s to all the staff who made our visit to London most enjoyable.",5,2018,06,02
133,Art Garfunkel at the Royal Albert Hall,"Wonderful hotel to enjoy the most amazing concert at the Royal Albert Hall. 
The hotel is a 5 minute walk from High Street Kensington tube and about the same to the Royal Albert Hall. 
Cocktails at the hotel after the concert were fabulous, but the breakfast even better!!
This would definitely be my hotel of choice on my next visit to the Royal Albert Hall. ",5,2018,06,02
133,Love this hotel!,"This is the only hotel in the world I never veer from. The location and the staff are second to none.  They make me feel like family and with my constant travel, that stands out!  Kensington High Street, tube stop, Whole Foods and Ken Palace/Hyde Park adjacent. Nothing better.  ",5,2018,06,02
133,Lovely hotel great location,"This is a very nice hotel right in Kensington high street. It is clean, staff are very friendly and helpful. If you want a central London hotel there are better options but if you want west London this is a great option. I will definitely stay again. Rooms are small but for London pretty standard. Decor a little dated but I would still recommend.",4,2018,06,01
133,Great Hotel!,"This hotel was spectacular!  It is in a great location, the staff is very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is very clean and very well priced for a high end hotel.
We had the best time!  We really loved it!
",5,2018,06,01
133,"Comfortable beds, great location","This is not the first time I have stayed at the Royal Garden however, I am always pleasantly surprised by the friendly, helpful staff, excellent location and comfort of the rooms.  As always a complete pleasure to stay and cant wait to come back.",5,2018,06,01
133,Anniversary visit,"Stayed one night for our wedding anniversary & to tie in with two evening events that we were attending. Location is very good, close to shops, transport & Kensington Gardens, leading into Hyde Park. Staff were extremely good, very helpful and attentive, the chocolates for our anniversary were much appreciated. Room was nice, quite small but reasonable size for Central London. Had drinks in Bertie‚Äôs Bar which was very pleasant but didn‚Äôt have breakfast which, at ¬£25 pp seemed on the expensive side. Overall a very nice stay.",4,2018,06,01
133,Still a great hotel,"My family and I stayed here for a night to celebrate my husband‚Äôs birthday. I booked directly with the hotel so we took advantage of the half term offers available (flick & food). The overall stay was enjoyable and the only cons i can think of were the followings:

- luggage arrived over 30min late to the room and had to ring concierge to chase as urgently required access to contents.

- executive room decor was dated and boring.

- breakfast area very crowded

I would still recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London as long as they dont mind being slightly away from all of the main attractions and willing to pay the high rates. ",4,2018,06,01
133,As you'd expect,"Our room was a generous size with a good outlook. We thought breakfast was expensive. Next time, we'd probably try to book direct. On the whole, a good hotel which we'd happily visit again. Difficult to see what more to add",4,2018,05,31
133,Nice Hotel to stay in,"When the first day I stepped in this hotel, the environment is very attractive.  The decoration of lobby is nice, not that many people around, quiet & comfortable.  The check in process is fast, we can go to the room quickly.  The layout of the room is very warm, clean & comfortable.   I can sleep tight until next day morning, did not wake up during the night due to the bed is very comfortable.  I rang the housekeeping & asked for iron & extra rack, they brought them within 15 minutes, we don't need to wait for a while.  Also the room has all kind of outlet, we could charged our phone & IPAD together.  I love the towel heater, with this facility, we felt warm after taking a bath.  Overall I will recommend this hotel to my friends & relatives.  It is such a good experience to live in Royal Garden Hotel.",5,2018,05,31
133,For being an hotel it was good but for being a more luxury hotel it was only okey,"I don‚Äôt think it qualified for the price or the expectations at all. The service was okey. Some staff were nicer then others. The room service was good regarding the brought in but the food was not to recommend. The breakfast was really nothing extra and I‚Äôm also used to more alternatives. 
I wouldn‚Äôt stay there again.",3,2018,05,30
133,Beautiful!!,"We stayed here for one night on Sunday March 27th, we prebooked via travel zoo and got an amazing deal, we arrived to a prepaid cocktail at a cost of ¬£11 each, we asked for G&T‚Äôs and a Lager shandy so traded for this instead of the cocktail at no charge, however there were plenty of cocktails to choose from if you would like one.
Our room overlooked Kensington Palace Gardens (608) and was spotless!!! The room, robes and slippers along with Pentaligons toiletries were fab!!! The bathroom was also spotless and the cleaner had a real eye for detail. We ate locally on the High St for our evening meal (The Ivy) and there are many places to choose from. The bar,in the Hotel is really great and usual prices for London. We parked in the Hotel for ¬£44 which is great for London. I would recommend this Hotel for location, great staff, security and good food, our breakfast at a cost of ¬£22 each was also included and you just cannot fault anything. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong........I tend not to do negative reviews as I would rather not review but this is a little gem in London not to be missed!!! We will return.
Thank you. oh.....there is an iconic Chinese restaurant on floor 5. It we just didn‚Äôt have time to eat there........well,done Royal Garden!!!!",5,2018,05,30
133,Phenomenal Find!,Absolutely loved the location and found all of the staff- from the front desk to the wait staff to the concierge- to be phenomenal!  Will stay here my next visit and would highly recommend this hotel to my friends and family.,5,2018,05,30
133,Excellent stay,"We stayed in celebration of my birthday and were given an upgraded room overlooking Kensington Gardens as well as a bottle of wine and chocolates! The staff were  universally friendly, helpful and efficient and I would strongly recommend the Park View Restaurant for dinner. It is worth booking directly with the hotel as you then benefit from their Rewards Programme  - I believe the actual reward depends on the hotel but on our previous stay we were given an upgraded room.  The rooms are well appointed and it is worth having one with a view over the Gardens. Our room had both a bath and a shower with Penhaligon toiletries. It is worth noting however that the mattresses are quite firm and won't suit you if you prefer a soft mattress. ",5,2018,05,30
133,A Stay Fit For  Royalty,"Stunning views, family-friendly, luxurious and great rates too, this hotel not only benefits from it's superb Kensington location but also it's modern interiors, amazing food (and room service) and the most welcoming of staff.",5,2018,05,30
133,Another great stay,"My third time staying here and it was lovely, per usual. Great staff all around and I would not think of staying anywhere else. If you need something, Steve at concierge must certainly be the best in London! Small rooms are the only drawback but they are quite comfortable regardless. ",5,2018,05,30
133,A very Royal stay,Great hotel and neighbouring our Royal family at Kensington Palace.  So nice to have Hyde Park next door and the lovely walks and amenities therein.  So close to the Royal Albert Hall so great for visiting London from another angle.  Also not too far to walk/bus/tube into the centre of London.,5,2018,05,30
133,elias paphitis,"The staff were just incredibly professional, so friendly, so kind, so helpful, smiley, chatty and could not be better.  I went with my wife was our 29 th Anniversary The room was large with a larger than normal size bathroom, which is quite rare in London. Loved the bathroom and bedroom. We had complimentary Champagne and  chocolates as well as complimentary bottled water. The king size bed was amazing  incredibly comfortable. The room was fantastic. ",5,2018,05,30
133,Perfect location,"A perfect location right near Kensington palace and gardens. Our room was road side but wasn't noisy at all. Taxi rank was fantastic.. didn't have to worry about when we'd be ready , just get one when ready. ¬£12 into Chelsea for an amazing dinner at ivy garden after being at Chelsea flower show. The only issue for us was cost of room very expensive (fine as a treat) so weren't happy to pay ¬£50 for breakfast. We walked into Hyde park had it there which was amazing anyway. Late check out time of 12 meant we weren't rushing. Staff so friendly. View from Chinese restaurant incredible.. we had a drink before going out. Highly recommended doing this! ",5,2018,05,30
133,Very nice hotel,"This was a real five star experience, The staff were friendly and courteous fro the moment we rung up to book the rooms, to the moment we checked out and waved goodbye. Breakfast was fantastic, lots of choice and the quality was very high. Berties Bar is very laid back and ideal for a relaxing drink, but if you prefer something a little less expensive you can visit The Goat which is opposite the hotel. Kensington shops also very close. The hotel rooms have a traffic light system where you can let housekeeping know if you want your room serviced, or alternative, if you do not want to be disturbed. Location is great. Kensington Palace is close by and while you can't exactly visit Kate and Meghan for a quick cuppa, you can see the public parts if the palace and the gardens are gorgeous. Our room view was of Kensington High Street, not spectacular but if you are lucky enough to get a room on the other side of the hotel you would be looking out on the greenery of Hyde Park. We went to a few West End shows, and taxi fare was about ¬£20 and took about 25 to 40 minutes depending on traffic. The rooms were large, beds comfy and the bathroom was great, spacey and modern. Would recommend without hesitation.",5,2018,05,29
133,My go to in London,"This is my regular hotel in London. My room requests are always met, the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, and I appreciate free wifi and late night room service as those are crucial when on business trips.  ",5,2018,05,29
133,Lovely central hotel,"We‚Äôve been lucky enjoygh to stay at the Royal Garden several times for work and for pleasure and the location, the room cleanliness and comfort, the food quality and most of all the high quality staff and service make this place a wonderful experience. Some rooms are a bit smaller but overall you really can‚Äôt go wrong- with the location many rooms have views over the park and the sausages at breakfast are the best!!",5,2018,05,28
133,Top service,"I just wanted to menton here that Nimfa should be voted nr1 when it comes to delivering service in 5star hotels. She pays attention to detail, smiles, remembers your preferences, etc. Too many hotels miss out on the importance of service during breakfast, the start of everyone's day...particularly if you pay top dollar.",5,2018,05,28
133,Wonderful but...,"Although this place was excellent in relation to location, I was extremely surprised to find I needed to pay a check-in amount of ¬£250 ($500Au) which I was assured would be returned when I checked out. I am still waiting for this to be done! Another person I travelled with had the $500 withdrawn twice! The last thing you want on your holiday is to be chasing up your money. Apart from this, the stay was very pleasant.",3,2018,05,28
133,Superb service and value for money!,"Really refreshing to stay in a hotel where all the staff we encountered were very friendly and efficient. The breakfast staff were incredibly attentive especially our waiter, Gabon. He was exceptional and nothing was too much trouble. Our room overlooked Kensington Palace and was spotless. We normally stay in whatever hotel has the best rate whenever we come to London but we will probably just come back to The Royal Garden in future as it was a pleasure to stay there. Thank you!",5,2018,05,27
133,Fabulous overnight stay,"The hotel is perfectly located for attractions such as the Royal Albert Hall and the major museums. A first class hotel, the rooms are superb and the staff excellent. It was an ideal choice for an overnight visit.",5,2018,05,27
133,A wonderful hotel!,"My wife and I stayed at this fabulous hotel for four nights this past week. We were warmly welcomed by the front desk receptionist, Andrea, who showed us to our room and made sure that everything was to our satisfaction. The room was impeccably clean and equipped with modern amenities that we expect from a five-star hotel. The hotel service staff were attentive to our needs. They went out of their way to  make our stay as comfortable and pleasant as possible. Do try their afternoon tea party. You will not be disappointed. We thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon tea party. It was a memorable experience for us! ",5,2018,05,26
133,Honeymoon,This was my second time staying at this hotel. The staff and service is excellent. Rooms are clean with amazing views. Easy walking distance to 2 tube stations and multiple bus stops. Breakfast buffet is out of this world!,5,2018,05,26
133,First Class Hotel in perfect spot,"Wonderful service, room, restaurant, bar, location all perfect. Couldn't fault anything.we did have a deal so made the break very affordable. Close for Chelsea Flower Show which we were attending, but had the peace for a good rest.",5,2018,05,26
133,My stay at the Royal Garden,"I had a wonderful time during my stay at the Royal Garden Hotel. The staff from top to bottom was friendly, helpful and pleasant to interact with. The rooms, restaurants, and other facilities were world class. This will be my hotel of choice in future trips to London.",5,2018,05,26
133,Another fine stay,"I spent three nights at the Royal Garden Hotel.

It was yet another fine stay. This is my go-to hotel when in London (although rates are quite high). Staff are great and the location is excellent.

I look forward to my next stay.",5,2018,05,25
133,Comfortable,"Stayed here for two nights. The location is very nice; the neighbouring streets have a good selection of shops, caf√©s and restaurants, and the park is just around the corner. My Queen Room was comfortable enough, but its interior location didn't merit the price: my colleagues were both placed on higher floors, whilst I got a first floor room directly overlooking the concrete roof above the entrance and a bus stop -- a view as charming as wet cardboard. Still, all in all a good experience, considering everything but the view and the interior location. Excellent breakfast.",4,2018,05,24
133,Well located - Great Staff -  Nice Rooms,"Spent 3 nights here in late May in a Kings Room which had views of Kensington Park. A very nice good sized room. Very clean and good bathroom facilities. Internetworked well and staff across the board were very helpful and courteous.

In  particular the room service was excellent. They have the ability to spin out some very nice meals, some of which are not mentioned in the in-room dining menu.

The room was well appointed, the bed nice and firm, bathroom facilities up to date and very clean. The room had a seating area that accommodted a two seater lounge easily.

In terms of location, you cant go wrong with an abundance of cafes and restaurants sprinkling the surrounding area.

All in all a very pleasent stay.

Well recommended.",4,2018,05,24
133,Great location and fantastic service,Stayed here over the Royal wedding weekend.  Check in was a breeze.  They had our room ready before check in time which was awesome considering we were arriving from overseas.  The front desk staff was incredible.  They were welcoming and efficient.  The concierge was great.  Hayden gave us a great recommendation for dinner and helped situate us with all our sightseeing needs.,4,2018,05,23
133,Good friendly servicz,I have not stayed at this hotel for many years. The room was spacieuse and clean as well as modern. The service at breakfast was friendly and professional. The food was well prepared. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hotel and congratulate the good management of this hotel.,5,2018,05,23
133,Brilliant Hotel,"Best thing about this hotel was the friendly brilliant staff.
They couldn't do enough to help and advise.
Its location is a little out of the west end. Cost ¬£22 by taxi last Saturday night each way.
Local Tube station was closed last weekend. Took over an hr to get there by different busses from Euston. This is not the hotels fault. after getting advise from the staff a bus to Green Park then Tube to Euston on he way back took just 30mins.
food in the hotel was first class.
Loved it",5,2018,05,23
133,This is so much more than a business hotel,"We had a great stay in May, in a garden view room. Great view, comfortable room, and really great service. The location of this hotel is also great, just on the corner of Kensington Gardens, with Kensington/Notting Hill in walking distance and easy access to the Subway. This hotel is a ",5,2018,05,23
133,Noisy small room,"Very small room for a five star hotel with bathroom ventilation noise over night.
The location is ok and the behavier of the staff was correct but could be more friendly.
It is a five star hotel that doesn¬¥t fulfill the expectations.     ",3,2018,05,23
133,royal garden but only up at 5th,"i have a room just front the lift ..it was awful....very Noisy at each way of lift, each ring of lift
the room was clean, bed well and the bath room with a bath and an shower was fine.
if you want a very nice view on the garden ask to be up than the 4r floor.",2,2018,05,23
133,Wonderful stay at this lovely hotel,"We recently stayed for two nights at this hotel.  The purpose of our visit to London was for a hospital appointment, so we were not really looking forward to our time there.  However, the hotel was wonderful, the staff, without exception, very friendly and helpful and our room (a king bedroom) was well equipped with a comfortable bed and excellent bathroom.  The breakfast each day was delicious and way above average for a hotel breakfast.  We had dinner in the Park Restaurant on the second night and this too was delicious.  It was my husband's birthday and he was surprised with birthday petit fours and a candle!  This hotel will definitely be our first choice when staying in London in future.",5,2018,05,22
133,Very good,"Very nice hotel in a very nice location of London. Super friendly and service minded staff. The beds where just according to our taste, not to soft, nor to hard. It's not the cheapest hotel in London, but that was not expected :-)",4,2018,05,22
133,Stay,The hotel is excellent situated at a very good location. The staff was very polite and very nice. The rooms were clean and tidy. The food was amazing.Each and every staff was helpful.i enjoyed my stay. Will definitely stay with the hotel whenever I go back to London.,5,2018,05,22
133,Almost Perfect,"The only complaint I have is that when they cleaned our room after our first night, they didn't replace the washcloths.  Otherwise, everything was neat and clean, the bed was comfortable, the breakfast, which was included, was great.",5,2018,05,21
133,Great hotel,Stayed here for our anniversary on the weekend of the royal wedding. Couldn‚Äôt fault it. Very friendly check in staff. Couldn‚Äôt do more to help. Room was great. Well equipped and great view over London. The bar was great too. Lovely cocktails. Just outside the hotel are the royal parks so loads to walk around and see. If you need the underground it is a 2 minute walk. Definitely stay again. Thanks! ,5,2018,05,21
133,Another wonderful experience!,"Having stayed at this hotel in February this year and been very impressed, my friend and I stayed again in March when we were in London for a concert.  We were not disappointed.

Once again, this hotel delivered on all levels.  I requested an early check-in and the room was ready upon arrival at 11am, which was much appreciated.

We had a king garden room which gave us a stunning view over Kensington Gardens and Palace, as well as across London.  The room was spacious and clean.  The bathroom spotless.

Room service was excellent, the food delicious and person delivering it to the room was polite and friendly.

All of the staff I have encountered at this hotel have been so friendly, helpful, efficient and professional.  They cannot do enough for you and always make sure they are meeting your expectations.

We had breakfast in the Park Terrace and it was absolutely delicious.  Breakfast at hotels can often be of a muchness... however, the food here was all very fresh, had lots of flavour, and again, the staff were so lovely.  

During our stay, I was remembered from my stay a few weeks previously and the staff surprised my friend and I with a gift of chocolates, simply as a thank you for returning to the hotel!  What a lovely touch.

We also had Sunday Lunch in the Park Terrace Restaurant - again, absolutely delicious!  Very relaxing, excellent quality of food and superb value for money.  It is a lovely setting for lunch - overlooking Kensington Gardens, it is light, airy and relaxing.

This hotel always makes you feel like they genuinely want you there and are delighted you have chosen to stay there.  Every staff member I have encountered has made me feel like the most important person there.  It is hotel with quiet elegance that makes you feel comfortable and relaxed.

I am visiting London again in a week and have once again booked this hotel - I actually can't wait for another lovely weekend at this hotel.",5,2018,05,20
133,Terrific venue for the iCAAD 2018 conference,"I was impressed by the staff and the beauty of the hotel. The iCAAD conference was a success and the staff of the venue helped a great deal. The set of of the rooms was impeccable, the response to the needs of the clients was swift, and the atmosphere they helped create made me personally very pleased. I liked the location a good deal.",5,2018,05,19
133,Great staff and location,"Service as a whole was fantastic but let down with our room not being ready until 3.50 when check in is at 2pm, which meant our plans had to change. Would highly recommend booking direct as the upgrade and additions made the trip that little bit more special or acceptable when 2 hours late checking in.  ",4,2018,05,18
133,70th Birthday Celebration,Stayed in The Royal Garden Hotel as part of a trip to the capital to celebrate my partners  70th birthday The hotel was ideally situated and the room and breakfast were very good I wished l had booked a Kings Room as it would have overlooked Kensington Gardens instead of Kensington High Street(in a Queens Room)The staff were very friendly,4,2018,05,18
133,Great location and great service,"Staff is always very friendly here and the rooms and baths are top notch.
Several good restaurants close by, as well as buses and tube station just down the road makes it an excellent location to stay at. That said, you don't even have to leave the hotel for a good meal as the 10th floor restaurant has a great view of the park and delicious food. Will definitely return.
Ask for a room with a park view and

133,"Beautiful hotel, perfectly situated and a must if you are in London.","Sadly we only stayed one night, to attend an exhibition at the town hall.  The Royal Garden is just the best hotel.  From arriving, every member of staff make you feel so welcome.  They are friendly, bright and quite obviously care that your stay is just perfect.  Good sized, immaculate rooms, with every special touch you could wish for. Our evening meal in Park Terrace was superb.  Again, very attentive staff, the menu choice was excellent and the food divine.  Very good value for money also.
I can't wait to return",5,2018,05,17
133,Great Staff and perfect location!,"The staff is really great and very welcoming. Accommodation is up to standard without anything special!
Location is really a big benefit to this hotel and moving around is easy!
There are plenty of restaurants  where you can have good food!i will definitely use the hotel again!",5,2018,05,16
133,Superb Hotel,"We stayed in one of the Garden Rooms and were delighted to find that the room exceeded the rather glossy pictures on the website!  The rooms are spacious, views are stunning and the staff are genuinely helpful.  We will most definitely stay here again. PS - Book direct for extra special service :-)",5,2018,05,15
133,2-week stay,"The hotel is comfortable but the heating/cooling system is either on or off, nothing in between. Great gym and proximity to Hyde Park. The food is very good; the Tiang Ming food is incredible but service is a bit slow. Staff is super friendly. ",5,2018,05,15
133,Great hotel,"We stayed for 2 nights, we were welcomed by friendly professional staff.
We had 2 rooms which were very clean and spacious. 
The location is perfect, right on high street Kensington short walk to the park. 
Lots of chops and very good restaurants in the area. 
If I had one complaint it would be the hallways to the rooms need a bit of a tidy up, otherwise everything was excellent and we will be definitely visiting again. ",5,2018,05,15
133,Birthday Stay,We have been staying here for nearly 20yrs as a family. We have celebrated milestone birthdays and had our mini honeymoon here. On this occassion it was to celebrate a surprise 70th birthday. The staff werent very helpful to my husband as we wanted to decorate table etc. We were told as you have bought your own cake it will be ¬£5 per head to eat it but if you chose a dessert it is free. I understand where hotels charge corkage but is this now cakeage?? Marco did rectify this but it didnt think was good. My mum recieved no extras for her birthday in room like cake or wine etc as we had on previous stays. Before our stay our room direct with hotel was ¬£268 per night but then i get an email from travelzoo ssaying hotel directly are charging ¬£179 per night inc breakfast etc for a king room. I emailed the hotel to see if there was any reduction and go a direct no as i paid directly and in advance which i had to as it was a birthday. I just feel that the hotel has lost sight of it returning customers especially as their system shows them our time spent at the hotel over the years. I have given them a 4 out of 5 as rooms are excellent and generally so are the staff but on this occassion we as a family of 5 felt it wasnt good.  ,4,2018,05,15
133,a structure to recommend,"Thanks, I was fine, but if I have to make a criticism, being a subject that suffers from allergic asthma I did not like the location of the room, there was no view ... when I booked I had seemed to understand that it was seen park .... so I expected a room more spacious and with slightly larger beds ... but I must say that all in all the structure is very functional staff is attentive, and the location is strategic for travel, I will return with great pleasure in this hotel ... maybe with a more airy room :))",4,2018,05,14
133,Wonderful staff and loved the location!,We originally had another hotel booked in Kensington and luckily we cancelled when we found the Royal Garden Hotel which was a 5 star and onlky slightly higher. It was our first visit to London and it could not have ,5,2018,05,14
133,Next to Kensington Palace,I expected a bigger size room for the price.  Especially one that over looks High Street Ken.  But it is next to the park.  There are professional staff.  The towels and toileteries and bed are excellent quality.  ,3,2018,05,14
133,Super Hotel,"Love this hotel for its location and staff. We had a room looking across at Kensington palace.
Fantastic breakfast, great rooms and lovely staff.
Shops are only a 2 minute walk away, with Kensington gardens about 5 minutes walk.",5,2018,05,13
133,Very Nice Hotel,This hotel is in good location with the Kensington garden and Hyde park within walking distance. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The staff were helpful and welcoming. I am pleased with my stay and will come again in the future.,4,2018,05,12
133,"Excellent staff and location,","I have stayed monthly at this hotel for a good few years, staff excellent and location. I love the spacious rooms, however it is needing a bit of upgrade cost is expensive though I have a rate, I am looking at cost and similar stard hotels are not as costly.",4,2018,05,12
133,Bad guest service,"The stuff was not able to get flowers for me, no will for an effort. No update for the Spa, which doesn't exist anymore, since....? It's in the booklet in the room and a button on the phone, but not remote.",2,2018,05,12
133,Luxury and Perfection,This hotel has everything  and everything is perfect. Beautiful views of Kensington Gardens and top quality room fittings with total soundproofed windows. Sleep quality was 100%. The spacious bathroom with top quality fittings and all the luxurious accessories one could wish for. Breakfasts were sumptuous and served in restful surroundings by attentive and friendly staff. A welcome anniversary plate of chocolates from an oasis in the centre of London. Perfect for our 52nd Anniversary. Thank you Royal Garden Hotel. We will certainly return.,5,2018,05,11
133,Business Trip,"Excellent great room, very comfortable. I do like to have tea/coffee making facilities though of which there weren't any. We had Room Service breakfast which was lovely but of course the hot water cools off by the time it reaches the room so my passion for hot tea was not achieved.",5,2018,05,11
133,Bad housekeeping,"Cheese from previous guest in fridge! And worst of all we walked in to our room after breakfast to our surprise we found our new sheets and pillows cases on the floor like a doormat infront of bathroom,I was shocked at their hygiene level ,",2,2018,05,10
133,Used to be one of my fav hotels but not anymore,"The location of the hotel is the best! in the beautiful High Street Kensington, very close to Kensington Gardens and Holland Park. Walking distance to Notting Hill, Bayswater, Marble Arch and many places. 

but this hotel needs renovation. it is outdated. If you plan to stay at this hotel, bring your towels with you, their towels are very very old and smelly. 

",3,2018,05,10
133,This hotel is wonderful! The staff is delightful and the view from my room is stunning!,"If you can, you must stay here. The room was comfortable and well stocked. The location couldn't be better. Right next to Kensington Park. There is some construction across from the hotel but I don't think you could walk three blocks without seeing some kind of restoration or even new building going on at least in Kensington right now. The staff was delightful but you need to watch out for ""bank holidays""",5,2018,05,08
133,Excellent atmosphere ,Very nice location very friendly the food was excellent in the Chinese restaurant and the breakfast was delicious it was quite all the premiere league was live also the UEFA champions was live really excellent ,5,2018,05,08
133,Wonderful stay,"Very welcoming helpful and friendly staff, amazing room view of Kensington Mews. Our room wasn‚Äôt cleaned properly so we spoke to reception and it was sorted very quickly and we even received a complimentary bottle of wine. Amazing comfortable bed. Would stay again, central to the Royal Albert Hall. ",5,2018,05,08
133,Hotel Conference,"Attended a business conference at this meeting. What an excellent venue.  From the moment I got out of the car till I stepped back in to leave... Outstanding warm, friendly staff with attention to detail.  Great room and excellent food.",5,2018,05,07
133,Review of Royal Garden Hotel,It's a wonderful hotel for families - especially impressed with what they have to offer children to make their stay enjoyable and memorable.  Service is outstanding here as well as the food.  The staff goes above and beyond and it's what makes this hotel a real gem in the heart of London.,5,2018,05,04
133,Not a 5 start hotel,"Its very expensive for what it actually is. This is not a 5 stars hotel. The website is deceiving and when you arrived you are disappointed. The facilities are dated. The location is far from the action, even though is next door to the Kensington Palace. ",3,2018,05,03
133,True Comfort,Aside from the excellent location the room was exceptionally comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful. London hotel rooms have a tendency to feel slightly claustrophobic but our room at this hotel was really quite large.  Our go to hotel in London when visiting the city.,5,2018,05,02
133,A wonderful stay,Thank you to all involved for a truly wonderful stay. Lovely clean rooms with comfortable beds and bedding. A fantastic breakfast offering and friendly and helpful staff. We look forward to returning soon!,5,2018,05,01

133,Good stay,"Great location for our business meeting, very near the tube station.  Good restaurants and bars close at hand.  Very clean and tidy hotel. Staff very helpful and friendly.  Lovely breakfast with good choice of fruit and cereal, hot choice was good.",4,2018,04,30
133,A great discovery,"As I had not heard of the hotel before our stay, i did not know what to expect however, I found it to be outstanding in every respect.  The hotel staff we met were all friendly, professional and helpful.  Gosia for example provided a first class welcome and check in experience. This level of professionalism was reflected in other areas of the hotel, particularly the dining room where, once again staff proved to be a credit to the organisation. 
The hotel rooms were fabulous and had incredible views over the park.  In fact, the excellent location of the hotel meant that we spent much time in Kensington Palace Gardens and exploring the surrounding area, which  proved to be the highlight of our visit. 
The food served in the hotel was extremely good, so much so that we ate in the hotel far more than we had intended.  It was always nice to return to the calmness of the hotel environment. 
This will,  in future, be our first choice of hotel in London.",5,2018,04,30
133,Very good place to stay,"The hotel has a perfect location, very close to the Kensington High Street Station and major amenities. The views from the top rooms are incredible and the rooms are clean, although the towels in my bathroom appeared quite dirty and probably need brand new sets. Staffs are polite and friendly; although I did not eat at any of the restaurants, I assume they will be quite good too. ",5,2018,04,30
133,Garden of grace,Very accommodating. They were able to polish my shoes last minute. They helped us with a luggage malfunction. All the staff was very nice and attentive. Location is great as well. Could not ask for anything more.,5,2018,04,30
133,Perfect!,"I have just spent the most wonderful few days staying here with my youngest daughter and meeting up with my other older children.  Everything was simply so perfect that it is difficult to know where to start... marvellous room, glorious view, fantastic Chinese meal at the 10th floor restaurant, super breakfasts, and quite simply the most outstanding staff.  We all enjoyed ourselves so much and so I thank everyone at this hotel for being part of creating our family's memorable weekend. Amazing!",5,2018,04,29
133,Outstanding Staff,"This hotel has a fantastic location - offering immediate central London facilities along with being located adjacent to Kensington Gardens. The best of city and park-land and both within seconds of the hotel. 
The hotel is excellent - facilities, options, food, rooms and extras. 
The truly world-class element to this property is it's staff. I have not found a hotel in the UK with this standard of staff throughout. The staff are professional, friendly and very well engaged. They understand every request in an efficient, appropriate and friendly manner. I was bowled over by your staff and it made our entire trip to London. What a special experience.",5,2018,04,29
133,Another enjoyable stay at the Royal Garden Hotel,"Great location, great food. Room was immaculately clean. But the overriding compliment is how happy, friendly and helpful ALL the staff are from receptionists, waiters to cleaners. Makes such a difference and the sign of a well run hotel",5,2018,04,29
133,A great stay,"Lovely staff, not obtrusive. Lovely, helpful and professional. All of the categories asked below were great but there was a little hole/rip  in the desk chair seat, Tiny as it was, it was there and we noticed it. However we loved our stay and would highly recommend the view from room 939 beautiful! ",5,2018,04,28
133,A Quiet and comfortable stay,"This was a really nice hotel in a perfect location for enjoying Kensington Gardens and is literally a 5 minute walk to the Royal Albert Hall and less than a minute to Hyde park

The staff were very friendly and helpful. The doormen never once said hi to us as we were entering or exiting the hotel but would do to other guests. 

Our room was a good size, comfortable as well as cleaned to a good standard and despite overlooking the road it was mostly quiet.

The hot drinks and toiletries provided were of a good quality and the room had a nice bath although the shower wasn't great.

A couple of features, like the ipod docking station (most people have Iphone 5's + or newer ipods with different charging ports ) and the TV seemed a bit dated with limited functionality but these are just minor things.

Finally, breakfast was a bit steep for us at ¬£25 a head, but there are some cafes close by and some shops such as M&S and Waitrose within short walking distances to get some form of meal.",4,2018,04,28
133,Royal Garden Birthday Weekend,Great location. Shower over bath not very modern. Staff excellent. Will be back next month. Food in the Terrace Rest. was excellent.....starter of belly pork and scallops was lovely. Thanks to all for a great stay.,4,2018,04,28

133,Excellent Hotel in all respects.,"This is one of the best hotels we have stayed in in London and we have stayed at the top hotels. The staff are beyond professional , kind and helpful.  the breakfast was excellent and a good choice of food. We wanted to stay longer.  Also the hotel is so well placed for Kings Road and Kensington High street so very good shopping on the door step.l  Not to mention the Theaters. Cannot speak highly enough.  This is our Hotel of choice when we come to London.",5,2018,04,24
133,Comfort with great service,"It was my wife‚Äôs 50th birthday so the staff went the extra mile to make our stay very special, providing an upgrade and special touches in the room and at breakfast. We had a room with an exceptional view of Kensington palace and the gardens.",5,2018,04,24
133,London Marathon 2018,"Staff were excellent, friend and very helpful. Check-in was easy and we didn't have to lug our bags around. I came down for the London Marathon and they went out of there way to get sports gels, jelly baby's, water and fruit which I thought was very nice and thoughtful. Overall great hotel and would recommend it to anyway going to London. ",5,2018,04,24
133,"Good location, average otherwise","This is a good, clean, average hotel room.  Well priced as we travelled with our kids and wanted connecting rooms.  Wagamama is next door as is Whole Foods and Au Pain Quotodien so we didn‚Äôt eat in hotel.  The staff are below average, and you don‚Äôt really know them nor do they know or care to know you.",3,2018,04,23
133,Nice hotel in a beautiful location,"The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were immaculately clean, and a decent size, especially in comparison to most EU hotels. The location was lovely, right next to Kensington, which was a very pretty part of the city. Location felt very safe, and fairly centrally located making travel around the city easy and walkable. I very much enjoyed my stay, and would recommend this hotel. I will definitely stay here on my future London travels!",5,2018,04,23
133,Excellent One Night Stay!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Royal Garden Hotel in April 2018. The staff were incredibly friendly, polite and attentive and the hotel itself was beautiful. The lobby area is very impressive and spacious and the same can be said for the rooms. We stayed in a standard Queen room which had everything we could require: a comfortable bed, seating area, television, free WiFi, safe, mini bar, good sized wardrobe and a spotlessly clean bathroom with powerful shower and excellent amenities - the robe and flip flops are a lovely touch! The breakfast in the morning was delicious with plenty of choice. The location of the hotel is great, overlooking Kensington Gardens and only a 5-10 minute walk from either Kensington High Street tube station or Queensway tube station. Could not fault our stay!",5,2018,04,23
133,Great service,"The service at the Royal Garden Hotel was awesome.  My friend and I arrived late one Saturday night for a girls trip, and were quickly pointed to a late night food option by the hotel staff that became a mainstay of our trip.  The hotel generously upgraded our room and we had a perfect view of Kensington Palace.  The accommodations were roomy, and overall, the hotel was a great value for the price.  I will certainly stay at the RGH on future trips to London!",5,2018,04,21
133,Our new favourite hotel,"We stayed here as a family of 6 and were really impressed with our stay from start to finish.  Firstly, this was the only hotel that we found that could accommodate us and all of our children in one room - a must given that the children are all quite young. Secondly, the service was impeccable from check in to check out and everything in between.  The room we had was spacious, clean and had an amazing view of Kensington Palace and the gardens.  There were nice touches for the kids too, such as scooter hire that made their stay an enjoyable one.  The other thing to be said is that the hotel is in a great location and well connected for access to west and central London.  We will be definitely be staying here again!",5,2018,04,17
133,Best Family Hotel in London - Magical Place !,"We our a family of hour with 2 young boys aged seven and five, and stay at the Royal Garden Hotel 4 or 5 times per year, and it's one of the best and most family-friendly hotels we've stayed at.

The children love the place - they get free scooters to whizz around Hyde Park on and enjoy the attention and engagement from the staff at the hotel who always go out of their way to speak to them. The food/drinks selection for children is almost as comprehensive as an adult's menu which is great as they get a proper choice as opposed to many children's menus which often feel like a bit of a token gesture.

It's in a great location, particularly if you have a room with a view of Hyde Park, and is in walking distance of various attractions - Albert Hall, History Museum etc, but particularly in the summer, then there's nothing better than taking the scooters and a picnic into Hyde Park, and also taking a pedalo out on the Serpentine.

The Concierge are one of the most helpful I've used, and are worth their weight in gold if you need tickets or advice on events.

The hotel is independent, and I think what sets them apart from some of their chain branded competitors is just how friendly and genuine all of the staff are.

My advice would be to book directly with the hotel and contact them in advance, as if you have any special requirements and/or are travelling with children then they can help accommodate most requests.

Finally, pretty much every time we've stayed at the hotel, we've bumped into someone famous - sports stars, musicians, actors etc which is normally a good barometer of the quality of service offered at a hotel.

Keep up the good work and we'll see you soon !",5,2018,04,16
133,Best Address in Kensington,"Best location in Kensington , ease of access and travel. There are lovely views of Kensington Gardens and you can access the gardens without having to cross the road. Kensington High Street has many shops and restaurants, you do not have to take a Cab to get around.
",5,2018,04,15
133,Pleasant Hotel,"I would go out for breakfast, there is a great Bistro if you turn right out of the hotel. The staff were really friendly, especially the girl who checked me in I wish I could remember her name. Rooms were clean and in room coffee was great.",4,2018,04,15

133,Service was amazing,"Amazing location and brilliant service. Could not do more to help. From the moment we arrived the service was impeccable - nothing was too difficult. Right balance of support and space. Hotel is in a perfect location for London, museums, walking etc. I would highly recommend this hotel for families.",5,2018,04,10
133,Wonderful ,Stayed in 2 garden view twin rooms.  Wonderful helpful staff and lovely clean room with the most wonderful view of Hyde Park.  Beds were wonderfully comfortable.  Room was a lovely size and breakfast was great too.  We had a few cocktails in Bertie‚Äôs Bar which were lovely.   One small thing I didn‚Äôt like was on early check in on Saturday morning the whole reception smelt of fried breakfast?!  Did not put me off and I will certainly be back.  Have been looking for a London hotel which didn‚Äôt charge the earth and now I found it. üíû,5,2018,04,09
133,Wonderful hotel and staff,Wonderful hotel and staff clean and comfy rooms nice location every thing you need under you secured and safe any service you want they can arrange for you we booked airport transportation and restaurant ,5,2018,04,09
133,Only the view of the room I pay for sweet I thought I will have park or garden but the view only for buildings and I,Only the view of the room I pay for sweet I thought I will have park or garden but the view only for buildings and I Was disappointed and I booked long the time so it can be grunted for me and I call them about the view but they didn‚Äôt give my nice view ,5,2018,04,07
133,Excellent  Hotel,This is our favourite hotel in London. For location and friendly service and well appointed comfortable rooms and great staff. Many thanks for a wonderful stay. We will recommend the hotel to our friends,5,2018,04,06
133,Great location and superb customer service,"Stayed for 2 nights over the Easter break and primarily booked this hotel due to it being a 5 min walk from the tube and 10 min walk from the Royal Albert Hall (attended a concert there). As it was our first stay, we were upgraded to a king room by the very professional and friendly gentleman on reception and we were delighted by our room - very spacious and spotlessly clean. All the hotel staff we encountered during our stay were fabulous and really did make us feel very special. I also need to give a special shout out to Cristian who served us on numerous occassions in the Garden Terrace bar - he was so attentive and made the most fabulous cocktails. We didn't eat lunch/dinner in the restaurants but we did have breakfast on both mornings which was delicious - lots of choice and they appear to cater for multi-cultures too. 
Overall, I think the Royal Garden Hotel is a fabulous place to stay, it is rated 5 star so you expect it to be of a high standard but I can honestly say I've stayed in others rated the same which have been a lot more expensive and nowhere near as good - in fact they could learn a thing or two from the Royal Garden on customer service! Very happy all round and would highly recommend if you want to stay in this location.",5,2018,04,05
133,Great location for London,"This will be my third time I have stayed at the Royal Garden and it has been fantastic as always.  I usually stay on the street view but this time they upgraded me to the Garden View which is just amazing.  It was during the Beast From The East and it was just magical to sit on the window and look out over the park.  The hotel is convenient to Kensington Palace, Royal Albert Hotel and most importantly the tube.  The rooms are always clean and the staff amazing.  I had left my adaptor at home and they helped out without any questions or extra cost.  I always have a great time and will come back again.",5,2018,04,05
133,A trip to the Palladium,"A very pleasant experience from the moment that we pulled up at the entrance, staff were all very polite and welcoming, our room was bright and clean with a fabulous view over the entrance to Kensington Palace, the hotel is very central for all of our needs and I would highly recommend this hotel and I definitely will be back.",5,2018,04,04
133,excellent location for Royal Albert Hall,we recently stayed here for one night as we had tickets for the Royal Albert Hall. The hotel is easily within walking distance of the Royal Albert Hall and a very good location for Hyde Park as it sits on the corner of the Park. Staff were very friendly and we enjoyed drinks in two of the bars. Breakfast was excellent although it is expensive at ¬£25 per head. Would defo visit again,5,2018,04,04
133,Grand old lady,"It may have seen better times. The Royal Garden has had some upgrades, but in other areas she shows her age. Yet the hotel still has much to say fir it. Fantastic location in Kensington, close to all major bus and tube lines. Walk to the park, Harrod‚Äôs, and literally hundreds of great restaurants",3,2018,04,01
133,"Comfortable, Clean, and above all customer-focused","Had a very enjoyable 1 night stay at this hotel. The front desk were very friendly, especially Natalie who offered us a new room immediately after we had reported a smokey room.  Concierge were also well organised and efficient.

Breakfast was lovely, and a very tasty full English was enjoyed.  We also found the restaurant Staff very friendly and accomodating.

Location is most excellent, right next to Hyde Park and the Serpentine with the Albert Hall and Kensington shops just a short walk away.",5,2018,04,01
133,Visit to Royal Albert Hall,"Perfectly located for Albert Hall and Kensington Palace and gardens. A treat to walk around even in January.
Great room with views over gardens.
Lots of shops and restaurants nearby.
Breakfast was good.
Pretty much perfect but mid-week also used by business people who rather loudly take over the bar areas in the evening.",5,2018,03,31
133,Royal Gardens HOtel an absolute must stay,"Excellent hotel with excellent staff to match. The view from our room was amazing, so much so that we had in-room Breakfast service to look over Kensington Gardens. The food was superb.  A must if you are visiting London, you will be back!",5,2018,03,28
133,"Great welcome, VERY comfortable room with superb views","I was very happy with my king room on the 9th floor overlooking Kensington Palace and Hyde Park. Probably the best night's sleep I have had in a hotel due to the very comfortable bed, black out blinds and almost dead quiet room. Lovely Penhaligon's toiletries gave it a classy feel. Really enjoyed my stay.",5,2018,03,28
133,"Excellent location, great service, comfy beds","Highly recommend this hotel, stayed with a friend for the Kasabian gig at the Royal Albert Hall great location, excellent friendly service, comfy spacious rooms. Want to go back again soon with the family for museums.",5,2018,03,27
133,second stay and not disappointed,"ideal for gigs at Royal Albert Hall.(5 minute walk away) Hotel clean, comfortable and staff very friendly and helpful. Food in restaurant good value for money and staff very accommodating. Easy walking distance to .lots of museums and harrods.",5,2018,03,27
133,London/Paris tour,"My recent stay was delightful; the staff was very accommodating and friendly. The rooms do need some updating but otherwise, the location is perfect ( right beside Kensington Palace and bus stop right in front). My children were given royal treatment and we will forever be grateful.....",5,2018,03,27
133,Enjoyable,"From the checking in to checking out, no problems at all,. The room though not big, was clean and the bathroom had everything we needed. The choice when we had breakfast was great, and cooked very well. Staff very attentive and friendly, ",5,2018,03,27
133,Amazing service and value in Kensington,Loved this hotel next to Kensington Garden. Rooms are thoughtfully arranged for comfort and function. Good lighting in both the room and bathroom and appreciated the placement of plugs as well as the view of the park.  Wonderful location in Kensington and a staff that cannot do enough for guests ,5,2018,03,27
133,Elegant and perfectly located ,"Located centrally in London, with a bar/restaurant overlooking Kensington Garden, this hotel really delivers. Service is impeccable, everything is spotless, and the location alone makes this for a great hotel. 
The rooms are definitely small, albeit comfortable. Surprisingly they have a large bathtub, which seems out of proportion with the rest of the room! 
The hotel gym is slightly off-property, but it is a franchise gym that is fully furnished. 

Definitely recommend it for the great English service, amazing location, and the creature comforts. ",5,2018,03,25
133,"I like this hotel, what's not to like.","Now this is a bit upmarket. The rooms are great, from the light switches to the soap, to the quiet music in the background in the room , to the greeting on the TV. This type of production takes commitment, training and investment. It's a good hotel, no doubt.

The bedroom is very comfortable, the bathroom is excellent, the restaurant is good, some of the food is very good, portions are ideal, not too big, but tasty. Two course ¬£40, of course tips, water etc add to that.

Had a good breakfast, but ¬£21 quid extra. The bill for the room was about ¬£250. Staff are friendly and very professional. \if you hit the bar you could walk out of this hotel with a chunky bill between the food, room and scoobies.

I'd recommend it but be wary about the bills. Last time I stayed here there were guards on some of the floors including mine, and a lot of embassies are in the park behind the hotel. There's a good guest spread, it used to be that the suits had the cash, now it is random.",5,2018,03,24
133,Absolutely perfect!,"Wonderful hotel!  The staff is lovely and so accommodating and warm.  I would advise you to book directly with the hotel, as they will provide room amenities when available for doing so.  The rooms are very quiet, the beds very comfortable, and the views of the park are great.  The hotel has an old world charm that you won't find in more hipster locations, such as Shoreditch.  I would highly recommend!",5,2018,03,21
133,Excellent experience!,"Excellent experience,warm welcome when we arrive with English tea and cookies in the waiting room,room has beautiful garden view and service is great throughout the entire stay.room service is excellent and restaurant is very nice with nice selection of different food.overall great experience!would stay again!",5,2018,03,21
133,Remains my clear London hotel of choice.....,"Have stayed at the Royal Garden for 10 years now and it continues to give me the best possible hotel experience in London.  Location is perfect, staff are exceptional, concierge forever helpful, room variety ideal and overall experience A+",5,2018,03,21
133,Terrible rude arrogant concierge and weak management,"The hotel is nice, great location, the Chinese restaurant is amazing, unfortunately the Concierge‚Äôs (particularly Romario) are rude and smug, the doorman also took offence when I didn‚Äôt use his taxi (presumably he gets backhanders from other cars that he recommends), also unfortunately the hotel manager didn‚Äôt have the ability to control her staff when they were openly rude to me.
Never again.
I will recommend ‚Äúnever again‚Äù to my business associates who have embarrassingly referred me.
Terrible, terrible management.",1,2018,03,20
133,Show and Rugby,Chose this hotel for a special weekend of Theatre and 6 Nations Rugby. Booked a Garden Room with fantastic views of Kensington Palace and Hyde Park. Lovely welcome from Rebecca on reception and staff friendly throughout. Room was bright and well prepared. We received a lovely treat for having booked direct which was appreciated. Being very near High Street Kensington Station we were well placed for the Underground to travel to our theatre and rugby trips. A higher class hotel but well worth the investment for a special weekend. ,5,2018,03,20
133,Female guests avoid at all costs!!,"shared twin room with female colleague. Threatened by menacing security guard at 4am to stop talking in our room or else! Other guests needs valued more than mine. Complained, no response. AVOID!!!!!!",1,2018,03,20
133,An excellent stay,"A most enjoyable one night stay, welcoming and very helpful staff throughout our visit, a great room overlooking the Gardens, very good lunch and breakfast in the Park Terrace. We would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,03,20
133,St. Patrick's Weekend - Coming Back Soon,This was our second time staying at the Royal Garden Hotel.  When we arrived it was nice to see Joseph standing outside and that he actually remember us from a year prior.  Customer Service and their attention to detail is obvious the minute you walk in.  The hotel is perfectly situated near HydePark and right next to Kensington Palace Gardens.  If you are lucky you may see Megan and Prince Harry leave Kensington a long the private road next to the hotel.  The rooms are very nice and the beds are comfortable.  The food is also very good we enjoyed the breakfast buffet every morning.  The restaurant is open until later in the evening so you can come by for a bite after sightseeing all day.   Whether you are visiting for business or pleasure Royal Garden Hotel is the place to spend your time while in London.  We will definitely be back.,5,2018,03,19
133,The Royal Garden Hotel Experience,Our third visit in six months and the quality of each visit has been excellent in all respects. All members of staff we came in contact with made particular effort to ensure our visit was a pleasant one.,5,2018,03,19
133,Overnight Stay in London,Very good stay whilst attending an Awards Dinner that took place at the Hotel. Both the stay and the Awards Dinner were well run by the hotel. Food was very good and the staff very helpful and smartly presented.,5,2018,03,19
133,Miss Sharon Clark,Have Been Staying At Royal Garden Hotel For Over 30 Years . Have Seen Many Changes Over The Years . Always Nice To Come Back & See Familar Faces . Marco In Park Terrace Is Always Very Accomadating For Our Needs . I Usually Like French Onion Soup & A Ham & Cheese Omlette . Before Going To Theatre These Items Are On Room Service Menu . Marco Always Arrange With Kitchen . To Have These Items Served In Park Terrace / Lounge . Which Is Always Greatly Appreciated By Myself & Friend . Rather Than Having These Served In Room . Would Highly Reccomend This Hotel For Quality Service & Staff . ,5,2018,03,18
133,Tiny bedrooms and freezing cold,"We stayed here for one night for a works event. The bedroom was tiny and nothing to write home about. In fact we‚Äôve stayed in bigger and nicer premier inn rooms for a fraction of the cost.
The ballroom the event was in was freezing cold. Our whole table were complaining about the room temperature was uncomfortably cold as the ladies all had evening dresses on. Even the drinks reception area was very cold.
When we returned to our bedroom the room was cold. Even though the heating was on. This was blowing out cold air. There was no extra blankets in the cupboards and because I was so cold I ended up having to sleep in my jeans, socks and dressing gown.!! 
Not what you expect from a 5* hotel which was ¬£250 per night. 
This also did not include breakfast which was very annoying. 
I certainly won‚Äôt be returning to this hotel in the future. ",2,2018,03,18
133,Comfortable Stay,Stayed here on a Saturday and the hotel was busy as expected. It‚Äôs well positioned adjacent to HydePark/Kensington Palace Gardens and of course to Kensington High St. The room we were allocated was on the small side but clean and comfortable and generally well appointed and had views towards Kensington Palace. The receptionist (Kamil) was excellent and managed to allocate our room before stipulated check in time and gave us a room with a better room than was otherwise have been the case. ,4,2018,03,18
133,Always a wonderful experience,"I have stayed at Royal Garden many times, and it never disappoints. Each stay is a fabulous experience, and the staff is absolutely helpful, professional and friendly.I would recommend it to anyone ANYTIME!",5,2018,03,16

Our room was immaculate and comfortable, every need anticipated. Beautifully equipped bathroom, comfy bed, really helpful and genuine staff. Will never stay anywhere but this hotel in London!",5,2018,03,15
133,Wonderful hotel for our large group,"We had 4 rooms on the 10th floor for a few nights in March.  The location is great--within 2 blocks of the Tube and lots of restaurants right outside the door.  The rooms were lovely and bathrooms very large and modern.  We only had drinks at the hotel, but the bartender was an artist at creating original cocktails.  The entire staff was fantastic--helped with directions, ordered a van for our large group, suggested restaurants for dining.  Would stay again!",5,2018,03,14
133,Great hotel for business trips,"Great location, friendly service, lovely breakfast and very comfortable rooms. We stay here every year for a work trip and I can recommend it. Views over Kensington Gardens are wonderful and close to metro and bus stops.",4,2018,03,14
133,very good,thank you very much for your business. I use this hotel about 1 time in three month and every time everything was very good. I would recommend this hotel to stay in London. Special thanks for Chinese  restaurant in the hotel,5,2018,03,14
133,Exceptional from start to finish,"on arrival we were met with a friendly receptionist who offered vouchers for use against the restaurant for dinner and the cocktail bar. We were lucky to be upgraded to a beautiful garden room with gorgeous views of Kensington Palace Gardens.
We had a delicious afternoon tea in the hotel also, the food was exceptional as was the service. Breakfast in the room was excellent also.
Everywhere we went, staff were really friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, the only downside is that we were only here one night!!",5,2018,03,13
133,Fantastic Hotel,We could not fault the hotel.  Our stay was glorious.  The room had a superb view and the location was ideal for  meeting friends and family. The receptionist was highly efficient and we really could not have chosen a nicer hotel to spend the night at.,5,2018,03,13
133,Fantastic hotel,"I was attending the ILMC conference earlier this month at the Royal Garden Hotel, and also stayed there for two nights.

Everything was 100%, ranging from the conference facilites to the bedrooms, the food and the reception and restaurant facilities.

The bedrooms were really comfortable and clean, good views over Kensington High Street.  Food via the buffet supplied was lovely, and the staff were ever so helpful and pleasant.  Although this stay was for business, I'd happily stay at the Royal Garden Hotel again.",5,2018,03,12
133,My birthday treat,"Hotel is well situated if you are visiting Kensington Palace  we travelled by train to Kensington Olympia and got a taxi to hotel  (about ¬£13  ) takes about 20 minutes on a Saturday , it‚Äôs about 7 minutes walk  to Kensington Palace  through the park and right next to hotel! Our room was clean and comfortable! Our only complaint was that the pillows had no support in them  I suffer with neck problems , I even called reception to ask for firmer pillows, which were also too soft ! The view was a bit disappointing as we were facing the main road. The bathroom was well equipped with a deep bath and fab walk in shower! You could even listen to the tv in the bath as speakers were connected in the bathroom ! Bath robes and slippers were provide. Mini bar which was well stocked, on demand movies about ¬£5.00 each , with good selection. Food in restaurant was excellent with lovely friendly staff , who were polite and offered a quick service.   Breakfast usual selection , eggs cooked fresh ! 
Main reason for visit was to visit Kensington Palace , unfortunately  it was disappointing. Separate review on this to follow!

133,Royal Garden Hotel Revisited ,"Just stayed one night.A pleasant enough hotel. Stayed there a few times as a child.It is still very similar. Reception almost as I remembered. Nice room although the biscuits I purchased from the mini bar were out of date.Hey,But still that‚Äôs not a big problem.Comfortable all the same. Still think there should be some better reference to 1966 Wordcup winners having their after match celebration there.Especially in the reception. Will Return.",4,2018,03,12
133,Excellent location and good value.,Good value and a great location. Food and bar service was good. Kensington is a lovely part of London with good stores and the lovely park to walk in close to the underground. The rooms are a bit small but the the cleanliness and service are first rate. ,4,2018,03,09
133,Fantastic again ,"Stayed for 3 nights late feb. The whole experience from the minute you enter the premises to leaving is second to none. Stayed couple times before and it was the same experience. All staff are polite and so helpful.
Room was smaller than previous visits but wasn‚Äôt major issue. 
The staff will chat pleasantly with a smile.
The mezzanine bar isn‚Äôt the cheapest but that‚Äôs to be expected in a hotel like this.
Will definitely be back next time in London.",5,2018,03,08
133,Cirque du Soleil  weekend,"We choose the  hotel because of the parking and only 10mins walk to the Albert Hall. We were very pleased, we found the staff very attentive and polite. We loved the upgraded room and the wine. We only ate breakfast their and that was perfect. Thank you, we hope to visit again.",5,2018,03,06
133,Meeting,"Lovely hotel at a decent location. Room size is good. Room contents can be better. Food variety can be better too. Hotel staff friendly and courteous. TV channels to include movie channels. Overall, would recommend to stay.",4,2018,03,06
133,Another Amazing Stay,"Stayed again for two nights over the weekend.
Met by a lovely lady on reception Saturday afternoon (I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt remember her name) and Alex.
They both made us very welcome and gave us the same room as our last visit - a garden room 939 on the 9th floor.
There are so many good things about this hotel and there is not enough space to talk about all here but here are the main ones:
- Staff friendly with guests and each other
- Spotless clean rooms and bathrooms 
- Bed linen changed daily
- Quick and quiet lift services
- Delicious room service menu
- Plentiful fresh breakfast menu
- Safe environment

Looking forward to coming back in July

133,Great Hotel,"The staff here were excellent, friendly and professional which added to our enjoyment of our stay. The bedroom (Queen size bed) was smaller than some but very comfortable and clean.  We prefer a shower cubicle so the shower above the bath was not to our liking but served its purpose. The full English breakfast at ¬£25 we thought was expensive so ate that meal locally at less than half the cost. We would return though as it is ideal for the Royal Albert Hall.",4,2018,03,05
133,One of the best,I have stayed in many hotels. This was one of the best so far. Lovely garden room with amazing views. Breakfast was a little overpriced but very nice. Very central to everything really. Will definitely stay again.,5,2018,03,05
133,GREAT STAY,"The Royal Garden is very Central to all you need in London. We stayed for 4 nights and had a great time.  Lovely staff,  Great Room with a lovely view.  You don't need Breakfast (its very expensive) as loads of great places near by to try our.  Tube walking distance and easy for all London locations.
I would recommend this hotel for short and long stays.  Enjoy",5,2018,03,03
133,Great location and lovely hotel,"Great location and lovely hotel. We stayed for my Wife‚Äôs birthday. Staff were very helpful and gave great service.  Room was okay, perhaps could do with updating a bit. Though we had a fabulous view of Kensington Palace from our room.",4,2018,03,03
133,Cirque Du Soleil ,"We had yet another fantastic stay at The Royal Garden hotel, the staff are so, so friendly and accommodating. They made our stay very special, we can‚Äôt wait to come back.

The hotel is very handy for The Royal Albert Hall, Kensington Palace, Hyde Park and of course shopping. All within walking distance.",5,2018,03,02
133,Dr Phil,Friendly and helpful staff at all times.  Room was clean and fully equipped with fantastic views.  Food (breakfast and lunch) were very good  Good bus and tube links to Central London. Would definitely book again.,5,2018,03,01
133,Great birthday/ anniversary at Royal Garden Hotel,"Had a fabulous stay at the Royal Garden! Was there to celebrate my birthday and our anniversary.  Hotel remembered at point of booking that I had stayed there the previous year for the same celebration.  Booked a Garden Suite, as RGH were doing a special deal back in November.  Definitely worth every penny!  Great staff, good food and fantastic views over the park.  Would recommend!",5,2018,02,27
133,Our FAVOURITE London hotel!,"The Royal Garden hotel is just perfect!  

It's location on busy High Street Kensington, but with beautiful far reaching park views, friendly but professional staff, fabulous Min Jiang dining experience plus excellent housekeeper standards makes this hotel very hard to beat!!

Thank you everyone.  We will of course be back soon!",5,2018,02,27
133,they get it right,"I really like this place. Have stayed here at least 4 times.The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, competent and consisten and best of all not overbearing or in your face. They are simply available. Everything is clean, comfortable, quiet. The food is also delicious and the service quick and efficient. I can't even believe I'm writing all this. It's quite rare I find in the world of hotels. Especially in London where they often get one thing right, but not anything else. 

The location is nice, too. Very busy area. Royal Albert Hall just a hop, skip and a jump. Definitely recommend.",5,2018,02,27
133,A great Hotel once again,"We stayed for just one night (sadly) when we went to the Royal Albert Hall to see the fabulous Cirque du Soleil.
We were welcomed by a charming receptionist, Lucy, who had also been to see the show and did her absolute best to make us feel welcome even to the point of obtaining a brochure for the Cirque du Soleil show. She was both warm and kind and I would expect to see her promoted in the very near future as she epitomised the thoughtfulness of the Hotel, which we have always found to be above and beyond most other Hotels in London.

I feel I must point out, which I failed to do so on check out, that the only thing wrong with the room was the shower head which needs adjusting badly as it gushes out of one side and nothing the other, however, this is quite a small point to make when you experience the many, many excellent points in the Hotels favour.

We shall continue to use the Royal Garden Hotel for its excellence, location and more to the point its staff.",5,2018,02,26
133,Great location and friendly hotel,We wnt to see ovo at Royal Albert Hall - so a one night stay here was a perfect location and experience. We were greeeted efficiently - and the room was lovely over looking Kensington High Street. It was a really nice visit,4,2018,02,26
133,Enjoyable trip,"Stayed here again‚Äô about our 15th stay here now and must say I preferred it a few years back when it was more of a cosy hotel

Rooms ok but getting a bit tired now and could do with a refurb.    Bathroom lovely 

Hotel bed not comfy.   To hard for me and also pillows appauling    We asked for firm pillows to be delivered to the room and on arrival they were the same limp soft pillows we already had

Room tips.   Get a room overlooking the park ",3,2018,02,25
133,Impressive.,"Started our stay with warm welcoming, received our keys straight away. Room was perfect, view breath taking. Went for a dinner in Park Terrace restaurant, food was worth every penny. Every dish was like a new experience. Room was quiet. Had breakfast with room service to prepare ourselves for a great day. Thank you.",5,2018,02,25
133,great staff and service,"I love staying at this hotel - the staff are very professional, friendly and most importantly, CAPABLE. The rooms are nice, the location is great. I also love that people leave you alone unless you ask for them to help you and then they do so very expeditiously and kindly. What else can you ask for?",5,2018,02,24
133,Top of the heap,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, having visited now two years in a row. The service was outstanding. The concierge desk was exceptionally helpful providing suggestions and advice on sights to see, plays to watch and restaurants in the area.The location is perfect. The restaurants are superior. We will return.",5,2018,02,23
133,Business trip,I was given an upgrade to a very nice room because I booked direct. The room was a garden room with a view over the Palace. Always remember seeing film of the England football team standing on the balcony after they won the World Cup. Pleasant memory even if I am not English.,5,2018,02,22
133,Marsh Visit,"Lovely accommodation, beds not really suitable for four people, we had a nine year old and a fourteen year old child, so the room was slightly crowded with the extra beds. This is our second visit and the location is excellent for a visit to the Royal Albert Hall, plenty of good restaurants around and right next to Hyde Park, lovely",4,2018,02,22
133,Great Hotel in great location,"Again Royal Garden was outstanding. great room, great location, breakfasts excellent.

133,Kensington luxury,"Unexpectedly we were looking for a room in London for that evening ‚Äì for five of us.
The receptionist took this request in his stride and offered various options and even took the time to show us two of the rooms.
Within 10minutes we were checked in and the children making their way to the room clutching smart new rucksacks given as gifts by the hotel.

Our junior suite had plenty of space, with a large bathroom and a luxurious feel. 
To top this we benefited from panoramic views over Kensington Palace. 

Point worthy of mention is that the pillows are probably the best I‚Äôve experienced in any hotel.

Breakfast is served in a bright room overlooking the entrance to the park, quality of both the buffet and cooked selection was outstanding, matched by extremely attentive service.

From check-in to check out all of the staff we encountered were friendly and went out of their way to welcome us to the hotel.
Overall a really well run hotel with great staff, great food in a wonderful location at the centre of Kensington - highly recommended !",5,2018,02,20
133,short stay,The hotel offers great and friendly service. The food is very good and the breakfast was quite simply wonderful. It set us up to experience London and for a great day  breakfast. The hotel's great location make it a great choice.,4,2018,02,20
133,Another great stay,"The 2nd time we have stayed and location, rooms and staff were all excellent, we would not hesitate to stay again, parking at the hotel really helped, I also got a room upgrade and  complimentary beer!",5,2018,02,20
133,staying at royal garden hotel,no Problem during our stay.the Location is very well situated..the Underground is near by.the chinese Restaurant in the tenth Floor is very good.the possibility of jocking in the kensington garden counts.,4,2018,02,18
133,Great Staff,"Great location, confortable hotel and very kind staff. The breakfast is excellent. Very close to the tube station and Kensinthon Park. Good restaurants and shops around. The cheapest room is a litlle small with you have more than 1 luggage, I recommended staying in a larger one.",5,2018,02,16
133,Classy hotel,"We have eaten at The park terrace restaurant several times, and it‚Äôs outstanding, so we were very happy to get a travelzoo deal. It is a lovely hotel, we got a voucher for a cocktail at Bertie‚Äôs bar, the breakfast was ok, pretty average, they did have vegan sausages, but it wasn‚Äôt as good as the evening food. Fab hotel, but wouldn‚Äôt have wanted to pay full price, if money is no object, then this is your place, I would prefer to spend the money on a show and a fancy meal in future. ",4,2018,02,15
133,I Love this Hotel.,"The view of the London sky line is amazing from this Hotel at night, you get a wonderful panoramic view which just has to be seen. The staff are very friendly and helpful and will try hard to make it happen for you. The Park Terrace serves the most amazing menus and even my fussy partner could not find any fault. The food was varied and so tasty. The attention to detail is amazing and the evening staff in the restaurant are very helpful but unobtrusive. The atmosphere in the restaurant was such that we forgot we were in a hotel and not in an eatery elsewhere. Having analysed the bill I would say the drinks came out on the expensive side for the wine, but if you cant afford it you don't stay at a hotel of this calibre. This did not take away from our stay at all. If like us you have trouble sleeping in a strange bed, you need have no worries on that score at the Royal Garden Hotel. The beds are so comfy and the pillows are also comfy, so much I went out and bought the same pillows for my bed at home. We will be back later this year and might see you there if you decide to give it a try. You will not be disappointed. I really cant praise it highly enough.",5,2018,02,15
133,Great place!,"An excellent place. Great staff, superb location and amazing views (garden room). I found nothing negative during my stay. On the contrary staff went all out to ensure I was comfortable. It was a daily pleasure waking up to superb views of Kensington gardens ",5,2018,02,14
133,Pint-sized luxury in a prime location,"Excellent but small room, heated towels, lovely toiletries, and best of all, you can roll out of bed and land in Kensington with all its wonderful shops.  Extremely kind and thorough staff- the front desk clerk personally escorted us to our room. We saved this hotel for the last night of our trip as a treat to ourselves: well worth the wait. Beautiful view from our room, too. Worth spending a few more bucks to finish your sojourn in style. ",5,2018,02,12
133,BRILLIANT!,"We have now become regular visitors to this most amazing hotel.  We have always received superb service, from the moment we entered to our room and to the restaurant.

Thanks to Andrea and Rebecca at reception - the room you allocated was gorgeous!  We thank the housekeeping staff for their attention to detail and making the presentation of the hotel and the rooms immaculate.  Concierge are always at hand to offer advice and thanks to Joseph for witty banter and making me laugh every day!

Breakfast is a wonderful affair with a brilliant choice of food.  Lovely service too.  Davina was enchanting - she choreographed a wonderful dance of pans, waffle making and egg poaching - could have been put to music!  such talent!  The poached eggs 'popped', just perfect - thank you.

The evening meals we had were at Park Terrace - this is a must!  The chef Steve Munkley and the team create amazing food which not only is a veritable feast for the eyes but tastes sensational too.  Daniel and his team are quite incredible, their team work is like a well oiled machine of observation, attentiveness, thoughtfulness, kindness  without being intrusive, For us, we now consider them as friends.  Liana is a superb host who welcomes you with such warmth (keep on knitting, I will see you soon!).  Emilio, Christian took care of our every dining need and even remembered what we had eaten previously - incredible!  Iannis whips up cocktails that are exquisite, you must try one!

Yes, I am gushing and waffling on the virtues of this incredible place in Kensington, so take my word for it and book in!  I cannot wait until our next visit.  See you all soon!",5,2018,02,12
133,Great Hotel Location Next to Kensington Palace,Lovely hotel and staff.  The restaurant manager was particularly helpful and went over and beyond to make our experience the best. Great to get out and walk to Kensington Palace and Park. Breakfast and lunch at the restaurant was very good.  ,5,2018,02,12
133,Weekend Break,"Stayed on a Travelzoo deal that made this hotel good value. Warm welcome from reception, room very clean and ready before official check in. Loan of umbrellas when wet. Lovely meal in the Park Terrace restaurant and amazing breakfasts with plenty to keep you going all day. Had a cocktail in Berties Bar as part of the offer a good space to sit and relax. Easy walk to The Royal Albert Hall and Museums as well as taking in Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. All staff very friendly and helpful",5,2018,02,12
133,Excellent location for site seeing etc in London. Clean and  good staff.,An excellent location and building. Lots of eateries around the area and easy to walk anywhere. Every member of the staff were very attentive and pleasant. Breakfast was of a very high standard. We was able to have a free cocktail with the booking which was worth doing.,5,2018,02,11
133,All great,Arrived at 1400 checked in straight away 2 porters took our luggage to room. Room was clean well equipped and warm bathroom was spotless .Reception rang and checked our room was ok.No noise at all bed a bit hard but I never sleep well away from home. We had a cocktail at Bertie's Bar which was nice. Breakfast was good buffet style.Every member of staff was excellent what more can be said,5,2018,02,11
133,Amazing views,"We stayed on 8th February 2018. We had only booked for 1 night, the hotel is fabulous and the room had amazing views of Hyde park, we decided to booked another night. The hotel has a beautiful lobby and we were checked in quickly. The room was huge, lovely seating area with large windows giving excellent views of Hyde park, we could see Kensington palace. The room was spotless clean, good sized bed very comfortable, bathroom had a walk in shower and bath. We found all the staff very friendly and helpful, the bar areas are tasteful decorated serving fantastic cocktails. We didn‚Äôt eat at the hotel but the menu did look tempting. Can highly rate this hotel and is excellent value for money ",5,2018,02,10
133,Truly Lovely Hotel,"I had a lovely time at the hotel.  y room had a great view and the staff were lovely.  My first time staying there and would love to stay again.  The food was really good in the restaurant, even though the service was slow and the restaurant was empty.",5,2018,02,09
133,Visit to Harley Street,"Local Hotel near to Harley street 
Having travelled the world I found this hotel fine and would have no problems on going back. Had to change room because of the size of the shower (it would be no problem for normal person) The hotel was very accommodating ",4,2018,02,08
133,Excellent,"An unforgettable stay here , if only for one night.   From arrival to departure everything was excellent, staff went the ‚Äòextra mile ‚Äò to make our stay comfortable.   We were fortunate to be offered an upgrade to a suite on the 9th floor, fantastic views of Kensington Palace and the park.  Overall stay was faultless, definitely stay here again for a special occasion .",5,2018,02,07
133,three days holiday,"wonderful stay in this wonderful hotel close to Kensington gardens, ideal to live the 'green' London although near the centre of the city. Jogging in the park was fantastic!
We certainly will come back soon",5,2018,02,07
133,Fantastic stay!,Absolute amazing service. Faultless and the most perfect stay. The room was spotless. The staff were unbelievably helpful and polite. Overall I would definitely recommend and I'm looking forward to staying there again!,5,2018,02,06
133,Family weekend in London,"amazing hotel , well positioned and located to get to all sights in london.  Lovely to have the park next door so that you can have a walk around kensington park and Kensington Palace is right next door.  Handy for museums and the staff are fantastic, very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is very clean.",5,2018,02,06
133,Flawless experience,"I stayed for one night at the Royal Garden Hotel in an executive room.  From the moment I arrived, the service was absolutely flawless.

The receptionist could not have been more friendly and helpful.  In fact, all the hotel staff I encountered were extremely polite, friendly, professional and went out of their way to help; nothing was too much trouble.

The room was lovely, spacious, and I particularly loved the Penhaligan's shower gel etc... being a fan of this particular range.  The bed was extremely comfortable - had a wonderful sleep and I definitely didn't experience a lot of noise from the corridor or anything like that.

Ordered room service and it was brought quickly and was fresh and delicious.

While there, my friends and I had Sunday lunch in the Park Terrace restaurant and it was absolutely delicious!  Full of flavour and reasonably priced too.  I have paid more at other places where the food wasn't even in the same league as this.  Couldn't fault the quality of the food or the service at all.

I was very impressed with the hotel overall.  It is a lovely hotel, elegant, but not overly stuffy either.  I had one of the most enjoyable weekends In London I've had in a long time and this hotel played a big part in that.  Loved it. 

Am planning another weekend in London next month and already have my eye on this hotel for that trip!",5,2018,02,05
133,Excellent,"I was involved in using the hotel for a week of interviewing. The location was great, with park next door and excellent restaurants nearby for all price ranges. Breakfast was high quality service. i would really recommend location especially",5,2018,02,04
133,Housekeeping left my door open,"Rooms are noisy because you hear hallway noise so well. And all the doors shut loudly all around. I was awoken by the automatic shutting of neighboring rooms. Yet after my turndown service my door was left open.  I arrived home hours later and the room had been both poorly turned down and the door resting open, having not loudly auto closed like every other door in the hall and like it did every time left  How ?!?!?!?",3,2018,02,04
133,Super Venue,"Visited to attend a black tie function. From arriving at the reception desk to the time we checked out the staff were friendly and attentive, making everybody feel very special. The function room was beautifully decorated and the food delicious. Well done all, often these occasions are bland and boring, but not this time - excellent!",5,2018,02,03
133,Home away from home,"For many years, we have been coming to the Royal Garden Hotel now. It really feels like home and over time we have grown to love it‚Äôs facilities. Min Jiang must be one of the best Chinese restaurants in the world. No stay would be complete with a visit to it. The staff at Bertie‚Äòs bar are just fantastic, doing their utmost to make you feel cosy, comfortable and cared for. Much the same applies to the Park Terrace restaurant. The clever and very functional layout of the rooms is just right up my sleeve. People who are looking for chintzy interiors will not become happy here. However, the Royal Garden managed to create a warm, luxurious and still functional environment. All in all, it is the only London hotel I want to return to. ",5,2018,02,02
133,"Nice hotel, great location, great staff, but needs some polishing","I spent two nights at the Royal Garden Hotel. This was my second stay here.

Overall, this is a nice hotel - a top-tiper 4-star hotel, trying to straddle up to 5-stars. The location is excellent, right off Hyde Park. The staff are all courteous and professional - a special shout out to the lovely Paloma at reception that really made me feel welcome. 

The rooms are well maintained, if slightly dated. 

Breakfast is pretty decent. The a-la-carte offerings are good and served nicely. No complaints here. 

The gym - which is open to the public as well - is pretty decent and well maintained. 

But there were unfortunately a couple of hiccups which makes me drop a star for my review unfortunately:

- Upon booking, I asked if the minibar could be emptied. I was told twice by e-mail that this was no problem, and was told once again when I checked in. I was therefore quite surprised to see that the minibar wasn't emptied upon entering my room! It was quickly emptied after I called reception, but there clearly seems to have been some communication issue.

- In a similar vein, the trash in the room was not emptied from the previous guest. Again, a low-hanging fruit that would have gone some-way to get a 5-star treatment.

- Tea bags were not replenished. Again - this was quickly fixed when I flagged this to reception. It's just the feeling that these are small things that should normally not have to be flagged!

Despite these hiccups, I'd recommend this hotel if you can get a good rate.",4,2018,02,01
133,Comfortable stay,Sadly I only stayed one night at this hotel so really only first impressions. Very friendly and attentive staff and importantly a very comfortable and well appointed room with lovely park view. I would stay if / when I return to London.,5,2018,02,01
133,Theatre Weekend ,"Fantastic hotel and location. Being right next to Kensington Palace in Hyde Park. The room was really comfortable and although facing the road we were not effected by any noise.
Breakfast was something else, really could want for more, plenty of choice and more than enough to eat.
",5,2018,02,01
133,Fantastic Property,The staff were friendly and helpful nothing was too much problem.  The food is out of this world.  The hotel rooms are very nice and comfortable and the location is on Kensington High Street so lots of shopping to the front of the hotel and Kensington Palace and Gardens to the rear...so everything catered for.,5,2018,02,01
133,Weekend break,"Customer service was above and beyond . Highly recommend this hotel from arrival to departure we where made to  feel welcome .
Breakfast was a relaxing experience with yet again professional and polite staff that gave a warm greeting  and ensured we had all we needed.
Clearly your customer service training comes to light . Would love to stay again ",5,2018,01,31
133,Fabulous Views!,Lovely hotel with wonderful views of London and Kensington Gardens. Being right next door to Kensington Palace was an unexpected plus. Staff provided  great service. Buses and taxis right outside the door.,5,2018,01,31
133,Comfortable  stop-over for business,"I pre-booked parking in the underground car park via the NCP website (for which there is a small discount from the prices charged on arrival) and lifts took me straight to the entrance of the hotel. On arrival a concierge swept my luggage straight to my room and the receptionist was friendly and efficient in checking me in - I was able to order breakfast and a wake up call. I sat in the bar for a glass of wine before heading up to my room after a long journey and enjoyed the relaxed yet sophisticated atmosphere of the Park Terrace - three waiting staff were warm, friendly and keen to ensure my half hour of relaxation was the best it could be. The room was tastefully decorated in a very modern chic style with excellent facilities, all spotlessly clean. Room service menu was extensive and very conservatively prices given the quality of the hotel. Room service arrived promptly and was piping hot and delicious - exactly what was needed after a long journey. Similarly, breakfast in the morning was delivered promptly and of a great quality - a perfect meal for an early morning and a busy day.
Checkout was seamlessly overseen by another very friendly and competent receptionist. Overall a comfortable stay, however the only reason for 4/5 rather than 5/5 was the quality of the mattress and pillows. The mattress was very soft, and the pillows were very thin filled with mainly air (I was able to fold them in half and stack them before lying on them to achieve an element of comfort and support) - resulting in slightly less restful night than would have been possible. ",4,2018,01,30
133,An ideal step to Le Cirque du Soleil...," For the third time, an ideal step to the show at the Royal Albert Hall of Le Cique du Soleil.
Otherwise, all the stay at the Royal Garden are a wonderful experience and not only because of the lncredible location.
Very kind staff and crew.
See you soon...
",5,2018,01,30
133,Weekend  trip,Visiting London to see Cirque de Soleil we chose the Royal Garden as it is convenient for the Royal Albert Hall.  The staff were friendly and attentive without being fawning. The room was comfortable with great views of Kensington Gardens. Food was very good my only minor gripe was the lack of a quiet comfortable area for coffee in the afternoon. Berries would have been perfect for this but didn't open until the evening.,4,2018,01,30
133,Superb,"The stay was excellent. it started with the ease of parking and having someone available to assist with parking. The staff at reception were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The room had a fantastic view and was clean and comfortable, the location of the Hotel was amazing, walking distance to the museums and shops.",4,2018,01,30
133,Gteat hotel,"Great hotel. A real treat and staff and service made it amazing. Slight mildew in shower, kettle had linescale and personally the pillows were too soft giving very little sleep. Would love to have options of pillows. ",4,2018,01,29
133,Overnighter with theatre trip,"We were given the overnight stay as a competition prize so didn't know what to expect however the hotel was lovely and is situated right next to Kensington Palace on the edge of Kensington Gardens and I'm sure the views of the gardens are delightful however we were given a room with a view of Kensington High Street which wasn't as nice! The hotel and the room were clean and modern and everything worked except the TV with a picture that looked as if it was disturbed by bad weather (although the weather was OK) and the picture froze so that I couldn't switch it over or off!. That aside we had a very comfortable stay and the restaurant was excellent and I had the full English breakfast whilst my Wife had the continental.
Would definitely stay again",4,2018,01,29
133,Such a wonderful hotel - and I'm fussy!,From the moment we arrived the team at this hotel were fantastic friendly and welcoming. Check in was a pleasure and it was a lovely touch being called once we had got to our room to make sure everything was ok for us. A delicious tray of truffle was delivered on a 'Happy Birthday' plate for my husband and having the turn down service after we got back from our night our was so nice. We enjoyed wonderful cocktails in the bar overlooking Kensington Gardens and breakfast was the best that we have had. There was an amazing range of choices for both continental and full English including 2 types of bacon and 3 types of sausages. We thoroughly recommend the Royal Garden Hotel and we can't wait to return.,5,2018,01,29
133,excellent,"great experience, I would recommend to family, friends and co workers .  Breakfast was wonderful, services was excellent. Everyone was friendly and helpful.  Enjoy my stay very much & would come back again to this hotel.

",4,2018,01,28
133,A touch of luxury,"If you are a tourist visiting London, as everyone says, this is a perfect loaction.  However, if you are British and would like a spot of luxury and a need tor relax, then this hotel is for you.  We stayed in a Garden Room and that is a wonderful treat.  The view was d elightful, both in the daytime and in the evening. The bed was extremely comfortable, luxury bathrobes and slippers were provided, the toiletries  were excellent and the bath was clean!!  A comfortable settee was provided along with a well stocked fridge. We didn't order room service but even that was priced fairly for a 5 star hotel.  The hotel allows you to check out later than most hotels which is greatly appreciated if you are there to relax and recharge the batteries.  Despite the hotel being a large hotel, you still get the sense that each individual customer matters.  Well done Royal Garden Hotel and staff.",5,2018,01,28
133,One day stay,"Great location, excellent clean room, good service.  Perfect location for a visit to Royal Albert Hall. East reach to parks, shops and tube. Plenty of restaurants nearby. Enjoyed visiting Kensington Palace. Lovely view from room. ",5,2018,01,28
133,Short Birthday Stay,The staff at the hotel are extremely helpful and friendly. Each member I interacted with assisted in making my short stay memorable and warm. The hyde park facing room had an amazing view and was fitted to a very high standard. ,5,2018,01,27
133,Two nights in London,A last minute booking to take  advantage of the hotel's excellent location to Paddington Station - that is within walking distance weather permitting  and The Royal Albert Hall for which the hotel were able to procure tickets for a show within their room rate.This additional level of service should ensure repeat business.,5,2018,01,27
133,Birthday Trip,"We a few times every year here, more recent was my birthday. I was as always amazed at the detail, the staff, and the experience. We had a Kensington Tea, lunch and everything was just amazing.
I will be coming back many more times for sure.
",5,2018,01,25
133,"Superb Location, Great Staff and Comfortable Rooms.","Superb location, great staff and comfortable rooms says it all really. The rooms with garden views are excellent, staff were friendly, attentive, without being intrusive, and helpful plus facilities offered everything a good hotel should. Loved the breakfast especially! Stayed for three nights, had a lovely experience and would certainly use this hotel again even if it didn't offer a great location that allowed a morning stroll around Kensington Gardens before a busy workday. If you are looking for a central location with everything you need and friendly staff I'd stop here and book now.",5,2018,01,24
133,"Royal Garden Hotel, Kensington","Absolutely fabulous hotel. Staff and facilities are top notch. 
Great location on Kensington High Street overlooking Kensington Gardens.  Easy walk to the Royal Albert Hall.  Get a King Garden room for a fantastic view of the Garden!",5,2018,01,24
133,Wish we could have stayed longer,"We stayed one night but would love to return another time. Everything about the hotel was excellent, including the staff. We often find hotel rooms too hot and stuffy but we were able to easily control the temperature in our room with the air conditioning. The bathroom in particular was luxurious with a deep bath and separate rainfall shower. The room service menu is vast and very reasonably priced. We were especially delighted when we returned from our evening out to find the in room tea and coffee supply had been completely replinished and a bottle of water and glass left on each bedside table. The hotel is in a fabulous location right next to Kensington Gardens and a short walk to the Royal Albert Hall. Our room was overlooking Kensington High Street which is very busy with traffic but we didn‚Äôt hear any noise and we slept like logs. Will definitely be treating ourselves to another night at this beautiful hotel soon.",5,2018,01,23
133,"Great stay, a rare find in London","Great stay, a rare find in London.  Good food, service, and nice rooms.  My only complaint was that the walls were a tad thin, so I could hear the conference calls our loud television in the rooms next door.  Otherwise, it's a much nicer hotel than I'm used to staying at whenever I have to go to London.  Food was excellent, especially for our conference.",5,2018,01,22
133," Royal Treatment ","Wonderful Friday night stopover in London 
The whole hotel is undergoing a massive makeover and boy doesn‚Äôt it look fantastic!
Superb service from checking in to check out. We booked a fabulous suite on the high level with stunning views over London Eye and BT Tower worthy of its Royal status indeed.
Can‚Äôt wait to stay again.
A must if staying in London 
",5,2018,01,22
133,Excellent stay,Very comfortable room with large bed and view down towards Kensington High Street.  Excellent service.  Lovely breakfast. Only few minutes walk from underground station. On the edge of park for beautiful walks.  ,5,2018,01,22
133,Cirque Soleil and overnight stay,"Packaged stay with tickets to Cirque Soleil. Fantastic hotel and Show.
Garden room very comfortable with free bottle of wine.
Car park is very tight but Concierge parked for us.
Second time we have stayed in last few months and we would highly recommend the hotel and breakfast.",5,2018,01,22
133,Very poor this time,"Usually, I enjoy staying at this hotel - the service is usually excellent, the location is great and the rooms are good.
This time, however, my bed was very uncomfortable, bot the pillows and the mattress felt old and tired. Plus, the room was very cold, no matter what I did with the thermostat. I had to sleep in my coat. 
I don't expect this from a 5 star hotel. very poor. Is the hotel going down hil?",2,2018,01,21
133,Great hotel,"This hotel provided 5 star service and accommodation.  Quick, helpful and efficient check in, and although we had the ‚Äòlower end‚Äô of the range of rooms it was perfect for an overnight stay and being at the end of the corridor, very quiet.  Some lovely touches such as coming back to the room with the radio softly playing, the bed turned down and complimentary water set out, and slippers and dressing gown to use.  There are some comments about the temperature of the room and we did struggle to get it right as it felt a little chilly, so ended up turning it up full whack which seemed to do the trick.  However it was preferable to the stuffy heat you sometimes get in hotel rooms.  

The breakfast was wonderful too, again very efficient service. 

Location wise it was a 20 min walk to Gloucester Road from the hotel (due to our tube stop being closed) and 15 min direct tube ride to Covent Garden, and also a direct line to kings cross too. 

We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. 

Thank you royal garden for making our stay so lovely.",5,2018,01,21
133,Good location,"Currently staying for 3 nights. Garden Room. I arrived in the evening very tired after a 13 hour flight. 

Check in was efficient. Room clean and modern but not plush. Fast, free WiFi. I requested a quiet room which it seems to be, thankfully. 

Bathroom is clean and spacious with nice touches. Great rain shower and separate deep bath. Large bed, although duvet was too thin not helped by the fact I couldn‚Äôt get room temperature right. But generally I couldn‚Äôt fault the room. Chose this hotel for it‚Äôs location as I have meetings locally. Lovely concierge and super helpful.  So far I would certainly recommend and stay again. ",4,2018,01,20
133,Lack of info/transparency,"So on the day i arrived (friday jan 19th) i asked where the fitness center was, and they told me it was closed. Pretty odd since the website says the gym is 24 hours. They did say that the gym would reopen the following day (jan 20th) at 6 am. With this in mind i decided to wait. The following day i decided to go workout around 10 pm, so i went to the lobby where they gave me the keys, told me the gym was open and showed me where the gym was located. Once i get downstairs, there seems to be some construction going on, i couldnt open the door so a guy came out and told me the gym was closed for construction. Bummer. I go back up to the lobby and they seem surprised as i came back only 2 min later. I told them the gym was closed and that there was a sign that said they were closed until jan 22nd, which they seem to completely ignore. They had no clue, nor any info about it. They were not rude, but the fact they werent aware considering it is a 5 star hotel is a huge downer. They should let all guests know all this type of information ahead or  even upon arrival, and not make the same mistake two days in a row",3,2018,01,20
133,"Good hotel, good location",Generally excelllent but duvets very thin so completely lacking warmth and any weight; had to turn up room temperature which then got too hot to be comfortable for sleeping. Good location for where we needed to be.,5,2018,01,19
133,Would stay here again!,"Too bad was only here one night for business!  Beautiful hotel, staffed by wonderful people, in a great neighborhood. Was wonderful to walk out door and into Kensington Gardens.  Very safe neighborhood.",5,2018,01,18
133,Excellent stay,"Great central location in London and we had a fantastic room overlooking the park. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. Unlike other hotels we've stayed in, this hotel was able to accommodate us with memory foam pillows which really helped us have a proper night's sleep. I would highly recommend staying here and look forward to staying here again.",5,2018,01,18
133,A Right Royal Treat,"We spent just one night at the Royal Garden on a Travelzoo voucher and what a lovely treat it was. We have stayed a few times before and as always the service and hospitality is first class. The staff are extremely helpful and welcoming, nothing is too much trouble. We stayed in a queen room which was very comfortable. Nice toiletries and well stocked with tea and coffee etc.

We had the pre theatre dinner at the Park Terrace which was a lovely way to start our evening. The food was delicious and not overly expensive. The service was a little slow so unfortunately we did not have time for dessert. Should have skipped the starter! 
The hotel is situated next to Kensington palace and it's an ideal spot for an early morning walk around the Park to work up an appetite for a breakfast that is a veritable feast! One of the best we have ever had. A perfect way to set you up for a day of sightseeing in the capital. Also there's a bus stop outside the hotel and a taxi rank so couldn't be easier. 
We do not visit London very often but when we do this is the place to stay. 
",5,2018,01,17
133,Great experience,The accommodations and the staff were excellent!  We had our teenage kids in an adjoining room and it was a great set up for our stay.  Great overall experience!!  Walking distance to  museums and easy access to the Tube.,5,2018,01,17
133,Spectacular,"We stayed in the Garden King Room all I can is the view is simply breathtakingly beautiful. I could have sat on the lounge a I looked out of the window for hours. The room itself was clean, modern and decently sized. Bathroom was very spacious, with a huge bath and a fantastic shower. Staff were friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful. The location was also great. 

We will definitely be staying here again when we return to London. ",5,2018,01,17
133,Perfect.,"Stayed here for a few nights back in November after my wedding for a little get
away as the honeymoon wasn't until January.

 Arrived and the doorman greeted us and was friendly. Went to check in, we were very early but thought we'd see if we could check in anyway. Staff were lovely and when asked why we were visiting London and explained we'd just got married we were upgraded and given food and drinks as a gift from them. Although our room wasn't ready we were offered a drink while we waited which was great. Then taken up to the room which was lovely with a great view of Kensington Gardens and Palace.

Staff were awesome all through our stay and when it came to check out (12pm for us) we asked if we could leave our luggage and many bags of Christmas shopping at the hotel reception and pick them up later as we not leaving london till later in the evening. This was no problem and made our lives so much easier.

All in all a great hotel with friendly staff in a great central location for getting around London. I will be back and glad the high horse 1* reviewers won't be so i can enjoy. ",5,2018,01,16
133,Always a fab stay,"We stay here every year for my birthday combined with a trip to see a show, and we love it every time. The staff were kind enough to give me a plate of chocolates with ""happy birthday"" written on it, such a lovely touch. All the staff are always so lovely, friendly and helpful. Room service breakfast overlooking the gardens is a great way to start the day! ",5,2018,01,16
133,Great location and easy stay,My first time in London - they were able to guide me to all sight seeing. Hayden @ the concierge desk will map out your visit and send you on your way. The hotel is clean and easy! The rooms could use some updating but the bathroom is extremely nice and spacious. Includes hair dryer and American outlet @ main desk in king room. ,5,2018,01,16
133,Excellent break,"Ideal hotel location with walking distance to the Royal Albert Hall. Staff and service excellent and we will be back. Short distance to walk from underground too. 
Had a lovely stroll round Kensington palace gardens which is just next door. 
Well done to all. ",5,2018,01,16
133,Stunning hotel,Stayed here twice now and it never disappoints. Only issue was noisy stayers upstairs awake til 4.30am and then cleaners were making a lot of noise by 8am! Apart from that it was a perfect stay. Room service on time and food excellent!,4,2018,01,16
133,Royal Garden is my unique choice in London.,"during the short stay, I didn't face any problem. I spent good time with good service, food , WIFI, room are fine and room service was good as well.... I wish to all the staff a Happy New Year and encourage them to provide always good service for the clients.",4,2018,01,15
133,My Stay,"Everything about our stay was very good. But I am extremely disappointed that my after shave that I am 100% certain I left in the bathroom has not been found?
And despite contacting the Concierge by email and the Security Department by phone to date I have not had a response.",5,2018,01,15
133,Excellent short stay,A great experience with very helpful staff.Location great and from the moment the doorman took my car to when we left it was a delightful experience . Quality of rooms good for the money and food excellent,5,2018,01,15
133,Understated Elegance in the heart of Kensington,"First trip to London was extra special because of the Royal Garden Hotel. We arrived early after a red eye from Boston and the staff was accommodating and kind from the start. We got right into a room, which was a great surprise after traveling all evening. The rooms are clean, tasteful, and spacious enough. We overlooked the Gardens. Beautiful bathroom with great amenities. The concierge staff was very helpful and gave us good direction on how best to see the city and get our bearings. This hotel is 5 star service without the pretension you can get at other accommodations of the same caliber. 

I suggest including the breakfast in your stay. Well worth the extra money. Gorgeous buffet of fruits, veggies, breads, pastries, yogurt, cheeses, meats, and you can order a la carte, depending on your package from their menu. The best way to start our London mornings! 

Afternoon tea is a must do here, too. We upgraded to do the champagne option as well and it was such a perfect way to spend our last afternoon. Great selection of tea, some rare and more special. Tea sandwiches and sweets were plentiful and delicious. 

Location is great-out of the main hustle and bustle of downtown and in the Trafalgar Square/Westminster/Parliament area but you have easy access there with cabs, the Underground, and buses. It is a great location to explore Paddington, Kensington, and easy walk to museums and Harrods! Only took about 45 minutes to walk from the heart of the attractions back to the hotel, so if you don't mind walking, its a beautiful route. 

Must check out this property if you want to be spoiled with great food, great service, and have a warm atmosphere to call 'home' for your London adventure!",5,2018,01,14
133,Wonderful trip,I would like to say my wife and I had a wonderful time staying at the Royal Garden Hotel for my wife‚Äôs birthday. We were made to feel so welcome and the room and service we received was exceptional. We also had a lovely meal in the hotel too!,5,2018,01,12
133,My overnight stay at the Royal Garden Hotel,"I love this hotel, and always stay here when I come to London. The staff are very friendly and professional and nothing is too much trouble. Beautiful rooms. Perfect location if visiting the Royal Albert Hall or Kensington Palace (within easy walking distance). Kensington High Street is also a great shopping experience.",5,2018,01,12
133,Ecellent,Very good hotel and good location and best views and best food and beverage and good staff and very good rooms and very relaxing hotel and best restaurants and bars and lovely wellcome to us and clean rooms ,5,2018,01,11
133,grate location,"The hotel is in great location, clean and friendly staff who gave our little one loads of goodies and a bottle of wine for us.They can also arrange scooters for the hole family if you so wished.  We have been at this hotel several times and will return in the future. In comparison to previous stays I felt the breakfast has slipped a bit ( some cooked food items where cold) but other than that no real complans     ",4,2018,01,10
133,Will be back,"Good location for the Royal Albert Hall, Kensington High Street etc. This is our first time staying here This is a busy hotel which can be noisy and although the staff are helpful they are reluctant to intervene if noise persists into the early hours. Breakfast was good. Love it.",5,2018,01,10
133,Excellent Location,"The hotel staff are all friendly, welcoming and helpful
the breakfast buffet was good-ish
the cleaning and minibar staff were not that professional neither that clean unfortunately.
The room size was perfect
the rooms are not quite as all noises are heard through the door and the wall",5,2018,01,10
133,Excellent hotel,"A thoroughly enjoyable stay with friendly and professional staff. 
A lovely hotel situated next to Kensington palace, with spacious rooms and every requirement catered for.  I would highly recommend and will most definitely be looking to stay here again in the future.  Chocolates were also left in my room as it was my birthday.",5,2018,01,09
133,Overnight at the Royal Garden,"Superb hotel, excellent staff and a splendid breakfast.

Never disappoints, great location, first class all the way.",5,2018,01,08
133,Amazing hotel with amazing staff,"one of the amazing hotels. they have the most friendly staff i have ever met during my travel around the world. not only the front office staff like reception and concierge but also the back office staff are really friendly and patient. sometimes i find cheaper hotels around london but when i remember my experience in this hotel  i change my mind and i re-book at the royal garden. the location is great near to the hyde park, oxford and harrods and still away from all the noises and troubles. the queen rooms are a bit small but the large mirror they have on the cupboard gives the illusion of the room being large. good choice for friends or young couples. the garden rooms are more suitable for couples with kids. (or if you are traveling with large suitcases).   ",5,2018,01,08
133,Blood stain on bed cover ,As you can see we found a huge blood stain on the top cover on the bed in our room. The hotels reaction has been nonchalant. I waited half an hour for the head housekeeper to come to our room. Her and the cleaner that attended both laughed when they arrived they though it was amusing after taking the offensive cover away they actually felt they had to ask if I wanted the other bed sheets to be changed. I spoke to the reception manager when checking out this morning.  She apologised no one called our room or checked on the situation throughout our stay. I am absolutely disgusted this is unacceptable in any establishment.,1,2018,01,07
133,Exllent,"Very attentive staff.  The bedroom was good, and the bed and pillows supremely comfortable.  The duvet was a little on the thin side, but there was a blanket in the wardrobe which I used.
Very good bath and shower.     Excellent choice at breakfast, and for a London hotel, was very good value",5,2018,01,07
133,London‚Äôs best Hotel,"This is London‚Äôs Best Hotel - full stop. It‚Äôs discreet, centrally located near to the underground, great high street shops, cafes, restaurants, etc. families are welcome and everyone feels special. For leisure travelers, wait for the room sales at certain times of the year and jump at them.",5,2018,01,06

133,Excellent stay,The hotel is well located and and pleasant. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the complimentary wine for booking direct through the hotel was a nice touch. The food was a little pricey but very good and the service was fab. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend this hotel.,5,2018,01,06
133,The best,"One of my best trips ever to london is when i spend time in the royal garden hotel, the location is perfect, everything you need is beside you and your minutes away from any other places, the neighbourhood is safe night walks are amazing because the park is just beside you! Just the best",5,2018,01,06

133,Christmas trip to london,"1-the evening room service to open beds should be don't between 6pm and 7pm not at 9pm. 
2-the concierge should be more considerate. He dragged our luggages on the stairs bouncing them all the way, and not taking care of them",5,2018,01,01
133,Desember trip with my two boys,"I stayed at royal garden hotel early desember with my two young boys and I was so impressed by the super friendly staff.

133,Christmas at Kensington,The hotel has very good staff who made a real effort to make one welcome. Not that common these days.  The Min Jiang restaurant has amazing views and the room (executive) was very well presented complete with small Christmas tree and a lovely welcome pack including some books and drawing things for the five year old. ,5,2017,12,29
133,Loved this hotel.,"We stayed here for a weekend getaway to London to see the xmas lights, really loved this place we had a lovely room overlooking Hyde park and could see Kensington Palace from the bedroom window, the breakfast was amazing and well worth having and the service was top notch,and the food was first class.
We would highly recommend this hotel as the position is good to get to all the sights and close to tube about 5 mins walk, you can also be in Hyde Park in 1 minute from the hotel doors and Kensington Palace just 3 mins walk.

And on top of this it was most comfortable with a superb location.",5,2017,12,26
133,Christmas spirit trip,This hotel is more a 4 star then 5 star hotel. Easy fix to get better: Change the rubbish beds and sheets. Fix the food to the restaurant and get some standard. Throw out load and overly drunk people.,4,2017,12,23

Furniture is a bit old and colors are dull. The view was ok-ish
House keeping is ok, sometimes not consistent with the amenities they add. Hotel is generally clean and neat but air conditioning controls are strange. ",3,2017,12,21

Afternoon tea was a real treat with the pianist and staff joining in with a happy birthday tune! 
We had such a wonderful time and will definitely be returning! ",5,2017,12,20
133,Wow!,"We stayed at the Royal Garden for one night to attend a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. What a wonderful hotel, with very attentive and well trained staff, and the place was absolutely spotlessly clean! We were there at just after noon, but our room was ready, which was a bonus, and we were shown to our room by the receptionist. Our bags were brought to our room literally minutes after we got there. On checking out the room it was spotlessly clean, the bed was of a good quality and the pillows were lovely. Everything about the room was great, and the extra bit of space where we had a sofa and desk and chair was a great addition and gave us somewhere to read the complimentary newspaper and for my husband to do a bit of work. We decided to order breakfast for the room, and what a breakfast it was. Plentiful, good quality and served with a smile! We were on the ninth floor so had a great view across London, but because of the glazing and black out curtains, we were not disturbed by traffic and the light. A truly wonderful hotel and we will definitely return when we visit the RAH again!",5,2017,12,20

133,Fantastic One Night Stay In The City,"From the moment we checked into the hotel, we were greeted warmly and told we had been upgraded to a garden room. The room wasn't quite ready so we were offered complimentary teas and coffees. On arrival in the room we were pleasantly surprised by the views over Kensington Palace gardens. The bathroom had a super deep bath, a powerful power shower cubicle. The bathroom had his n hers dressing gowns and thick white towels. There was also complimentary shower gel, shampoo and body lotion. Behind the sliding glass doors of the wardrobe is a safe, numerous wooden hangers and complimentary sippers for use during your stay. Perfect little touches to make your stay just that little bit better. Our room had excellent heating that could be adjusted to suit your own individual needs which was very welcoming on a cold chilly December evening. Our bed was firm which will really liked but the pillows were a little too soft for our liking. As we booked direct with the hotel, we were given a complimentary bottle of chilled Prosecco along with two small bottles of still water. On returning from our night out, the bed had been turned down with a further bottle of water on each side of the bed. Everything has been so thoughtfully considered here. There are ample sockets to charge your phones, cameras etc.The breakfast in the morning was delicious, we went for the continental option and devoured plenty of fresh fruit, yoghurts, pastries and coffee etc. We booked a car parking space underneath the hotel which which got at a very favourable discount as we were staying in the Royal Garden Hotel. We parked at 10.30 am on a Saturday and departed at 17.00 pm on the Sunday costing us approximately ¬£40. When you come out of the hotel turn left for the Royal Albert Hall and Harrods. Turn right for a few shops, banks, restaurants etc. Opposite Royal Garden and slightly to the right is Prezzo, further down on the right is The Ivy. Absolutely beautiful stay. This hotel met all our needs and more. We will definitely return, book direct to reap various complimentary rewards. Lisa & Craig x ",5,2017,12,19
133,Exceptional hotel,"We have stayed many times at this hotel and the standard is outstanding. The staff are welcoming and very helpful. We have stayed as a couple and as a family, with our 4 year old daughter. The hotel is extremely child friendly. Book this hotel - you will not be disappointed.

133,Good Hotel but no PARKING,Very nice hotel but you need to pay extra to park your car. The rooms are clean and the service is very friendly. Ideal location fot Hyde Park and The Royal Albert Hall. Good location for shopping. Bad parking.,5,2017,12,19
133,Business/Family Trip,"We stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel recently. I was there for a business trip, but my family joined me as they had never been to London. The hotel made special accommodations for us and treated us like royalty when we were there. Everyone was courteous and helpful, and always willing to provide all information needed to make our trip/vacation go as smoothly as possible. We would definitely stay here again in the future!",5,2017,12,18
133,Excellent service that never falters.,"We have been staying here for years and will continue to return as the staff members are excellent.
This is a great hotel I cannot find anything to complain about.  Very spacious and comfortable rooms.",5,2017,12,18
133,Lovely stay,"Lovely well located hotel, very clean and well presented, staff were all excellent.  Yes the room is small but fine for one night stay in central London that is standard unless paying a lot more.  Breakfast was beyond excellent.  would return again",5,2017,12,18
133,Surprising Location,"I liked the hotel very much. I would always come back. Didn't have breakfast though so cannot say anything about it. Got an upgrade, bottle of water and fruits in the room. The room was on the 9th floor and quiet. The bed was super",5,2017,12,18
133,Very disappointing. Very poor experience.,"Booked using a huge number of Chase loyalty points. We must have been given the worst room available on the property. Room 524. A box with no space for luggage, looked nothing like the double picture on hotel site. Not a 5 star room, a 3 star room at most. I was very dissapointed because this hotel room looked so nice from the pics. It is absolutely unacceptable for the price or points. I did speak to reception but was told there were no other rooms available at the price range that night and needed to wait till next day. Their main concern was the price range, not the guest. Since they seemed unwelcoming to make a change and we were staying a few nights, we did not follow up. Neither did they.

Concierge was also not 5 star. Incorrect information and poor follow up for taxi arrangements. Lobby restrooms could have been maintained better.

On the plus side - breakfast was awesome. Location very nice.

Advise to management: Show some care to every guest regardless of the channel they arrive.",2,2017,12,16
133,Great hotel and location,"Great stay again this time in garden room with lovely view of Kensington gardens and Kensington Palace.  Friendly service and great location especially for Royal Albert Hall (10 minutes walk).  Would definitely recommend stay here. 

",5,2017,12,15
133,Freezing cold room,"Stayed in room 129 on Thursday 14th December for 1 night, as we entered the room we could feel the cold which was a shock to the system (¬£260 for room only) so we thought the room would be a comfortable temperature at least. We called the reception who sent an engineer to investigate, he confirmed that the blow air would get warmer but why was the room so cold for any guests to walk into ? It took approx 45 mins for the room to warm up but the sheets on the bed were cold all night. Hotel seemed really nice and staff were excellent ",3,2017,12,15
133,park suite,great views of hyde park and high street kensington. room service is always amazing and food really well priced. nice spacious room really well equipped with great facilities. staff always willing to help :) will always recommend to friends and family,5,2017,12,15
133,Pre X-mas business trip,"Great stay as usual. One tip: Last time I visited the RG, the gym closed down. Alternative (2 blocks away across the street) is not really an option. Hotel should re-establish a gym in-house for the guests",5,2017,12,15
133,"Royal Garden, best place to stay in london","a combination of location, views, services and staff friendliness makes this the best place to stay in London whether you are visiting on business or pleasure.
the concierge is very helpful whether it is shows or dinners 
the business centre is very responsive to unusual requests.
very low staff turnover improves the guest experience and suggests a high level of staff loyalty",5,2017,12,14
133,Wonderful Weekend break,Really great weekend stay. The whole Hotel was spotlessly clean. The staff were polite and very courteous. Only one small negative is that the queen rooms are very small. We will book a different room type next time.,5,2017,12,13
133,Christmas in Lonodn,"The hotel is fantastic. 
The only thing to complain about is the very hard beds, and the staff in The Terrace. The staff is forgetting things, don't understand, and very slow. No matter if it was for breakfast or for drinks.
Sad with this small things, otherwise the Hotel i absolutly fantastic.",5,2017,12,13
133,Perfect for London Convenience,Our only issue was how small the room was.  Much smaller than the photos.  The bathroom was great as was everything else which was perfect.  Very clean and welcoming hotel. Great location. Will return again.,4,2017,12,12
133,Beyond Excellent Hotel,The Royal Garden Hotel is aptly named as you are treated as someone special from the minute you arrive until you are wished farewell. The rooms are fab. The restaurants are excellent. Also they must serve the best breakfast in High Street Kensington you are spoilt for choice. As for Bertie‚Äôs Bar for a late night drink - aaamazing. ,5,2017,12,12
133,As always lovely saty,"Fantastic hotel great service great location always choose the Royal Garden Hotel why stay anywhere else!!!! The location is excellent for all London attractions with the bus stopping just outside the hotel and the Tube a 10 minute walk away. The hotel has lovely views over Kensington Palace Gardens, and for real convenience there is a NCP car park under the hotel with fantastic discounted rates if stayin* at  the hotel. I have stayed here with my mum more than 30 times now wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere else.",5,2017,12,12
133,Royal Gardens,"I come to London often for business and regularly stay at Royal Gardens.  The location is convenient and I greatly enjoy having such close proximity to the parks.  The accommodations are clean and well kept, and the staff friendly and professional.",4,2017,12,11
133,Awesome,"Amazing stay in this hotel. We had a few drinks in the bar and an evening meal and breakfast in the restaurant. The food is of a very high standard. The room was clean and spacious, the staff were all amazing too, friendly helpful and smiling 
Well done 
Shall return ",5,2017,12,11
133,Excellent,"I have just returned from a weekend in London. This is the first time I have used this particular Hotel. I can Highly recommend it!  I arrived early on Saturday morning and the young lady on reception was outstanding! I received a room immediately even though it was only 11am. The room was abslutely immaculate with a beautiful view over Kesington Gardens. I was on a very busy schedule but every member of staff I met throughout my stay - Concierge, Room Service, Housekeeping were absolutely brilliant. Service was always with a smile and nothing was to much trouble. I will definitely return. Thank You",5,2017,12,11
133,Great for Business,"Will choose Royal Garden for my future business trip.  Close to the tube station, Enough stores around the hotel, quiet location, close to Paddington station for Heathrow express ride.  Much better than other hotels in center of London.  ",5,2017,12,10
133,4 nights,"Hey I spend 4 night in royal garden hotel and it was excellent time and place ,Very nice place and service also the cleaning is perfect     Food is delicious and healthy with different kind of cousins ....",5,2017,12,09
133,Very enjoyable stay,"Very nice hotel, room was well appointed with quality fittings.  The Min Jiang is excellent.  Getting a taxi the next morning was a bit of a trial - the hotel could organise this better I think. But otherwise and excellent one night stay after a dinner and I would use this hotel again.",4,2017,12,09
133,Nice views but dated,"Our room had nice views over the park, it was spacious and clean but just very very dated and quite dark.  The reception and bar area also feel old fashioned too so could also do with an update.  Staff were friendly and helpful and it is very clean.  Would stay again as convenient for visiting our friends who now live in Kensington.",3,2017,12,08
133,Lovely Hotel,Me and my mum stayed here for a special birthday treat. The hotel was lovely. The staff were incredibly helpful and the location was perfect! All in all a great stay. Will definitely recommend to friends and family. ,5,2017,12,08
133,Loved Royal Garden Hotel,The location and hotel were great. Next visit we will stay in the same hotel. From the moment we checked in the staff were all very helpfully and friendly. The tube is very close and a lot of very nice restaurants.,5,2017,12,07
133,This Is A Poor Excuse for a 5 Star Hotel,"I have stayed in a number of 5 star London hotels over the years. Few have been impressive, many have poor service and small uninviting rooms. This hotel simply continues the trend. 

On Check In, the Receptionist did not listen to what I had to say and began arguing with me. The issue pertained to a deposit charged to my credit card. I asked if the ability for any charges to my room could be disabled, to avoid anyone charging items to the room number. She took this request as a refusal to hand over a credit card and so called for a manager, who also did not understand what I was asking for and demanded a credit card. I never refused a credit card but neither member of staff listened to what I was actually requesting. I asked for a late checkout and that request was refused and I was told to ask the night before check out. A VERY poor check-in experience. 

The room itself was ridiculously small, given the cost of rooms. The bed was way too small for two adults, one being 6Ft tall. My wife's legs hung over the end and being so small, made for two very uncomfortable nights sleep. We also could not turn off the wardrobe light and it shone all night. We asked for it to be fixed, but we came back at night and it had not been repaired. We had to call down to Reception to ask for a resolution. 

On the first day, we asked one of the many Conceirege's for some details of a V & A exhibition. The smell of smoke that he emitted was unbearable. It is unacceptable to smell like an ashtray, whilst on duty. Also, the information he gave was incorrect and the exhibition did not begin until 3 days after our departure. 

The breakfast was mediocre and certainly not worth the money. 

On the night before departure, we asked for the late check-out and it was refused, as they were ""Fully Booked"". I just stood there looking at the receptionist, wanting to say so much about the stay. The level of poor service just continued. I did mention to the Receptionist that I could not understand how the hotel receives glowing Tripadvisor reviews, as we were so unimpressed. To say she was not interested, was an understatement.

Personally, this is yet another London hotel we will not re-visit. I would not want to waste any more of our money at this hotel. I have never been so unimpressed with a 5 star hotel, as I was with this one. It has to be one of the worst I have stayed in for comfort and service.",2,2017,12,06
133,excellent,"the room is excellent so is the hotel, and the staff are friendly and helpful, and the location of the hotel is nice and the hotel is known. i'm looking forward to booking again in this hotel, thank you so very much.",5,2017,12,06
133,Amazing stay with amazing views,Will definitely come back here. The views are amazing and the location is perfect for shopping and sightseeing. The breakfast in park Terrace is superb especially with the omelette and waffle chef and all the staff were so friendly. The room was spacious and exceptionally clean and I didn‚Äôt want to leave at the end of my stay. ,5,2017,12,06
133,good,"The location is exemplary, the service and staff are superb. The room was Queens Room. Though the contents were very good, I think it was overpriced for a single room at the non-refundable, 2-month in advance rate of ¬£188 per night! In comparison to the ¬£200 per night double bedroom of two beds, with a view on Kensington palace and Gardens!
Also, tv reception in the room was bad, reflecting again on the room location.
Otherwise, all was very good.

",5,2017,12,06
133,Amazing,We loved it as a family. Excellent location and very friendly staff . Everything was convenient .. highly recommended especially if you want something close to the park and in the centre close to everything ,5,2017,12,05
133,Excellent hotel,"Stayed here 4 times now over the last 15 years and its always excellent.

The staff make this hotel, nothing is too much trouble, friendly, well mannered, from the reception staff to the house keeping.

5 star cleanliness. Gorgeous breakfast. Lovely rooms with great coffee/tea facilities, good quality coffee and biscuits.

My parents were upgraded from a queen room to a deluxe king overlooking Kensington gardens. I did politely ask for a possible upgrade because it was their 50th anniversary and the hotel very kindly did this along with some chocolates.

Just wanted to say a big thank you for the free upgrade, my parents were over the moon with their room.

Hopefully this won't be our last visit....",5,2017,12,05
133,Xmas Party Event 2017,"This hotel was an exceptional venue for holding an event. The events organiser,  Bettina was amazing from first point of contact.
Every meeting or email prior to the event was dealt with professionally and without delay. She knew exactly what would work and within our budget. When choosing the food dishes for the event, Bettina added some more suggestions which were absolutely amazing, and were all executed well on the evening for a party of 78 people. The bedroom was beautiful and the hotel itself is in a prime central location. The whole ambience of the hotel and staff contributed to a truly wonderful weekend.",5,2017,12,04

133,Be treated like Royalty,"I had the opportunity to stay at the Royal Garden Hotel back in 2014 and once again this past Thanksgiving. Service all around was excellent from when we first arrived at the hotel in the morning. Paloma at the front desk greeted us with a smile and worked with us to get us into our rooms as quickly as possible. 

What was great about this visit was seeing the night manger of the Park Terrace Restaurant and Bar, Daniel who I met back in 2014. A true professional with excellent interpersonal skills and one that takes pride in his job.

The rooms were nice, clean and comfortable. I would recommend, if it is in your budget, go with the deluxe room as opposed the the standard room. Due to the oversight on my part, I booked the standard room which was a little smaller then the deluxe rooms we had last time.

Overall I cannot say enough good things about the Royal Garden Hotel and their staff. The staff truly made us feel welcomed and I highly recommend the hotel if you want to be treated like royalty.",5,2017,12,04
133,Weekend birthday stay,"Couldn‚Äôt fault anything, lovely room , great views, nice bar, excellent brekkie and the location was spot on for the winter wonderland and the Kensington Palace tour with the Diana dress exhibition. Next to the gardens it was nice to have a walk around on a not too busy Sunday and also plenty of drinking and eating places all close by . Will stay here again in he near future ...only slight downside is they have smoking rooms so beware when booking ( can‚Äôt believe it in 2017 )",5,2017,12,04
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"Great hotel location and service in the hotel. 
Service disappointing in the corporate function. 
Rooms vary hugely in size and I would question the value for money depending on what room you are allocated.
If you have a front facing room you look out over Kensington High Street but if you are lucky enough to get a rear facing room you have a lovely view. ",3,2017,12,04

133,Lovely weekend break,Great location for the Albert Hall and museums so great for a weekend break. It‚Äôs a comfortable  well run hotel with all the facilities we needed. The breakfast was also very good. Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt have long enough to try the bar or restaurant but we definitely return.,5,2017,12,04
133,not quite a 5 star hotel,the room was small for a 5 star hotel and not up to 5 star standard. excellent location. the service not that great in the bar although good coffee. the Chinese restaurant was outstanding.although very expensive.,4,2017,12,03
133,Fabulous hotel and AMAZING staff,"We stayed here for only one night for our daughters birthday and I have to say this is the most friendly hotel I have ever stayed in.  Every single member of staff who we came across were so friendly and nothing was too much trouble and they were all so happy it shone through.  The hotel itself is in a great place for shopping the rooms are lovely and comfortable and clean with great amenities.  Breakfast was great and all you could want in a lovely setting.  I have to say I wouldn't even look any further I would only stay here I can't praise it enough, happy staff make happy guests and that is certainly what you get here.  Can't wait to be staying here again thank you Royal garden for a lovely stay",5,2017,12,03
133,Warm and friendly hotel in a great location,"From arrival to check out the staff in all departments of the hotel were excellent. Friendly and helpful without being stuffy or officious. We were lucky enough o get a room overlooking Kensington gardens which was delightful.
Perfect location for visiting the Royal Albert Hall - as we were.",5,2017,12,03
133,Outstanding Stay in London,"Although my stay in London was brief I couldn't have picked a better hotel. It was easily accessible from Heathrow and locates in the heart of shops and restaurants. I thoroughly enjoyed my walk through Kennsington Garden and all the shopping. The hotel staff was quite pleasant during both my check-in and check-out. The hotel was modern, clean, and I really appreciated the attention to detail such as the greeting with my name on the television in my room. I highly recommend staying at the Royal Garden if you visit London.",5,2017,12,02
133,Fantastic 5* all the way ,"We flew from Newcastle to London for my daughters birthday so we booked a hotel Off recommendations we also booked a Chauffeur to save any hassle from the hotel they where waiting on time so friendly  the car was gleaming  and the driver was very friendly and so nice must say we have travelled all over the world and this must be one of the most friendliest hotels  my family have ever stayed . Great attention to detail , very clean , fabulous rooms .

",5,2017,12,02
133,Best Hotel in London ,"I am impressed. Such a very nice, lovely, stylish hotel with great service and elegance. To wake up with the view of Kensington Palace, and to have Kensington garden on your doorstep gives a lovely feeling. The area is great as well and I would choose this hotel over and over again. Don‚Äôt miss the Roof top restaurant or a little break in Bertie‚Äôs bar . ",5,2017,12,02

133,Excellent customer service,My wife and I booked a room and evening meal using a special offer for a birthday cerebration. The staff were friendly and very helpful and could not have done more to make our short stay better. After a day touring the local sights we had a  delightful cocktail in Berties bar before enjoying one of the best meals we have ever experienced from the A La Carte menu in the Park Terrace restaurant.,5,2017,11,30
133,Location,"Great hotel. Good sized rooms which were clean and tidy. All staff we had dealings with were very good. Got the room, breakfast and cocktail for a very good price. Only criticism a little too far out of the city. Ideal for Knightsbridge and Kensington.",4,2017,11,30
133,A good hotel in the heart of London,"Second stay here. Once again, very nice with great helpful staff. Room was a little tired but overall, we were happy with our stay. Breakfast was delicious served whilst watching the Royals drive past!!",4,2017,11,30
133,London overnight stay in the fabulous Royal Garden Hotel,Excellent location - we had a lovely stroll through the park past Kensington Palace on Sunday morning. Beautiful rooms - very well laid out and presented. Reasonably priced food and wonderful choice for breakfast. We have stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel a few times now and wouldn't contemplate going anywhere else now. Added bonus meeting a famous pop group member in the lift! Awesome!,4,2017,11,29
133,Great place to stay in London,"I always stay at the Royal Garden. It's close to the tube, rooms are comfortable and spacious, 24 hour room service, and the staff is kind and accommodating. The rooms facing the park are the best ones as the view is quite serene.",5,2017,11,29
133,ROYAL GARDEN HOTEL,"An excellent hotel ,the only one that we consider when visiting London,The rooms have great views of Kensington Gardens or the busy High street.The restaurant also has great views,food and service .Everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel.Access to the city is just outside .by bus or tube and the Royal Albert Hall is walking distance.",5,2017,11,29
133,What service looks like,"From walking in the door at the start of our stay to leaving to return to Canada, I can say that Royal Garden Hotel truly understands what quality of service means! My family and I absolutely LOVE this Hotel. We have been around the world and stayed in COUNTLESS hotels...... This hotel is one of the BEST!   Lorilee Cole",5,2017,11,28
133,Almost perfect,Gorgeous modern hotel with great views from the garden rooms. It's a treat for me to stay  a hotel like this but its one I'd definitely like to repeat. Garden room was modern and spacious. Staff are friendly and welcoming. Hard to fault.,5,2017,11,28
133,"Excellent hotel, great service","Great location for using TFL. Located next to Hyde Park it offers a great opportunity to take a pre-breakfast stroll through the park.
Profeesional staff that can't do enough for you. Twelfth time of stopping - never disapoints",5,2017,11,28
133,No view,"¬†The hotel website states ""Our rooms offer panoramic views of¬†Kensington Palace and Gardens, Hyde Park and London‚Äôs skyline."" But all we could see from our room was a wall. It was a very disappointing experience.",3,2017,11,27
133,Great Hotel & Super Location,I stayed at the hotel during a conference. The staff was polite and friendly and the room design was very classy. The location was great as it was right next to Kensignton Gardens. It was Autumn and the garden was breathtakingly beautiful!,5,2017,11,27
133,THE LADY STILL HAS HER APPEAL AND PERFECT LOCATION,"FROM ROOM 509.....of The Royal Gardens Hotel in The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea..... I have an excellent view of Kensington Palace as the morning ‚òÄ wintry sunshine blazed through my room window.... Almost like a wake up call for me to enjoy the sumptuous and varied breakfast offerings.  

Very helpful and professional staff on duty on the 25 November 2017. Basil the chef was also helpful and animated. 20 plus years of service shows.

My check-in experience was pleasant and the staff were helpful and courteous. It was also nice to hear a staff asking you on check-out if you enjoyed your stat and wishing you a pleasant onward journey.    

I requested a quite room on the higher floors with views of Kensington Park and my request was granted. Thank you RGH. The RGH front entrance staff were equally courteous. This proves (particularly in England and some European countries) it does not require hotel staff to move  mountains by just making EVERY guest feel that they are welcome like a VIP.

My bed was comfortable and the complimentary tea, coffee, water etc was a nice bonus...although I did not get my morning newspaper delivered as promised. Good to see a hotel house-keeper on each floor checking the quality of housekeeping.

My suggestion to RGH is to consider plain laminated floors for the rooms and removed the carpets when they undertake the upgrading of the property.  It is More hygienic, easier to clean and less likely to show sings of stains.",4,2017,11,26
133,Great Hotel.,Great hotel and good value for money. Nice to look out over Kensington Gardens whilst having breakfast. Great location for visiting the museums and the Albert Hall. Also only a short distance from Harrods. ,5,2017,11,26
133,A perfectly London hotel,We stayed here 1night for Equity Release Awards dinner in the hotel. Reception staff great. Room thoughtful design with everything at hand. Peaceful and not overheated. Dinner food restaurant standard. Breakfast and staff a delight. Stay again? Yes. ,5,2017,11,26
133,Is the Hotel Owner Aware of the Staff Member's Rudeness?,"I had an unpleasant guest experience at the hotel.  Due to miscommunication among staff, I was disturbed in my room while I was resting with the privacy light on, and spoken to in an unkind and unprofessional manner by both a staff member and the manager. Guests should always be treated with hospitality and trust.",1,2017,11,25
133,Beautiful hotel - worth the price!,"I booked this hotel as part of a package with Harry Potter and the Cursed Child tickets as the show was sold out and this was the only way I could get tickets.  So it cost me a pretty penny, but I am SO glad I did it!  Not only did it mean that we could plan our trip to London and I knew I had show tickets, but the hotel was fantastic.  The staff was friendly and helpful and when they found out we were on vacation for my husband's birthday, they brought up a bottle of champagne on the house, which was really considerate.  The concierge's recommendation for dinner was spot on and our room included a full English breakfast each morning, which was delicious.  We had turn-down service every night and all of the nice touches you expect with a luxury hotel.  Thank you!!  And the bathtub was even nice and deep (I am usually too tall for them, so I enjoyed actually getting to soak in a real tub for once after sightseeing)!  Worth every penny!",5,2017,11,24
133,Champagne gourmet night,"Stayed over last night as we have visited the Park Terrace restaurant many times and decided to make a night of it by staying here as well. We had a room on the first floor overlooking Kensington Park and really could not fault anything from arriving to leaving.
Will definitely return and thoroughly recommend. I have written many glowing reviews about the restaurant but again would say it‚Äôs worth a visit as not only is the food well presented but the staff are excellent. ",5,2017,11,24
133,Fantastic experience,"Right from my the start, I received a warm welcome from the staff. Cleaning and room service staff were very courteous and friendly. I will definitely be staying at the Royal Garden Hotel again in the future. I was very impressed with the gym facilities.",5,2017,11,23
133,Awards Evening,"I attended an awards evening which overall was enjoyable, however on this occasion (following many previous times staying at the hotel) I thought the room lacked some basic maintenance. the shower head needed descaling, I had a soiled towel and there seemed to be drainage problems, Issues I would not expect to have in a 5 star establishment",3,2017,11,23
133,Great hotel but room service needs improving.,"Great venue hotel and surroundings, Great for London vacation or business. Nice clean comfortable room 123.  Reception staff were welcoming and professional. Bar staff on a busy night coped well at the FSM awards even when the credit card system crashed and  could only take cash! Hotel was very nice, bathroom was very clean, nice room comfortable bed over looking Kensington High Street,  nice shower, bath robe could be improved  and staff were excellent, The only negative I could give this hotel was that I ordered breakfast in bed and it never arrived. 
Would I recommend this hotel, yes!",4,2017,11,23
133,Great central location," I travel to London and stay here a great deal for business. The staff is always gracious and beyond helpful. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed. It‚Äôs central location is fantastic.  Easy to reach the metro, shops, Royal Albert Hall, Kensington Gardens, etc. Also, if you can get one of the rooms that looks out over the gardens it will make your stay all the better. ",5,2017,11,22
133,Home from home,"We have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have never been let down. We always receive a warm welcome and are made to feel very welcome. Car parking is at a premium in the city so the car park at the hotel is a bonus. This is a central hotel and is handy for Kensington Palace, Hyde Park, Royal Albert Hall, Albert memorial to name but a few of the sights. 
At night the London skyline is illuminated and looks wonderful, giving you an idea of just how close you are to all the areas of interest. 
The rooms are very comfortable and spacious, with good views from the upper floors, over the Hyde Park and in some cases part of Kensington Palace. 
The breakfast is very good and is varied enough to suit everyone. The continental breakfast has a wonderful array of fresh fruit and pastries etc. You can have a full English breakfast or any variation to suit your needs. The chef is on hand to make fried, poached eggs and of course a selection of fillings for omelettes. Give it a try you will not be disappointed.",5,2017,11,21
133,Expensive but worth it,"We stay here every November as a treat. Great hotel, excellent service, food is superb. Nothing is too much trouble Parking is good value and below the hotel.Will definitely be back next year. Would definitely recommend ",5,2017,11,21
133,Our favorite London Hotel,"We stay here every time we travel to London whether it be business or pleasure.  The service is fantastic, the rooms are very clean and large enough to provide a comfortable stay. The view overlooking Hyde Park is beautiful.",5,2017,11,21
133,Best hotel breakfast I've had in a very long time,"I stayed here on Saturday, 18 November, along with my husband, my son and his partner and daughter.  Our rooms were lovely, two overlooking the road, which gave a great opportunity to 'people watch', and from my daughter's room you could see Kensington Palace.

I have stayed in many hotels in London, but I think this is one of my favourites.  The location is great, especially being next to Hyde Park.  Walking on Sunday morning cleared lots of cobwebs.

Unfortunately, we were late booking rooms, so we were unable to book a table in the restaurant for dinner as it was full, but the breakfast was excellent quality.

I would definitely return to this hotel on my next trip to London and would recommend it without hesitation if you are visiting the Capital.",5,2017,11,21
133,Excellent hotel and staff,"The restaurant, the staff, the service, the location are excellent.
The room is comfortable but the temperature must be warmer especially in the afternoon, it wasn't possible to regulate the temperature in the room",4,2017,11,21
133,Wonderful place to stay,This hotel is a wonderful one. The staff is friendly and attentive. The only problem I have was in the bar with a in training lady that was really disappointing even disagreeable. When I asked for a juice she told me something like this: If you want a juice look there for it,5,2017,11,20
133,I‚Äôm bringing my mum back to the Royal Garden Hotel!,Thank you to the Royal Garden Hotel. Totally worth every penny for our evening stay. Myself and my daughter made the most of the room and were able to relax in a luxury. Our daughter had a complimentary rucksack with special goodies that made her trip even more memorable. The reception staff made me feel so special - like I was a returning well loved guest and the concierge were so obliging and were very attentive. The breakfast was great too and nothing was too much trouble for anyone. I am bringing my mum back for a treat next year!,5,2017,11,19

133,Amazing Experience At Royal Garden Hotel,"I frequent London 6-7 times a year on business and have stayed at many brand hotels. However, none of them compare to the excellence, quality and phenomenal customer service I experienced at the Royal Garden Hotel. It's now my new hotel of choice in London moving forward and recommend the hotel to anyone visiting London on personal or business matter.",5,2017,11,19
133,Super as usual.,Thankyou to Jonathan and the team for looking after our guests and ourselves so well. We are always treated like one of the family and the service as usual was impeccable. Looking forward to our next stay...,5,2017,11,19
133,40th Birthday Weekend Stay,"My husband and I stay in London frequently but this was our first visit to The Royal Garden Hotel and it certainly won't be our last. We always stay in Kensington and have passed this hotel many times before deciding we would try this hotel for my 40th Birthday stay.
The hotel and staff were amazing , nothing was too much trouble and the staff were so friendly , it made the stay even more enjoyable.
The rooms are large with all the amenities you would expect. Clean and comfortable.
We booked to have breakfast during our stay and it was well worth booking , plenty of choice , everything was delicious and once again the staff were amazing.
I would highly recommend this hotel and I most certainly will be rebooking.",5,2017,11,17
133,Luxury Stay,"Fantastic hotel, staff very friendly and helpful throughout my stay, would highly recommend. Room service and food very good and delivered at time requested.  The view from my room was exceptional overlooking the palace and park.  Beds very comfy and bathroom very clean will certainly stay there again.",5,2017,11,17
133,Great hotel,"Very well located, nice clean rooms with very friendly and efficient  staff. It is a very upscale hotel in price and though I would gladly stay there again,however I would never be able to afford it. I have been fortunate to stay there on 3 or 4 occasions and each time , it was on someone's else dime.",5,2017,11,15
133,Lovely Hotel and Great Location,Excellent hotel and service with great views over Kensington Palace and close to Kensington and underground for ease of access everywhere. We attended a function that was equally good. A bit expensive but expected at this quality of hotel,5,2017,11,14
133,London stay,Very pleasant hotel. I personally think the food and bar drinks are overpriced. But overall a very pleasant experience and very well located for ease of access to all major attractions in London. Right on a bus stop and close by to a tube station ,4,2017,11,14
133,Brilliant,"Very clean, bed was very comfortable didn‚Äôt want to get out of bed! Brilliant and helpful staff! Views were lovely. Good location. We were upgraded to a even better room. Hotel facilities were brilliant",5,2017,11,14
133,Latest visit,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay last week and visited my art exhibition which I'd been invited to attend. Hotel very central for where I needed to go to and good transport links. Managed to get a visit to Harrods as well so a good two day stay.,5,2017,11,13
133,Very comfortable room!,"Despite being out of the hotel all day on business, I very much enjoyed the comfortable room in the evenings. All my wishes were met and the food did not disappoint. The hotel was very clean and the location is perfect for those who like to do a morning run in the park! ",4,2017,11,13
133,More than the sum of its parts.,"Rarely do I experience such hospitality. The staff at the Royal Garden are a credit to the industry.  I am not going to comment on each component, needless to say my experience during my visit was one to remember, a truly world class hotel.

I look forward to returning with my family, you made my fleeting visit to London an exceptional experience. I hope you don‚Äôt change a thing.",5,2017,11,12
133,A good stay,"A very  good experience and stay.

133,One night,Spent one night at hotel. Very friendly and helpful staff. Good location .  If your not from London and not used to London prices then make sure you bring plenty of money as food and drinks are expensive .,5,2017,11,12
133,PRICEY BUT EXCELLENT.,Weekend away in London and this hotel did a great  job. Booked due to good reviews and great location. Nice big room and we got a green view which my wife liked. Big bathroom and quality toiletries. Bed good. We had a noisy night one night due to some kind of award evening being held at the hotel and lot's of guests partying but it didn't ruin our stay. Having Wholefoods across the road was a bonus.,5,2017,11,11
133,Excellent location,The hotel rooms were excellent and the staff was great. The location is terrific. The hotel does lack a calm feeling on arrival the outdoor bell staff could do a better job clearing the cars and not allowing smokers in front of the building which makes the hotel seem less nice than it is. We were reluctant to stay there as a result and turned out to be pleasantly surprised by the hotel. We normally stay at the Ritz or Browns which is a different vibe but I would say compares reasonably to Browns but the entrance chaos doesn‚Äôt let you realise that. ,4,2017,11,11
133,"Perfect location, good service","Heart of London, centrally located with all shopping places around and close to museums. High Street Kensington tube station less then 5 minutes walking. I got upgraded and had an absolutely amazing view from a huge room, with lots of space, big bed and a spacious bathroom. The bathroom itself was quite basic (comparing to the quality of my room) but I did not need anything else. Nice, good quality breakfast, although I did not quite understand the fact that my breakfast was included while I still had to sign a bill for ordering something a la carte. So I was not billed but had to sign. This was a business trip so we used conference rooms (exceptional service) and coffee breaks & lunch - quality of food was exceptional as well. Very good hotel, I am pleased, also with service and staff attention.",4,2017,11,10
133,Quiet place,"I recommend this hotel for those who wants comfortable stay in London, It is a bit pricey but the location is fantastic and the room is big and comfortable. I have aked for accessible room and got one.",4,2017,11,10

133,A wonderful week return to an old favorite.,I first visited this hotel when I brought a group on a tour of England in the early 1980's. It was wonderful then and when my wife and I visited the newly updated version we were very happy indeed. The staff is magnificent from the doorman to the managers. The best of the best.,5,2017,11,08

133,Worst experince,"Awful, awful rooms as in a cheap hostel. Could not stand more than 5 minutes in there and moved out. Furnitue in the room are work out, bathroom cheap looking and far from 5 star cleaness standard, view from the room partly on the nearby wall. Nothing was really right",1,2017,11,07
133,best view in london,Great stay. friendly staff. No nonsense child friendly luxury hotel. the view overlooking kensington gerdesn is stunning . A much nicer alternative to the more expensive hotels on the other side of hyde park,5,2017,11,07
133,Superb location,Our room had a beautiful view overlooking the park and London. All staff made this a wonderful experience. We will return next year as we have not found a better hotel in our many trips to London.  The location was very convenient and the car parking under the hotel was a real bonus.,5,2017,11,07
133,Home away from home,"Another outstanding stay at my home away from home. Its always a pleasure to stay at the Royal Garden Hotel as they are consistently superb in everything g they do and have to offer. I will continue to use this hotel when in London and highly recommend it to others as well.
",5,2017,11,07
133,Excellent,Had a king room fantastic view great bed and breakfast room service was great. Location was a bit out if city center but Kensington high street tube is only 400m away which if you‚Äôre travelling from Euston is advised as a black cab is going to cost you ¬£25. Staff were friendly and the hotel is really 5 star both facilities and cleanliness ,5,2017,11,06
133,A great stay,"I would highly recommend this hotel it is set in a fabulous location. The staff are friendly and approachable. The food was excellent. The room was spacious and impeccably clean. All as you would expect from a 5* hotel.  You would not be disappointed.

133,Great hotel but not a 5* ,"It's a fantastic hotel! I arrived at the check-in to be awarded with a free upgrade. All staff members are incredibly helpful. 

Although I've stayed in nearly 60,  5* hotels throughout the world and this certainly isn't one. 

The decor and standards are just simply not to the standards of a 5 star hotel. small cracks In the tiles, old lobby decor and only Iphone 4 alarm clocks in the rooms (who even has a Iphone 4 now?) really not what was expected in 5* hotel in central London. 

The park view lounge downstairs (afternoon tea) is fantastic although and service is flawless through catering to every need I had. 

I called room service at 10:30am and asked for a bottle of water (should be complimentary for a 5* hotel). Although was informed this was for a (turn down service in the evening only) after calling reception this was quickly solved phaps some small training needed to solve this issue. Or even providing 2 bottles of chilled water in the room is a good idea? 

 
Quoting at ¬£165 a night I'd happily see this as a 4.5 star hotel and certainly would stay there again. 

Don't consider this a negative as 99% of the staff are fantastic!",4,2017,10,31
133,Great hotel in Kensington.,"Royal Garden is a great choice for a London hotel. Wonderful location in the heart of Kensington. Very friendly staff.  Nice, well appointed rooms. Their rates are usually very reasonable by London standards. I‚Äôve stayed here many times and it‚Äôs always been a great experience. ",5,2017,10,31
133,Not What You'd Expect for a Five Star Hotel,"Overall, this was a room where the sheets on the bed were clean, the TV worked well, the bathroom was clean and plenty of towels. But ... and here's the thing: that's pretty much what you'd expect from any two or three star hotel. I've used Premier Inn and Holiday Inn a few times and both have been better to be honest.

Staff were polite and responsive when we asked for help with the air conditioning and more pillows.

So why the rating? It will do for a night ... but it is not what you'd expect for a five star hotel at all. First of all, we arrived at 12.30 pm and could not check-in. Check-in was at 2pm. So we were unable to have a rest and freshen up. I found that quite late really - similar to holiday lettings / self-catering.

Next, the tea and coffee making in the room was very poor (see photo) two coffee sachets, no herbal teas at all, not even peppermint, milk that should be refrigerated left in a drawer. 

Queen sized bed but mattress was old. If it wasn't for the topper, we'd have felt the springs a lot more. Very bouncy, not supportive. Again, for one night it is bearable. But not what you'd expect. 

In the shower, the door did not keep the water in at all, consequently the water went all over the marble floor making it very dangerous to step out of the shower especially as there was no handrail to assist. It was a very deep step down (see photo), 

The breakfast was an extortionate ¬£28 per person so we didn't go for that.

The thing I found really surprising is that things that were very visible were not clean: The phone, notebook, lamp ... it's just not what you'd expect. The plug on the kettle was loose.

We had no water in the room except for paid water. As we were leaving oddly enough, some guy with a trolley handed us two bottles complimentary - however, could really have done with them during our stay rather than on leaving. They were glass and difficult to carry with our luggage so we left them.

I would say the room is ok, but tired.  But a bit more effort could have been made with the cleaning.

But the thing that really got me was it was our 30th Anniversary and I'd left a message with the booking that we were celebrating. We got 6 chocolates on a dish with a Happy Anniversary message but for a five star hotel I kind of imagined something a bit better. Complimentary box of chocolates, small bottle of wine maybe, a few flowers ... or maybe complimentary breakfast ... was I dreaming? I mean if 6 individual chocolates was the 30 Year Anniversary special ... what's the norm? Nothing? What's a birthday? Nothing ... don't know... thought I was booking somewhere really special. It wasn't. But it was ok for staying the night. I even explained that it was our first night without children in 17 years! And still nothing special...

Anyway, if you need a room and central location and if you manage to get it when discounted - it's ok. But if you're expecting five star ... this isn't it...",2,2017,10,31
133,Wonderful,"My sister and I stayed overnight following the Queens Nursing Institute Awards evening. We arrived at 2pm, and found our welcome and check in smooth and faultless. Our cases were taken to our room. All the staff were polite and helpful. The hotel was immaculately clean, the room had everything we needed. Wonderful accommodation. Thank you Royal Garden Hotel. Keep up the good work.",5,2017,10,31
133,Afternoon Tea,This was a birthday present from a friend.  The whole experience was made so special for us by the staff.  Reception and Park Terrace staff were brilliant and could not do enough for us.  The sandwiches and cakes were excellent and we just had to finish everything!  All the staff we encountered were a great asset to Royal Garden Hotel.  A lovely afternoon - thank you.,5,2017,10,31
133,Business with pleasure,great hotel. We stayed in a king room. There was a lot of room to move around. Hotel staff are friendly and helpful. We walked through the park and to Soho. There are plenty of shops and cafes around the hotel. Its a good central location. I have stayed at many London hotels and this is becoming my  favorite.,4,2017,10,30
133,Lovely hotel in convenient location,"Stayed here for one night with a friend on a weekend break to London whilst attending a concert in the Royal Albert Hall. We had adjoining Queen rooms on the 8th floor with fantastic views of Kensington Palace. Both rooms were superb, exceptionally clean with everything we needed. Service from all staff was excellent from the moment we checked in to the moment we left. We had a very good breakfast in the restaurant with lovely views of Kensington Gardens. I am gluten free but they catered for me with GF toast and cooked my bacon separately from the buffet. This hotel was a welcome sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of Kensington and because it was so well located we were able to walk to everywhere we wanted to visit. I would stay here again, highly recommended.",5,2017,10,30
133,A lovely location and fab hotel,"A lovely surprise gift for my 8 year old nephew .
Free use of scooters provided by the hotel for use in Hyde park .
The hotel was very charming and spacious , all staff were very friendly and helpful .",5,2017,10,28
133,Fantastic Location and Fantastic Service,"This was a 5-star experience all around.  I rated that sleep quality slightly lower because on two separate nights, I was woken by a 2:30am fire alarm - both false alarms.  That said, the staff was extremely professional in handling the situation.  As it normal for hotels in Europe, even high-end hotels, the room size is a bit smaller than I would expect in the US.  Still, it was extremely comfortable, quiet, and clean.  I highly recommend getting the English breakfast in the morning.  ",5,2017,10,27
133,Excellent quality,Very friendly. Nothing too much trouble for them. Cleanliness is obviously a priority. Concierge was excellent. Children get a little rucksack on arrival filled with goodies- a nice touch! I would definitely recommend this hotel. ,5,2017,10,27
133,Short Stay,"Excellent hotel. Only stayed one night but service from check in to check out was excellent. Large room (950) although not overlooking the park was not a requirement for myself. Clean with every thing required (Queen Room). Very good bath and separate shower. Nice touch was being offered iron/board immediately at check in as reception staff anticipated I was there for a black tie do in the hotel - was even delivered within minutes of reaching the room. Very good breakfast - continental buffet and hot food cooked to order. Short walk from the tube and near the park. Well located for visiting London, but not a personal requirement for this visit.",5,2017,10,27
133,Good but not exceptional,"The Royal Garden offered an extremely good value rate given its location and given the same rate I would definitely consider staying at the hotel again. The service at the hotel is 5* but everything else feels much more like a 4*. We found the hotel to be clean and the facilities good. We stayed in room 810 which had a nice view over the palace green. My sleep was disturbed by the duvet which was really thin and flimsy and a really low level electrical hum despite everything being turned off. Reception said they would investigate as we checked out but I suspect it was coming from the walls. There is a good spread laid on at breakfast but we got unlucky with our choices - hash browns left out too long so they were chewy and poached eggs that are re-heated in hot water before serving but weren't left in long enough so we ended up eating cold.

We also had fire alarm issues at 2am but that's just one of those things. The hotel staff were very apologetic and helpful. Those that have written previous reviews moaning they were not informed by hotel staff about what was going on are morons. If a deafening fire alarm goes off in your room (1 of 400 in the building) - you get out of the building.Then find out what is going on!",3,2017,10,26
133,Great Service but major problem with baby friendliness.,"I stayed for two nights at the Royal Garden. Overall the on-site staff were very helpful and friendly - great check-in, very supportive with a few requests I made, fantastic doorman and very professional/friendly housekeeping staff. Room was good. My main irritation for the stay is that I was required to pay 100 pounds per night extra to upgrade the room upon check-in because the booked room was not big enough for a baby cot. This felt like a completely unreasonable up-selling that penalised me for travelling with a baby and is the first time I have experienced something like this at any hotel. Shame as that let down the whole experience.",3,2017,10,26
133,A great place to stay,"We have been coming to this hotel for over 5 years and we are never disappointed. Great staff and service. Next to the the park and Kensington Palace...Easy access to buses and the underground
Great restaurants at the hotel and locally.",5,2017,10,25
133,It was all going so well until‚Ä¶.,"I recently stayed here as I was seeing a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. This is a perfect hotel for this as it is only a short 10 minute walk away.

When checking in I found the receptionist to be very welcoming and friendly. The room we were given was very nice and it had a lovely view overlooking the park. The room is contemporary and the bathroom had both a shower cubical and a separate bath. If I had any complaints it would be that the mattress was a little too firm for my taste.

We were really enjoying our stay until we got a wake-up call at 2:30am in the form of the fire alarm going off. We got up, got dressed, evacuated our room and went down the fire escape and stood outside with approximately 100 other guests. The fire brigade pulled up and some firemen went inside for 10 minutes then left. 

A letter was pushed under the door in the morning apologising for the evacuation explaining that a faulty call point set off the alarm. When we checked out I inquired what happened and was told someone set off the fire alarm. Whether it was set off deliberately or by a fault is not what I have a problem with though. These things happen and it‚Äôs not really the hotel‚Äôs fault if a drunken guest decides to wake everyone up.

What I do blame the hotel for however was the lack of coordination or any appearance of a manager telling the guests what to do when we were waiting outside at 2:30 in the morning. We didn‚Äôt know when it was safe to go back inside and only went back in when other guests went back in probably due the lack of information.

Despite that I probably would stay here again but I hope the managers will handle the situation better if something like this happens again in the future.",4,2017,10,25
133,Great three days in Kensington,"The location of the hotel is perfect for a short stay in London with buses and underground at your fingertips one can be anywhere in greater London quite quickly.  But Kensington High Street area offers a full range of shops, restaurants, parks and restaurants very near by.  And the staff of the hotel will help you find them all.  Our room, a garden view one, was roomy and very comfortable.  The extra space was worth it for the three nights.  Would definitely recommend staying here.",5,2017,10,25
133,Perfect stay,"Except from being evacuated at 2:30 because of the fire alarm going off it was a perfect holiday. Room, staff and breakfast was perfect. Great location! Had a beautiful room facing the park. Went with friends, but with not hesitate to go back with my family. ",5,2017,10,25
133,Wouldn't stay there again,"Not more luxurious than a travel lodge and the room I booked was apparently unsuitable for 2 people so had to pay an upgrade fee to get a reasonable size room. 

Fire alarm went off at 2am, no sign of any staff to tell us what was going on, had to phone the conceirge to be told it was a false alarm.

133,Gem in the heart of London,"This hotel is centrally located and a short walk to the Kensington HIgh tube station.  Rooms are beautiful and some overlook Hyde Park.  I thoroughly enjoyed the stay, the service, and the location.  Lots of great restaurants nearby.  ",5,2017,10,24

133,October Stay,"Very nice contemporary hotel with amazing service. Also well located and quiet. The fire alarm went off twice during our stay-waking and scaring our child, but the issues were quickly resolved. The mattresses could use improvement-springs poking, but everything else was perfect. A very family friendly hotel.",4,2017,10,23
133,Another perfect stay.,"We arrived and had a lovely warm welcome from Lucy, who was very helpful and showed us our room, which was a garden room, very comfortable bed, with sitting area, and lovely size bathroom, with everything you need. We had breakfast included this time and I really hope we get the offer to have it again included in price, It was absolutely the best ever, such a good choice, you can fill up and need nothing until the evening. We have had a lovely relaxing stay, all the staff are very helpful and courteous, I look forward to returning very soon, the position of the hotel is less than 5 mins from the tube and there is a good selection of shops and restaurants. I highly recommend the Royal Garden.",5,2017,10,21
133,Disappointed!,"there was a fire alarm at about 2:00 am causing all guests to get out of bed and go outside while fire department investigated.  The next evening the same thing happened.  The hotel was otherwise perfect.  Clean, helpful staff and great location.",3,2017,10,19
133,Very good ,"The room is small but well laid out. Great location in the city. There's so much around you that you won't be in the room much anyway.

133,Normal hotel to be rate as a 5*,"I use to stay at this hotel for a business trip.
The hotel is quite, well located, a little bite old and needing a renewal.
The service is correct and fast, the rooms are old but clean.
It‚Äôs not really a 5*rate hotel but for London is good.
Maybe the breakfast service is a little bit expensive  (20¬£) for the variety they offer, besides we ask for a capuccino and a few extra products and we never received, guest it was because the hotel was really full.",3,2017,10,19
133,perfect stay in London,best place to stay to visit London - the location is great - the staff is one of the best you can find. we had a fantastic view over the park - we used all the restaurants and bars - we think the Chinese restaurant could be better - spezially the ambience and the styling should be more modern - but all together it was a perfekt stay for us and we will come back as soon as possible - ,5,2017,10,19
133,Reply from Mr & Mrs S.H.Brown,"Our stay was excellent and all the staff were very helpful. We have raised a query regarding Peak Points which I understand are being phased out.

133,Best Hotel and Afternoon Tea!,"Great accommodations, staff is friendly and helpful- quick to respond. 
Wonderful room service. Excellent afternoon tea in the Park Terrace. 
Concierge desk knowledgeable and pleasant. Right next door to Kensington Palace and Gardens as well as Hyde Park. Very safe property and area for the solo traveler as well. ",5,2017,10,16
133,Mixed feelings,"Used to highly recommend this property, but am not sure after last experience. Service has deteriorated. 
False fire alarm calling everyone out of bed at 2.30 AM, standing outside in cold air, no information given by any manager on duty. Sure, safety of guests always comes first, but communication is as important in service delivery. Being asked three times for name and room number during breakfast, is annoying. Did not return the next morning.
Check out service was factual and uninterested, no effort to made to inquire how the stay was, no interest in offering help with luggage or taxi. Left this once excellent hotel with mixed feelings.",3,2017,10,16
133,"Excellent location, service and rate",Royal Garden Hotel has a unique location and offers excellent service at good rates. Surrounded by beautiful parks ideal for a walk as well as surropunded by one of the best shopping area in town. Metro and buses connections are very convenient too.,5,2017,10,16

",5,2017,10,13
133,Great family experience,"We went on a family trip to London and booked this hotel that seemed kids friendly and very near to the Park, we made an excellent choice! The hotel is very welcoming, the kids loved the presents and everything was nice and work perfect during our stay. We have an executive room which I think work very nicely if you travel with 2  children. Room is very nice, bathroom is quite big and comfortable, many nice details overall.
There are many things near the hotel for your convenience and is also near from the metro station and main things to do in the city.
Service and attention of the personnel is 5 stars. We are definitely coming back!

We are definitely coming back on our next trip.",5,2017,10,12
133,Excellent Hotel,"Loved staying at this hotel this September. It is in a good location with Kensington Castle at the back of the hotel. This is where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge live with their two children and where the Princess Diana memorial garden is located.
The rooms at the hotel are spacious, everyone was very friendly and went out of their way to make your stay wonderful. Food is good and the bars a great place to spend time at night.  I will stay at this hotel in the future and not even consider another.",5,2017,10,11
133,October stay,"Really lovely hotel to stay in with a great location. We treated ourselves to room service the next day which was lovely. Slept really well, it was surprisingly quiet considering we were facing the busy street. ",5,2017,10,11
133,Room rather disappointing,"Very friendly staff and a great location. On check in I was told that I had been allocated a really lovely room, so was expecting something special. I think I had possibly the smallest room in the hotel. Had difficulty walking around the bottom of the bed to look out of the window. Very limited supplies of tea, coffee etc, and only 2 sugar satchets. No iron or ironing board to be found in the room. Limited power points and one wasn‚Äôt working at all. On the plus side the room was nicely furnished.",3,2017,10,11
133,Well situated and very comfortable,"Nice room is not very large, but the view is splendid on the Royal Garden. Very quiet spot and comfortable bed, the good sleep is guaranteed.
The staff is OK, particularly the welcome.
The only problem is the breakfast room, too busy to get a quiet time, not enough space, or people too close each other, while the rest of the room is partly empty.",4,2017,10,11
133,Great Experience! Will be back again..,"Friendly helpful staff and good location.
The area is very convenience. Room is comfortable and clean.
Like the nightly turn down service provided. Feel like just at home.
Will be back when I come to London next time.",5,2017,10,11

For 2 you need to choose a king size bedroom as the queen size bedroom is fine for one only
Breakfast is very good also ",5,2017,10,10
133,"Warm, friendly excellent service",Really go the extra mile with the children and the facilities for them is brilliant I will definitely come back and stay. Being right need to the park helped. Travelling with a child the hotel made us feel very welcome ,5,2017,10,10
133,"Great value, good location."," We got a really nice room overlooking the park, and paid far less and we would have at another similar hotel. We also made it known that we were bringing our 10 -month-old baby, and they provided a nice mini crib and gave him a cute little teddy bear, too ",5,2017,10,10
133,Great location!,"Located right on Kensington Garden which is beautiful.  Near nice shops and restaurants.  Nice hotel rooms.  Staff was very nice too.  There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel, which add to the very convenient location as well.",5,2017,10,10
133,Royal Garden - Home away from Home,"As usual a fantastic stay at Royal Garden, they truly make you feel at home, whilst they treat you like royalty. Remember to book the breakfast as inclusive. It is well worth it. I cannot recommend this hotel enough.",5,2017,10,10
133,Fabulous hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for a weekend break to London. It's a fabulous hotel, spotlessly clean, friendly helpful staff and good food. I would definitely stay here again. It was very convenient to Kensington Palace and the Royal Albert Hall.",5,2017,10,10
133,"Nice place to stay in London, facing Hyde Park Gardens","Nice international hotel, well located ! I appreciated rooms, level of services, breakfast and bars. I also attended a european conference and all facilities were nice. May be there could be improvment on the quality of food on global buffets for lunch....",5,2017,10,09
133,very good hotel,"I enjoyed a nice stay at the Royal Garden Hotel which is just a few minutes away from London must-see points! The room was spacious and nicely decorated, also very clean. Breakfast room service was sharp on time. ",4,2017,10,09
133,Excellent hotel,"Just stayed one night for family gathering in London.  Room was xcellent and staff were wonderful.  Excellent hotel.  Just beware of the entry to the car park.  It is so narrow, we ruined one of the hub caps driving down the ramp.  The porter drove the car out for us as he knows the ramps so well. We wished we had asked him to park it for us.... ",5,2017,10,09
133,Best Views from rooms,"4 persons in a small suite wouldnt do that again. Wonderful stay, clean and good services. Very good place in the middle of town. Close to U trains and shopping facilities. Very nice view on town, must be even better the park side",5,2017,10,07
133,London business Trip,Hotel is in a great location and we stayed for 8 nights house keeping needed top up of teas and only managed one turn down service also could not manage to get to roof top bar or restaurant as constantly booked out! ,4,2017,10,04
133,Pearl Anniversary,Absolutely fantastic weekend at the Royal Garden Hotel.We stayed in the excellent Room 903 that was over looking Kensington Palace and the gardens.On this elevation it was extremely peacefull at night no traffic noise whatsoever. ,5,2017,10,04
133,Amazing Hotel with fabulous food,"My husband and I stayed here on 29 September for one night. The staff were very welcoming, the room was lovely and the breakfast was amazing. If you stay there try their delicious pancakes. We will definitely be back as sitting having breakfast overlooking Kensington Palace was a wonderful start to the day. Thank you.",5,2017,10,04
133,Will return,"My favorite was the bed.  I have never slept so well on vacation. The staff was so helpful with giving directions, restaurant suggestions and just overall assistance.  We chose this hotel through our time share program and did not realize just how awesome the location, food and staff would be.  My only concern was the size of the shower and bath tub.  The small shower had a large rain shower head and the bath tub was narrow.  So I didn't find either of these relaxing after a long day of walking. That said, I would definitely return.",4,2017,10,03
133,Excellent breakfast!,"The Hotel is good, the location is even better, but what we remembered the most was the buffet breakfast on the ground floor. Quality of food and the service were impeccable! Special thanks to the staff that cater and serve the breakfast!",5,2017,10,03
133,Excellent choice,"Perfect location, in close proximity to train station, restaurants, pubs, shopping and there is a bus stop immediately in front of the hotel.  Short and scenic drive to Oxford St, Convent Gardens and Piccadilly Circus. Excellent service, in room dining - tasty food and lots of choices. Nice bar and restaurants. Very comfortable and clean rooms.",5,2017,10,02
133,"Great service, great location","We had a very nice stay at the Royal Garden Hotel.  We stayed at the hotel through a time share program we belong to so hadn't really extensively researched beyond reading a few reviews on this site but we were very pleased.  The staff at check-in were extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms were large, comfortable and clean, definitely had more of a business hotel feel but that was not an issue for us.  Breakfasts were wonderful with lots of choice, food well prepared and again excellent service.  The hotel is in a nice quiet area right by what must be a major embassy row, which was very pleasant to walk down.  It was near a tube station and was walkable to many other areas, there was not necessarily must right by it, there were a few restaurants but really probably somewhere to venture out from more than an area to stay around.  There were a few things that kept this from being an ""excellent"" for us mainly inconsistent service and maintenance or follow up (such as a soap dish/bar broke off in our shower and was not really fixed, the first day we had scads of washcloths then didn't receive any when those were taken and had to chase down housekeeping, issues with TV connectivity that we were told were being addressed but never were) but none of this would prevent us from recommending.",4,2017,10,02
133,Another great stay at the Royal Garden,Typically stay at the Royal Garden when in London. Convenient to bus connections and tube stations for easy access to the city. The staff is always welcoming and accommodating. Property is impeccable and extremely comfortable. Would highly recommend it.,5,2017,10,02
133,Hardly again,"I did not choose the hotel. It was booked by default as it was advised for special rate by conference organizers.
Pros.
Remooving the airport film from my suitcase by bellboy was a good surprise and actually the the first such experience.
Room was ok.
I was delighted to have a great view from the window to the Gardens.
All room maids were very polite and were saying ""hello"" and ""good morning"" from the heart.
The girl from laundry service was just extremely considerate and helpful. As example when I called and asked for s—Åissors, she brought them after about one minute. 
Doorkeepers were great.
Cons.
Check-in: Arrived about forty minutes before 2:00 p.m. Obviously I was ready to wait for the room until two. I was asked by receptionist to wait in the lobby and was promissed  that I would need to wait about 20 minutes and I would be advised when I can go to the room. I was waiting for 50-55 minutes until 2:15 and then told another receptionist about promises and inquired about the situation. She gave me immediately the keys which as I understood were ready long ago. She showed no any sign of regret about the situation. 
Breakfast: Though breakfast was included it was actually the worst choice of foods provided free of charge. And I have been to over 20 countries worldwide. This was my second stay in London. The first was in  Millenium Glocester two years ago, and the breakfast there was also not up to the mark (so I can make a conclusion that probably throughout London all hotels provide poor included breakfast), but it was definitely better than in RGH. First morning I was provided a menu and was told that it would be free of charge. But anyway I was given to sign a receipt with over GBP20+. The girl said she made this receipt by mistake, it would be free for me and asked to sign. The second morning the guy said the sausages would cost 4,5GBP (if I am not mistaken), but at the end announced that he would not charge it. Oh, thank you!.. Again bill for GBP20+. Mistake?.",3,2017,10,02
133,This hotel made our weekend ! ,I stayed at the this hotel with my cousin last weekend. The staff could not have been more welcoming and were extremely helpful. We stayed in a lovely room with a fabulous view for an extremely reasonable price. The location of the hotel is excellent also. We will definitely be returning. ,5,2017,10,01
133,Disappointing,"Both rooms smelt of smoke, one overpoweringly so I had to ask to change.  The second was better, but I still awoke the following morning smelling smoke everywhere which was revolting.  The beds were smaller than Super-King which is usually standard.  Our avocado eggs breakfast was not good, but the buffet looked better.",2,2017,09,30
133,It is an average hotel with couple of positive points ,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 5 days. 

The service and quality is very average and it is like 4 star hotel. 
The hairdryer is disaster and it takes ages to dry the hair. 

However, if you anyone want to stay in this hotel, I recommend to get the park view. The view of the park is fabulous specially during sunset and sunrise. 

The other advantage of this hotel is the location. It is in prime location and anyone can walk down the street and take a look at different fashion and sport shops. 

Very positive point about this hotel: ""if you have luggages and you need to store them because if different reasons, this hotel has a service to store then for you for up to maximum 6 months. (I can say I liked this option because it helped me a lot)",3,2017,09,29
133,Deluxe,"Fantastic location, walking distance to royalty, friendly and helpful staff. Shops galore nature close. Be treated like royalty stay the 10th floor is super special. Make sure you enjoy a afternoon tea when staying here.",5,2017,09,29
133,Good hotel,"I spent two nights at the Royal Garden Hotel.

While this hotel is past its prime, it‚Äôs fairly well maintained and staff are generally competent and courteous. 

I stayed in a Garden-side room which had an OK view of Hyde Park. The bed mattress was a bit hard and staid though. And the shower was  nearly impossible to get in/out (this could have been easily addressed if the shower door went outwards instead of inwards!). Cleaning was OK although they forgot to replenish my teabags - which was then dealt with when I asked. 

Breakfast is OK - the buffet selection is average, but the a la carte options are pretty well done and presented.

Location is great.

Not sure about value/quality ratio - it does depend on how good a rate you get to judge whether it‚Äôs worth it!
",4,2017,09,29
133,I'll be back,"Great location. Friendly staff.  Comfortable room.  High St., Kensington tube stop is a short walk. Plenty of restaurants and food shops in th neighborhood. The hotel is located adjacent to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. ",5,2017,09,28
133,Fabulous location,"Great hotel good value for money ..... comfortable clean rooms will definitely be back. Located next to a beautiful park near to public transport links, shops and restaurants. Staff are attentive and helpful. ",5,2017,09,28
133,1 night of perfection,"This is the first time we have ever stayed at this hotel , although we have eaten here several times, From the moment you get out of the car, you are treated like royalty. The room was brilliant, had everything we could possibly wish for, being a wheelchair user, it was perfect, from the wide door for easy access, to the wet room shower, with every aid you could think of. A lovely room, a fantastic meal with a friend, a show in the west end, then back to heaven , Then a really good hot full English in the morning, what more could you ask for. A big thank you to all the staff that made our stay so good, They actually talk to you rather than at you, which is so nice, . I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a nice place to stay and a restaurant where the food is perfect. . must try the other restaurant upstairs one day soon, see you in November !! , Can't wait",5,2017,09,27
133,concert at royal albert hall,My wife and   Ihave stayed at the hotel several times. The location is ideal for attending concerts. The staff are always friendly and courteous and we always enjoy our stay. I run every day and the Park is right outside the front door. Why would you stay anywhere else in London ?,5,2017,09,26
133,Great place to stay,"The hotel is well located for getting to Knightsbridge or for exploring Kensington.

Our room was clean, beds were very comfy and we had a great view over the park. 

By pre booking parking through the hotel,  it only cost ¬£22 for 24 hours, a real bargain in London. 

Would certainly return if we need to stay in this part of London again.

",4,2017,09,26
133,A first class break,"A great hotel in a fantastic location. The staff are first class, always warm and friendly and extremely helpful. The views over Hyde Park and Kensington Palace are spectacular and the shopping on Kensington High Street is  top class.",5,2017,09,25
133,Exceeded expectation,The hotel was perfect for what we needed. Location was ideal for us and the room and service was excellent. I would fully recommend the hotel. We paid a little extra for a garden view and that was money well spent. We had a lovely and relaxing overnight stay. The check out time gave us the chance to have a leisurely breakfast. ,5,2017,09,25
133,Lovely hotel,"The hotel was great; the staff were helpful and friendly, without being over baring, and the rooms had everything you could need. The bed was also very comfortable.

133,A Hotel that keeps on giving!!,Staff was super friendly accommodation was nice and clean! Great location as well! I would definitely do it again!!! It was close to the park which was really nice because you got the have nice walk around and views. The only down side was the buffet in the morning didn't have a lot of variety for vegetarians. The pillows were not comfortable.,5,2017,09,22
133,Disappointed trip,"They check me in smoking room which I didn't ask the carpet had stained 
I had to wait for long time to give me non smoking room
Bathroom paint was peeling from shower unit and water leaks fro the ceiling ",3,2017,09,22
133,This hotel continues to excel,"It has been three years since our last stay at the Royal Garden, and again we were impressed by the facilities and the service. Our room overlooked Kensington Gardens - what an amazing view at any time of the day and night. The bed was comfortable and we had sufficient space for the four nights we stayed there. Food in the restaurant for breakfast was lavish and well presented, and the friendliness of the staff and their efficiency made the stay that much more enjoyable.
This is our definite ""go-to"" hotel for London. We know our way around so can get to every part of the city from here - and the joy of being able to walk in the Park can't be beaten. We will be back.",5,2017,09,21
133,The Royal Garden keeps on delivering....,"I have stayed at the RGH several times and will continue to do so.
Superb location, seamless service, lovely rooms overlooking the Park.
Mark Anderson is a true host and will make sure you're well looked after.

Staff very helpfull, and this always with a smile.
Also the location is fantastisch. Kensington Palace and Garden is in the Backyardigans of the hotel.
I Will return for shure !",5,2017,09,20
133,Brilliant Hotel,This is a hotel which must be visited. Surrounded by the beautiful setting of Kensington Palace this hotel is a gem. Lovely walks around the gardens and also situated on Kensington High Street so shopping is in the vicinity,5,2017,09,20

Room was very comfortable and met all of our needs. ",5,2017,09,20
133,Return trip,See my comments before on gym. I can't believe that we have no water in the gym. I had to beg for a cup to drink out of. No one told me this in reception. I did bring this up at the desk afterward. I hope this can be rectified.,3,2017,09,18
133,Extraordinary,"Very well located, attentive staff and impressive rooms. 

I was given an upgrade because I did ny reservation on their web.

Simply extraordinary, I would recommend this hotel for one of the best experiences in London.",5,2017,09,17

This is a great West End hotel that runs very well.
I like the asian emphasis with the dining options and the rooms can have wonderful views. ",5,2017,09,16
133,Perfect location coupled with perfect service,"The Royal Garden Hotel has been my preferred place to stay in London for a very long time. In a way, it feels like home to me in the meantime. The warmly decorated rooms are very functional and still manage to impress me because they are so well thought through. All restaurants and bars are excellent but the Min Jiang - possibly the best Chinese restaurant in Europe - has star qualities with its beautiful views of London. The best thing about the hotel is its staff though. Without exception they are all extremely professional, very friendly and manage to give each guest the feeling of being welcome. The service at the Royal Garden Hotel is fantastic and far better than at any other hotel I have been to in London.",5,2017,09,15
133,Great Experience at a Great Hotel,"This is the first time that I stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel.  The staff was very helpful and very prompt whenever I made requests.  The view over Kensington Gardens was a great thing to be able to wake up to every morning.  I also liked the location of the hotel, which was by Kensington Gardens but there were a lot of shops and restaurants near by if you didn't want to go far.  If you did, there were many fast and convenient ways to be able to go to other parts of the city.  I look forward to travelling to London again and when I do, I will definitely consider staying at this hotel again.",5,2017,09,14
133,"Comfortable, elegant very well located.","The rooms are comfortable, the service is discreet and effective. The hotel is well located for sightseeing, shopping, walking (Hyde Park next door). I had problems with the bath and they were sorted out promptly. I've stayed a few times and my main complain is the smell in the air conditioning. I don't know if they have smoking rooms or some people just don't care but a couple of times I had this nasty cigarrette smell coming from the ventilation in the room.",4,2017,09,14
133,Always a great stay,We have stayed at this property several times and always find it a wonderful property. The location is always very handy for us and we do enjoy a stroll in the park. The rooms are very very well  appointed and the staff is always friendly and helpful. ,5,2017,09,14
133,Great experience!,"I been working with Royal Garden Hotel for couple of events that i organized for our company and me and my team couldn't be more satisfied with the service and whole experience that this hotel provides. 
The location is great, the views are amazing, restaurants are unbelievable, rooms are perfect for your stay in London and staff are simple excellent,. 

for our 2 days event everyone went above and beyond for us. I would like to thank Jerry and Edward for introducing us to the hotel and taking care of us as company in every way possible. To the reservation teams Angela and Melissa who had incredible patience to deal with my changes and always finding a solution. the Min Jiang restaurant that serves the absolute best Chinese food in London. Marta and her team accommodated all our requirements and took great care of us and our guests, and of course the last but not least the F&B team - Bettina who was a star! she took care of all the event basically from the begging to the end. very responsive to our needs and just a great person to work with. she left us in great hands of Adriann who did a great job on the day of the event and had everything under control.

thank you everyone for your support. We will be definitely coming back and please count on our recommendations.",5,2017,09,14
133,The best hotel we have stayed in,"This is our third visit to your hotel and to be honest I was a little apprehensive that it would not be as good as I remembered but I need not have worried, it was better!
The standards in the hotel are kept at all times by all staff, whether late at night or morning-absolutely fantastic. All staff should be congratulated but especially the manager. The food was excellent and the quality of  the rooms. I remember especially the Doorman lending us a few umbrellas as we were walking to the Royal Albert Hall. We didn't even have to ask!",5,2017,09,14
133,Mixed impression,"This is the second time I stayed in the Royal Garden.
I like the hotel because of its location (central and view over the park) and the excellent service provided by ALL staff. What I don't like is the noise and the ineffectiveness of the heating. Also, the chairs in the breakfast room are worn out and uncomfortable.",4,2017,09,12
133,Wonderful experience!,"I found this hotel and excellent facility, with beautiful, spacious rooms and wonderful service. The turndown service was not expected but really welcomed and the perk of a bottle of wine upon arrival and water on our bedside each night were high quality, elegant and thoughtful touches.  We were especially impressed with the Asian Fusion restaurant on the top floor.  The food was superb!
Thank you.",5,2017,09,12
133,Superb ,"My to stay place in London, excellent clean rooms, superb service and lovely staff, excellent value for money.  Situated within easy reach of many of the to go places in London and right next door to Kensington Palace Need I say more.",5,2017,09,12

Excellent breakfast buffet plus freshly cooked omeletts etc. Business center competent, reception very helpfull.",4,2017,09,12
133,M Desforges,An excellent room with a view to die for. An ideal spot for the Last Night of the Proms. I don't like breakfast in my room but this was worth making an exception.It is a shame the lunch restaurant looks over a dull road.,5,2017,09,12
133,Good hotel to stay at in London,"This was the third time for me to stay at this hotel. I enjoyed a lot and felt comfortable in the last two stay. But it was not a pleasant stay this time.
I left my luggage as the front desk as it was too early to check in, but the luggage was left unattended. It could have been taken by anyone.
The other awful experience I had at this hotel happened when I checked out.
The lady at the front desk was so mean and unfriendly. She showed little respect and no smile to me. She did not ask me how my stay was and said ""Have a nice day"" without even looking at me. I may stay at this hotel again as the other staff were good and all the equipment at this hotel were excellent.
So some improvement are sure to be needed.",3,2017,09,12
133,Excellent,"Spent 4 days there. The service is great, the staff are friendly and professional, the in-dining service was great. The location is excellent. My room had a view on the gardens. I would like to stay there again.",5,2017,09,12
133,Great location and amazing service for small wedding reception,"I had an afternoon tea reception for my small wedding (32 guests) at the Park Terrace Restaurant, an evening drinks reception at Bertie's bar and stayed at the hotel. My entire experience from restaurant to bar to hotel room was top notch. My husband and I were especially struck by how professional and hospitable every singe person we came across in the hotel was, and they helped make our special day feel even more special. I stay in a lot of hotels when I travel, but the Royal Garden really stood out for comfort, location and cleanliness. The bed was extremely comfortable, we had a great view of Hyde park and London, though very central there was no noise at all when the window was closed. And the bathroom was all you would want for a pampering relaxed hotel stay. I can't say enough about how great my experience was and I am looking forward to going back.",5,2017,09,11
133,Superb staff and customer service,"Big thank you to Felicity duty manager and Lucy reception trainee.
Really helpful in all aspects over our weekend stay. Will certainly be returning again as we have over the last 20 years.

The 50 years celebration publication was a fantastic gift.

133,Excellent Hotel,"I think everything was perfect with the hotel, the location, the staff ,the food ,service. There was nothing I was not happy with.This was my second time staying at this hotel and both times I was very very satisfied ",5,2017,09,08
133,For family's only,"We had a great time as a family with two kids. But this is not the hotel for couples or friends. Lots of kids, very kid friendly, and they had s blast. Only down side is that there is no evening activities for the kids and it can get boring. ",4,2017,09,08
133,Steven Brown review,"Another perfect stay at RGH not least due to upgrade to beautiful suite overlooking palace and garden. Such a treat to return to after a great day in the capital to relax and enjoy complimentary chilled wine. We love RGH.......thanks to all ans see you again soon.

133,Classy hotel,"This hotel was booked by son and daughter as a surprise for my 50th birthday, what a treat. Staff were very helpful couldn't do enough for us, in the evening the they had a turn down service where the would go into your room and turn down your bed, put the lights down low and play music it gave a great ambiance after having a long day sightseeing.",5,2017,09,06

133,Short stay,"Great hotel,the central location was essential  for my stay as I had to work the weekend of the Carnival and I'm unable to be at home. I would recommend this Hotel highly,the warm welcome and friendly staff was very good, also they don't charge you for room service.",5,2017,08,31
133,"best hotel in Kensington  , maybe London","really  great hotel  , one of the best i stayed in .  Really great  service with  top class food  served  from a very friendly staff.

133,Wonderful Hotel,"Spent 5 lovely days over Christmas 2016 at the wonderful hotel
We spent Christmas here a few years ago and for weekends on a few of other occasions.
We are staying again in a few weeks times and greatly looking forward to our stay.
Great service starts with the doorman who always greets with a smile and relieves us temporarily of our luggage.
Staff at reception very friendly and efficient and book us in
Our Garden Room is as always very welcoming and spotlessly clean.
Our view over Kensington Gardens is spectacular in winter and does not disappoint.
We order from room service on our first night and the meal arrives just as we have settled in and feeling hungry.
Food is hot and very tasty as is the wine we ordered.
After a good nights sleep we head down for breakfast and are greeted by the Maitre d and we have time for a chat about our last visit. Breakfast tastes freshly cooked with eggs just right. Plenty of toast and coffee - nothing too much trouble.
This hotel is well located with tube and buses (bus stop outside hotel) into central London.
We are at Bertie's for dinner and again the staff very friendly.
Our next 4 nights were equally as pleasurable.
I can't think of another hotel to stay in London other than the Royal Garden Hotel

",5,2017,08,30
133,Bank holiday treat,"Excellent short stay. The staff were outstanding. Very cheery. 
Our room was superb with stunning views over Kensington Palace Gardens and London and very clean, quiet and comfortable.
We took up one of their recommendations in the pre-stay email and went to the Diana Exhibition which is just a 5 minute walk away. Very enjoyable.",5,2017,08,29
133,very good,"very good location and very nice staff.
Enjoyed the breakfast.
Did not much like the bedroom wich had 2 small single beds. I 'd rather had one double bed even if I was single bacause it is always much more confortable ",4,2017,08,29
133,2 night stay with Kids,"The location is exceptional. The staff was one of the best I've encountered, they really give great recommendations for dining and how to get to places. Great place to stay with kids. Room service dining was pleasant, kids LOVED their hot coco.",4,2017,08,28
133,my dream realised,"Its a fairly good and clean hotel, the staff especially on the terrace left much to be desired they wouldn't let us sit at the tables near the window because we 'only' ordered drinks and no meals...sigh",3,2017,08,28
133,"Great hotel, very pleasant stay","We stayed three nights at the Royal Garden Hotel celebrating our second anniversary. The staff was very friendly and we recevied a complementary bottle of white wine and truffels as a gift for our celebration. The size of the Queen room was a bit small but absolutely sufficient for three nights. The room and the whole hotel were very clean, the breakfast was delicious and the staff very friendly. We had a cocktail at Bertie's Bar above the reception. The bar keeper was exceptionally friendly and welcoming and made some great recommendations regarding the cocktails.
We would recommend the hotel anytime. ",5,2017,08,28
133,Excellent,Wonderfull hotel with great service. Situated on a perfect location to see the English culture. Very near to the Royal Albert Shall and Harrods and near Hyde Park. Very friendly staff and well equipped rooms.,5,2017,08,28
133,Great location for families with scooters for kids!  We will use this hotel again.,"Recently spent 4 nights here exploring London, then returned about 3 weeks later for 2 more after cancelling another London hotel to get back to this one.  Hotel has a great location near Hyde Park and if you are traveling with children, the Princess Diana Memorial Playground is pretty close (as much as anything is close together at Hyde Park) to the hotel.  They will give your children a scooter to borrow with a helmet and that chance to play like they do at home was invaluable to moving through jet lag and the ""out of routine"" nature of travel.  Hotel was very clean. Sofa bed was bad.  We simply had them bring a roll away.   One roll away not so good, the other so good I would have slept on it.  Just the nature of roll aways, IMO.  Executive rooms are very spacious, regular rooms less so but none as small as other we experienced on our trip.  Staff great and location is really close to tubes, bus lines, and those places where you rent a bike in Hyde Park.   King bed super comfortable, air conditioning works, and noise from street was never an issue.  Tub very deep.   On that day you can't bear to walk anymore,  it is a major treat to eat at the Chinese restaurant at the top floor.  The food is outstanding.  Not inexpensive, but no ""shrimp paste"" type products in it.  The best and freshest dim sum I've ever eaten.",5,2017,08,25
133,Simply fabulous ,"Rooms, service, warmness of welcome and quality of breakfast first rate and certainly 5*. Ideally located for all amenities and if you get lucky with the weather a beautiful walk through Kensington Gardens and beyond is extremely worthwhile. 
",5,2017,08,23
133,Great hotel for family,Everything was nice but the breakfast wasn't included and the unprofessional act at checkout by the receptionist who sent me a staff asking me to leave. I believe I will come back again. Not far from underground station,4,2017,08,19
133,"Royal locality, great amenities","Located in upmarket Kensington and overlooking the Kensington palace, Royal Garden is ideal for the business and leisure traveler alike. The billionaire's row is right next door and so are a lot of wining and dining places.",5,2017,08,19
133,Great Location on the Park,"We stayed at the Royal Garden as a wedding anniversary gift and to visit Lady Diana's dress exhibition. Both were great and provided memorable experiences. The hotel is well located near the Park, shopping and local pubs/restaurants. Nothing was a hassle and staff were very helpful with any questions. The bedroom was a surprise in its size with a relaxing raised sitting area overlooking the High Street and quiet. We plan to revisit the hotel on our next big trip. ",5,2017,08,18
133,First Class Hotel,I stayed for 4 days and London turned on magic weather.  My room was very large and overlooked Hyde Park.  Close to all great shops and restaurants this hotel is just wonderful.  The staff are all incredibly professional and the service is second to none.  (the concierge even helped me get into my dress for the races)  Breakfast offers buffet and a la carte (the chili omelette was wonderful)  The Concierge are incredibly helpful with the right touch of English humor.  Congratulations to Mark Anderson and his team on a great hotel.,5,2017,08,18
133,Royal Garden Hotel London Excellent,I stay at this hotel every year when I come to London. I spend a lot of my life travelling around the World and staying at 5 Star Hotels and I rate the Royal Garden London as one of the best.The location is great and the staff are always friendly and helpful.  ,5,2017,08,18

In good quality, staff friendly and really help, defiantly recommend for everyone who want to visit Kensington palace in door step when you stay.",5,2017,08,17
133,Great London stay,"If you are looking for a hotel near the tube, lots of good restaurants, overlooking Hyde Park, 24 hr room service, and that pays close attention to booking requests - this is one of the best options for London. I always stay here because all these details are important to me. ",5,2017,08,16
133,another wonderful weekend,"We love this hotel. The staff are excellent, the rooms [ we have only stayed in park view rooms] very comfortable, and the breakfasts delicious. we booked online directly with the hotel so we got an extra little gift of a bottle of wine in the room..thank you to the hotel for that.
The minor negatives were food trays/ tables left too long in the corridors [ I don't think this should happen in a 5 star hotel] , only one small bottle of water and one glass left by the bedside [ for a couple?]...but can't think of anything else. Its not cheap but it IS a very nice hotel in an excellent location. We keep going back. ",4,2017,08,15
133,My stay in London,"Beautiful hotel in central London right next to Hyde park and Kensington palace , friendly staff made me feel welcome and were highly attentive , would defiantly stay again . The rooms are really clean and functional ",5,2017,08,15

133,Excellent stay,My husband and I had a lovely stay on Wednesday night. We had a light lunch in the lounge which was beautifully presented and tasty. Our room overlooked the park and was light and very comfortable. Staff were extremely helpful and accommodating. We shall look forward to a return visit very soon. ,5,2017,08,13
133,Great Stay,"TRG was recommended to me since it's close to office, but it was excellent service and accommodations and I will stay again. Only thing missing was no access to Sky Atlantic so I missed GOT episode 4. I'd have expected to have access to more tv entertainment in the room. ",5,2017,08,13
133,Succesful stay,"The hotel is situated in the most perfect place for site seeing walking in the patk shops and 
Restaurants also for transport links , we had a very nice stay and staff and all other setvices
were spot on ",5,2017,08,12
133,"Great location, comfortable hotel","Overlooing Kensington Garden/ Hyde Park, the hotel is conveniently located. We did not get a park view room which probably comes at a premium but the view at the back from our room was still pleasant. Rooms are comfortable and quiet. The lobby looks nice and trhe common parts are clean. One drawback is that our room smelled of tobacco, probably coming through the AC unit or because of the previous occupant. Only the 3rd floor is smoke free apparently.",4,2017,08,11
133,Beautiful property with awesome views of Kensington Park,The room was very comfortable and we loved the view from the hotel of Kensington Palace.  The on-site dining options were fantastic and enjoyed wonderful service from everyone of the staff that we interacted with.,5,2017,08,10
133,Lovely afternoon tea,"This was a present from my husband and one of the best afternoon teas I have had. The staff were lovely and nothing was too much trouble for them. We were first offered a large tray of glass jars of all the different teas to smell and decide which blend we would like. My husband doesn't drink tea or coffee so they gave him a large pot of hot chocolate which was nice. We had a delicious selection of sandwiches to start and after we had eaten them were offered more which my husband enjoyed as the usual couple of finger sandwiches we have had in other places are not enough for him. We were even offered a third helping but he decided to leave room for the cakes. These too were lovely, along with the scones and the nicest homemade jams I have tasted. We were again offered more if we wanted but were just too full. They even put the last remaining scone in a box for us to take home. We finished up with a walk in the beautiful Kensington Palace gardens. Would definitely come here again.",5,2017,08,10
133,Location and comfort,Very nice view from the room to the hydepark the hotel is just a step away from the parks gate on highstreet kensington the room has all requirments and comforts close many landmarks and shopping places  in london ,5,2017,08,10
133,"Perfect location, wonderful staff, a London home away from home!","I had the pleasure of spending a couple of months at the Royal Garden on a recent business trip to the UK. The staff went above and beyond to make my stay enjoyable as this hotel became somewhat of a home away from home.

The rooms are extremely comfortable and the breakfasts are some of the best I have enjoyed in any hotel. Importantly, the property is located conveniently in South Kensington, which opens up London on your terms. You have Hyde Park right next door (beautiful for a morning/evening run), Royal Albert Hall and the palaces are a short stroll away while High Street station allows you to get anywhere you need to in a short amount of time via the underground.

A few tips...

- Rooms on one side of the hotel look over Hyde Park while rooms on the other look over South London. I preferred the city view, but it's up to you - just let them know if you have a preference!

- Min Jiang; the Chinese restaurant on the top floor is definitely worth checking out. Not only is the food incredible, but the aspect overlooking the park and London skyline at sunset is breathtaking.

- The street adjacent to the hotel (Kensington Palace Gardens) is well worth walking down. Not only is it home to the palace, but also a range of embassies and consulates which make for fascinating and awe-inspiring ogling of the architecture!

- Notting Hill and Portabello are a short walk away (down the aforementioned street) and the Churchill Arms is a beautiful pub with a literal garden growing all over it, is also not far away.

- The TVs carry a huge range of cable sports channels if this is of interest to you, as it was to me!

- If you're a football fan, Stamford Bridge and Craven Cottage are a decent (but nice) walk to the south if you fancy catching a game in season. Wimbledon is also a short train journey away should you find yourself here in June.

Many thanks to the team at RGH for a wonderful stay! Will certainly be back.",5,2017,08,10
133,Lovely hotel great location,"Nice, comfortable stay with great concierge and staff very pleasant. Beds are really comfortable and clean. Parking is easy and great location. Shops are on the doorstep with Harrods a little stroll away.
Walking through the parks is beautiful and so relaxing.",5,2017,08,09
133,"Great location, but quite old building ","I spent 2 nights at this hotel. The lobby is quite busy, the check in took some time despite arriving way after 2pm. The atmosphere is very impersonal. 
The size of the room is quite decent, but decorated in a such old fashioned way. The whole hotel needs a proper refurbishment to look a bit more modern with a charming touch that is definitely missing now.
Breakfast is below average.

Pros: exceptional location 1 doorstep from  Hyde park. Good gym.
",3,2017,08,08
133,Delightful Staff,"The Chinese restaurant on the 10th floor has long been a favourite of mine. The rooms are very comfortable and well maintained although rather dated. Although not as cheap as it was a couple of years ago, there are occasionally some good last minute deals to be had.",5,2017,08,08
133,"Inconsistent Service, Lovely Location","We have stayed at The Royal Garden Hotel four times over the past three year.  The location of the hotel is ideal, close to the shops and casual restaurants on Kensington High Street, Kensington Gardens (great for the Princess Diana playground), Hyde Park, Victoria&Albert museum, Science Museum and Museum of Natural History.

The hotel is quite unattractive on the exterior and an eyesore for the surrounding neighborhood.  However, the interiors were renovated 6 or 7 years ago and are much better than you would expect from the outside.  The interiors are more contemporary with a large, light lobby and nice restaurant and lounge that overlooks Kensington Gardens.  

The efficiency and friendliness at the front desk is very inconsistent.  Some staff are very good and quite warm and friendly, others are on auto-pilot- merely getting the job done in order to finish the shift.  I think many are training at the hotel.  The hotel has terrible looking staff accommodations tucked behind and to the left of the hotel.  I imagine employees are given room and board for training and a minimum wage.  Our check in always takes a long time and they never realize we have stayed at the hotel before.  Normally we are coming off a 10-hour flight and an inefficient check is awful. 

Most of the time we entered and exited the hotel, no one greeted us or even lifted their eyes from a computer to see who we were or where we were going, security is of no concern.  This aspect always makes me slightly uncomfortable because at times the hotel is quite busy.  Anyone can enter into the lifts.  But also it never makes you feel welcome.  

The same poor service is true of the bellmen.  Inconsistent, often too busy to even greet you and not very professional overall.  It has been the same story every time we stay there.  I always find it interesting that hotel management does not understand the the bellmen are the front line of the hotel experience, and how they treat you sets much of the tone and impression of the hotel.  

The rooms, unless staying on the Kensington Garden side of hotel, are small.  We have found the cleanliness not stellar and the turn down service inconsistent- sometimes it is done, sometimes it isn't, sometimes you have a water by your bed and sometimes you do not.  The housekeeping staff do not keep the hallways clean and the room service staff often takes a couple of hours to pick up used room trays.  In the rooms, I often find fingerprints on desk tops and remote controls.  For this reason, on my last stay in London we found another hotel.

The bathrooms are fine.  There have separate bath tubs and shower areas but the sink area leaves little room for toiletry bags, or space for products.  The layout of the bathrooms are awkward as they are long and narrow, and the tiles are in a cream color but overall not great quality.  I only note this because it does state it is a five star hotel, but really it is four star (three if you consider the poor service).

Unfortunately your hotel offers in the Kensington/Chelsea/NH area is rather limited. There a few boutique hotels (great, Milestone and Blake's) but not a good option when traveling with children.  Stay at The Royal Garden if you find good rates and set your expectations to stay in an average hotel in a great location.

The staff in the restaurant on the lobby floor are very nice.  But I would say the staff lacks real energy, friendliness and a desire to serve.  You will find some who are nice but overall there is low energy and a poor sense of service.

If you can find a good rate, the hotel is well worth a stay.  But there are times when the rates are well over ¬£350 per night which makes it a poor value for money.",3,2017,08,07
133,"Convenient,clean, compact",Recently stayed over night whilst attending a concert at The Royal Albert hall. The hotel was very convenient for us with the RAH little more than a 10min walk away. The service we received was generally good & we was very with our room which over looked Kensington palace.  Our room which although compact we found comfortable & fulfilled our needs but might of been a bit cramped if we were staying longer. We will definitely checkout their room rates when we visit this part of London again.,4,2017,08,07
133,Excellent ,Having stayed here many times before we were looking forward to another weekend stay . From the moment you enter the foyer all your wishes / dreams come true . The staff here must be the best in London they are so friendly and polite and absolutely cater for your every wish . The Royal Garden hotel is beautiful positioned next to Kensington gardens and a 2 minute stroll to the London Underground . There are plenty of restaurants/ coffee shops outside if you want informal meals . Bertie's bar is a class act and the martini olives are to die for . Well done all the staff and management for creating another superb hassle free stay with you . We hope to be back soon . ,5,2017,08,06
133,Trip,"As always the staff and accomodations made my time in London comfortable and pleasant.  I often recommend fellow travelers to consider staying at the Royal Garden whenever they are in town.  I enjoy the location and proximity to the park.
",5,2017,08,06
133,Lovely Afternoon Tea,"What a lovely afternoon at the Royal Garden Hotel. I booked Afternoon Tea as a special treat for our anniversary, and wasn't disappointed. We turned up half an hour early for our table as the rain has started, but this wasn't a problem and we were seated straight away at a table by the window overlooking Kensington Gardens. The staff were very attentive and even brought a selection of around 20 different tea's we could choose from. The sandwiches were all delicious and seemed to be unlimited as they kept coming around to offer more. The fresh (still warm) scones were fantastic along with the other desserts and cakes.To top off a lovely experience they had even made a special 'happy anniversary' message (in chocolate of course!). This visit was on the expensive side for us Yorkshire types - but well worth it as a special treat - we even got two Pimms cocktails thrown in for free - I think this was a limited special offer though so might not always be the case.",5,2017,08,06
133,Amazing view of the Kensington Palace Gardens,"Stayed a night in the Royal Garden Hotel and it did not disappoint!

We had a fantastic view of Kensington Palace Gardens and the suit was immaculate. 
The bed was very comfortable and room was fitted with AC so we could easily regulate the temperature.
The staff were so friendly and helpful and made us feel really welcome on arrival. 
The hotel is a perfect getaway for couples, but there were also lots of families staying there too, as it is in such a good location to all of the attractions of London.

Looking forward to coming back one day.",5,2017,08,04
133,1st Class Hospitality,"I stayed here for one night as we had a reservation at Dinner by Heston. The dinner was amazing, but the hotel experience really made this an evening to remember. We were warmly greeted on check in by the concierge and reception team who efficiently checked us in and showed us to our room. The hotel looks like it has had a recent refurbishment and the room looked brand new. A lovely welcome note and some cold beers were waiting for us as we got ready for dinner. My only complaint is that I had to check out early for work. Now i just need to find an excuse to return.",5,2017,08,04
133,Value,Price is reasonble for location and style. Rooms are comfortable and service is great. Excellent top floor Chinese restaurant with views of London skyline. Breakfast is not to same great level as rest of the hotel.   ,4,2017,08,04
133,Just brilliant,It was my friends 60th birthday so we went to Princess Dianas dress exhibition at Ke4nsington Palace and then onto the Royal Garden for afternoon tea  Absolutely brilliant and the scones are just to die for  The service was incredible and the surroundings really really out of this world Could not fault the whole experience  Don't miss it,5,2017,08,03
133,Excellent Location & Service,Excellent location. Friendly staff. My only complaints are (i) some noise during the night (possibly air con machinery outside the building) and rates which could be more competitive for repeat customers.,4,2017,08,03
133,A SUMMER SONG,The Royal Garden was the ideal setting in glorious Hyde Park for a stunning time in London. The Park Terrace's breakfast is top drawer !! The Concierge team are great ! Hayden Barnhill the star there.,5,2017,08,01
133,A good hotel,A great property with a fantastic location in the heart of London.  I enjoyed staying there and I would recommend it to anyone that is interested to visit London.    Good facilities and nice staff.   Nothing more to add.                                                       ,4,2017,07,31
133,"Great location, but lots of noisy families","In my previous review, I raved about the Royal Garden.  As the staff are still wonderful, the food is good as ever, and the location is great, I think it's still a great choice.  However, get a room ending 31 through 50 . The lower number rooms are not well insulated from the noise of the many many families that stay here.",3,2017,07,30
133,Could be great but is not.,Staff are all foreign and have no sense of service.     We had drinks in the bar and were never shown the bottle of Chablis or offered a taste.   We had to ask for everything.  They barely speak English and it is quite embarrassing to have to repeat basic requests.    The rooms are quite small although the bathrooms are nice.   Penhalagon's products are lovely.   The location is very good but they need to train their staff to an appropriate level.    The assistant Manager was English thank goodness and I relayed my thoughts to her.,2,2017,07,29
133,Best staff," Very fast and good service provided,Good location and close to all what i needed. room is good and clean. The best thing i likes about the hotel is their services and the location.
What i did not like is The food prices is little high specially the breakfast and there was a little of noise from  many opening and closing of doors which i think was from house keeping. ",5,2017,07,29
133,Comfortable and clean,"A very friendly and efficient check in and a room that was clean and well furnished, although we found the bed to be not too comfortable. Staff were generally very welcoming. Breakfast was good, though they did run out of glasses resulting in a wait for fruit juice.",5,2017,07,28
133,Home away from home,"We were made to feel welcome from the moment we arrived. The very professional, friendly & attentive staff were brilliant. Our room was very comfortable and the hotel breakfast is one of the best going around.",5,2017,07,27
133,wonderful," Everything is great but there are reviews in the room service. Many days I can not find the water bottle. And also I can not find a cup to drink. There is a very high hassle outside the hotel on Saturday and Sunday after 2 am",4,2017,07,27
133,Lovely Anniversary Treat,"Got this hotel as part of a theatre break. 
Pros :-

133,Wow!!,"From the moment our luggage was whisked away in arrival to departure everything was just lovely!
The staff were gorgeous, the breakfast extensively moreish and the hospitality immense.
Luxury without being invasive or over the top- just how we like it.
Thanks for a fabulous stay! ",5,2017,07,27
133,Five Stars!,"The RGH is deserving of its five star status. I stayed here with my family when visiting London. Being on Kensington High Street, it is right in the centre of the hustle and bustle of London. There are a number of food and shopping options right outside the door of the hotel. It is also located near the beautiful Kensington Palace and Gardens. Apart from the RGH's superb location, the hotel itself is beautiful and luxurious. The rooms were comfortable and modern (though a bit cold at times). The service is also wonderful and the staff was always very warm and welcoming! A memorable London stay thanks to RGH!",5,2017,07,26
133,EXCELLENT,"Please keep the excellent service that you give to all your hotel clients.  Staying with you was indeed a wonderful experience as you always showed willingness to help us whenever we needed your assistance.  The location is superb giving us the freedom to walk or take the transportation needed to get to our desired destinations. Your efficient and always attentive staff made us feel welcomed and made us feel at home which was very much appreciated by all of us. We felt secured at all time and we commend you for that. I will without any hesitation recommend the Hotel to both my dear family and close friends.  Thank you for making our stay in the Royal Garden Hotel most enjoyable. It was indeed a great experience.  
",5,2017,07,24
133,Disappointing,"Massively overpriced continental breakfast and confused pricing. The porridge came at the same time as the cooked breakfast and was made with water and which while appealing to some was not to my taste.  The opportunity to have it made with milk would have been welcome.
Charged for the mineral water that was put by my bed side. Why?
Great location but overall this didn't feel five star.",2,2017,07,23
133,Great Location,"The location of the hotel is very good near the parks 
One day before our arrival , some one from hotel called me asking about my room  preference >
I requested a room at higher floor in hotel but when we arrived at hotel reception desk I asked the lady at reception to give us room at higher floor but unfortunately the lady at reception insisted on given us room 115 at first floor with terrible view looking over machines 
I was rely disappointed..",2,2017,07,23
133,No more than average,This hotel is in a very good location but very over priced rooms are small with noisy AC. The breakfast was average but over priced and not a good selection of teas or coffee and had to wait a long time for a decaf,3,2017,07,22
133,Great stopover in London,"The hotel is ideally located for both the west end and the museum. The room was very comfortable with all necessary features. Our room hadn't great view over Kensington High Street and beyond.
We look forward to staying at the hotel on our next visit to London.
",4,2017,07,22
133,"Wonderful views, excellent breakfast, and fantastic staff","Our family arrived fairly early the morning from a red-eye flight, and the front desk staff spontaneously offered us a temporary room to rest in until our suite was ready later in the day.  This was a wonderful touch, allowing us to freshen up prior to heading out to see the city. Our luggage was even transferred to the new room automatically.  Our room accommodated our family of four and had a wonderful view of Kensington Palace.  The hotel is very family friendly; our kids were offered backpacks and activity kits which kept them occupied.  The breakfast was a wonderful highlight, with a huge variety of fresh fruit, and eggs and waffles cooked to order. Overall this was a great family choice in central London and right beside Kensington Gardens where kids can run free and play. The only downside is that the closest underground station is on the circle line, which we find to be slower than others (and of course, this is out of the hotel's control!)",5,2017,07,22
133,""" Magical ""","I stayed with my daughter in London for holiday in this wonderful hotel
Upon a arrival we were greeted by the most friendly receptionist ever,so lovely 
a great first impression of the hotel.   
Our lovely room was on the 5th floor with with a fantastic view of the Kensington Palast in Hyde Park.
The location could not be better, right in the dazzling Kensington High Fashionstreet.
15 mins walk to the Natural History Museum, bus stop in front of the hotel.
We took a sightseeing tour that I could book directly from the hotel, with the bus stop just opposite the hotel.
The breakfasts were excellent with a wide selection of hot and cold offerings. My daughter had pancakes with berries - absolute divine. My eggs & bacon breakfast was superb.

We had an unforgettable pleasant stay.

",5,2017,07,22
133,Grate place in grate location,"I have staied in this hotel for a week. It was nice and it was in great location. The staff was very helpful. Bed was very comfortable. I came with my 6 years old daughter, and they offer a lot for children.",5,2017,07,20
133,Awards dinner,"I attended an awards ceremony here so I can only rate the food and service not the accommodation.

Staff were great, service was quick and sleek, food was amazing especially the desserts

would recommend",4,2017,07,19
133,Birthday weekend!,"I booked two ark suites for a birthday celebration for my sister- in- laws 40th birthday!  The rooms were amazing and very spacious with spectacular views of London and Kensington Palace.
From booking our stay to all the added extras our stay was made extra special.  All the staff were very helpful and everyone with whom I had correspondence with made sure all my requests were met.
I would definitely recommend Th Royal Garden Hotel for their excellent service and spectacular rooms.",5,2017,07,18
133,"Great Hotel, Good Location","This is a wonderful hotel, very good location. Near to many attractions. Berties' bar is a great place to unwind. Minjiang is the chinese restaurant with great view of the park and the service is excelleant. There is plenty of dining options and shops nearby the hotel.
The rooms are very comfortable and in room dining service is very good.
There is no swimming pool in this hotel.",5,2017,07,18
133,Excellent as always,"We often have lunch here and consistently excellent, thoroughly recommend. London's best kept secret. Fantastic value and unbelievably cheap for London. Very personal service. The waitress (Nimfa) has been there for over 20 years and always a pleasure to see her. She should get a pay rise for sure! ",5,2017,07,18
133,Business Stay,"Rate could be a bit more reasonable but excellent staff all food and beverage outlets offer an excellent service and quality of the food is excellent as well.
Location of the hotel is wonderful close to stores and tube service will consider for future stays ",5,2017,07,17
133,Another great stay at the Royal Garden Hotel,The Royal Garden Hotel is my preferred hotel in London and had another great visit.  Used the meeting rooms and restaurants in the hotel and they maintain their high standards but it is the staff at the hotel which makes it special.,5,2017,07,17
133,Nice hotel in Kensington,"We went here for Afternoon Tea after a visit to Kensington Palace. The restaurant was very nice, light & airy and the staff were friendly and attentive. My other guests had the champagne tea which went down very well, with extra strawberries (because of Wimbledon) We all enjoyed learning about all of the different teas they served and being able to choose our favourite. I had a gluten free afternoon tea for the first time and didn't really know how this was going to taste? The sandwiches were excellent and kept coming! When the cakes arrived they were very well presented, but unfortunately didn't taste as nice. However, the scones were very good, and if I went again, I would just have sandwiches & scones. The 'normal' afternoon tea was excellent according to the others, and despite the above-I would go here again.",4,2017,07,16
133,Before the Proms,"Super stay. Thanks for looking after us so well. Will come to stay again. Will recommend to friends. So convenient for central London, the park, Kensington and Nottinghill Gate, museums and the Royal Albert Hall. Looking forward to it. ",5,2017,07,16
133,Great location. Close to everything,Close to food - shops - the tube - nightlife - bars and services.  Nice friendly staff.  Perfect location.  Great value for money.  The door man made sure I took an umbrella from him as he knew it would rain later in the day.  The room was a good size.  Bathtub was deep.  Mini bar and coffee tea maker in the room.,5,2017,07,15
133,Recent stay,We stayed in a accessible room everything we needed and more.The staff were so helpful this are 5th stay and we keep coming back .I cannot fault a thing everything about our stay was perfect .The beds are so comfortable.,5,2017,07,13
133,"Excellent hotel, great location",We have stayed here several times over the past few years. The service and quality of this hotel is second to none. Nothing was to much trouble for the staff in helping us enjoy our stay. Just what I would expect from a five star hotel.,5,2017,07,13
133,"location is excellent,service is very good ,atternoon tea is delicious,we are satisfied.","This is a wonderful hotel,location is excellent,service is very good and polite,room is very big,atternoon tea is delicious,transport and shopping are very convenient,we are satisfied with this vacation ,we hope we will stay  return again next time.",4,2017,07,13
133,Excellent,The whole experience was very good. I would love to return. The beds were very comfortable everything we could need was there.the staff were very attentive. Was made to feel very special. It was a lovely experince from the start of stay until we left.,5,2017,07,11
133,"Fabulous staff,  great location","I usually don't mind small rooms, especially when in a historic building, so this wasn't really a deterrent, but if you find that a problem as for one of their double and avoid 8th floor.  But the generosity and friendliness of the staff as well as great location made it all worthwhile - just loved it!",4,2017,07,10
133,Dissatisfaction with check-in,"Our dissatisfaction with regard to the room readiness during check-in... the booked room was not ready on time and we had to literally waist our time ... the room overlooked to the Kensington street where the loud music from the nearby restaurant was heard up to 3:00 am. The next day we asked to change the room staying in the same room category. We were offered a room overlooking the garden, but it was not ready for the promised time either... we had to be near by the hotel and we again waist a few hours. The rest was acceptable. ",5,2017,07,09
133,Great stay,We always stay at the Royal Gardens Hotel whilst visiting London. The staff are great and always strive to ensure that you have a great stay.  It's a superb location for sight seeing and going to see the shows. ,5,2017,07,09
133,A Variety of Viewpoints,"What a great location, staffed by some of the best in the business and with nicely appointed, sparklingly clean rooms.
There were things that you have to take in your stride, like a very small room for two people, but the hotel was at 100%, so we could not upgrade.
Then there were the blips in the veneer of perfection. 
The room was only set up for one person and it took a while to get another set of towels. We did not bother getting another coffee cup in the process.
Probably the thing that was least attractive was the breakfast buffet. I think management should eat what they are serving once a week. The pastries and the cereal set up was amazing, but the hot buffet and the omelette station left me wondering what on earth were they thinking. I understand ""the great British breakfast"", but this presentation left a lot to be desired.",4,2017,07,09
133,"Great Location, Wonderful Hotel","Very nice, very clean hotel room.  Excellent location that can't be beat.  Staff very courteous.  All around excellent hotel.  The only thing was that the Wi-fi is not secure, so that was our only problem.",5,2017,07,08
133,Disappointed,"Our experience on this visit was disappointing. In spite of being repeat customers, checking in early, and paying more than 
$500 per night we received room 430 where half the window was blocked by a wall.",4,2017,07,08
133,Best family vacation,His hotel goes above and beyond in service and quality. It was a wonderful trip with a beautiful view and exceptional location. All restaurants were so accommodating and were high quality. The staff was so friendly and the cleanliness of the room was exceptional. ,5,2017,07,07
133,Just perfect!,"What a great stay at Royal Garden Hotel. Loved the location, shopping on your doorstep and the ease of getting around London (bus at front door, train station 2-300m away). I had a lovely room (with a separate seating area) on higher floors overlooking Hyde Park.  Very comfortable and large by London standards.  To top it off the staff are very friendly and accommodating.  Highly recommended!",5,2017,07,07
133,Constructive feed back,A need to improve the bathroom and more importantly the service staff in garden terrace restaurant requires attention / improvement. e.g. special order placed with one serving staff who relayed to another staff without emphasising on the special request and as a result I served with something I did not order. Another incident was that my order was delivered to the wrong table on more than one occasion.  Also a simple order of toasts took more than 20 mins to be served.,3,2017,07,05
133,Room with a garden view,"The location right beside Kensington Gardens is hard to beat.  We had a Garden Suite and overlooked the gardens.  The room was well appointed, quiet, spacious with a lounge and desk. The only negative was that the bed was too firm.  The buffet breakfast was excellent, and Basil's omelette's great. The service was excellent without being over the top. The staff were very friendly.   A very comfortable and convenient hotel, we would definitely stay again. ",5,2017,07,05
133,Highly recommended,"We booked the Executive Suite and was upgraded to the Royal Suite. The view was spectacular, overlooking Hyde Park with Big Ben and the Eye on the horizon; the night view was amazing!!! The room itself was stunning with a large separate sitting area; the bedroom was spacious and the entire suite was luxuriously decorated. We truly enjoyed the stay, the suite was our sanctuary after our long hectic days in the crowded tourist attractions. It was a one of the high lights of our trip!!! Thanks!",5,2017,07,05
133,Lovely hotel but not the room we wanted,"Placed in a Twin room after booking King bed.
No complimentary newspaper appeared.
When staff were told the answer was sorry that was housekeeping.
Not good enough. This is an expensive hotel so expected more",3,2017,07,04
133,A wonderful hotel with first class views.,Very well organized and clean. Tasty breakfast and welcoming staff. The room was very smart and blessed with superb views of the park. The car park entrance and exit are a bit tight but there was plenty of room once down there.,5,2017,07,04
133,Anniversary celebration ,"Booked this hotel
For our night in London for celebrations for our 30th wedding Anniversary, lovely hotel, room was great had everything you required for your stay, though bed not the greatest, staff were great and very helpful, and couldn't do enough for you, enjoyed a lovely cocktail in Bertie's bar before we went to dinner!  Breakfast was great again everything you could want and especially the chef cooking your eggs to order! 
Great enjoyable stay ",5,2017,07,03
133,Wedding Gift,"The hotel was lovely and the staff great, I found the bed a little uncomfortable not that crisp hotel feel off comfort we usually have in a hotel. the towels felt old along with the face flannels. the room itself was a bit dated even though we were upgraded. also there was people smoking in a surrounding room which was most unpleasant as the smell came into our room and hit us when entering or exiting it.",4,2017,07,03
133,Great for families.,"Great room service, kids menu, and stuff for the kids to check out at the concierge desk e.g.  Scooters! Next door to Hyde park and a short walk to the best kids park in the world, Diana Memorial. Whole Foods across the street. Convenient TK Maxx next door to go grab those items you forgot! ",5,2017,07,03
133,For your trip to London I would advise this hotel,"Great hotel, fantastic food, particularly the Min Jiang restaurant, and an ideal position right next to Kensington Park, yet right on Kensington High Street.  Staff very friendly.  Would recommend for leisure or business trip.",5,2017,07,03
133,Short stay,"We stayed only one night on a stop over for business, beautiful hotel with great facilities and brilliant staff, couldn't fault anything. Clean and very nice rooms. The breakfast was brilliant plenty of choice and good quality.  ",5,2017,07,03
133,An Oasis in the City,"A great place to stay in the city with Kensington Park next door the views from the Garden rooms are spectacular. Staff are friendly and helpful. Excellent service was provided in the restaurant, the bar and in our rooms. The cleanliness of the room could not be faulted.",5,2017,07,03
133,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed here for one night as we were attending Phil Collins concert in Hyde park. 
The rooms were absolutely beautiful, included a separate shower and bath, very large bed and tea making facilities.
We decided not to book the breakfast as for ¬£25pp seemed a bit steep however we walked 100 yards down the road and there is a beautiful little cafe.
The hotel is immaculately clean, the staff were all very helpful 
Would I stay here again? Most certainly!! ",5,2017,07,03
133,bad experiance,"I recommend not to visit this hotel , unless if you can pay such amount for bad service .
location is great , amenities is good . customer service is bad , not friendly . they night shift receptionist lady with no smile at ALL .. ",2,2017,07,03
133,Great Weekend,Had a fantastic time at the hotel.  Staff members were wonderful. Rooms comfortable. Food amazing (order the duck in advance)!!! Great with the kids. Park right next door for a nice stroll. Can't wait to do it again!! ,5,2017,07,02
133,"Elegant, classy and comfortable",Excellent customer service and nice perks such as bath robes and slippers and bellman to bring luggage up to our room as well as a no charge for room service for our paid breakfast made this hotel stay one to recommend!,5,2017,07,02
133,Great but ...,"Everything was perfect: the service, the bedding, the bar, the breakfast. The hotel is in a great location (center of london, 5 minutes walk from metro, in a very nice shopping area)
Only shadow on the board ... had to wait 1h30 to get my room while for once i had time to myself without my son (i would prefer to take a bath, rest, do a blow dry .... instead wait in the lobby!)",4,2017,07,02
133,"Royal views of the garden, indeed!!!","We stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel for two nights and had a wonderful time. Beginning at check in: we were greeted by lovely Christina who gave my daughters beautiful backpacks with toys inside. And later sent us a bottle of wine and a card, so kind!! And our two connected rooms on the 10th floor had astonishing views of Kensington Palace and Hyde Park!! We were amazed!! The beds were also very comfortable as well as the bathrooms.
When we asked for room service, everything was perfect. 
We would definitely come back to the Royal Garden Hotel and strongly recommend it.",5,2017,07,02
133,Lovely,"Great Staff, excellent location. This Hotel really set the standard for our stay in London. Helpful courteous staff and travel to major sites were a breeze due to the location. For our first visit to London the room overlooked the Kensington Palace weather was amazing, nice restaurants were close by even the Big Bus tour had a station across the road.  All in all a great place to stay at an awesome price.",5,2017,07,02
133,My favorite place in London,"I've stayed here twice now, two years in a row, and it feels a bit like coming home. I know exactly which tube stop to take, how to walk to my favorite spots. This location is prime! In addition, rooms are massive by U.K./Euro standards, restaurant on site has a great breakfast, room service is efficient and also delish. Staff was able to accommodate us an early 10am check in this past trip, last year they stored luggage and happily allowed us to use the gym's facility to freshen up. ",5,2017,07,01
133,"Great, but, bad sleep.","Great hotel. Clean, nice rooms. Horrible pillows, squash down to paper thin. The firm Pillow I requested was also too thin. Even putting two tougher was uncomfortable. I left with a sore neck! Otherwise it was a nice stay.",4,2017,06,28
133,Mary P,"A great experience from top to bottom (the bar on the roof has special views).  Wonderful staff!  Will be coming back again! Located righ next to Kennsington Palace.  If you like a morning run, this is the place.",5,2017,06,28
133,"Being poorly during our visit we offer many, many thanks for such special care.","Over the years of our countless visits to London we have always stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel, because, unlike many other such hostelries, we have first hand experience of how they really do care for both their guests and the staff. And, during our latest visit, it was delightful to see the busy party to congratulate all of those many staff with over 20 years service; what an achievement!   Yes, it was no surprise to us that, suffering from my chronic illness for most of my visit, staff at all levels from chambermaid to waiter to general manager went more than the extra mile to provide gentle, cheerful care, to ensure I was as comfortable as possible. Many, many thanks.",5,2017,06,27
133,Great option if you get the right room!,"We enjoyed our stay here.  We booked direct through their website and were given a bonus for that.  They also contacted us to see if we hand any concierge questions before we came. It was farther out of the main city then we wanted, but it was a short Tube ride away.  The hotel is located on a great shopping street which was super convenient to Whole Foods, Starbucks, drug stores and restaurants.  We had an executive room  with a rooftop view.  The sofa bed was small, a twin, not a double like the listing suggested and could not fit 4.  This was also a connecting room which was loud on both nights.  I had to complain twice after being awoken at 1 AM with continued noise until 3 AM.  Since we were staying for 6 nights, when I complained I asked for a better room.  We were given a different room with a city view the next day on the 9th floor with a full couch sofa.  We also started a second room that night, a twin room with a Mews view, which was nice.  Our only problems were some outlets didn't work and some radios had USB hubs and some did not.  Makes it hard to charge devices. They need more USB hubs!  We had room service and one of the items we ordered was the 3-onion soup.  We were brought 3 onion soups, and were charged fas such.  The girl who brought it up went back downstairs to talk to the manager to correct it, so she corrected the bill and took 2 of the soups away.  I thought that was odd, in the US, they would leave them from you.  Otherwise, the food was great.  Our girls in the twin room ordered pizza one night and the staff refused to let them put it on their room charge so they had to spend their cash, which I didn't appreciate. Other than that, the staff was really friendly and helpful and the rooms well appointed.  Could use some minor upgrades for the price.  Had amenities for the family like games and scooters which we borrowed. ",4,2017,06,27
133,Week-end in London,"The room was not ready at 14h00, thus we were forced to wait. Was given a room 601 - a room with a very strong smell of cigarette smoke. The floor carpet was covered with several stains. After our complaint, we were explained that this is a smokers room. We requested immediate change of room. We were given a new room - 219 - it was rather OK, but it was a room for invalid person. The bathroom sink was at very low high. not very satisfied taking into account the number of stars allocated to the hotel.",2,2017,06,27
133,Top classhotel and staff,The location of the hotel was perfect . The staff and accommodation were first class and as far as we were concerned could not have been any better. We would definitely recommend the hotel to our family and friends. Thank you all for a great stay.,5,2017,06,26
133,Great Location," Great value for money in a fabulous location. It is a short walk to the Royal Albert Hall, the park and easy access to the South Kensington museums. The Kensington high street shops are on the doorstep and it is well serviced with transport links making it easy to get to the West End. 
The staff were friendly and helpful and the view from our room was lovely, right across London.",5,2017,06,26
133,A Perfect place for any stay,"Ideally located, excellently furnished , superb staff. Surpassed our expectations even though already one of our favourite places to stay. We will be back again as soon as we can because of the outstanding service.",5,2017,06,26
133,Great hotel,"The staff service is one of the best in London . Great reception on arrival , room very clean very quiet in central London even with window open ,view of Kensington park help . Very nice restaurants nearby for all taste . About 20 minutes taxi ride to Covent Garden.",5,2017,06,25
133,Director ,"The best hotel....staying for years....my 2nd visit in 2 weeks....very comfortable...clean
All managers, staff very helpful & take care of all needs. All Resturant are good - delicious food. 
Reception manager Angie Lu is excellent
She is very help full....I feel like at home
Great hotel ..... üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç",5,2017,06,24
133,We had booked double room but received a single,"We were put in a single room despite having booked a double. The front desk was unwilling to correct the mistake and the front desk manager did not even show up despite our request.
The room was set up for one i.e. one cup, one bathrobe etc. so the hotels claim that it was a double is false. We traveled with one regular suitcase and one carry on and we had to remove furniture from the room in order to be able to open our suitcase. Certainly not a 5 star experience as they claim to be. The Chinese restaurant on the top floor however was top notch - 5 stars üëç",2,2017,06,23
133,Mostly very good,"Nice location, relatively modern, decent service, good food options. My two main gripes are:

1. During the week-long stay, almost every day had to get new keys as mine would get demagnetized no matter what I did. VERY annoying. The system needs to be changed somehow.

2. Our rooms were fine, but it is starting to feel outdated. It's not first stay, I recall a full remodel a few years ago, but it's now time for a refresh.",4,2017,06,22
133,Great Stay,Some rooms very small but when moved the room was very good. On a long stay internet and TV very important. Found the internet drops out regularly and the TV experiences static/interference regularly. Staff and general service fantatsic,4,2017,06,22
133,Hotel in the park,This hotel has one of the best locations in London. Garden rooms are so peaceful and look directly into Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. There is a private road in between the back of the hotel and Hyde Park which is hardly ever used and makes it one of the quietest hotels if you book these rooms in London.,5,2017,06,22
133,Not As Great As Last Year,"I had stayed here last summer with my daughter and had a wonderful experience, but unfortunately, not all of the staff are trained to treat their clients as valued customers. Our room had definitely seen some use since our prior years visit, though it was still a lovely space. The Concierge Staff is EXCELLENT, the Front desk staff, however, is hit or miss when it comes to client service. My husband was not impressed, though the location remains excellent, so they have that going for them. ",3,2017,06,21
133,Lovely hotel with great staff,Great food breakfast amassing very large selection room large and the beds extremely comfortable ideally situated for attrations would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing for a good place to stay with great staff,5,2017,06,21
133,Summer Gala,"Can not fault this hotel. Excellent staff, rooms and service. All the little extras made a big difference. It was a very hot day but the air condition worked a treat! Would definitely recommend this hotel, good location",5,2017,06,21
133,Fantastic,I came to this hotel with my friend we were warmly greeted and made to feel very welcome nothing was too much trouble a very very enjoyable experience Thankyou very much to all the staff. And breakfast in bed is a must!!! Yummy xx,5,2017,06,20
133,7 days stay in Royal Garden Hotel,My girlfriend and I had a fantastic stay at the Royal Garden Hotel. The hotel is situated at the south west corner of Hyde Park and the room had a fantastic view over the park and some of the London skyline. The rooms were spacious (Garden room) and very clean. The Kensington area is a perfect place to stay. ,5,2017,06,19
133,Great Hotel,"This was a very nice hotel with amply sized rooms.  Near Kensington Palace but a bit further away from other attractions.  Nonetheless, it was a great stay with great staff-all very helpful and nice.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,06,18
133,Highly recommend,"The hotel is a perfect location for visiting the Royal Albert Hall. The service is excellent and staff friendly and helpful. Standards all round are very high and we would definitely stay here again. Our room (executive) was extremely comfortable and spacious, although our view wasn't so good - overlooking a flat roof, but it was just an overnight stay so no big deal. Breakfast good but pricey. Pre theatre meal was ideal.",5,2017,06,15
133,Recent stay,"Near tube station, good bus routes. Very personable, well trained staff. We have returned for the fourth time & hope to return. We especially appreciated Laila 's help in the business center, Torie at the front desk, & Steve the concierge. ",5,2017,06,13
133,Great place to stay,"Service amazing very helpful and friendly. Very close to underground station if travelling, Lots of places to eat, drink and shop around the area. Lovely views from our room onto the park. The only thing I thought was a bit of a down side was the cost for breakfast at ¬£25 per head. As I had booked via Bookin.com didn't get the option to get a discount. When leaving did speak to the receptionist as coming again in November to see the concert I didn't get to see this time, have been able to book again  and was offered a discount on breakfast which have taken up. ",5,2017,06,13
133,A weekend treat!,"My husband and I enjoyed a fantastic weekend at this lovely hotel, looked after by excellent staff who made our stay so memorable. Standards were very high and we were extremely impressed with our room which overlooked the park. Room service was impeccable and all the hotel employees consistently helpful and professional. It definitely warrants its five stars!",5,2017,06,13
133,Be careful about scented laundry,"The hotel uses scent in their laundry detergent and do not warn guests. If you are sensitive to these, you need to manually mark your forms. For a 5 start hotel, this is inexcusable.

The hotel location is great, and the staff is friendly and helpful.",3,2017,06,12
133,BEST SUITE IN BEST HOTEL OF LONDON,"Certainly part of the Best hotel in London; cOMMUNICATION, RECEPTION. Beautiful suite with all amenities. The hotel is quiet, in central London. We really enjoyed our stay in that central London hotel. ",5,2017,06,12
133,Great Stay,"I have visited RGH on several occasions and have always had such a great experience, from the comfy rooms, great restaurant options and impeccable service, you can't go wrong! Check out the view from Min Jiang, you won't be disappointed üëè",5,2017,06,12
133,Perfect for Business trip,This was perfect for my short business trip. Very nice facilities. The location was also a big plus as the bus stop is just outside taking you to Hammersmith station that is connecting to the main tube lines.,5,2017,06,12
133,Fab hotel,"The Royal Garden never fails to impress! The staff are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble, will be returning very soon. It is a great hotel if you are visiting the Albert a Hall. Really good to get an upgrade also.",5,2017,06,12
133,"An excellent hotel in an excellent location with excellent staff. That's threee excellent s, your through to the next ro","All was excellent except the high heat in the Park Terrace restaurant which was almost so bad that we contemplated leaving and having breakfast somewhere else.
On a good note, we were moved to a slightly cooler spot and enjoyed what can only be described as a superb cooked buffet breakfast worth the ¬£50 charge",5,2017,06,12
133,"Good location, great for kids","Another great stay at this hotel. One of the highlights for us is the extra mile they go for kids - including welcome pack, map of the area and the free use of scooters to explore Kensington Gardens. The staff are also very welcoming and helpful. ",5,2017,06,12
133,Great business hotel!,"I have stayed here multiple times and recommend this highly for business travel.  It is centrally located in a good spot and a very nice neighborhood in London.  The hotel is well appointed, nice rooms, not huge, but very very nice.  The lobby is quite nice and the restaurants in the hotel are very good.  I will definitely continue to come back to the Royal Garden when I go to London for business.",4,2017,06,11
133,Very favorable stay in London.,Lovely hotel and personnel.  Great location with a beautiful view.   Very welcoming and helpful.  Luxurious accommodations.  Did not get a chance to experience the bar or restaurant but very inviting.  Only negative was signed up for newspaper but never received.,5,2017,06,11
133,Nice but not 5* ,"We had stayed in this hotel for a night previously back in 2009 and enjoyed our stay so when we were looking to book a hotel for our recent trip we didn't really look at any other options. 

The hotel is in an excellent location for the underground, buses and Kensington Park. However with the exception of the bar staff, who were excellent, we had minimal interaction with all other staff.  We weren't acknowledged in any way when we walked through reception and we found the lady who checked us in to be a little cold. 

During our 4 night stay the main revolving doors were out of operation so the small, narrow, heavy doors to the side had to be used. Although there was a doorman present every time we entered and left the hotel not once did they open the door for us. In fact on one occasion they actually stood and watched me struggle in the strong wind. 

The room although satisfactory was clean, apart from a visible stain on the carpet, but just faintly disappointing and underwhelming. The room was also very warm and although we had the air con on the maximum setting it didn't make much of a difference to the temperature. 

The bathroom was clean and functional but again faintly disappointing. We expect much more than a tiny shower cubicle for the price of the room. Also I don't expect to have to squeeze between the counter and toilet to be able to use the vanity mirror. 

We left the do not disturb light on so housekeeping did not clean our room. However they woke us up when then rang to check that we didn't want them to service the room. To be fair the following days they just slipped a card under our door. 

We did mention the doorman issue and our disappointment with the service at checkout however as far as we could see no note was made and we have yet to hear anything from the hotel. 

All in all this isn't a bad hotel but it doesn't compare to other 5*s we have stayed in. For the amount of money we spent we expected so much more and would definitely stay elsewhere next time. 

",3,2017,06,11
133,Nice but not 5 Star,"Hotel rooms a little tired (stain on carpet) and space not plentifull. Bathroom ok but a little cramped (get rid of the bath like most hotels are doing now)
Bar staff were great. Very attentive.
Never saw the Doormen open a door for anyone.
Reception staff generally ignored us when we walked in or out of the hoetel
Didn't use the restaurant so couldn't possibly comment.",3,2017,06,11
133,Afternoon Tea,Staff were utterly charming and attentive.  Tea was lovely offered extra sandwiches and scones.  Huge pot of tea.  Scones were warm and offered extra of those also.   Couldn't fit them in though!  At ¬£31 pp I felt this was good value.,5,2017,06,10
133,One night of luxury in the west end.,"Really good hotel, great proximity for the Royal Albert Hall. First class, ate dinner and breakfast. Not cheap, but good value. We only stayed one night with a show package but if you want a quality, relaxing, central London hotel, close to museums, Kensington Palace and Hyde Park, this is it.",5,2017,06,09
133,Top hotel,"Had an amazing time would recommend and looking forward to staying in the future 
 Excellent staff couldn't do enough for you
Hotel very clean 
Food very good 
Drinks  reasonable  prices 
Busy hotel but also seems very  quiet at the same time 
",5,2017,06,08
133,Rude doorman,Had to encounter really rude doorman who won't let my driver pick us up from the main door. We have 2 young children and a wheelchair user. There is plenty of space which is empty but doorman won't use their common sense. Won't be returning here again. ,1,2017,06,08
133,Cheeky Afternoon Tea,"Things started off badly by being offered prawns when we had informed the hotel that no seafood was wanted.
However good strong coffee, good tasting, fresh sandwiches with a second helping offered improved things.
Warm scones, with great tasting jams and nice cakes.
Fruit cake was very dry.
Staff fairly attentive throughout. Poor views of the park, not quiet what was advertised. 
Nice to have the lady playing the piano.
All in all a nice experience,",4,2017,06,07
133,Visit to Kensington,"Fabulous location, next to Kensington Palace, short walk to Albert Hall or Hyde Park. Concierge very helpful with good advice.Rooms clean and comfortable.  Breakfast selection very good. Staff friendly.",5,2017,06,07
133,Whoa! Wasn't prepared for how amazing this hotel is!! ,"Ok, I actually was pretty freaking bummed to have to stay at any hotel! I was unfortunately part of the IT meltdown that British Airways had and I literally was stuck in London, no luggage, no flight home to Dubai, no data plan, no information and no idea when this would be over...it truly was a nightmare! 

We were left to fend for ourselves and if you read my other review about the London hotel I stayed in, there was no way I was going to stay there. We were handed a piece of paper that explained we had to fend for ourselves and with a dying laptop in the airport, I quickly searched for a hotel. I came across Royal Garden, took a quick read of the reviews (due to the many people stranded, a lot of hotels were full), booked one night, hopped in an Uber and headed there. I usually don't stay in the Kensington area but I think I found my new favorite location in London.

I arrived at the hotel beat up after sitting on a plane on the runway for 4 hours after an 11 hour flight and from the moment I arrived, everything was fantastic. I was quickly checked into my room, on the 8th floor and was beyond happy to look out the window at the gorgeous view of Kensington high street roof tops! To add another dreamy layer, the room had this seating area by the window that was beyond perfect...i quickly stripped off my clothes put on the robe and slippers and curled up on the seat and stared out the window...exactly what I needed after a crazy day!

The location of the hotel couldnt be any better, a short time later I realized I needed to buy clothes and toiletries and EVERYTHING was like right at your doorstep. Zara, H&M, Whole Foods, Boots, even the Vodafone store all just minutes away...it made my inconvenient stay, that much more bearable. Not having a flight and not knowing when I would get one, they accommodated me having to extend my stay another night, same room, same rate (like 2 minutes before checkout)...everyone was very lovely and understanding.

At the end of my two night stay, I was actually a bit sad to leave! I loved the hotel, the staff were all so warm, welcoming and helpful. I will stay here from now on on all my trips to London!!

The only negative points I have, that honestly didnt really matter in the grand scheme of things, but to keep it real as always...the wifi, kept cutting out...not a big deal unless I was trying to send emails or work (which I wasnt) and even with my privacy light on, housekeeping (i think it was housekeeping) still kept knocking on my door and disturbing me...however, I chalk it up to just happenstance, it only bothered me when i woke up and someone was in my room! 

But overall, the service, the quality of the rooms and the location all made up for it!! Highly recommend!!

133,"Luxury, cleanliness and brilliant staff.","My husband and l stayed on Monday night, beautiful room, view and facilities.The staff are excellent, so well trained.  When we returned from our concert we found the room had been readied for our return, curtains closed,low lighting on, radio on low too, fresh water and glasses by our bedside. This level of service is rarely seen now a days.We unfortunately managed to leave a couple of things behind in our room and have just found out that not only have these been found, but already being posted to us! Looking forward to returning. The hotel does indeed deserve its 5 star rating, and look forward to returning.",5,2017,06,07
133,Great Location,"Positives: Fabulous location on Kensington High Street. Plenty of great Pubs, restaurants and Cafes in walking distance. Tube station 500m away.
Negatives: Not great for a long stay. Small room with very few drawers/shelves to unpack clothes and not enough space to keep a suitcase open.",4,2017,06,07
133,Royal Garden stay,"I have visited this hotel now on a number of occasions and it never disappoints because of it being a lovely ran clean modem hotel along with lovely staff and lovely food in a great London location. keep up the good work, see you again shortly.",4,2017,06,06
133,Great location and one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in!,"Understanding that smaller rooms are quite common in Europe, the Royal Garden manages to make great use of the space providing a clean and functional guest room with everything you could need - including a towel warmer!  The hotel staff is extremely gracious and professional, they made me feel like I was at home despite being across the Atlantic Ocean.  Bettina Sander, Melissa Harris, Maswani Ahmad and Yolande in the business center were all fantastic to work with and they took great care of me during my week-long stay.  I wish I could stay in the Royal Garden Hotel for business and pleasure in every city!!  Looking forward to returning again sometime soon.",5,2017,06,06
133,Good Location ,"Stayed for 2nights to attend a concert at the Albert Hall.
Perfect Accomodation for the Albert Hall which is 10mins walk away .
Right on the edge of Kensington Park which we had a lovely walk in and close to Kensington Palace .
Very well staffed and very professional.Room lovely view of the park .
It was my first visit for about 25 years and that would be my only comment,it hasn't really changed since then ,felt a bit dated in areas .However ,for some ,I'm sure that is a good thing !",4,2017,06,06
133,Wonderful visit,"Greatly enjoyed a repeat visit to the Royal Garden Hotel.  I travelled specifically to celebrate a birthday by attending concerts at Royal Albert Hall. I loved that the short walk got me there in 5 minutes, & the location near the tube, shopping, & park was a plus.  The hotel staff spoiled me with their attention, & afternoon tea was a highlight.",5,2017,06,06
133,Don't Be Fooled,"I have stayed in over a dozen different hotels in London in the last ten years and thought I would return here for its convenient location near some of the major museums. I looked at the pictures on the website, the room looked reasonably spacious in line with previous experiences and felt that the value was decent. Little did I know how misleading the information was. At 350 Pounds plus breakfast, the single room was not cheap, but it was the smallest one I have ever been given in London and the sound proofing was poor so I heard noises both from outside and when my neighbors returned at 1am. The staff are pleasant, the free wifi works well and the Chinese restaurant should be recommended, but please avoid staying here - at least in a single room. 
Interestingly, the hotel sent me a review form to fill in online. Curiously, despite three tries, it would not accept my review. Perhaps my low rating triggered the ""technical issue - please try again later.""",2,2017,06,06
133,Nice Hotel,"Everything at the hotel was of an excellent quality. One thing that let it down was the breakfast service which was very poor. Had to stand in line at restaurant door to be told after a ten minute wait that no tables were available and to come back in 5 minutes. When we returned were shown to a table but service was non existent really. Had to clear our own plates from table onto an adjacent table, lack of available hot food, tea and coffeee took ages to arrive, nobody checked that everything was Ok etc. etc.  The hotel was very busy but this is no excuse for a 5 star hotel.",4,2017,06,06
133,great experience,"We will recomend this hotel for its comfort, service and location. We were upgraded which was a wonderful surprise. If we go back to London, we will try and stay in your hotel.
The closeness of Hyde Park was great. And we reaaly had a room with a view.",5,2017,06,06
133,Prime London Location,"This is our second stay at this hotel located next to Kensington Palace. Being repeat customers confirms the quality of this hotel and our past experience. In previous visits to London we have stayed at Knightsbridge and Lancaster Gate in quality hotels, however love the location (tube station under five minutes walk) and the luxury this accommodation provides. We had a problem with Hotel.com booking this accommodation, however the staff at the hotel resolved the issue. Both times we have stayed at the Royal Garden the rooms have been lovely with great views and very comfortable. This time we only used the hotel restaurant once, as we have favourite restaurants in the locality of the hotel. This visit we stayed three nights and we will return again.",5,2017,06,05
133,Enjoyable visit,"We booked for a Friday and Saturday nights on a deal through Hotels.com and, having stayed there many years ago, I thought it would be worth a try again ‚Äì especially at that price.
It was Mothering Sunday the next day, and, having agreed to meet daughter, we tried to extend to include the Sunday night. Hotels.com were only able to do this by cancelling the original reservation and re-booking for the 3 nights ‚Äì at full price.
I contacted the hotel, explained the situation and they added the extra night and made sure that we stayed in the same room.
The staff and service was excellent and the buffet breakfast was great on Saturday and Sunday mornings, but nowhere near so extensive on the Monday morning.
We tried to reserve a table in the restaurant for the Saturday evening, but they were fully booked, so had to go elsewhere.
I have no complaints at all about the hotel, although a little impersonal, but what one would expect of a 5 Star hotel.
My only mistake was in picking the location ‚Äì most of my reasons for being in London were in the Covent Garden area, which meant a ¬£20 taxi ride ‚Äì my fault, not theirs",4,2017,06,05
133,Perfect stay.,I couldn't fault the Royal Garden Hotel. From arrival to check out the staff were friendly and attentive. A  tasty English breakfast cooked to order was the ideal start to a day of meetings in the hotel's well appointed conference facilities. Aperfect stay! ,5,2017,06,04
133,Lovely stay,"A perfectly located hotel for our visit to the Albert Hall and Hyde Park. The park room was a great size and comfy bed with a lovely view over the park. The dinner and breakfast were delicious. With NCP parking at the hotel it makes it very to drive to the hotel.
I highly recommend this hotel for those looking for a hotel near Hyde Park.",5,2017,06,04
133,Great location shame about the paper thin walls,"The view, location and facilities are great at the hotel and the food and wine are fabulous too.
The hotel suite is well appointed but unfortunately the walls are paper thin and the voices and movements of our neighbors woke us on several occasions. I could hear a phone conversation at 4am where the man in the room's voice was audible and also that I f the person he was chatting to over the phone.
Very disconcerting. Not good.",4,2017,06,04
133,Great hotel," Great hotel in fantastic location. Hopefully they're phasing out the practice of pulling two twin beds together and calling it a king. Spectacular view, great service, wonderful location. Enjoyed Bertie's Bar, too.",4,2017,06,04
133,Great location next to park ,Clean and comfortable hotel.  Very friendly staff.  Great to be able to walk through the park.  Good location near the Kensington high street tube station.  Rooms are quite small and breakfasts are expensive.  We had a view out over the street  - nice to be able to open a window - double glazing kept it quiet.  ,4,2017,06,03
133,"Great view, great hotel","This met our needs- a view of the park, a car park underneath the hotel and good food at the Park Terrace restaurant. 
We had a garden view room and it was very good with plenty of complementary fruit and sparkling water.
it was quiet too.
The bus stop was right outside the hotel!
",5,2017,06,03
133,Great Hotel we will be back!!,"On our short trip to London we stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel.  There were 3 adults traveling the room was very modern and ultra spacious.  We had a king size bed and a separate sleeper in a side seating area of the room.  The bath was huge a separate tub and shower areas. Nice unit for heated towels.  English breakfast was included daily.  Location is very nice close to the tube and if you're interested in the hop on hop off bus it is located across the street. 

Give this Hotel a try!

",5,2017,06,02
133,Great hotel in a good central location,"We recently stayed in this hotel having chosen it for its close proximity to the Royal Albert Hall.  And I am so glad we did. The accomodation was very comfortable, clean and well equipped.   We had asked for an upper floor room which gave us fantastic views over the city. The hotel is close to Kensington High Street underground station and there is also a bus stop directly outside with buses every few minutes to popular tourist spots. The full English breakfast was excellent and staff very attentive. Altogether, this was a fantastic stay and this hotel is now top of our list for London hotels.",5,2017,06,02
133,Royal garden hotel,"Nice!! Location was excellent.. Next to Hyde Park. A lot of bars, restaurants around the area. Easy transportation!! Clean and comfortable rooms.Fitness center was excellent. Foods are excellent. We are excited to stay again.",5,2017,06,02
133,perfect location,London is not cheap to stay. But this hotel makes it worth. Great room with al;l facilities in a great neighborhood. Nice shops and places to eat and parks to spend your time. Close to the underground to get to visit the rest of London.,5,2017,06,02
133,Still Great,"I have been coming here since the mid eighties and am glad that the quality has remained high. I love the location, the towel warmers, the English breakfasts. The concierge services are always excellent.",5,2017,06,02
133,Great Location for the Albert Hall,"Well prepared and luxorious room with a great view of Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, extras such as biscuits and fruit in the room were very much appreciated as was the deep bath. Only five minutes walk from the Royal Albert Hall so was ideal for a post concert stop over.",5,2017,06,01
133,Great Hotel in London,"This hotel is so close to Hyde Park, the Kensington Palace, and in walking distance of many different shops and places to eat.  The staff is top-notch.  They also help with any inquiries as to tickets, catching a cab, has a great dining room ....Rooms are lovely.  We will definitely be back if we ever visit London again.",5,2017,05,31
133,Great Location,"This was my second stay at the Royal Garden Hotel. I enjoyed my one night stay in a small double room with a lovely view of  Kensington Palace. The bed was very comfortable, the air conditioning was nice and cool and the bathroom shower was lovely. The hotel has an ample room service menu  and room service was prompt. Location is ideal just blocks from Royal Albert  Hall , adjacent to kensington gardens and Hyde Park and a short walk to High Street Kensington Underground and High street shopping and dining. Several bus lines stop in front of hotel making the rest of London accessible for tourist destinations.",4,2017,05,31
133,Beware the sofa bed,"This is the 2nd time I've used the Royal Garden Hotel, overall it is an excellent property, with great service. I was thrilled to use it again.....BUT.....on this stay, we used a King size room that had a sofa bed.....never again. Sofa beds aren't known for being comfortable but this was ridiculous. I considered sleeping on the floor!!! They brought in a rollaway that truly wasn't much better, but we piled the sofa bed mattress under the rollaway mattress the first night and it made it bearable, however sadly the maid removed it for the 2nd night.....I complained to the management hoping to get some kind of credit, but alas, it fell on deaf ears. It's a very expensive hotel, but centrally located (right on Kensington High Street next to the park), but I felt they dropped the ball on the whole sofa bed experience. Too bad :(",4,2017,05,31
133,Beware Booking.com they are liars and cheats,"Great hotel, extremely busy but the booking.com website is phoney and I recommend not using it. They falsely advertise prices and room sizes and have extremely uninformed and rude staff on their phone lines who lie to you.",4,2017,05,31
133,Jim MK,"Hotel was ideally located for the park and Albert Hall, plus close to places to eat, and good quality, and convenient that car park is next door.
Also close to tube station, enjoyed the walks in the park, and the fact our room had a garden view.",4,2017,05,31
133,Amazing Location.,"Amazing location but the rooms are tired and not at all a 5 star. Nothing was outstanding about this hotel. Bedding was rough and scratchy. It has the ability to be a 5 star, just needs the rooms to be renovated and better bedding.",3,2017,05,30
133,Very good experience,"We very much like the hotel. The staff is very friendly and forthcoming.

This time the bathroom could have been cleaner (limescale) and the staff at breakfast was not as flexible as previously. But otherwise a great place we always like to come back to.",4,2017,05,30
133,A port in the storm," Our flight was cancelled and after an exhausting 7 hours in line at Heathrow, this place was so warm and welcoming and lovely to land at!! We were most grateful
 and would have stayed longer, except that we were ready to fly home.",5,2017,05,30
133,"Very good, convenient location and clean","Friendly staff, good shopping facilities and convenient parking.Would have appreciated discounted parking.Rooms clean and service efficient. We need discounted parking to keep cst of staying in London down to reasonable levels.",4,2017,05,30
133,weekend in London,"The hotel is in a great location for the parks and museums. 5 minutes from the Tube station for travelling around London. Staff were very friendly, Nice room, wide variety of choice for breakfast and good place for a nightcap after going out in the evening. 
",5,2017,05,30
133,Weekend in London,"A amazing hotel, very clean, amazing staff very helpful and really wonderful breakfast and a perfect location for travelling around London. Best hotel in London definitely recommend it. We had the garden view rooms and the views were just stunning of Hyde park and Kensington Palace. We were able to have some early morning and mid afternoon walks there due to such close access from this hotel. ",5,2017,05,30
133,Fantastic!!! Brilliant place to stay! ,We had just arrived from Australia and this was our first stop! We could not have asked for a better hotel! The location was brilliant and the staff were so helpful and accommodating!   Thankyou for attending to us and treating us so warmly during our time with you!! Highly recommended to everyone!! The hotel rooms and facilities were brilliant including access to a good gym. Breakfast was amazing!! We would come back just to stay here!! Thankyou!! ,5,2017,05,29
133,room with a view,"We've stayed here before, also in a 'garden room' with a great view of Kensington gardens. The room is spacious and comfortable, with a good bathroom. They should get the cleaners to rub the shower head to unclog from calcium carbonate deposits, but I was able to do this to get maximum flow. There seems to be a shortage of HD channels on the TV. Receptionist on arrival was excellent, friendly and efficient. The receptionist on check-out was efficient enough, but not particularly friendly, didn't smile, didn't ask how our stay was, and didn't close the check-out with a ""thank-you, hope to see you again"", and I had to ask ""are we done"". Not good enough,certainly for a 5-star hotel. Door staff were very good too, greeting and offering help with luggage etc.",4,2017,05,29
133,Most fantastic hotel with most fantastic service in London!,"From Jimmy and Karol who meet you at the front door, every single person working at the RGH makes your stay most pleasurable! 
Even after the BA chaos, it was wonderful to come home to the RGH and feel the biggest relief and experience an instant sense of comfort. Everything is under control again. And nothing to worry about until the next flight. 
Thank you to everyone at the Royal Garden Hotel! X",5,2017,05,29
133,Home from home in London,"I have been staying at RGH for many years, and it has always been good to me. Driving into the parking lot can be a nightmare, buy with the help of the very helpful doormen Darius and Jimmy I was able to park with no problem this trip. I do think that ""quiet please"" signs could be erected in the elevator lobbies at night, because I was woken every night by inconsiderate neighbors at 2am. The rooms are in need of an upgrade, looking a little tired.",5,2017,05,28
133,Good choice for High St Kensington Area,"The rooms are comfortable, breakfasts were good. Guests can use the small but well equipped commercial gym in the same building. Service was attentive, efficient and friendly. Only let down was the meal in the normal restaurant, where good ingredients were cooked somewhat indifferently.",4,2017,05,28
133,Wonderful visit,"I thoroughly enjoyed everything about the Royal Garden Hotel, and look forward to returning. The staff was exceptionally warm, friendly and competent.  Afternoon tea at the Park Terrace was a highlight.",5,2017,05,28

Beautiful location ideal for tourists and business men alike.
Breakfast was excellent. Staff very welcoming and helpful
Would certainly recommend this hotel to others",5,2017,05,28
133,Midweek stay,An excellent experience at an excellent hotel.  Would be very happy to recommend to others and to stay there again.  Staff were helpful and friendly service was excellent & the food delicious.  Thank you to all the staff for their care and attention. ,5,2017,05,28
133,Chelsea flowers,We had a fantastic two night stay whilst visiting the Chelsea flower show. The hotel was excellent as always and the staff went out of their way to show that nothing was too much trouble. The view over Kensington palace was breathtaking. ,5,2017,05,27
133,Best Hotel location in London,"Overall very happy with our experience, wish the rooms would be a little larger and the closet. Not enough space for 2 people. There is no outlet in the bathroom for  the dryer which makes it an inconvenience. Service and staff very professional.",5,2017,05,27
133,The Most Welcoming Hotel In London,"I have been staying at the Royal Garden for 25 years . Its location , the staff , the service and quality of the rooms have always been excellent. The Chinese restaurant overlooking the park is also excellent and nothing like an early morning walk in the adjacent Kensington Gardens to start your day!",5,2017,05,27
133,Our booking was changed and the breakfast is not worth ¬£25 per head.,"We'd booked a quiet double queen room. We were told by reception the booking had been changed. Not by us. To a twin room on the front. In the end we had to accept a twin room on the back.
The breakfast is not worth the price. The cooked breakfast was deliver just warm and looked like it had been sitting around before it was delivered. The eggs were hard. We should have sent it back.",3,2017,05,27
133,Splendid,The Location on The Westens of Kensington Garden and the start point of High Street Kensington is perfect. Excellent diner in the 10th floor restaurant. Splendid view on the Hydepark. Perfect access to public transportation. ,5,2017,05,27
133,5star stay,"We only stayed here for 2 nights but we loved this hotel. The staff were exceptional, very professional and super helpful. We left our bags with the hotel so we could go over to Paris for a couple of days which we greatly appreciated. On our return we were upgraded to a suite which was fabulous. We ate in the hotel restaurant which was great. We had our 8 yo with us and everyone made him feel very welcome. On our last night we had Chinese in the restaurant on level 10 - this is a must! Food, views and service 11 out of 10. This hotel is in a great spot, beautiful location next to the gardens and also train and shops at your door. Loved it - we'll be back. ",5,2017,05,26
133,Impeccable service,"We usually stay at The Soho Hotel when we visit London but decided that as we were attending an event at  The Royal Albert Hall we would try and find something closer. We usually stay in boutique 5 star hotels and were not expecting much from.this hotel but it is really lovely. The young lady who checked us in Catia was really pleasant and when she realised it was a birthday trip she upgraded us to a lovely room with a view of The Palace. After popping out for something to eat we came back to find a bottle of wine and a lovely note from her wishing us a wonderful evening. The service is excellent. The staff including the room maids are friendly and courteous. The rooms are lovely, well equipped and immaculate. Nothing is too much trouble. I really don't think I would have got better service staying in a ¬£500 per night hotel. Really very impressed ",5,2017,05,26
133,Top class in London,"A true 5-star experience!
We enjoyed the spacious Garden Rooms overlooking Kensington Gardens and London Skyline which is worth the extra cost. And by far the best breakfast we have ever had at a hotel.

",5,2017,05,26
133,Good location and friendly stuff,"Food in room not tasty, I asked to change my room as it is not as I requested online, I only got promises but no serious action took place, AC needs maintenance, no water complimentary in the room, over all it's fine for very short sty",3,2017,05,26
133,5 days in London,"We enjoyed our stay at the Royal Garden. Without exception, all of the hotel staff was friendly and helpful (I appreciated the offer to check me in early after arriving on an overnight flight from the Vancouver). Great view from our 7th floor room overlooking the park and palace. Location was very convenient. If you are less than 6' in height you will have to climb over the tub wall (it is quite high). Our only disappointment was with the hardness of the bed and flimsiness of the pillows. We did ask for a couple more which turned out to be much better. All in all, I would certainly stay here again. ",4,2017,05,25
133,Great location next to the park,"Stayed here as I have stayed before. Great for a morning walk in Kensington park next door. Close to tube station and good eating places. 
Staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms are large. I like the step up to a longer with large open windows. Shower I found hard to get in and out of. (I'm tall and slim) and I struggled. 
Other than that great hotel.
I will be back! ",4,2017,05,25
133,Best of all worlds.,"Stayed few times and think the friendly service and quality of the Royal Garden is unmatched by any others.  Perfect location with Shopping, restaurants and Kensington Palace Gardens.  Easy access from Paddington and Victoria if flying to Heathrow or Gatwick. ",5,2017,05,24
133,Anniversary dinner and overnight stay,"Our room was large and very comfy. We overlooked the high street. The traffic was really busy but we didn't hear it. We had all the normal luxuries of mini bar, we only wanted the tea making stuff but we were just happy knowing it was all there. Little things like having hangers that were removable and not on those silly metal connecting hooks and of course a night safe which is invaluable these days. Dinner was in the Park restaurant, we had organised that well in advance. Cocktail was nice, food lovely. Service, as always was excellent. A lovely time on our 6th year of celebrating there.",5,2017,05,24
133,Great Hotel,"We've been coming here for more than 15 years, and still very satisfied!  Centrally located, Whole Foods close by if you need something, Kensington Palace just behind the hotel. The concierge is the greatest!",5,2017,05,24
133,Room with a view,"Perfect location - close to Kensington Gardens and Kensington High street, large rooms, friendly staff. The hotel had everything we wanted except for a nice bar area after 11 pm. We specially liked the chinese restaurant on 10th floor.    ",5,2017,05,23
133,Great location maybe skip breakfast?,"This is about the sixth time we have stayed at the hotel. It's in a great location and you can always be sure of polite, friendly and helpful staff. This trip we stayed for 3 nights. as always room was comfortable and hotel was very clean and well presented. Nearly everything was great. Only problem was breakfasts. We didn't include in our booking to give us flex-ability. We did have breakfast on the Sunday but after being sat in the window in direct sunlight and being reminded by our waitress about 5 times that breakfast wasn't included and we would have to pay I did feel as if they thought we may do a runner. Breakfast on Monday morning was better but we were again told several times breakfast wasn't included and we would have to pay, by the same waitress who told us the previous day, you would have thought we had caught on by now! It also took us about 10 minutes and asking 3 times to get some butter to go with our toast. Would go to this hotel again but I think I would use as a base and skip breakfasts next time.",4,2017,05,23
133,A nice place and nice staff,"its a nice hotel, located in a lovely area. Its near hyde park, and a lot of shops and cafes are around.  Staff are freindly. The room is clean and arranged nicely. Bathroom is clean. It was a lovely and comfortable stay. ",5,2017,05,23
133,A Royal stay at the Royal Garden Hotel,"A wonderful hotel with wonderful friendly staff.  I recommend this hotel to everyone staying in the Kensington area.  The room was clean, very comfortable and had an amazing view of the Kensington Gardens.",5,2017,05,23
133,stunning location & views,the room was great with views over London and the Min Jiang had stunning views over Kensington park with service that was second to none and our after concert drink in the bar was a treat will have to book again for the next visit to albert hall,5,2017,05,23
133,Seminar crumbs,"Attended a week long seminar here.
Hotel very nice but facilities totally unsuitable for purpose.
300 people trying to train communication skills in a room dimly lit snd and terribly noisy was hopeless.
More the fault of money grabbing organisers than the hotel. However teas and coffee supplied were a bit stingy and no where near fast enough, hot enough nor were there enough biscuits. Some times there were none!",3,2017,05,22
133,My recent stay,"I love the location of the hotel and the spacious executive rooms. My only complaint is the lack of a proper coffee machine in the room.  Breakfast is ok but not great. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Overall, I like the hotel, but I wish they put coffee machines in their executive rooms ",4,2017,05,22
133,Lovely hotel,So nice to find such a lovely hotel in the heart of London - its like a serene green oasis - the view from my room was of Kensington palace - it was fabulous. I found all the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful and the dinner was delicious ,5,2017,05,22
133,"Nice hotel, lacking in some key cleanliness issues.","The hotel itself is nice, rooms are small but adequate, but the hotel fails to meet some basic cleanliness requirements of a 5 star property.

To start off with, i stayed there for 4 nights and I did not get a single towel that wasn't either stained, overused, yellowing/graying instead of white, stained, distorted, etc. Not a single towel over 4 nights was white and clean.

Further, I asked for a fresh pair of towels and a dental kit on my first night, and honest to God they both arrived me with a big bloody booger smeared across the dental kit as well as on the towel. Like someone has just picked their nose and wiped on the box and towel. Disgusting.

Lastly, the minibar wasn't working in the room.",3,2017,05,22
133,A wonderful Experience,"A short walk from High Street Ken underground, the hotel overlooks Hyde Park and rooms on high floor overlook Kensington Palace so it feels very tranquil in a bustling area. Standard of catering for our group in the Park Terrace was superb and the prices very reasonable for Central London. Every member of staff was helpful, polite and friendly. You get the feeling people enjoy working here and are looked after. A great hotel.
",5,2017,05,21
133,Great Stay,"This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at. The room was clean and staff would come 3 x per day to clean rooms; the service was impeccable, the staff were very nice and helpful. A wonderful experience.",5,2017,05,21
133,Royal Treatment,"Another great stay. Marcus in the restaurant, along with the rest of the staff, took really good care of us. The Royal Garden is, for us, THE place to stay in London. A discount for regular visitors is missing. Watch your tipping/bill in the Chinese restaurant though... ",5,2017,05,19
133,Great location!,"Superb location, superb staff and superb rooms! We have stayed here numerous times and are never disappointed. You are made to feel valued as soon as you enter the hotel.  Be sure to include the breakfast as it is well worth it!  We an't wait to return!",5,2017,05,18
133,Perfect hotel for walking the parks and into London,"We were treated to luxury at this 5 star hotel, the food, drinks and service was impeccable and nothing was too much trouble. We needed to drive to London on this occasion and the hotel is outside the congestion zone and has valet parking in the underground car park so no worries about finding so where to park or security.",5,2017,05,18
133,Birthday treat,"I had such a lovely stay, we were there celebrating a friend's birthday and both had the best time. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and welcoming and taking the time to make sure we were looked after. Particularly Patrick de le Mar and Mick Lynch, whose added touches really made our stay extra special :). We had a brilliant room on the 5th floor overlooking Hyde Park, the views were fantastic! It was great returning to our room after our night out to a thoughtful turn down service too. It's these little extra touches that we really appreciated. I would love to return and will definitely recommend to my friends and family. Thank you all!! Best wishes, Jasmine",5,2017,05,18
133,Harry Potter,"Had a fantastic weekend in London to see Harry Potter at the Royal Albert Hall. We stayed at the RGH and were very pleased with the staff, surroundings, food etc... All to a very high standard, they could not do enough for us. We also managed to get an upgrade to a suite which made it extra special - will definately be back to sample the oriental restaurant on the top floor! Breakfasts were very special.",5,2017,05,17
133,Beautiful hotel,"Beautiful spotless room overlooking the park.  V comfortable bed, good hot shower.
Lovely breakfast, also had dinner here and that too was very good
Staff very attentive and not intrusive
Will be my favourite hotel to stay at for business from now on
",5,2017,05,17
133,Sight seening in London,"Great hotel, great staff, viery nice rooms. Within walking distance to a lot of major sites, Kensington palace and gardens, Hyde park,Natural History Museum, Science Museum, Victoria & Albert Museum, Buckingham Palace and some of the best high end shops around. A tube station is a block away so you can travel around London.",5,2017,05,17
133,Another pleasant stay,Spent a week at the hotel. Staff are a real pleasure and we were made to feel very welcome. The location is fantastic for our needs being both access to the city for work and social needs after hours. Will return shortly ,4,2017,05,17
133,Wonderful Hotel!,"So much to recommend the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington.  First, that it's in Kensington and the Garden is right outside the window.  The Holland Garden is down the block, stunning.  Food of every stripe within walking distance.  Especially lovely: Kitchen W8 just a few blocks away. Hotel staff is delightful, helpful.  Beds huge and comfortable (not so easy to find a reasonably priced king bed in London!).  Our room was beautifully laid out with a living area up a few steps, sofa desk and huge window over the garden.  Soundproofed rooms!  How delightful and how quiet.  A gym (which, sadly, we never got to). Wonderful restaurant overlooking the park, great coffee.  What was there not to love?  Still wishing I were there.",5,2017,05,17
133,"A Pleasant, Comfortable Stay Every Time","I just finished my fifth visit on business and the hotel continues to impress.  Perfect location near the High Street Kensington Tube stop making for a quick trip in from Heathrow Airport (1 train change).   Staff is pleasant and helpful. The rooms vary in size and even the smallest of rooms will accommodate 2 persons.  Rooms offer a single 110 plug for those in from the States. There is also a USB charge port.  

Rooms clean and comfortable with in room coffee/tea service and refrigerator.  

There are plenty of restaurants for quick or casual dining nearby and a Starbucks across the street. Shopping is everywhere as you would expect.  Stores for snacks and sodas nearby also.  

The menu for breakfast at the hotel is OK.  The buffet is a bit boring; however, you can order a substantial meal off the menu.  

I recommend the hotel for both business and personal travel.  The location is great and in a safe walking location. You can explore for miles.  ",4,2017,05,16
133,Fabulous Staff,"Beautiful hotel, great staff and overall comfort superb. Breakfasts are not as good as you'd hope for a 5 star hotel, but still a wonderful place to stay when visiting London. Celeb hotspot too and I'm not surprised!",5,2017,05,16
133,Lovely friendly hotel,"Loved our garden room, good-size, nicely organised, bathroom great. Couldn't find the coffee maker, not sure whether there was one! Everything was neatly stowed away. Kids had a rucksack of activities given to them and Scooter s were available to borrow. Park is right next door and we explored 3 royal parks whilst we were there! Lots of good food options nearby.",5,2017,05,16
133,Anniversary Stay.,"I booked a stay with The Royal Garden Hotel to begin celebrations for our Silver Wedding Anniversary. I booked a room which was on a special offer deal and was very happy with the choice. After receiving an email from the wonderful May, from the reservations team, I was offered a list of complimentary goodies to choose from and the possibility of a complimentary room Upgrade. I was not expecting the Upgrade as it was subject to rooms available.

When we arrived we were greeted by staff and immediately felt comfortable. The check in staff were delightful and very helpful. We did receive an upgrade to a King Garden Room which we were very thankful for. 

When we returned from an evening out we found the most beautiful and thoughtful touches to our room which included an Anniversary Card, a platter of chocolates with the words ""Happy Anniversary"" in chocolate, a fruit platter and water (which had been chosen from the complimentary goodies list) We were very touched by this gesture and made our whole stay a very pleasant one.

We cannot thank the staff enough for their hospitality and the Hotel is a complete joy. I will be recommending the Hotel to everyone. 5* all the way. 

Thank you so much.

Mr and Mrs Seekings. ",5,2017,05,15
133,Another Glorious Stay,"I return again and again to the RG on business and with family and can freely confess that I am firmly hooked on this hotel.  It just ticks so very many of my boxes: location, warm, accommodating and friendly staff from check in to concierge desk to room service to operators to the excellent round the clock business centre staff; great food (room service and Min Jiang especially), air miles, business centre and the cosy modern comfort of the room and add ons.  On this particular trip our usual good experience was only enhanced by our room upgrade to a garden room. And now you get automatic and not just free wifi which is great!",5,2017,05,14
133,"Perfect location, wonderful Hotel","Stayed recently at the Hotel. Location was perfect, staff very friendly and breakfast delicious.
Nothing was too much bother when we asked for advice from any of the staff. Customer service officer Christine was very friendly when we checked in.",5,2017,05,14
133,My review can be rated as excellent,"No recommendations. Everything was great. This included the receptionists, the concierges, the personnel at the business office and the porters. The location of the your hotel is an important factor to consider. Not only is it central we're

As I pointed out in this survey everything was superb. ""Everything"" included the room service, the receptionists, the concierges, the personnel at the business offices, the porters. I would like to first focus on the concierges and the business office.  I had a problem with my airline reservation. Although I had a reservation nowadays it is not considered if a seat is not reserved and I had not reserved a seat. They went way out of their way in helping me reserve a seat with British Airways. In as much as food is concerned we experienced the breakfast and the Chinese restaurant. Both were excellent. The breakfast was standard a type we get in top notch hotels. The duck in the Chinese restaurant was delicious. The service in both restaurants was very good. Coming to the location of the hotel, it is central. There are all sorts of stores surrounding the hotel. Shopping that my wife who was with me loves to shop and this made it easy for her. Moreover, transportation to areas other than Kinsington such as Knightsbridge was easy despite the heavy traffic

",5,2017,05,13
133,business travel in Kensington,"Love the location - right on Kensington High street near shops, easy access to everything, good wifi signal. Small rooms as always for London hotels, friendly helpful staff, great door staff to help you get taxis",4,2017,05,12
133,Friendly environment and perfect location,"Royal Garden Hotel enjoys a lovely view over Hyde Park and it is just within one step to the Kensington Palace. Warm welcome and friendly environment are present throughout our 3-night-stay no matter where you are either in the Garden Terrance restaurant, at the reception, asking help from the concierge or Minjiang Restaurant at the 10th floor. ",4,2017,05,12
133,Wonderful hotel and staff,"I am a frequent traveler, for business and pleasure.  This was my first time here and it was terrific.  It's chic and conveniently located.  The housekeeping staff took very good care of us.  But it was the charming Christina who made this stay so memorable.  She greeted us with a warm and friendly smile and went out of her way to make sure that our stay was easy and special.  Those types of first impressions count, and we will definitely return.",5,2017,05,11
133,Conference guest at the Royal Garden Hotel,"Rooms were great, the view spectacular and hotel food good. My only criticism is the bar in the conference area was very slow,  with staff who seemed uncertain and supervisors, when alerted to the woefully slow service, were unconcerned.",5,2017,05,11
133,Great hotel,Stayed here for 1 night for a work conference and i have to say the food was great.  Rooms are nice and comfortable.  Great location also so if you need a hotel in London and budget isn't tight give this place a try,5,2017,05,11
133,THE place to stay in London,Perfect location.  Staff are warm and caring.  Magnificent rooms and the restaurants/bars are all first class.  Tube station nearby.  Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park offer so much. Mn Jiang is as good a restaurant as you will find anywhere in the world.,5,2017,05,11
133,Great location - very friendly staff,"My partner and I were staying for a conference at this hotel.  Staff very friendly and helpful, and room very clean and comfortable.  wasn't disturbed at all in the night, which was a real bonus for me as I normally find I get quite broken sleep in noisy hotels.  Well located for restaurants close by, if you choose not to eat in the hotel.",5,2017,05,11
133,Conference ,"I recently stayed at this hotel for a work conference, so no choice in the hotel we stayed at. The location is great, not even 5 minutes from the main shopping street and tube station, so the location is perfect (and what you pay for). I was allocated a smoking room, which isn't great when I don't smoke, the hotel was full that night so no way of asking for a change. Breakfast in the morning was good and great that you can get it delivered to your room for no additional charge. I wouldn't stay here out of choice but it does the job for a conference hotel.",3,2017,05,10
133,Best stay ever in London,My wife and I took a long weekend break in London and our stay in the Royal Garden Hotel was great. The staff is friendly and provide a very high level of service. The view of the park is great. Very close to subway and busses. ,5,2017,05,10
133,Excellent experience,"Our stay at the hotel has been a very good experience overall. Very welcoming staff, nice rooms en excellent service. We attended a conference which was also very well organized and supported by the hotel. Highle recommended",5,2017,05,10
133,good,"Very good good personal good location very good servisewe want to thank the hotel staff for a good stay,next time will definitely stay at your hotel and will recommend to all our friends,We loved the view of the garden,walking in the Royal garden",4,2017,05,09
133,"Great, but keep away from street view rooms",All good except noise from street. Double glazing non-existent. Too much noise from traffic and street protests. Breakfast excellent but over-priced at ¬£25. Bertie's Bar very good but short on seating at times - bar service is unobtrusive and slow.,4,2017,05,09
133,Perfect Hotel,"The comfort and location of the hotel are outstanding. I will definitely come back to this hotel next time I'll be in London. Beautiful lobby and rooms, excellent breakfast and very clean room. I liked the fact that there was a real hairdryer in the room rather than one of those fixed ones in the bathroom that you may as well not use. The only issue I had was that there was only one outlet in the room, so charging the phone and using the hairdryer at the same time was not possible. 
The location is absolutely perfect for shopping, eating out, and going for a morning run in the Park. The hotel is much better than other hotels of the same category I have stayed in in London before. ",5,2017,05,09
133,Fabulous,"Lovely hotel, worth the extra for a garden view, helpful and friendly staff.
Fantastic location, some excellent local restaurants including the The Ivy Kensington and walking distance to the Albert Hall where we were going to a concert. Car parking a bit pricey but it's London! 
A discount for hotel users would be nice? ",5,2017,05,09
133,Lovely hotel,"Friendly and helpful attitude. The breakfast was absolutely delicious. The rooms were spacious and being a Family travelling together, the hotel arranged rooms for us next to each other. The location is excellent! We will definitly return!",5,2017,05,08
133,Excellent hotel in great location.,Stayed on business for two nights. This hotel is excellent and in a great location. I will return with my family for a holiday. The staff where very attentive at all times and although a large hotel had plenty time for all the guests it seemed.,5,2017,05,08
133,"good location, great breakfasts",good 4 star hotel in a great location at Kensington Palace. The rooms are quite small but nice. Bus stops right outside the door to Trafalgar Square and tube station is a 5 minute walk. Very good breakfast. Couple of nice pubs and restaurants within walking distance.,4,2017,05,08
133,Royal Garden Repeat Visit,This was probably the 6th or 7th visit to the Royal Garden Hotel and it has never disappointed. The staff were very welcoming and seem to do their best to make sure that you enjoy the whole experience.,5,2017,05,08
133,Quality of design,"The quality of functionality in a room for disability when sick, needs attention! Nothing 'emergency' was functional. The care however was excellent. A First Aider was at hand but more for psychological trauma and support. I was fortunate to not need serious medication but over the counter Imodium was not available or offered. This sadly forced me to stay in bed. Missing a very important meeting. ",5,2017,05,08
133,Nice but nothing special,"Nice and clean place to stay with welcoming staff but don't expect anything special.
Recommended for its conviniency if your staying in the area but not charming at all.
Reasonable value for money but not particularly a good deal.
Also very oriented towards middle east clientele and all it supposes...",3,2017,05,08
133,Under-whelmed,"Checkin in was made very difficult and room wasn't ready, kept waiting whilst they eventually sorted it out. Credit card was taken from my view for an imprint !!!! Not what you expect form a 5 star London Hotel !",3,2017,05,08
133,"Lovely hotel, but service poor","The accommodation was very nice, but try to get a room at the back of the hotel as Kensington High St is noisy. Service was the worse I have experienced in London and more than one case of poor interaction. ",2,2017,05,08
133,Did they think I was a VIP?,During my whole stay I kept wondering if somehow the staff all thought I was a VIP or someone famous - they certainly made me feel like I was! I have stayed in hundreds of fine hotels round the world but I don't think I have ever been made to feel like everyone knew who I was and that I was the  most important guest in the hotel. Very Impressive! Overall just excellence - can highly recommend,5,2017,05,08
133,Best 5 stars we've ever been to,"The hotel in nothing imoressive from the outside, but the service we experienced was awesome.
We stayed at the execitive suite, it was lovely, the lady who checked us in came with us to the rrom to explain to us every detail about the rrom.
The bed was extra comfortable, the housekeepers were present morning and evening, 
I was impressed but the number of concierge and how hejpful they were.
The hotel is very well situated on High Kensington street, just next to Kensinton Gardens, 5 minutes walk from the tube and where buses and taxis are at the hotel entrance.
We were there with the family, and everybody enjoyed the stay. 
Breakfast is excellent. The chinese restaurant on the top floor is one of the best chinese food I have experienced.
The street is very animated and has many many restaurants and stores.
Highly recommend",5,2017,05,07
133,Comfortable but a little corporate,We enjoyed an extremely comfortable king sized room for a brief overnight London stay recently. The staff at this hotel are efficient and the room was well appointed. Altogether good value if you don't mind the somewhat corporate atmosphere and want to be close to Hyde Park and Kensington high street.,5,2017,05,07
133,Super Stay!,"Nice hotel, friendly and professional staff, top quality services and excellent position in London. Very convenient for walks, to shops, pubs and restaurants. Also, with the park close by,  it's a great place for jogging. Will definitely choose it again.",5,2017,05,07
133,Friendly staff and great rooms,"Really great base for our trip to the Royal Albert Hall. Our room was a good size, comfy king bed and it was nice and quiet. 

Whilst we couldn't upgrade on the day they did do send up some chocolates to celebrate our anniversary. 

Really helpful and friendly staff. Would definitely stay again.  ",4,2017,05,07
133,Birthday trip,All perfect great location and easy parking. I am planning to make this my usual  hotel when I stay in London . I found the staff particularly pleasant . I also liked the heating system and the fact that we coulf open a window at night for some fresh air,5,2017,05,07
133,Great location!,"Lovely hotel and service was great! Staff made us feel welcome and there were some lovely extra touches for a friend's birthday. We also got interconnecting rooms as requested. Breakfast was lovely - staff were very attentive and the food was good. 
Only minor niggle was the cleanliness of the bedding for the sofa bed. ",4,2017,05,07
133,Bit disappointing for 5 star hotel,Hotel stay was mostly a pleasant experience but feel more attention should be given to reception area on a regular basis to ensure rubbish is collected and toilets inspected. At no time during our stay did we see a cleaner in these areas. ,3,2017,05,06
133,Not a pleasant stay,"Below expected standards 
The room was not clean enough while checking 
The beds and pillows were very uncomfortable 
The location, meanwhile, was an advantage of the hotel
The hotel is still considered old",1,2017,05,06
133,Relaxation with top quality hotel and staff,"Wonderful and professional experience all round - can highly recommend. Location, facilities, convenience, such a personal welcome by Arron making all the difference to customer care. Lovely and shall certainly be returning. Thank you! ",5,2017,05,06
133,nice and comfort,Nice place nice location nice service best for famely speacaly arbian gulf famely..big room batter than most hotel room in london behaind best garden keingeston garden ...every shop u need neer the hotel so u dont have to walk mauch,5,2017,05,06
133,GREAT LOCATION,Fantastic location next to the park and walking distance from many spots in London including Knightsbridge. My room had a great park view (well worth it) and the room very clean with amazingly comfortable bed. Very sound proof too which is brilliant - no listening to the next room' s plumbing!!!   Breakfast only ok but if stayed again would go to the Muffin Man a few minutes walk away.  Concierge lovely and helpful.,4,2017,05,06
133,Very nice with few flaws,"The royal garden hotel is amazing but connecting to wifi is hard room service took a while the key had to be canceled because we got locked out. The food was great and we have stayed there many times the pull out bed was hard to get out because the housekeeping never came after we called.  Since my family is large we needed connecting  rooms we called the front desk but no one came to unlock it but eventually someone came 

Again we loved this hotel and hope to be back 2018 ",4,2017,05,05
133,"excellent -  but restaurant service is ""variable""","Expensive but good quality hotel - great room, bed very easy to sleep in. all quiet all night... but restaurant experience clearly varies - dependent upon who is running the floor - 1st evening I felt like a king - 2nd evening (different staff) I felt like a criminal ....",4,2017,05,05
133,Excellent stay!,"Attended a workshop and conference. Excellent service, friendly staff and and overall great experience during my 7 day stay. I can recommend this hotel to anyone who needs to be in the Kensington area. ",5,2017,05,05
133,Great location,"Staff really go out of their way to make you feel welcome. Graet location for in and out of London trips, as well as for a nice walk through Kensington Gardens and Holland Park. Transport facilities very nearby with busstop in front of the hotel and Underground at three minutes walk.",4,2017,05,05
133,Excellent,"But the welcoming by the front desk was not that much other wise every thing was excellent 
I would certinlnly recommend the hotel for my Freind and my next visit .But I would like to make the welcoming staff from the front desk better",5,2017,05,05
133,Not a lot better than this Hotel,"From the minute we arrived to the moment we left it was a fantastic experience, we where upgraded to a suite overlooking Hyde Park which was stunning, the staff where friendly and attentive and very helpful from the Reception staff, concierges to the cleaners ",5,2017,05,04
133,well positioned and proportioned rooms,Nice hotel with extremely friendly & helpful staff which make up for the tired decor. Quietest rooms are at the east side or rear overlooking the park; floors 6 and above have superb views over to the city skyline. This hotel is well positioned for all Kensington and Knightsbridge activities although has to have one of the worst proportioned car-parks in town: absolutely do not use if you have a wide car or value your wheels. Remember to request non-smoking if preferred. Very comfortable beds.,4,2017,05,03
133,International Conference,"The staff surpassed the fantastic facilities- what tolerance! Efficient, charming and tirelessly helpful, the hotel didn't miss a beat and delivered it's usual standard of excellent service. Quite a feat to protect every guest when 1,000 Therapists descend.....",4,2017,05,03
133,Superb,"Returning to a hotel where you have previously had an outstanding stay can often prove disappointing. Not the case at the Royal Garden Hotel. Consistently good on all levels. Food, drinks, staff, room, comfort - superb. Location could not be better. ",5,2017,05,03
133,Practically perfect.....,"I had the pleasure of 1 nights stay in this superb hotel.  check in fast and efficient....room spotless, comfortable and luxurious.  Ate in Chinese restaurant on 10 floor...sublime.  breakfast faultless.  Overall I cannot recommed this hotel enough,  great location.",5,2017,05,03
133,Excellent hotel for families,"We took our two children (1 year old boy and 3 year old girl) to London for the bank holiday weekend for their first taste of the city. Having usually only had to find hotels for myself and my husband in London I was a bit unsure where to start when looking for a family friendly hotel in London; however I stumbled across an article about the hotel in a newspaper mentioning the family packages that they had started to offer so decided to give the hotel a try. So so glad that we did. The hotel was fab and very accommodating of the family. Upon checking in both children were presented with a backpack full of items to keep them busy - colouring in books and crayons, a drinks bottle, a torch. The backpacks went down brilliantly with them as did the fact that you can hire a micro scooter from the concierge desk and go for a ride around the park that's right next door. The hotel was in a brilliant location to visit the science museum and national history museum - both easily walkable. Staff at the hotel were all lovely and very helpful. Now onto our room - we were very pleasantly surprised when we opened the door to our hotel room to see that we had been upgraded to a suite - it was amazing so much space and we all loved it / although now we have to hope that the kids don't expect hotel rooms to be like that all the time!! All in all an excellent trip and we would have no hesitation in staying at the hotel again on a future trip to London or in recommending it to others. ",5,2017,05,02
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"On Kensington High St.
Close to Kensington Gardens.
Excellent large room and large ensuite with luxury toiletries.

We never stayed here.",5,2017,05,02
133,Service of the Highest Standard,"A wonderful location, attentive, efficient and highly professional staff committed to making your stay wonderful. Every aspect of the Park View Suite was exceptional from the heated flooring in the bathroom to the space to stretch out and the wonderful views over the park. The only slight negative was that we could hear and feel very faintly the bass coming from the nightclub attached to the hotel - this did disturb the process of falling asleep but was in the main incidental to the overall package on offer. A highly recommended hotel that I will definitely be re-visiting on my next London stay ",5,2017,05,02

133,London Getaway,"Stay here every time I come to London great location close to everything staff are very professional, my only negative would be that guests stand right outside the enterance and smoke ... so gross for anybody entering or leaving the hotel to have to walk through they should have to stand much further away from the building enterance ",5,2017,05,01

133,Best Hotel Ever!!,"We have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world, Royal Garden Hotel in London, by far our favorite! 
We began planning our trip with our local travel agent and her contact person at the hotel, Rachel Henry. Rachel promptly responded to all of our questions and requests. 
Upon arrival we were greeted by our doorman, Joseph,who attended to us and our luggage in an efficient and friendly manner.
As we entered the lobby, we were greeted by the Concierge staff as if we were old friends. Special kudos to Monica, Cedric, Stephen and Hayden. The Concierge staff very helpful in planning day trips, excursions, transportation and dining reservations. Monica escorted us to our lovely Garden Room ( a must do), on the 5th floor overlooking Kensington Gardens. 
The Park Terrace is a beautiful combination restaurant and lounge where we enjoyed breakfast and cocktails. Lunch and dinner also served . The food is delicious! By the way, be sure and include the breakfast package in your room charge. This is an incredible English breakfast each morning. This is available in the Park Terrace Dining Room and in room service 24 hours each day!! The Park Terrace is managed by Bruno, and Cristian assisted by hostess, Liana, and very capable staff, Onofrio, Benedetto, Marco, Nikolett and Cristian. Each member of the staff always had time for us and conveyed an overall feeling of caring and interest. 
Be sure and frequent the bar area in the late pm to enjoy the beautiful piano selections provided by Nina and her daughter! 
In the evening, be sure and visit Bertie's Bar where we were served libations and light snacks by our favorite, barista, Gergo. 
From the time you arrive until the end of your stay, you are treated as if you are family.",5,2017,04,30

Everyone at the hotel was warm & friendly especially Torrie at the reception desk. I've been traveling for many years & Torrie by far was the the most welcoming front desk person I've met. 

Our room was spacious & had a wonderful view of London. Each night the room was turned down with bottled water & soft music playing along with robes & slippers. 

Location was perfect.  Across the street was a Starbucks, grocery store, & places to eat. Had yummy dinners at The Goat Tavern & The Spaghetti House.  Down the street a lovely breakfast at The Ivy & around the corner dinner at Maggie Jones.

133,First Class,"This is an excellent hotel, the staff are very helpful and the rooms are very comfortable.  We had a first floor Garden King Room which overlooks the gardens.  The hotel is close to many restaurants also a five minute walk to the tube and on main bus routes into the heart of the city.

We will return to the Royal Garden Hotel and that is the best recommendation that I can give.",5,2017,04,26
133,Fabulous hotel in brilliant location,"I have stayed at this hotel now three times, and held a large conference here, Every time I stay, I want to come back.

133,Wonderful London Option,"I did enjoy this hotel.  I had a spacious room with a view of High Street.

They had a US power adapter and a USB plug.  Room came with an excellent shower and tub and roomy bathroom.  Bed was very comfortable and I found my room to be very quiet.  There was a sit down vanity that I do my hair and make up at, which I loved.

You can get access to the gym, Anytime Fitness, attached to the hotel.  Decent gym for a hotel.  It does not have everything, but its great while on vacation.

i loved the location of this hotel.  Very close to Kensington Palace, and not far from Notting Hill.  Lots of fabulous shopping on High street and near by.  Close to the tube to get anywhere.  I preferred staying here rather than staying closer to all the tourist sights.  I felt like I got a better feel for London here. 

I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2017,04,25
133,Fabulous suite with amazing views,"Myself and two female friends had a weekend in London and chose this hotel as we were booked to go on the Kensington Palace tour on the Sunday. We couldn't have chosen a better hotel for convenience but we were in awe at the stunning views we had from our suite. We absolutely loved the suite in room 447 and after a stressful week we each found immediate relaxation. The little touches also impressed us on our return from dining out when our sofa bed was made up and the master bed which was enormous was also turned down with bottled water and a glass placed beside each bed. The little touches really do count ! The staff made us feel very comfortable and were extremely helpful and a cocktail or two in Bertie's bar was just perfect.
I had already booked to stay in the hotel in June when I'm attending the Phil Collins concert at the Royal Albert Hall as it's also a convenient stroll for there and I had upgraded to get a garden view so now I know what to expect I am certain I won't be disappointed and neither will my other friend who is with me. I'm almost wishing away the weeks until my return. Thank you for a wonderful time at your hotel.",5,2017,04,25
133,Nice Hotel,"Clean Rooms, Friendly and Supportive Staff, Location is not in city center but close to nice park (Hyde Park and Kensington).

We loved it, can't wait to return",5,2017,04,24
133,London Magic,"A beautiful property. Excellent location next to Kensington Park, with bus stop in front of the hotel and High Street Kensington Station just a couple blocks away.

133,Lovely hotel and great location.,"My husband and myself stopped here recently. It is in a lovely location ,overlooking Kensington gardens and Hyde park. All the staff we dealt with were really nice, very professional,polite etc. The room was overlooking the road, which was fine , we weren't disturbed by traffic noise. The other side would of had better views over the park but we were fine watching the posh cars go up and down the high street. 
The room was lovely, lots of space and super clean bathroom likewise. We ordered room service and it was gorgeous. All in all no complaints a great hotel.",5,2017,04,24
133,Spoil yourself,"Stayed at the Royal Garden as we were attending a concert at the Royal Albert Hall and it's within easy walking distance. The hotel was fantastic, staff very friendly and helpful from check in to check out, room was superb with a king sized bed ensuring a perfect nights sleep. The Breakfast was superb and plentiful. I would thoroughly recommend toe hotel. It is obviously pricey due to its five star rating but if you think you deserve a bit of luxury and want to treat yourself then this is the place.",5,2017,04,24
133,Still our favourite hotel in central London,"This is our 3rd time staying at the hotel and it is fantastic.

A very special weekend in a very special hotel.",5,2017,04,23
133,Still the best hotel in West London,Great service and value for online prepaid special of 157GBP.  Convenient and safe location.

There is bus stop in front of the hotel and the Oyster card is available in small shop beside the hotel ""ask concierge """,5,2017,04,22
133,A great place to stay,"We all know that Kensington is a very nice and prestigious area. The Royal Garden hotel, where we stayed for several days, is very ""strategically"" located at two feet of Kensington garden. 
If you  arrive by car, which was our case, an independent car park is usefully located under the hotel.
After getting out of bed, it is very convenient for running and walking to Hyde park and beyond.
Within the hotel and restaurants, the staff is smiling and, more broadly, very professional. 
Bedrooms are spacious with some fantastic upper views on parks and city's streets. D√©coration is elegant, without any extravagance.
Room service is at the right level in terms of service quality and efficiency. Nevertheless Cesar salad should be served with bacon and Parmesan, even it is 1pM.

Not surprising for this kind of premium hotel, English breakfast is pretty well cooked and served.

Regarding restaurants, 3 options are proposed to satisfy customers expectations:
> ""Ming Jiang"": 
- Chinese food at very high level of creativity and quality (with, on top of the building, a beautiful view over the city)
> ""Terrace Park"": 
- Delicious english food in a more formal frame;
- international dishes in a relaxing ambiance. Good value for money proposal.

To sum-up, we enjoyed a lot our stay in this nice hotel superbly placed, where customer feels first in all circumstances.",4,2017,04,22

133,I really like these guys,"As I have only ever come to this hotel to work, I have a different viewpoint to most.  Although I stay whilst working there (running a conference) I can attest to the fact that their room service breakfasts were always on time and yummy, the housekeeping staff are excellent.  Would not hesitate to recommend on that basis.",4,2017,04,20

He works evening Hottie Hayden.",5,2017,04,20
133,Drinks and dinner - a wonderful night,"My wife and I had a fabulous evening in the lounge and restaurant last weekend. Starting with a couple of fantastic cocktails (including a perfect smokey old fashioned) prepared by the head barman, Onofrio, enjoyed in the relaxed setting of the lounge. We then moved through to the restaurant for an excellent, well priced meal. Delicious fresh bread to start, then scallops followed by duck breast with foie gras for me, beef followed by melt in the mouth lamb for my wife. A very interesting and reasonable wine list, including a c¬£50 2010 Bordeaux which was perfect. Don't be alarmed by the strawberry cheesecake pre-dessert, you get to choose something too (I must confess to doubling down with a different cheesecake). A lovely meal, in great surroundings.  Very attentive service and a 5* night all round. We'll be back!",5,2017,04,19

133,Royal Garden Hotel - an excellent business destination,"Our company booked a business meeting at this hotel in February 2017.  The location is very convenient to Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens and Palace, and other Knightsbridge locations.  The meeting rooms were very suitable, and the hotel room was lovely (but compact), with a splendid view across the gardens.  
The Park Terrace restaurant bar and lounge was very convenient for breakfast and after-hour ""debriefs.""
Hats off to the Concierge desk - they were very skilled and exceptionally courteous.  I was very pleased that they were able to arrange access to the Diana exhibit at Kensington Palace as well as a wonderful high tea at Fortnum and Mason.",4,2017,04,18
133,Great Hotel!,"Would recommend this hotel.  Staff and service were excellent.  Great location.  Everyone at the hotel was very helpful.  Whatever we needed, they were able to provide.  The turn down service was excellent. And the concierge was extremely helpful.  ",5,2017,04,18

Everything about the hotel is 5*, from the friendly staff through to the room through to the restaurant. We were staying for a 50th birthday and the touch of chocolates with a happy birthday sign from the hotel was a very nice touch.

133,Still good value for a 5 star hotel.,Overall a good experience again..We always have a Garden Room as we love the view. *It is also great that you still have Smoking Rooms.

133,Special Place to Stay,"Wonderful Hotel, exceptional welcoming and staff very friendly Great Location with Park on the doorstep as well as the High Street which has everything you could possibly need. I will be returning here on my next trip ",5,2017,04,11
133,A really pleasant experience,"We arrived for afternoon tea a little early and were greeted by a friendly dining room manager ,who showed is to a table just outside the dining area, where we enjoyed cocktails that really tasted of what was stated as being in them,and not the more common watered down variety found in many hotels. Shown to a table next to the large glass window we enjoyed a cream tea better than we have ever experienced. Having chosen from the dozen teas on offer ,we enjoyed sandwiches and scones, all freshly made and served by staff who obviously enjoy what they do. We were offered more of everything ,which is unusual ,but sadly being rather full we had to decline. A great place to go and spoil yourself in elegant surroundings.",5,2017,04,10
133,What a wonderful experience,"I always read reviews but don't tend to leave them ... However I feel compelled to express what a fantastic stay myself, my wife (40th birthday) and my 2 children had this weekend at The Royal Garden Hotel.

From check in to child friendly cocktails in Bertie's Bar the hotel's staff couldn't have been more attentive and helpful. Plus the bonus of an upgrade to a Park Suite with stunning views of Kensington Palace/Gardens and a personalised birthday message made this a really memorable stay.",5,2017,04,10
133,"Nice hotel, service bit poor","Service at the restaurant is poor, takes ages to get a cup of coffee or your ordered eggs. Rooms are ok, fitness is perfect. Location of the hotel is perfect, just right beside Kensington Gardens which caters for a nice walk during the day",3,2017,04,10
133,Excellent location and fantastic view from the room .,Unfortunately the rooms are too small and beds are very narrow 90 -100cms and uncomfortable.. Service staff are friendly and helpful . The breakfast buffet was poor in selection not matching a five star hotel,4,2017,04,10
133,TECC London 2017,It is an very good hotel with dedicated staff and excellent location. The only negative was the breakfast experience. Took way too long to be seated and the whole process was a bit cumbersome. But the food was good. ,4,2017,04,10
133,Hyde park hotel,"Nice hotel in a super location between Kensignton and Hyde Park with Lovely views from the 10th floor Chinese restaurant. Our stay was only let down by the dated d√©cor in the bedroom, hard bed and unsupportive (cheap) pillows)
great location and good service.",4,2017,04,10
133,Great Place and community around,"Very good service from the staff and modern interior furniture in all rooms.  Easy access outside the hotel to shopping, sightseeing, going to park, dining, ..etc.  The lobby is spacious and Gym is fantastics and very big compared to other hotels in London.",4,2017,04,10
133,Good with Few comments,"The hotel is very good in terms of its services, location, friendliness of some staff..etc. But some times when certain policies are not clear with the hotel staff themselves, this may result in confusion with hotel guests.",3,2017,04,09
133,Second to none!,"We were going to use booking.com as we use it often, but we booked directly and what Royal treatment we received! From start to finish nothing was too much, attentive and assertive staff, great lady a check in, very professional, personable and efficient. The room was lovely. Views like that in London are few and far between.
The breakfast lady who was greeting was nice and the breakfast station chef was a true character which was extra special as so often people become robots in hospitality. There were 3 guys in Berties bar again very very good at what they did.. my glass was never empty for long.
The top floor restaurant was delicious and as reviewed so well.. we have to agree.
We are in London most weeks but never stopped this side, be assured we will recommend and we will also be back!
Amazing team which reflects in a truly Amazing hotel.   
All the best!

Excellent service in the restaurant at ground floor. Very clean room, all the services 24/7(important). When I get back to London I'll take a room in this hotel. Thanks.",5,2017,04,08
133,Short stay in London ,"We stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington recently, and we couldn't have been happier with the room, staff, service and the sumptuous breakfast. 

In a casual conversation with the concierge, we mentioned that we were in London for a celebration and were stepping out in the evening for a special meal. 

Well, as we were getting ready there was a knock and there was a chilled bottle of wine and a card with best wishes from the management! This touch was unexpectedly lovely and made our evening even more special.

The hotel is situated close to the high street shops, museums, Royal Albert Hall and of course, Kensington Palace and Gardens.
We are happy to recommend it.",5,2017,04,08
133,Exceeded expectations,"I lived in the area for a number of years but never set foot in the hotel, let alone stayed here. I stayed in April for one night at a conference rather than journey home (i now live in the London suburbs) and was glad i did. I didnt have particularly high expectations but was pleasantly surprised. The room was nice with a good view over the park, the wifi was free and properly quick (20Meg download) and although breakfast was cooked to order it appeared quickly and was good. Nice Penhaligons toiletries in the bathroom - good shower.  Overall a very pleasant, if short, stay.",5,2017,04,06
133,Modern hotel by the Gardens,"This very modern hotel is conveniently  located to the High St. Tube stop on the Circle Line.  The rooms and the restaurant have stunning views of the gardens.  The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.  The cooked breakfast has unbelievable gourmet  choices and is of a quality that you never find in ""breakfast included"" category.  You can visit Kensington Palace every day! 

The negative:  the most uncomfortable hotel bed and pillow that I have ever slept in.  And I am not a sensitive sleeper.  The twin bed is basically a cot on wheels. not even a real bed frame.",4,2017,04,06
133,"Lovely hotel, wonderful location","The Royal Garden is a beautiful, top tier
hotel in a fabulous location. Walk right outside into Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens and down the street to Whole Foods & great shopping in Notting Hill. Excellent nearby transportation too. The rooms are spacious, the staff is helpful

I thought the hotel was lovely. Nice room, good location and professional staff.

133,Very pleasant stay in perfect location,"Clean comfortable double room, might be a bit tight for two people though. Very nice breakfast, friendly staff and perfect location.

133,As good as the first time!!,"Its always a risk when returning to a hotel for the second time after such a lovely stay the first. However, The Royal Garden didn't disappoint and we will certainly return again soon. And as a tip to all the lamb on the room service menu s as good you will find anywhere and cooked to perfection!!",5,2017,03,30
133,Location and More,A secret five star gem.   Central but away from a lot of the hustle and bustle of west/central London. Good staff and great rooms.  If you get the Exec room you will not find a bigger bathroom in London.  ,4,2017,03,30
133,Good location - staff could be a little more friendly.,"Would definitely stay there again. Lovely room with great view.  Central location in London with access to public transportation and taxis.  A little pricey. Rooms are very clean. Highly recommend this hotel. 

",5,2017,03,29

133,Did not disappoint,"Enjoyed my stay at this hotel - great location beautiful view and large room - bed was very comfortable and the room quiet.  I asked for an iron and ironing board which promptly arrived.
The breakfast was really great and the hotel offered a great variety.",4,2017,03,29
133,Worth every penny,"An amazing view and a large room with huge bed. Flexible with special requests and an outstanding location in the heart of Kensington. Disappointing architecture but  otherwise faultless.
Conference facilities were good with excellent service and food. ",4,2017,03,28
133,A cash cow,"An overwhelming advantage of this hotel relative to many other properties in London is its location: across the road from Whole Foods, steps from Kensington Gardens, a few minutes walk from High Street Kensington tube station. Two other benefits are friendly and attentive stuff and an amazing Chinese restaurant Min Jiang on the top floor with breathtaking views of Hyde Park and London's skyline behind the park. We dined twice at Min Jiang and both times the food was exquisite, especially dim sum and crab dumplings with bouillon inside. The restaurant was also full of Chinese patrons, which is always a good sign. 
On the negative side, our executive room was dated and in need of upgrading. The door of the bar fridge was misaligned and required a certain effort to close it. The room was large but the sitting area was not separated from the sleeping area, which would be preferable for families with little kids (executive rooms are advertised as family rooms). Internet connection was sporadic. I had to constantly reconnect/ relogin to access Internet. Finally, the heating system in the rooms is through an air conditioner, meaning that somewhere in the ceiling there is a device that is pushing hot or cold air (depending on what you want) into the room. As a result, if you want to warm up or cool down the room, you will get a steady draft in the room, which exacerbates such condition as sinusitis. Heated floors would be much better. Therefore, my impression was that the owners of the hotel are simply milking the property for its superb location and it would be nice if they could invest some of their profits into the property upgrade.",4,2017,03,28
133,London Hotel of Choice,"We have been guests at the Hotel for over twenty years and return once or twice every year.
The location, comfort,excellent service and reasonable price have been a feature over this time.
We will be back again in September. Many thanks Royal Garden.

133,Excellent hotel would return!,"This hotel is based right on the edge of Hyde Park, it's within easy distance of underground station and moments walk from the great shooing of South Kensington. You can walk to many of Londons museums within 30 mins as well. The hotel it's self is well appointed, reception very friendly. Rooms are cosy but functional. Bed good, bathroom very clean. Breakfast was very nice excellent choice of hot and cold selection. Overall will definably return to this hotel! ",5,2017,03,28
133,"Great place, great location","This was a great hotel in a great location. Friendly staff, really great food at the hotel restaurant. Might be the best grilled fish I have ever had. Close to tube station and steps away from Kensington Palace. ",4,2017,03,27
133,Outstanding!,We stayed for 2 nights in a king bed garden view room. 1st class service throughout from the moment we arrived. Room exceeded expectations with oustanding view of Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. Very well appointed room and comfy bed. We used the bar on the ground floor and service superb. Prices as expected for hotel of this standard. Would definitely recommend!,5,2017,03,27

133,Great Hotel,"Everything about the hotel was great: location, facilities, and  staff.  Great spot four touring, shopping.g, and just relaxing.  It has it all.  I would definitely stay here again, and will recommend it to friends and family.",5,2017,03,27
133,Just a place to spend the night,"
The hotel's location is great; bang smack on High Street Kensington and views over Hyde/Kensington Park from both the cafe and Min Jiang Restaurant are quite lovely. Rooms are of a good size and there is a seperate shower stall in the bathroom; both rather rare treats in London. The hotel is efficiently run, everything works and no complaints on cleanliness. Overall, difficult to fault from a purely objective nuts and bolts perspective but this place has no character, no soul; none whatsoever.

It shows from the very business hotel 1990s decor; harsh lighting, plenty of ceramic tiles, grey carpets, office like furniture and a general lack of any warmth. The word cosy has no application here and this hard and calculated feel extends to the service culture. If you expect to be made to feel special or to be treated in anyway that runs counter to the hotel's strict standard operating procedures, forget it. The Royal Garden Hotel is akin to an organization run purely as a profit making enterprise. There is no pretence that you are anything but a single very narrowly defined business transaction. The lack of soul, character and good service was particularly stark after moving here from a 3 night stay at the Rosewood London.

No drinking water is provided free of charge. If however, you book your room directly with the hotel, this entitles you to a reward of two bottles each day and fruits but only on day 1. Ask for three bottles of water and you will be turned down. Ask for four and they will literally laugh out loud. We had dinner at their cafe one quiet night. Lots of free tables. We asked to be seated at a comfy looking empty sofa table. ""Oh no, you can't sit there; we have already set the table for breakfast tomorrow. Our cafe closes in one hour."" What?! Is this a boarding house or a 5* hotel? The service at Min Jiang was no better. Curt, abrupt and cold although to be fair, the Peking Duck which you have to pre order and the dim sum were not bad. 

I settled my room bill the night before an early morning departure. ""If you settle your tab now, the bill cannot show your final nights room charge, its our system"". Only after showing displeasure was i told that ""we can put in the charges manually"". Just some examples of an ingrained reluctance to go that extra mile.

In conclusion, not a bad hotel by any means but definitely not one to patronise if you want to feel special. A clean, safe, convenient and expensive place to spend the night. Nothing more nothing less. The Singapore Khoos who own this hotel should perhaps look to their fellow country woman Christina Ong for a tip or two on how to add some soul to this 5* property. Life is not just about Dollars and Cents.",3,2017,03,26
133,Perfect hotel,Very comfortable hotel with lovely facilities overlooking lovely gardens. Room was very comfortable. Restaurants were excellent especially the Min jiang service and atmosphere was incredible. Cocktails in the park terrace were lovely. Bertie's bar ideal for late night drinks and snacks after a show.,5,2017,03,26
133,Excellent Hotel,"Friendly staff, very Nice Roms, excellent food! Whenever I'm in London I stay at The Royal Garden Hotel. The Location is also perfect wherever you Need to go. The nearby Hyde Park is perfect for a nice stroll or s quick run!!",5,2017,03,26

The bar staff were incredibly attentive, nothing was too much. The reception team were superb too.",5,2017,03,25
133,The vibe is always good!,"Staying in beautiful hotels makes me happy. Maybe the Royal Garden is not the most beautiful or luxurious hotel of London, but the staff is super friendly and the vibe is always good. Love staying here and always feel very welcome. It is indeed a little like coming home. ",5,2017,03,25
133,ABFA Student Awards Dinner stay,"Given its pricing and location in a crowded part of West London the Royal Garden offers exceptional service levels. From Paddington take the Circle Line West to Kensington High Street, turn right on exit, cross the road and it is a four minute walk.",5,2017,03,25
133,Great location,"Great location close to parks, museums, shops, very convenient. Great facilities to combine family and work... Porters were too busy and unattentive though, not helpful at all.  Nevertheless we had a great stay",3,2017,03,25
133,"Freezing to death last night, and slow response from hotel management ","I am a guest at room 809, and have been here for a few nights, and 2 more to go.  Despite the small size the room came with a nice garden view, and hotel service in general are very good. Great breakfast also! 
However last night the housekeeper left one of the windows open, and with the Window curtain closed (after the turn-down service I guess);  when I returned to room around 11pm, after a full day filled with meetings in city, i went straight to bed.  Feeling cold, I turned up the temperature on the heat control panel.  But it just got colder the entire night (probably 4 degree Celsius or below outside),  so I kept waking up and turning up the heat control more, and put on all the sweaters I can find, as well as long pants and socks, and went back to bed fully geared in my day time clothes. 
I only found out the reason when I got up at 6am and opened the window curtain. And Wow one of them was kept open the entire night, hence the freezing coldness in the room. 
I called the reception after breakfast around 9:15am, and lodged complaint. Was told they had simply incident before, and someone will call me back. Never heard back before I had to rush out for my meetings today around 9:35am. ",2,2017,03,24

The nearest Underground Station is High Street, Kensington and we have been all over the city using public transportation. ",5,2017,03,23
133,Afternoon tea,"There are many pluses to the afternoon tea at the Royal Garden. The hotel and staff are charming, the location is fab and the champagne delicious. What spoilt it for me was that the sandwiches and all of the cakes were refrigerator cold. The scones,on the other hand, were warm and appealing. So for us, a mixed bag.",3,2017,03,23
133,excellent location in London,"Had to stay in the hotel for a conference. 7th time in London for this purpose, the best hotel I ever stayed there. Nice location, good to reach by public transport. Ask for a view on the Kensington garden.",4,2017,03,23

raised. we will no doubt stay there again in the future.the staff were very friendly and helpful at all
times",4,2017,03,22
133,Park Terrace Restaurant,"We bought dinner for friends and ourselves as a Christmas present on a Travelzoo deal and were not sure what to expect.  However we need not have worried, the whole experience was exemplary.  The restaurant is intimate, without being overcrowded, tables are laid well and the service is excellent.  Our waiter explained everything about the cocktail and food menu and described the food as it was served.  Every mouthful of the 3 courses was delicious, beautifully presented and very well balanced. We each selected something different from the a la carte menu and everyone was delighted with their individual choice.  One of the party was celebrating a birthday and was given a pretty plate filled with petite fours and iced with 'Happy Birthday' as an extra treat. We enjoyed a lovely evening, with fantastic food and exceptional service and, as icing on the cake, were presented with a voucher to return at the original price we had paid.   Even without the deal, and taking into consideration the location of the hotel, we would say ¬£37.50 for a 3-course a la carte menu of this calibre is exceptional value for money and would have absolutely no hesitation in returning ourselves or recommending to friends and family.",5,2017,03,22
133,Simply Beautiful,"What a wonderful place to stay whilst in London for business.

Beautifully decorated, excellent staff and extremely comfortable rooms.

133,London with my teenage son...,Great location for us- right on Kensington Park- steps from the Palace (which makes a great fist stop when you are jet lagged but still want to get out and see something). Embassies are on the other side- so besides the front street-very quiet. Concierge was amazing setting up our dinner reservations before we arrived (loved all their selections). Very helpful staff in general.  We will definitely stay here again! Room was clean and comfortable with view of Kensington Park & Palace. Breakfast buffet every morning was great- and they were mindful of your time.,5,2017,03,20
133,Delightful afternoon tea,"Had a reservation for afternoon tea for me and my husband yesterday and we both thoroughly enjoyed the experience. 

First they bring you the range of teas on a tray (usual breakfast tea, earl grey etc plus black teas, white and green teas etc) and you can choose which you want. Our choices were very nice. Next your sandwiches are brought to you on plates and they were also very nice, very tasty. When you are finished they come over with more sandwiches on a tray and you can take as many more as you would like, we took a couple more each and afterwards they even come back for you to have thirds (if you have room).

The cakes are then brought to you, the selection was very nice, we tried everything and shared each of the cakes so neither of us missed out on trying anything.

The waiters were very attentive but not in your face, the restaurant was very nice, light and airy and plenty of space between tables so you were not on top of other guests and we could hear each other talk. There was a pianist playing but this was in the background.

All in all a very nice experience and we would go back and repeat again.",5,2017,03,20
133,Fabulous stay,"Just been for a lovely ladies weekend in London and stayed at The Royal Garden Hotel which was fab.

133,Exceptional Service,"My wife goes to London every year for a weekly business trip and this year she stayed at the RGH. 

Unfortunately, it was the week of our one-year Wedding Anniversary. I emailed to see about surprising my wife with her favorite flowers on Saturday via the website but had no response. So on Sunday (a little tiffed due to no response) I called the hotel. I explained what was going on to the operator, who was so sweet and understanding. She connected me to Guest Relations Rep, Monica, who was awesome! Although our Anniversary landed on a Sunday, Monica left the hotel, went to a local flower shop, and delivered the flowers to my wife's room along with signature plate of chocolates and note, Happy Anniversary. My wife was so happy and we had the best ""Skypeversary"" ever. 

I am a department head of a luxury hotel in NYC. The only down fall I saw: If you have an online contact service, make sure you reply within 24 hours. Other than that, perfect. 

My wife came home very happy with her week's stay at the RGH. She said that the service was spectacular, the housekeeping staff were great, and the room service staff were exceptional, professional, and prompt. 

She will be back next year, and again, thank you Monica!",5,2017,03,18

133,Business stay,"Great place, great view on Kensington palace gardens .best place for a peaceful sleep! However be careful with breakfast queues on business days if you are in a rush, and personnel was totally uninterested to sort out the matter.Had to skip breakfast , that was annoying.                                                 ",4,2017,03,17

133,Excellent Hotel,"Following the surprising number of readers of my first and only ever post I thought I should extend the courtesy to other places that I have had a memorable experience with. I can say that this is a truly excellent hotel and a true reminder of what good service should be. I would definitely recommend booking directly with them as they will match any rates and  always surprise me with their great welcome gifts. The first thing that struck me about the hotel is the excellent level of service from the moment you walk into the hotel. Imagine the Hilton but with better rooms, service, food, prices... Excellent Hotel throughout! Ps make sure you pay a visit to Bertie's Bar for a quiet but great drink by one of the bartenders.",5,2017,03,15
133,After the Ball overnight stay,"This was our second stay and the staff as previously were excellent (nothing too much trouble), food wonderful, bedroom and beds wonderfully comfortable.  This year, our room overlooked Kensington Palace which was lovely but we preferred the room we had last year which overlooked Kensington High Street and was bigger with more sumptuous d√©cor and with a proper dressing table in a good position for lighting for ladies to make up their faces!",5,2017,03,15
133,Middle of everything,"We just visited London for the first time. We did a little hotel hopping stayed at three different hotels. This hotel was one of our favs. Very spacious and clean rooms. No iron coffee or conditioner, but they provided iron upon request.",4,2017,03,14

133,Good accommodation in right location,Pick up the tube or bus nearby. Good shopping right there. Excellent access to park. Bring the car and park underneath the hotel. Stroll to the Albert Hall. Good all round without being in the middle of London,5,2017,03,14
133,Rugby trip,An outstanding hotel with excellent rooms and very welcoming staff. The breakfast buffet had a great variety to choose from and the cooked breakfast was equally good. Other meals taken were of a high standard.,5,2017,03,14
133,Perfect location and family friendly,"We stayed at the RGH for three nights family of four (children 4 and 7). Clearly jet lagged we were given a warm welcome with the kids receiving really cute back packs with little goodies inside including a nice notebook with color pencils, perfect for 'journaling our trip'. We were right in the middle of the high street which meant we didn't have far to go to the tube station, shopping or to try out the various restaurants.
Our room was comfortable the kids shared the pull out couch, which was put away in the day and opened during turn down. We loved our cleaning lady, she was very nice and made sure we were well taken care of with extra towels and such.
We ordered the food and flicks for the kids one night and they were so in awe of the spread! Definitely a must try with children. 
The concierge desk was very friendly and helpful and the gentleman at the downstairs restaurant was so funny, making sure the kids were always laughing when he passed by. He had a chocolate Martini made for me ( my first of many). 
All in all we had a lovely time at the RGH and would love a to visit in a warmer month so we could enjoy the gardens itself.

133,A very happy weekend,"We had one night at the Royal Garden Hotel just now and it was fabulous.  We had booked a Garden Room which had amazing views over Kensington Gardens, the Round Pond, and Kensington Palace.  The bedroom was lovely, a really nice bathroom with a separate shower in it, lovely Penhaligon's bath stuff, comfy dressing gowns, a nice big television, tea and coffee making stuff plus some rather nice biscuits, an excellent hairdryer and a large plate of dates and baklava that we had chosen as our special gift.  We had dinner with friends in the wonderful Min Jiang chinese restaurant.  This was exceptional, with really delicious food.  We also went to the bar for a quick glass of champagne to celebrate my son's engagement, which was fun, although rather empty, but it had only just opened for the evening.  Our breakfast was served in our bedroom.  There was masses to choose from and we really enjoyed it all.  This is such a lovely hotel, everyone is very professional and friendly and I cannot wait to go back there again.",5,2017,03,13
133,"3 times the charm, as was the 1st two!","love this hotel, beautiful and welcoming, the bar staff from Vilmos the manager on down to the wait staff remember your drink order from trip to trip so impressive, it makes you feel like family.  one of the best places i have ever stayed",5,2017,03,13

On the high street in Kensington, so very accessible.
Breakfast was very good quality.
Rooms were large and clean.
24 hour room service is always good!",5,2017,03,13
133,Cleanest bathroom ever,"Stayed recently with friends and loved the hotel and great location as it's on Kensington High St, we only really used the hotel as a base and only stayed two nights but found lovely staff, very polite and helpful but have to say the bathroom was the cleanest I've ever stayed in (except mine at home obviously üòâ) they could do major surgery in mine, really that clean, well done - I know it's a small thing but nothing makes me shudder more than a dirty bathroom. ",5,2017,03,12
133,First stay - will not be the last,"11/03/17 - Just had a one night stay at the Royal Garden Hotel‚Ä¶. Thank you for such an enjoyable experience. I am very critical when booking into a hotel and have often requested a room change (even in well-known prestige hotels) ‚Äì I am happy to say this was not one of those occasions. 
We stayed in a park view room (438) which I feel was worth paying more for, the room was very clean and well equipped. We checked in at approx 1pm and then decided to explore the area - on our return, I found we had been given a fruit bowl and complimentary water. 
We booked the hotel to attend an event at the Royal Albert Hall due to the close proximity (10-15 min walk along the main road) on return from our evening out; housekeeping had done turn down ‚Äì which I was not expecting. 
Breakfast the following morning had a good variety of continental and cooked items with the service being second to none. I look forward to our next stay and would not hesitate in recommending this hotel. Superb service from check in to check out, if I had to make any criticism ‚Äì more smiles would have been nice ÔÅä",5,2017,03,12
133,great staff -  great view,"the staff was extraordinary friendly from the concierge to reception to the cleaning ladies and service personal at the bars , the view @ Kennington Gardens great! 
I will gladly come back once or more often a year! ",5,2017,03,12
133,Beautiful hotel however not smooth check in,My partner and I received a gift of an overnight stay in the hotel with complimentary welcome drinks. Unfortunately on arrival (at 6pm) four hours after check in commences we were told our room was unavailable to check into and there would be a delay. Due to evening plans this was not possible and the alternative we were offered was a non-smoking room which we declined. The front of house staff did manage to secure another room for us after some telephone calls to housekeeping however this made the start of our stay quite uncomfortable and not the luxury start we had hoped for. Our room was fine and welcome drinks were excellent. Breakfast the following morning was also sublime. We would visit again however I would ask that due to this experience our room be saved and available from the time of check in as expected.,4,2017,03,11
133,Excellent Weekend Break,"Wonderful hotel, very nice room. Great view of Hyde Park. Would definitely recommend. The children really like their goodie bags. Great location, bus stop right outside and close to the tube. Very friendly staff. Breakfast was delicious. ",5,2017,03,10
133,Just the place to stay for a short break in London,"We stopped for 4 nights in this up market hotel which is close to the centre of London and has its own shops nearby in Kensington High Street. We found it ideal for visiting museums, art galleries and theatreland. A number of bus routes have a  stop outside the hotel and they are very convenient to use; otherwise the tube station is about a maximum of 5 mins walk from the hotel.
We had a standard room at the back of the hotel which overlooked Kensington Gardens and the Palace; it was a good size, clean and well equipped and quiet. When we arrived we had a late lunch/bar meal and the food was excellent - one of the best Burgers my wife had ever had. Later on we had an evening meal in the restaurant and once again it was excellent and good value for money considering the venue etc. If you want to eat out there are a complete range of eating places within easy reach ranging from noodle bars through to expensive restaurants and everything in between. The competition seems to keep the hotel on its toes.
We found it very relaxing to be able to walk from the hotel straight into the biggest park in London and then go to a museum etc.
Overall a good place to stay",5,2017,03,10
133,Lovely!,"Great location, right in the hub of the capital but with the beautiful Kensington gardens a stones throw away for when you want a break from the city bustle.  The foyer gives you an introduction of the level of quality you will come to expect throughout the hotel.  Clean, modern rooms, helpful staff, highly recommended! ",5,2017,03,09
133,Wonderful as always,"Next to the Palace, overlooking exceptional gardens, the Royal Garden never fails to satisfy. The concierge gentlemen are charming and attentive and always do their best for you. The location is the best!",5,2017,03,09
133,Overnight theatre stay,"Stayed overnight here on a discounted deal with railcard. Convenient for the tube and Kensington High Street. Check-in was straightforward and room, although small, was both clean and modern. A side-on view of Kensington Palace was a bonus! We slept well without any noticeable noise from outside the room during the night. Pre-booked breakfast was a delight with views over the gardens. Full English breakfast delicious and brought to the table (better than the usual buffet scrum!) Staff in restaurant were efficient and attentive. All in all the best hotel that we've visited on a short London trip.",5,2017,03,09
133,Good.,"I use this hotel for many years. I like this hotel very much. I will recommend this hotel to my friends. The hotel is clean. Location is good and easy for shopping, eating and do what you want to do. I will use this hotel continuesly.",5,2017,03,09
133,Upgrade a mistake,"Looking forward to a garden view room. I was v disappointed to be upgraded to a large and cold executive room. Unbelievably bad design. Not only was there no drawers or shelves big enough for a folded shirt various bath knobs came off in my hand and for the 2nd time the engineer had to be called to allow the bath to drain. The good news was we had an excellent dinner. 

",3,2017,03,08
133,Amazing,"Everything was perfect! The room was classy, calm and very clean. The staff was great. The location is awesome with the view to Hyde Park! We ate in the room and the service was super! The breakfast was just brilliant! Will come back for sure",5,2017,03,08
133,Superb! 10/10,"I booked this hotel for my fiances 30th and pre wedding celebrations. The staff and service was exceptional. To make it extra special we were even surprised to an upgrade. Food was amazing, room service was amazing, staff were amazing and the suite was phenomenal. Couldn't fault a thing. Thank you to all the staff you have created some very happy memories for life :) ",5,2017,03,07
133,Fantastic ,"I have been to the Royal Garden on several occasions either for drinks or afternoon tea but have never stayed , this time on our recent visit to London to celebrate our friends 50th Birthday we booked this hotel in an executive King room . We were not disappointed the room was clean and spacious, the only thing I wished I'd had was a room with a view over Kensington gardens but it did not stop us enjoying our stay . 
The staff at check in were very polite and helpful . 
We decided to eat at the restaurant on the 10th floor Min Jiang We've eaten here several times and can highly recommend with views of the London skyline and amazing food . 
Bertie's bar is also great for after dinner drinks again the staff are fantastic and they can certainly make a good cocktail . 
Then to make our friends birthday even more special on returning back to their room a bottle of wine & chocolates and a message hand written in chocolate Happy Birthday from the hotel . 
I would just like to say a huge thank you to all the staff for making the weekend a memorable one . 
We shall be back . 
",5,2017,03,07
133,Superb hotel in a great location,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Royal Garden Hotel, the service, location and staff are wonderful, there is car parking if you need it, and excellent restaurant's and bar facilities.  The Royal Albert Hall and the V and A are within walking distance, and great shops on your doorstep. ",5,2017,03,07
133,Very Poor customer service,"I booked a restaurant table for 10.15am through open table with the idea that breakfast prior to Kensington Gardens Diana exhibition would form part of a birthday celebration. 

Two weeks later and just over a week before the booking I received a call to ask was it breakfast or lunch, when I explained breakfast I was asked if I could guarantee the table back within 1 hour - when I declined, it was suggested 1 and a quarter hours. Breakfast usually takes 1hour so almost certainly we would have vacated in a 1-1.15 hr slot but given breakfast orders are taken at 10.45 and beyond I really object to having to be so precise (especially as a birthday) and two weeks after booking. I asked them to cancel and although we have been to the hotel several times before this was just an example of poor customer service, in fact no customer service",1,2017,03,07
133,Business trip,"Fantastic hotel with great facilities. Helpful staff, good business centre, excellent breakfasts.  The rooms are very comfortable, spacious and spotlessly clean. Great location right next to Kensington Gardens.",5,2017,03,07
133,Disappointed,"I stayed in the Royal Garden Hotel while attending a conference at the hotel. The hotel was fine but unfortunately when my wallet was either lost or stolen, I found the staff to be very blas√© and not that helpful. 

I contacted the hotel a few days later to see if my wallet had been found and although it's almost one week later now, I've received no reply. This is not great service. ",3,2017,03,07
133,great quality and value in central London,"the staff in this hotel are generally more engaged with the guest than most others I visit. the Chinese restaurant Min Jiang is our favourite in London with spectacular
views over the city and authentic cuisine.
best value 5 star hotel in town and just a strolll from the Royal Albert Hall and Kensington High st",5,2017,03,07
133,Very Good Hotel,"My family and I spent one night at the Royal Garden after seeing a show at the Albert Hall. We had two rooms, both light and airy over-looking Kensington Gardens. Compared to most London Hotels I‚Äôve stayed in the rooms were on the spacious side and very clean.
We had afternoon tea in the restaurants. If you opt for the package, you get a vast selection of teas to choose from plus sandwiches and cakes. All very English with the piano player in the background.
However, two negative points which in view downgrades the hotel to ‚ÄòVery Good‚Äô from Excellent
 During afternoon tea I had to wait a long time for the cakes. I reminded a staff member that we were still waiting which resulted in a somewhat heated discussion between two members of staff in their own language which I couldn‚Äôt recognise. I think that the delay was in fact caused by having to wait of the scones to finish baking which were delicious once they arrived.
The second point is there was a 30 ‚Äì 40 minute queue for a breakfast table the following morning. I can only guess that demand was high as breakfast was included in packages throughout February, whereas, normally Breakfast will cost you ¬£25. But that said, having to queue for that length of time on a Sunday morning was unacceptable.
If I needed to stay in Kensington again, would I stay in the Royal Garden? Yes I would but just get up a little earlier to beat the Breakfast queue.",4,2017,03,06
133,Great experience,"The whole experience was a joy from start to finish.

My wife and I visit London regularly and changed our previous hotel to the Royal Garden. We booked a garden room which overlooks Kensington Gardens - lovely to watch youngsters playing soccer Sat and Sun morning.

Lovely room, plenty of space, great breakfasts (room service).

Friendly, efficient staff - hard to find anything to complain about - oh they did cancel our room cards after one night but quickly and politely resolved.

Will certainly return.",5,2017,03,06
133,Great hotel with great location,"Brilliant business hotel with warm and welcoming staff. The hotel facilities are flawless both inside the room. The beds are great and wifi included in your stay. Great views whether you face towards the palace or towards High Street Ken. Best location in London near great shopping, public transport, taxis, and wonderful restaurants and bars. And if you just want to enjoy sitting or walking in the park - it's right next door. 
",5,2017,03,06
133,AMAZING,"This not the first time we have stayed in this hotel and IT WILL NOT BE THE LAST!
We had the warmest of welcomes from Torie at reception and we were so excited that our room was ready upon our arrival.  We thank the housekeeping staff who are the hidden gems of this hotel, the lobby and reception sparkle and our room was beautifully prepared for us. 'Bravo'!The room was glorious and luxurious with a wonderful view of the park.  The bed gave us delicious slumbers.  The shower warm, but invigorating and just what was needed to wake us up to an exciting day!  Thanks to Vaiva and all the staff who welcomed us and served us with yummy breakfasts (both mornings), and the gentleman who makes the most sumptuous of poached eggs!
This is just my favourite hotel of all time!  See you all soon.",5,2017,03,05
133,Good value 5-star but not world class,"I got this as part of a package and found it to be a terrific value. It's certainly staffed as a 5 star hotel with doormen and service members everywhere you turn. They are friendly though perhaps not at a Four Seasons or Ritz-Carlton level of overly helpful. 

I just didn't think the property and room itself were particularly impressive.

Location is a mixed bag since it's next to Hyde Park which is nice for a run or a view but it can be a little bit of a walk to a few subway lines. If you only need the circle line, then this place is fine. That said, it's relatively quiet and a very nice neighborhood.

They were nice enough to give a park view which was lovely. One downside was you can hear birds chirping as early as 5am. 

There was a nice turndown service. On one of the nights though housekeeping left some stuff in my room (must have just forgotten it midway).

They do have 24 hour room service was actually was quite well done and fast. I only wished they states the poached eggs come with toast so I didn't waste money ordering a la carte toast which I thought they could warned about. Food and presentation itself was great.

Overall I enjoyed the stay and would consider staying again. It just wasn't particularly memorable in a way a 5-star hotel might normally be.",4,2017,03,04
133,Very Comfortable Hotel,"Lovely hotel, nice room, great view from top floor bar & restaurant & the one for breakfast on ground floor.   Staff are very friendly & helpful & the food is good. Downstairs bar is very quiet for having a beer in & top floor is just cocktails.",4,2017,03,04
133,An Oasis in London,"I have lived in London for over two decades and prefer to stay at this hotel. I like it for everything it is.
It does not have the quintessentially English look and feel of many other hotels. Instead it offers a cosmopolitan alternative. The restaurants and rooms are great. The views can bee wonderful and relaxing. The location is well situated to the charms of London's good restaurants, museums, parks and shopping. It's just very enjoyable to stay here. It is a place to unwind.",5,2017,03,03
133,Wifes Christmas present accompanied by Theater Tickets.,"Disaster all round for the stay at the hotel, show was good. room that we was put in was noisy and small. We were nearly late for show as hotel had no where for us to stay it was 1700 before we had a room.",3,2017,03,02
133,Great stay,We stayed in the Garten Suite and our view was all over the hyde Park. The Staff was very friendly and our wishes were fullfilled in a few Minutes. The Location is very central and the Big Bus tour stops right in Front of the Hotel. Clean Rooms.,5,2017,03,02
133,Perfect Location Plus,"I stayed here 3 nights for the location. I was delighted with my stay. The room was tasteful, the view of the park wonderful and the service was exceptional . I liked the layout of the room, the bathroom was very nice. Everything was spotless with attention to detail. I also enjoyed the bar at the top of the hotel (the restaurant was fully booked).",5,2017,03,02
133,Luxurious stay in the perfect location!,"The rooms are extremely clean and well furnished. The staff are friendly and there are plenty of great amenities to keep you entertained. The location is ideal since it's a walk away from shops, Hyde Park, and lots of great restaurants and supermarkets. Totally recommended!",5,2017,03,02
133,Little details made the difference! ,"What a gem! Situated on the corner of Kensington  Gardens we had a wonderful view of the Kensington Palace. Lots of little detail (labels on the light switches(so annoying having to try them all to find the right one!), room vacant/do not disturb switches ( no cardboard door hangers-hooray!) and a huge double walk in shower. 
The reception staff were fabulous and when immediately moved us when we had a room with a bath rather than a shower. The breakfast staff were delightful! 
A great find, and well definitely be back! ",5,2017,03,01

133,Room for improvement,Although breakfast was included in our reservation the breakfast fast asked us to complete a chit showing cost of breakfast - WHY - we have never before had to do this???    Road noise still audible even though room fitted with double blazing - poor quality!    ,3,2017,02,28
133,one night stay,"A pleasant stay for one night, staff very attentive and meal good,

We had our teenage daughter with us and so our Executive Room was a bit cramped. Our own fault for leaving it late to book in half term week - the Garden Rooms are a little bigger apparently. My daughter joked on FaceBook about the lack of biscuits in the room. Not only did they respond - we came returned to the hotel to find about 10 packets of them in the room.

Convenient for Kensington Gardens, shops and museums. Easy to travel further afield as close to the Kensington High Street Tube.

Would recommend the gin selection in the Park Terrace Bar",5,2017,02,26
133,Poor breakfast and poor waiting staff,"Ordered eggs benedict for breakfast which took over half an hour to come (despite other orders arriving in that time for tables around us even though those people had arrived for breakfast after us). It was served on a burnt muffin (completely blackened) and the order had obviously been left sitting on the hot plate for around 10mins or more, as the hollandaise sauce was completely dried out, solid and congealed - I scraped it off in lumps resembling something more like scrambled egg. Pointed this out to the waitress who was uninterested and walked away - presumably as she was the cause of the prolonged wait and having left it on the side to spoul. Very disappointing and unacceptable service from staff. Would not return.",3,2017,02,26
133,Excellent Hotel with Kensington Garden View,"Very good modern hotel with garden view.
Reasonable distance to the center of London.
I recommend the garden view rooms, for London very spacy,
In the neighborhood shops and restaurants, tube station not are away.
The Kensington Park is next to the hotel, so running and biking is possible.
",5,2017,02,25
133,Older hotel with friendly staff and excellent breakfast,Rooms are old. Shower leaking water. Black hair on the floor. Staff outside at arrival only welcome guests that arrive with taxi all other have to take care of luggage and baby carts themselves. But overall staff is very friendly. Breakfast is excellent and so is staff at service. If I ever return it would be because of the breakfast. ,3,2017,02,25
133,Lacks the attributes of a top 5 star London hotel.,"I thought the staff could have been more attentive, professional, and friendly.  Had an anonymous feel to the hotel.  My hallway smelled of cigarette smoke.  My room looked dated.  The room service was excellent.  ",3,2017,02,24
133,Short trip,"Excellent stay, lovely hotel.  Staff very nice to deal with and very helpful.  Great location for exploring London.  Hotel is modern and clean and the rooms whilst small having everything you need to hand.",5,2017,02,24
133,Would come again!,"Great spacious rooms which is unusual in London. Recently decorated and beautiful en-suite bathroom too.  We could have happily stayed in our room all weekend were it not for the Opera, A Book of Morman, a trip to the Wallace Collection, the Natural History Museum and finally the London Eye. ",5,2017,02,22
133,Out most recent stay at your hotel,"All was excellent, all staff very kind and helpful.  Then the most amazing gift from you, as it was my husbands birthday weekend, you gave him a bottle of wine to celebrate his birthday.  All as usual excellent, this is around the 10th year we have been visiting you.",5,2017,02,22
133,Lovely stay yet again,"We stayed in an executive room as our daughter was with us, it was very spacious and the sofa bed was all ready when we came back from our evening out. Water provided at turn down. Delicious breakfast everything you could think of all hot and eggs/omelettes/waffles cooked freshly while you wait. A little pricey but well worth it.",5,2017,02,21
133,london experience,"My wife and I use this hotel at least twice a year and have done for a number of years. We have stopped in anumber of major London hotels but this is our favourite. Great location, excellent food, wonderful service, NCP parking on site and so on. We will be returning in Sept/Oct for a West End show and a wander round one of the great cities.",5,2017,02,21
133,Annual visit,"Great place to stay, always welcoming but not stuffy in any way - staff are knowledgeable and welcoming and clearly seem to love the place which makes anyone's stay homely. My wife and I have been coming for the last 5 years, at least once a year and have never tired of the place - we are definitely planning again next year's already",4,2017,02,21
133,The Royal Garden hotel,Excellent hotel and I have been staying here since the 1980's and will continue to do so. The general manager Jonathan Lowery is particularly friendly and one of the reason I keep coming back. I will be at the hotel again in June this year.,5,2017,02,20
133,Great Hotel & Staff,"Great location next to Kensington Gardens + on Kensington High Street, best of both worlds! Park view room offers fabulous views of the palace / park & city. Kensington High Street tube station a stones throw away + Victoria by black cab at a very reasonable fare (especially on arrival / departure laden with luggage!) Welcome experience was the best I've had at any hotel. All the staff were extremely professional, cordial, focused and approachable. Our sons were so well looked after at breakfast (hot chocolate / pancakes and the rest!) Very pleasant and hassle free experience. Well done very well run establishment!",5,2017,02,20
133,A real treat,We have stayed at the Royal Garden once before. It is a lovely hotel with the highest standards of service from all the staff. Connections to the West End are good by tube and/or bus. It is also a delightful walk through the parks to Hyde Park Corner.,5,2017,02,20
133,Perfect getaway,"Perfect for visiting The Royal Albert hall as only a 10 minute walk away.

This hotel has parking facilities underneath (NCP) which we were given a discount for using, the hotel is outside the congestion charge so that was a bonus.  We were made to feel very welcome by all the staff who were friendly and helpful.

",5,2017,02,20
133,Excellent Hotel,"Myself and hubby stayed here for 1 night as we were due to see a show at The Royal Albert hall and found that this hotel is only a 10 minute walk away.

There is parking underneath the hotel (NCP) which we were given a discount for using it as we were patrons of the hotel.

Kensington High St has lots of restaurants/bars/shops available.

We would definitely stay here again as it was a fab stay with friendly staff and comfortable rooms.",5,2017,02,20
133,Excellent hotel,"Very Nice hotel
I will recommande it
The situation is perfect with the View on Hyde parc.
The personnel is perfect and the service too.
The breakfast is hudge.
The Subway and buses are just in front of the hotel.",5,2017,02,20
133,One of the best hotels in London,"This is my go to hotel in London. The location is the best, staff is friendly and helpful, facilities are great (especially if you get a roo wirh park view) and the Chinese restaurant in the top floor, Min Jiang, is one of the best in the world. Highly recommended!",5,2017,02,19
133,Reservations con be better,"My Company sponsored an event and I wrote to reservations asking fro quotes through their website. heard nothing back and called. I had checked booking.com and got ¬£150 with full breakfast for one night. On speaking to reservations the said the best the could do was ¬£195.00. I mentioned booking.com and asked if the would like to match and save the commission,, NO? So a booked through booking.com and saved ¬£45 and had a great night.. very poor first impression on guest service though. The room was a queen, very nice, fro one night, staff brought me an iron and board. Penhaligans toiletries, tea and coffee making facilities, good tv and air-conditioning - great location and excellent quality of breakfast.",5,2017,02,19
133,Great hotel and sercice with flawed reservations,"Called the hotel for a quote for one night , they quoted ¬£195.00, I mentioned a quote of ¬£150.00 with breakfast and would they want to match that and save up to 30% commission. They said no, so I saved ¬£45 and booked through booking .com...and my company was sponsoring an event awards. I even wrote to reservations and was ignored so ended up calling .. very poor approach to service for first impressions. The rest of the experience was very good.",4,2017,02,19
133,Location and personnel make the place very special,"Booked directly with the hotel , young lady on the phone from reservation had all my details from the previous stay and offered me range of extra complimentary choices. I settled on fruit bowl ! Upon arrival was upgraded to a bigger room and all throughout the stay personnel extremely kind and professional making ones feeling very welcome.

Location of the hotel is very convenient, next to Kensington Garden and few minutes to underground station and shopping. After good breakfast a walk through the Kensington Gardens and the Hyde Park was wonderful way to start the day.

Definitely next time in London I'll stay again at the Same hotel and definitely will book direct. Congratulations to the management of the hotel for making sure that guests are treated in such a friendly and professional way.

Sent from my iPhone",4,2017,02,19
133,Perfect in every way,"The hotel staff are fantastic which is why I give a five star opposed to a four star.  The hotel rooms are nice and modern and certainly deserve a high score, but the carpets are clearly old and in need of  replacing.. However, I would stay in this hotel again, we enjoyed our stay very much.",5,2017,02,19
133,Superb,Great stay ad great value for money. Staff couldn't been more helpful. Didn't hesitate to send a complimentary bottle of champagne up to the room when they found out that we were celebrating an engagement. Breakfast room service was excellent all included in the price of the room.,5,2017,02,19
133,good location,"ideal location for a sight seeing trip.bus stop outside,tube a short walk.rooms are not too big but then you are not living in it! staff all very helpful, breakfast choices are plentiful.the only fault in my opinion is ""Berties"" bar. as we used the dining room bar on the first night as we thought this was it.but realised the bar was the other end of reception,and as we were the only 2 in the bar, other people probably had the same experience.",4,2017,02,18
133,A great location,"Everything was so nice and great. Wonderful view of park side. Friendly and helpful staff, willing to go the extra mile for us, very comfortable pillows, nice room and wonderful hotel, Very welcoming attitude and professional customer service was provided from check-in and check-out. I recommend to everyone to chose this hotel. I will keep returning there again. ",5,2017,02,17
133,Stylish Hotel that oozes quality,Great hotel with plenty of choices for eating and drinking. Close to the buzz of London but with a quiet and relaxed location. Staff are wonderful and the bedrooms are large and comfortable. My favourite London Hotel and a special Valentines Break,5,2017,02,17
133,A Perfect Stay,"Everything from checking-in to checking out. The comfort, the cleanliness, and the staff. Every thing is rated as 5 stars. The hotel sent us a beautiful complimentary plate of truffles for our anniversary ‚ù§",5,2017,02,16
133,Long weekend,"Wonderful hotel, will keep returning whenever we are back in London. Staff were brilliant, always willing to go the extra mile for us. Only slight disappointment was in the 3 nights we were unable to get in to Ming Jiang as they were fully booked",5,2017,02,16
133,Good visit,"Friendly staff, close to shops and restaurants.  I was happy to see a Whole Foods. Market across the street. I found it easy to get around town with this hotel as my base. Walking was easy with the park right next door.",5,2017,02,16
133,Stay at Hotel,"Great value for money with package with theatre seats. Fantastic place to stay and eat. definitely coming back. Very efficient team, showing me to room, early breakfast room service. everything you need. room overlooked park. very comfortable.",4,2017,02,16
133,"Great location, great service","I have been staying at the Royal Garden several times now. Every time, the staff has been extremely helpful and friendly. The rooms are spacious and clean. The location is in a great location. Highly recommend.",5,2017,02,15
133,Fantastically wonderful,"We arrived in black taxi to the front door with a smile, reception where wonderful with additional staff presenting my daughter with a rucksack and pencils, a small and thoughtfull gift. The suite is very spacious, most hotels call suites a suite just for the sake if it, not this one.

Night so quiet you here only your own.

The views from the rooms are lovely with large windows to complement such a Royal view.

The Italian over the road is very nice, all fresh all Italian and tasty food.

Spellbound we where returning from Dinner to witness the England Rugby team victorious over France leaving reception.

If it's good enough for the Lions and next door to the Windsors then it's good enough for Moi.",5,2017,02,15
133,Best hotel in London,"Great hotel, visited multiple times and never disappoints. Some of the best suites in London. The underfloor heating in the bathroom was just divine. Great in-room dining service and having a dining table in the suite meant it was perfect for a relaxing dinner and breakfast.",5,2017,02,14
133,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed two nights as part of an excellent Travelzoo package; the inclusive breakfast and welcome drink made this a far better choice than most of the other hotels that we usually use in Soho and Portobello Road.

Staff were excellent; the full English breakfast brilliant.",5,2017,02,14
133,Room with a view,"Booked this hotel for its location. Right on Kensington High Street. Perfect for a weekend of shopping and musuems. Booked a Standard Queen Room, and WOW, what a view!. Straight over Kensington Palace!. Room was small but nicely furnished. The bathroom was clean and in good condition. The bed was comfortable. Ordered breakfast in the room and have to say it was comfortably the best breakfast I have ever had in a hotel. It was huge and delicious. Would definitely stay her again.",5,2017,02,14
133,London week end,Special offer for this hotel otherwise would never have considered it! Absolutely fabulous place staff brilliant great location - can't wait to visit again. Would highly recommend this hotel for week end trips plenty of shops and pubs nearby and easy access to central London.,4,2017,02,14
133,home away from home,"I stay regularly at the Royal Garden.
I would not stay anywhere else in London.
it is my Home away from Home.
they know how I and we like our room or suite set up and every trip is perfect.
After a long day's business, being able walk into Bertie's and have a night cap and a conversation with all the bar men is very relaxing.
The Royal Garden obviously treats it's staff well as the turn over rate is exceedingly low. this make the guest's experience even better as one is known all the way from the General Manager to the chambermaids.",5,2017,02,14
133,Comfotable stay in Kensington,I'm a recurring guest of this property and it never disappoints. Close to Kensington Highstreet Tube station it caters well to the business traveler. Comfy beds and wonderful pillows! Staff of the hotel is courteous and always punctual.,4,2017,02,14
133,Best service in London,"This hotel really went the extra mile, fabulous staff, great position and overall an exceptional experience. Always my first choice when I visit London.  Room had a great view over Kensington Park and was clean and modern.",5,2017,02,14
133,Perfect place.,"We absolutely loved it! Especially the large rooms and the fantastic breakfast. Service immaculate, location great and a place we will definately visit again. Staff is beyond friendly and the ambience is laid back.  ",5,2017,02,14
133,On average ,"Classy and comfortable but disappointing regarding style and design. Old fashioned atmosphere.
We got a room with twin beds with views and when we request a king size one we got a smaller room with views to the hotel AC machines.
I won't repeat the experience.
The staff was friendly.",3,2017,02,13
133,"Thank You, Royal Garden Hotel","We had booked for one night using a Travelzoo promotion and so had a very reasonable price to start with.  However,we were delighted when we were upgraded to an executive suit after my husband informed the hotel that we were celebrating my 60th birthday.  There were even surprise chocolates in the room with a special birthday message! Fromstart to finish we were impressed by the standard of service and attitude of the staff. There was a classy atmosphere with no hint of being pretentious. Our room had a great view over kensington Palace and Hyde Park with a huge picture window and comfortable sofa and chairs. Our bed was enormous and the bathroom was huge. Everything was spotless! We enjoyed very creative cocktails  in the bar surrounded by tasteful decor and friendly people. Breakfast in the morning was as expected with omelettes cooked to order and everything, both continental and traditionally English that you could wish for. Coffee was served and fruit juuice was fresh with bits in!! The location was ideal; both tubes, buses, a variety of restaurants and many shops were close and the Albert Hall is on the doorstep. About five minutes away is an M and S food shop if the wine in the very well stocked mini bar is too expensive!  All in all a treat worth paying for ...we felt comfortable, looked after and special throughout our very memorabe stay. Thank you!",5,2017,02,13
133,Lovely trip,We were delighted with the hotel having got a special deal. Cocktails were great and can't fault the dinner we had. As for the breakfasts there was so much choice and it was delicious.  Staff could not do enough,5,2017,02,13
133,Week Long Business Trip in London,Hotel was generally very good reasonably-priced for central London. Several restaurants within an easy walk and property sits right next to the park. Only complaint was street noise which interrupted sleep on occasion. I had a third floor room overlooking Kensington which is a very busy street. A room higher up or at the rear would have made the stay perfect.,4,2017,02,13
133,Amazing view,"My 4th time stay here and will come back again. 
Rooms are adequate size and the garden view rooms offer beautiful view of the park. The rooms are modern and almost all the same so if you are looking for something fancy or characteristics it's not for you but if you want a friendly relaxed experience in a wonderful location don't look further! 
The only thing I would have changed is the carpark! It's right under the hotel but ¬£40 a night as it is for public use, I would have arranged for the guests to atleast enjoy a special discounted rate if I was in the management. 
",4,2017,02,13
133,Weekend in London,"Location nearby Hyde Park, Knightsbridge is aldo nearby.
Beatifull hotel, excellent breakfast.
Staff is very friendly, reception is very helpfull.

Rooms are very comfortable, bathroom is very nice.
You got lots of stores and restaurants in the neighboorhood of the hotel.
",5,2017,02,13
133,Excellent stay,"Booked into a queen room for solo stay, room was clean, comfortable and a good size for one person, staff were friendly, location of hotel is excellent and 5 min from the tube, cafes and shops on high street nearby.",5,2017,02,13
133,a very good experience,"Very friendly atmosphere. Centrally located and clean rooms. Very functional. Bathrooms/ showers quite spacious for a central London location. I liked the beef served for one of the lunches. The quality of the fish dishes is lower, though. Probably too greasy.",4,2017,02,12
133,Afternoon tea,"Delicious afternoon tea, extra sandwiches offered as well, and cakes were all fab. All served at a leisurely pace so it makes for a lovely afternoon experience. The tea is brought first, followed by sandwiches and then cakes as a separate serving so you can really make an afternoon out of it rather than feeling like you are being rushed in and out. Highlight was definitely the fact that the scones were still warm!",5,2017,02,12
133,On average,"Location is fine, staff polite but it is not a remarkable hotel. Poor in design and settle in the old fashion way. Very classic.
We had a twin bedroom with views to the city and when we ask for a king size they gave us a worst room with views to the AC hotel machines. Service is correct and quality too. ",3,2017,02,12
133,Great,"A wonderful stay, with a beautiful view! The staff were very friendly, the room was clean and modern! I dwill be happy to stay again. Very close to all the great things London has to offer, close to Kensington High Street tube, Knightsbridge, and local restaurants and pubs. ",4,2017,02,10
133,Recommendable,"Great hotel (clean, modern interior), super friendly staff (starting at the reception, followed by the friendly and professional staff at the restaurant), great location (I normally stay in the financial district around bank, but would accept a longer way to commute to my meetings in the future)",5,2017,02,10
133,My Home away from Home,"The team at Royal Garden Hotel is nothing short of spectacular! I've been staying at this hotel over the past several years and it just keeps getting better and better. They do an amazing job of making you feel like part of their family and it really does feel like my home away from home.  

A significant improvement that I noticed from my last visit was that they now offer easy access to FREE wifi. No more having to login with a super long passcode-it was very simple and FAST this time around.

I look forward to being back in London and seeing everyone at the Royal Garden!

 

",5,2017,02,10
133,Lovely stay and immaculate rooms!,"I stayed at the hotel for a business trip. I had recently had some very bad experiences with a local group of hotels in Kensington but the Royal Garden house hotel has renewed my faith in hotels and sets the standard for how a good hotel should be run. Immaculately clean rooms, lovely facilities and staff that go out of their way to help you. ",5,2017,02,10
133,Absolutely superb as usual,"Stayed here several times.

From check in (easy fast and staff superb and friendly) to check out the trip was A*.

I stayed one night on a business trip and am always impressed.  I will definitely stay again. 

Rooms spacious, clean and large bathrooms - drinks in the bar good and the staff are amazing. I can't praise it highly enough...",5,2017,02,10
133,"Great Location, great hotel",Royal Garden hotel overlooks the Park/gardens and is very conveniently located. High Street Kensington tube station is about a 5 minute walk if that. You are right on High Street Kensington and have plenty great shops around you. Try to get garden facing rooms. The bar off the lobby has great cocktails. ,5,2017,02,09
133,Highly reccommended,"What a fantastic two days.  Best ever break and mainly due to the staff.  Most seemed to be foreign but their command of the language was excellent and they were so attentive.  Could teach the Brits a thing or two!  They really made our stay.  The room was very comfortable and squeaky clean.  Breakfast was out of this world.  Fresh fruit galore with cereals, English, Continental or Oriental breakfast,  toast etc. Best selection I've ever seen. Definitely recommend this hotel and will hopefully return.",5,2017,02,08
133,Great hotel,"We chose this hotel as it was within walking distance of the Royal Albert Hall and close to Kensington High St tube station and right next to Hyde Park. 
We had a great view of London from our 10th floor room which was a good size, clean and modern. Excellent breakfast too.",5,2017,02,08
133,Weekend break,All of the staff we had contact with were friendly and helpful.  Our request for a garden room on the booking appeared to be overlooked so after a broken nights sleep (I'm a very light sleeper) I was pleased to be given a move to the back of the hotel.  We had a lovely meal in the Park Terrace with visiting family in a relaxed atmosphere.  We like the location of the hotel and would be happy to return.,4,2017,02,08
133,Anniversary Weekend ay the Royal Garden Hotel,"Had a lovely welcome and really enjoyed the vista from our Garden Room overlooking Hyde Park. Thanks to May for our welcome Anniversary Card and gift - a lovely touch. Everything we needed from this visit, we received with a welcome from all staff, housekeeping and the breakfast team. Good location for Kensington shops and attractions with the Tube Station very close as well. Would love to have a little longer to enjoy all the facilities. Love to come back soon.",5,2017,02,07
133,hendson,we had a wonderful stay.  and Margaret was very accommodating and helpful.  appreciate all what she did for us during our stay.  we also enjoyed the breakfast with the fresh fruit and pasteries. will definitely return to the royal garden hotel,5,2017,02,07
133,Outstanding,"Fantastic hotel with wonderful staff; all in all a brilliant stay.  Nothing was too much trouble - the staff bent over backwards to help us out. Incredible food at Min Jiang, great drinks in Bertie's Bar, top notch room service. ",5,2017,02,07
133,Large corporate hotel,Stayed at the Royal Garden hotel before the England France Six Nations Game. Typical large corporate hotel. Staff were ok but I certainly felt they were just doing a job rather than really caring. Best feature was the gym which was first rate,3,2017,02,07
133,Rugby Weekend,Its 5 years since we last stayed at The Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington. The hotel is still lovely although it is now becoming a wee bit dated in parts for instance the shower could be better and there is no under floor heating in the en suite and our pillows were a bit soft.. However the view from the Garden rooms is still very special and worth paying the extra tariff for. ,4,2017,02,06
133,Royal Garden Hotel is the destination,"The hotel is in grate location 
Very lovely staff
Wish the breakfast staff is as friendly as the rest of the staff
I believe the value for money is fair
The evening bar is lovery with cozy atmosphere and beyond ",5,2017,02,06
133,Highly recommended.,"Loved the stay at the hotel. 5 min walk from the Tube station. Peaceful views over Kensingotn Gardens. I slept like a dream and never heard another noise from residents. Staff very helpful, complimentary newspaper, bottled water, slippers etc. Breakfast was pricey (¬£25) but amazing, especially my made-to-order omelette. Would certainly return. ",5,2017,02,06
133,Really good hotel,"This is a fabulous hotel, the staff are very friendly and helpful, stayed here on a Travelzoo deal and this was great value also ate in the Park Terrace restaurant on a Travelzoo voucher which was top class as always and the waiting staff couldn't have been more helpful.",5,2017,02,05
133,Excellent stay,"Stayed here for one night as a base for tea at the ritz then a show at the Albert Hall for my wife's 40th birthday.  Booked on line, next morning got a call from the hotel thanking me for booking and offering a complimentary bottle of wine for our room, also enquiring if it was a special occasion. We recieved a friendly welcome when we checked in. We went out for tea, and on returning found the wine in our room along with a tray of truffles with happy birthday  iced onto the plate. A very nice touch. We went out again to the Albert Hall  ( literally a 10 minute stroll) and returned to find the curtains drawn, water by the bed, lights down low and some soothing music playing low on the radio. A very nice welcome back to our room. Overall found this hotel friendly, spotlessly clean and seeming to go that extra little bit that makes all the difference. Would definately recommend this place and we would certainly return. ",5,2017,02,05
133,A great stay - Will certainly come back,"In summary, excellent room, great location and professional service by a very polite staff.  I got a free upgrade to one of the suites on the top floor. An amazing room comparable to the best suites in all of London. I will certainly include the Royal Garden Hotel in my list of most preferred hotels to stay when in London. ",5,2017,02,05
133,Over the moon,"Had a lovely time, was expecting a smoking room but when we checked in and shown to room it wasn't a smoking room the reception staff went to check and showed us to another room (upgraded to the penthouse) it was the only smoking rooms available, could believe our luck, great hotel great staff great service. ",5,2017,02,05
133,A good experience in a great city,"The Hotel is in an excellent location. Staff very professional and friendly.  Food choice and quality at Breakfast and Dinner are very good.  
Stay was an enjoyable experience an we will be back again in the future ",5,2017,02,05
133,I loved this hotel,"The staff was amazing, the food was great, the bars were delightful, the location was splendid, and I'm ready to return!  

Very handy to the tube station, lots of local places to shop and eat, walking distance to anywhere you'd need to be.  REALLY.  
",5,2017,02,04
133,A welcome stay in London,If you want hassle free and friendly service always with a smile and a welcome word look no further than the Royal Garden Hotel. Great room with fabulous views of the gardens and the City skyline. Excellent front of house team and concierge desk. This hotel has cracked service and friendlyness to a tee. ,5,2017,02,04
133,How the great have fallen!,"From being one of the 5 star best hotels and the only hotel I'd stay in for the past 7 years I've been coming in to London, to being one of the worst and will be looking at alternatives for the next visit.

Material condition of the room has really deteriorated and are very dated. The iPhone docking station/alarm clock is the old style 30pin socket. Does anyone still use those?
Grout in the bathroom is very grubby and in need of being re-grouted. Edges of the carpet coming away from the edge and curling up. Drafts coming through the window seals. We were always surprised that traffic noise could not be heard but now with the seals gone it's pretty loud.
Defects with the room logged with the room were shrugged off. Toilet that has a faulty syphon, which means there is a constant flow of water. The on-site engineer recommended pumping the flush handle until it stops, which can take several minutes, rather than replacing the worn out syphon. The kettle in the room has a dangerous plug, which has just been ignore, nor has it been Portable Appliance Tested. A requirement that should be carried out at least every 6 months based on its use and location. 

Bath towels and robes used yesterday were taken but not replaced and the breakfast order form not left. Things one shouldn't be calling down to reception to have brought up.",1,2017,02,03
133,Good experience,"It was my one night stay for business purpose. The facility, service was very good as expected. The inclusive English breakfast was nice and warm. The room was slightly smaller than expected. The location was excellent. Over all I am a happy customer.
",4,2017,02,02
133,Stay in London,"Super hotel, welcoming staff, had a complimentary tea and coffee because our room wasn't ready, they booked my friend and I into a double room instead of a twin, no problem changing it, it also had a view overlooking Kensington Palace apartments. It was excellent value as we booked it with a company on an offer.",5,2017,02,01

Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2017,01,30
133,A Precious Gem in London,"I think words are missing to describe how wonderful our 10-day stay was on this hotel. First of all, I have chosen this hotel here, on TripAdvisor, using the reviews and comments, the bad and the good ones. And I can say, I was not entirely prepared for how good our stay would be. Since the first contact during Check in the experience was good. I think the customer service team makes all the difference on this hotel and makes the guest feel at home. Great bathroom and hot shower, great bed, great linen, great view, great food, great amenities. Normally I do not compliment so easily, but I can say that Royal Garden Hotel has made our 2 weeks vacation a unforgettable experience. Thank you!",5,2017,01,29
133,Quality throughout,Only stayed one night but after a warm and efficient welcome I was soon in a very well appointed and immaculate room. Breakfast in my room arrived exactly at the time requested and was both generous and delicious. No negatives at all and will be back. ,5,2017,01,29
133,Fantastic Hotel,"We were having a function at the hotel and the whole team at the hotel were brilliant, well done to all. The food and beverages were perfect. The rooms are very clean and functional. The whole experience was great, from check in to checking out and in every department.",5,2017,01,28

133,Great London venue,Location is great - next to Kensington Gardens. I have a 6-year old and they really look after him from the scooter use to the kids backpack they give him. Definitely stay here when I can get to London. ,5,2017,01,27

133,Great stay,"We recently stayed at the Royal garden and had a great time. The room was small but well appointed and if we return we would definitely upgrade to a larger room. The hotel staff were always pleasant and helpful. We dined in the restaurant on our first night and were so impressed with the food and service that we dined there a further two times, and the experience was made better by our waiter Marco. We visited the hotel for pleasure not business and would recommend it to anyone wishing to stay in Kensington.
Well done Royal Garden!",5,2017,01,26
133,"Excellent,Well worthy of the 5 stars","I used to live around the corner as a penniless student and always said I would stay here one day.
45 years later here I am, was it worth the wait? Absolutely! Recent refurbishment is very nice
Staff are faultless! Truly 5 stars ( and I have stayed in many others as well) 
Only slight niggles are that the continental breakfast selection could be wider ,and some rooms have better views than others but now I am being picky ",5,2017,01,26
133,Just so,"Perfect location, service and price.The attention to detail was appreciated making our stay a pleasure. Stan took our booking and arranged for an interconnecting room for our children and a little something for my partners 50th. Thank you.",5,2017,01,24

133,Fantastic weekend break,A weekend to remember with our daughter.

And the receptionist on our arrival was delightful! üòÄ,5,2017,01,24
133,Smoke smell penetrating room,Room 838 is a Garden View room but you get the SMELL OF SMOKE from the adjoining room which is an authorised SMOKING ROOM!!! This ruined our stay as the smell penetrated our room for the whole night. In the morning we complained but it was not treated as a serious complaint. Oh sorry about that.....,2,2017,01,23
133,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here three times now - lovely hotel with great staff. The Park Terrace Restaurant serves an excellent breakfast, but the evening meal is even better! The hotel is literally next to Kensington Gardens. ",5,2017,01,23

133,Amazing hotel and staff,"This hotel is amazing. All of the staff are attentive and professional. We were treated like royalty the whole time. We had an amazing room on the 10th floor. The food was wonderful and well recommended. I asked for a blanket and was sent one immediately along with more hot chocolate for a warm nightcap drink. The next morning we had a lovely breakfast and a late checkout as my daughter was in a meeting.
The hotel was holding a conference and that was taken care of with smooth precision and professionalism. If companies need to book conferences this is the place to go. Thank you to all especially Tori who arranged the room and the lovely housekeeper whom I chatted to about buying a hotel bath robe from yourselves but unfortunately they were not available. She was lovely. Well done to the person who hired this staff they were wonderful. Please go to this hotel. I know that whenever I go to London from now for whatever the reason I will be staying there. 
Thank you to all The Minas Family",5,2017,01,23
133,Not as good as it used to be,"Queen Room lovely view but don't expect to use the TV as it is positioned where you can't sit/lie facing it. My nightdress disappeared when the sheets were changed. I had to push and push for them to find it and it was returned from the laundry, un-laundered, screwed up in a plastic bag having been with dirty washing. Cooked breakfast and service in Terrace bar disappointing. The staff are no longer united or managed well throughout the hotel although it remains a lovely place to be.",3,2017,01,23

133,Really nice stay,"Great locations and nice, comfortable room! 
Staff were helpful and the price was reasonable 
I really enjoyed breakfast looking over the park and the stay was surprisingly quiet considering the central location ",5,2017,01,21
133,Wonderful Birthday Stay!,"My partner Daniel and I stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel for my Birthday. 
We had the most wonderful stay. The staff couldn't go out of their way to help any more than they did.
We ate in the Park Terrace restaurant, the food was delicious and the staff were so accommodating and recommended a beautiful wine to accompany our food!
Will definitely be coming back, thank you Royal Garden Hotel xx",5,2017,01,20

133,Most family friendly hotel in London,"The kids loved it, they felt spoilt and were given all sorts of surprises and lots of attention by the amazing staff who were  warm and kind, and didnt mind at all my monkeys running around the lobby and being full of beans. the room was great, very comfy beds, borrowed scooters and scooter around Hyde park, really, 5 star family friendly lovely place.

Must recommend those king size beds- so, so comfortable- just what was needed after busy days enjoying ourselves",5,2017,01,17
133,Excellent London Hotel,"I booked a night at the hotel through Travelzoo as a Christmas present for my husband and we stayed on a Saturday night in January.  The voucher costs ¬£149 and included one night's bed and breakfast and a cocktail in the bar.

Guest Services were absolutely amazing.  I contacted the hotel directly once I purchased the voucher with Travelzoo and asked if they could send me a brochure as this was a present for my husband for Christmas.  Not only did they send the voucher but someone from customer services at the hotel contacted me and offered me an early check-in.  We were also offered a late check-out at no additional cost but as check-out was at 12pm the following day we did not need it.

On arrival we were shown to our room by the lady that checked us in and we were given an upgrade!  This felt like a really nice personal touch and we were shown to our room on the 9th floor with great views across the city.  We were also offered breakfast in bed the following morning at no additional cost, plus a free Sunday paper. 

The room and ensuite were spacious and had everything we needed including a very well stocked minibar!  As a further treat, when we arrived back following our afternoon trip to Harrods (which was ten minutes away) to our room late on Saturday afternoon the chap from customer services that I had been corresponding with had left us a personal note and some chocolate truffles!

We also booked dinner at the hotel with another Travelzoo voucher for a three course meal in the Park Terrace Restaurant.  The voucher was again excellent value - ¬£62 for three course, plus cheese plus a cocktail!  The only additional item we paid for was a very nice bottle of wine.  The food was delicious, service was second to none and it was very good value.

The hotel was certainly 5 star and both my husband and I felt thoroughly pampered and looked after by guest services.  I have no hesitation in recommending it.",5,2017,01,16
133,very bad breakfast not a good start to the day,"the room was great really nice and quiet and easy to use air conditioning etc - however... when it came to breakfast the next morning, that was a very different story. the staff were lacking and useless very poor English so I may as well have been staying some place other than UK - I wasn't told at any time that breakfast was not included in the already very expensive price for the room . half way through still eating the bill was thrown down at my table, which was seriously insulting. then to add insult to injury , when I made a simple request for apricot jam, not exactly asking too much , I was told very gruffly that there was no apricot jam and that if I wanted apricot jam next time I would have to fill out a request form ahead of my next stay! such a shame as the beautifully set out breakfast buffet table was ruined ",3,2017,01,16
133,Great hotel and good position,From the moment we arrived we felt at home. All staff were courteous and helpful keen to ensure our stay was memorable. Room was excellent and well maintained. Eating in the Park Terrace was a good  experience both food wise and service wise. Would have preferred firmer pillows but we could have asked and I am sure they would have been changed. Will stay again when we visit London again.,5,2017,01,16
133,Winter Stay,"My third stay at the Royal Garden and each has been excellent.
Great friendly staff that makes you feel at ease the minute you arrive.  The rooms are clean, well maintained and relaxing each and every time. ",5,2017,01,15
133,Our home away from home,"Our 7th floor suite was amazing with breathtaking views of Hyde Park and HUGE and LUXURIOUS by any measure. We have travelled quite extensively throughout Europe and this was by far the best of the many 5-star rooms we have stayed in. The opportunities we have had to eat at the hotel proved to be exceptional experiences. The food was the best fine-dining quality and service impeccable and attentive at all times. We were simply blown away by the service standards.

Location was also fantastic with a myriad of wonderful shops and eateries. It is also walking distance to the Royal Albert Hall, Science Museum, Natural History Museum and  Imperial College (which we needed to visit for our 16-year daughter's education). 

The icing on the cake was on New Year's eve where our hotel room afforded unbeatable views of the fireworks display and what a wonderful start to a brand New Year it was!

Thank you Royal Garden Hotel for being our home away from home and making our trip an unforgettable one.",5,2017,01,15
133,"Great hotel, good location","Staff very friendly and can't do enough for you. Only downside where the pillows which were to soft, and the towels were only bath towels and not bath sheets. The information folder in the room gave concise information on hotel room services prices. We stayed in a garden room and the view was fantastic. Though hotel on main road we did not hear any road noise.
The part restaurant serviced great food which was very well priced and service was excellent ",5,2017,01,15
133,Royal London,I am coming to London about 5-6 times a year and usually stay at Royal Gardens. Excellent location. Being next to Park gives a wonderful opportunity to jog and walk between business meetings. The staff is most friendly ready to fulfill any request. Chinese restaurant on the top is exquisite. ,5,2017,01,14
133,Good location and friendly staff,"Very good hotel with a good location and friendly staff. However, the pillows and blankets were not good. We went there during winter and the blankets were to thin and not enough. The pillows were not very comfortable to sleep in as well. ",5,2017,01,13
133,Great hotel from all aspects ,"Have stayed at Royal Gardens hotel  in standard room (208) at the second floor for 14 nights during December 2016 , the hotel located in Kensington where many shops, Restaurants, cafes and many other facilities is in walking distance from it as well as the Hyde Park. overall stay was very pleasant, actually the hotel was great in terms of every things for me like staff, check in/out process, and room service i can say that i felt in home while i was faraway. 

Room size was bit small but it wasn't a considerable issue since all other things were great as i mentioned above.  

Will be back and would recommend it to all traveler.    
",5,2017,01,12
133,Ali from Dubai,Very good stay and location near Hyde Park and restaurants. Room very clean and size is fine. There was just an issue with heater which did not work except for two days . The reception was trying to resolve the issue but it seems the system is a bit old and could not be fixed,4,2017,01,11
133,Lovely stay!,"We have nothing but good things to say about this hotel. We stayed a week and everything from check in to check out was perfect. We didn't have many special requests, but small things like bringing an extra blanket & arranging a car to the airport were handled quickly & cheerfully. Our room looked over the Park and the view was amazing. The room wasn't huge, but big enough, quiet & comfortable. We enjoyed having the sofa to relax on. The bathroom was spotless & had a nice shower & a separate deep tub.
We had breakfast a couple of times in the restaurant. The breakfast buffet is very well stocked with lots of cereals, fruit, pastries, cheeses, meats, juices, yogurt, etc. Full English breakfast and a few other a la carte items are also offered. I only wished it were possible to just get a couple of eggs & toast as I didn't want so much food every morning.
The hotel is convienently located on the High Street just a couple of blocks from the Tube. There are many shops on the High Street & a Whole Foods Market too. Don't miss the Waterstone's bookstore further down the High Street. 
We ate at Maggie Jones's restaurant & at the Spaghetti House, both nearby, & enjoyed both.
We definitely hope to splurge & stay here again some day!",5,2017,01,10
133,Excellent choice,"Pure coincidence brought to this hotel, which turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. Excellent location, superb service from all staff, and nice spacious rooms. Definitely a first choice for my next trip to London. ",5,2017,01,10
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"Always a pleasure here, superb staff, magical rooms and overall a real treat. Thanks to all the team who made our stay so enjoyable once again. Would recommend this to anyone, I have never been disappointed and am always eager to return.",5,2017,01,10
133,Excellent Hotel and Staff,"A really enjoyable stay and what a great position. We stayed for 2 nights and the experience was great, from check in which we arrived at 2 hours early, but were still found a room immediately to the  restaurant staff and housekeeping all excellent.
The cleanliness of the hotel was excellent, the breakfast service brilliant and then there is floor 10 and what an experience in MIN JIANG.

After years of staying in the Covent Garden area the stay at the royal garden turned out to be a great change. We found ourselves exploring areas we previously hadn't travelled to and what an experience just walking up Kensington Gardens to taking a 5 minute walk to the Royal Albert Hall it was a new experience that was very enjoyable.

I would definitely recommend a trip to the hotel and all it offers.",5,2017,01,09
133,best in london,"i have stayed here for many years, both while on business and for pleasure. The park view rooms are perfect. great service, great position in london, relaxed friendly staff and never snooty. very well priced for this quality of hotel. many big stars stay here. so why not star spot at breakfast....I will be back again and again.....",5,2017,01,08
133,"Great location on Kensington High St, near the tube station and smack in the heart of London.","I requested for a room change with a view of the High street as I found the first rooms view uninspiring. They graciously complied. The location is brilliant and within walking distance of all the shops, Hyde park, Kensington Gardens, The Royal Albert Hall and much more.  They also have a National Car Park in the basement of the hotel which is so handy if you are driving.
Service was good and I would gladly stay there again.",4,2017,01,08
133,Underwhelming,"I was excited at the prospect of staying at such a prestigious hotel. There certainly was an old-school air of staff carrying bags in from the taxis outside but I had not been on my room for 5 minutes before I had housekeeping knocking on my door offering to ""turn my bed down"", obviously expecting a tip for the service. The room was small but clean and well-serviced but the tea and coffee facilities were the level you would find in a budget chain. The tea was weak and undrinkable, one of the milks had gone off. Underwhelming.",3,2017,01,08
133,Excelllent location and Services,"The Hotel is in an excellent location. Staff are friendly and attentive. Room was clean and impeccable. Only reservation I have relate to the inadequate closet space. I was alone and stayed only for one night so I did not have a serious problem with closet space but for a couple who plan to stay longer , it could be an issue.",5,2017,01,07
133,Nice Stay,"Location is great, service is wonderful.  The staff makes this a good place to stay.  The beds are not as comfortable as they should be.  Room and bath were clean and in good repair.  Same with the public areas.  ",4,2017,01,06
133,"location, views. but small rooms","Room is very small, we stayed 10 nights and had no where to put luggage etc. 
Internet is great, speed and reliable. 
Big windows with nice room views
Bathroom and shower work well, towel warmers, good water pressure etc. but very small.  Nice shaving mirror that doesn‚Äôt fog up. 
TV system is great with full Sky and easy to use 
We got mined pies on arrival.  We also got birthday wine and other items with compliments. 
When we arrived the room was setup for one person, one towel, one set of everything, had to get that fixed. 
Asked for more coat hangers because we were staying 10 nights but didn‚Äôt get them
We had 2 birthdays, and they delivered a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates, lovely touch. 
The lobby lounge is very nice, good food and service. 
Berties bar didn‚Äôt seem to be open at all, maybe the Christmas period. 
The Chinese restaurant is good, but far too expensive. 

",3,2017,01,05
133,prestigous Hotel,"Wonderful location,best for dining, shopping.
Well trained personnel good breakfast.
Early check in, helpful for the late check up.
Good views of Hyde Park.
Available parking in the High Street Kensington as very positive point.",5,2017,01,05
133,London's Best Location,"Simply the best location in London, only a couple of blocks from High Street Kensington tube station, right in the middle of tremendous shopping and dining, and overlooking William, Kate and Harry's home! ",5,2017,01,04
133,Solid choice in a great location,"Over the course of the last few years, I've now stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel several times. The facade isn't the most inspiring, but the interiors are more contemporary than the exterior, well kept, clean, and the location (at least for me) is ideal, with a bus stop right in front of the hotel, and a tube station within 5 minutes' walk, and the park next door. The staff are generally very good and efficient, although on my most recent trip I'd noticed a slight decline in standards, perhaps due to new staff (there were several trainees). If the management would care to get in touch, I can provide examples. But overall, it's a reliable option in a great location, which is why I return. ",4,2017,01,04
133,Great place to stay in London.,Great location in the heart of Kensington.  A few blocks from Kensington High Street Tube Station.  Several very good restaurants nearby.  A very good value for money.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  Rooms are large by typical London standards.  ,5,2017,01,04
133,New Years weekend stay.,"Fantastic hotel, loved every minute of our two days. Staff are brilliant, friendly and couldn't be more helpful. Room, Park View Suite (free upgrade) was incredible. Love the place. Would recommend, and hope to return.",5,2017,01,04
133,"Excellent location & helpful, friendly staff",Excellent location on Kensington High Street for shopping but also next to Kensington Park for lovely walks.  Staff welcoming and helpful. Great breakfast with lovely views of the park. Room and bathroom good size and very clean.,5,2017,01,04
133,Best in London ,"Couldn't get a better place to stay. Large rooms, clean and friendly staff. Right on the park and close to shops. 
Comfortable beds, and good sized bathrooms. 
This was a third visit and I would 100% stay here again when next in London. ",5,2017,01,03
133,Very nice hotel in an even nicer surrounding.,The hotel itself is very beautiful and the area even more. We have also tried the two restaurants and did not regret it at all. The whole staff is very friendly and helpful and made our visit to London around the turn of the year an unforgettable experience. We will certainly come back.,4,2017,01,03
133,NYE stay,"Not very happy about this hotel. We had to wait 2 hours over check in time as our room wasn't ready, we were told we would be contacted when it was ready and we wasn't. Because of this mistake we wasn't apologised too or given a later check out time or anything complimentary. This made our whole evening late and I was disappointed ",3,2017,01,03
133,Christmas Day Lunch!!,"An enjoyable visit spoilt by a very disappointing Christmas Day lunch. 
All other meals were to as very high standard  it was such a shame the lunch was ""overworked"" it would have been much better to have offered a classis traditional Roast Christmas Day Lunch!
Excellent location, very clean and tidy room, helpful and courteous staff.
 ",4,2017,01,03
133,Londons Best,"You won't regret it!  Staff are knowledgable, enthusiastic and friendly. The hotel is the cleanest in London - really.  There are 2 restaurants - both magnificent, no need for a taxi elsewhere!
The manager will leave soon and everything will change, that's how it works.  But! Maybe not here?! 
We'll see.",5,2017,01,02
133,NYE Stay,"Been here a few times over the years and it is always good. Choses a king room overlooking Kensington High St which was great for people watching from the ceiling to floor windows. Room was a good size for London. Staff are friendly and professional would consider staying again when next in London as long as the price remains competitive.,",5,2017,01,02
133,Excellent the second time!,"I stayed here for two nights in October and was really disappointed!! Small room, bad lunch etc..  Decided to go back a month later as the location is perfect for me. What a difference! Everything was great. The room was bigger with a lovely view on Hyde Park. The service was excellent from the reception to the bell boys and the room service.  I am really happy that I gave them a second chance and will certainly be back!",4,2017,01,02
133,Wonderful Hotel experience,"The Hotel staff made us very welcome, everyone seemed genuinely interested in making our stay a memorable experience. The Hotel always appears well maintained and provides a safe and peaceful environment matched by the warmth & welcoming staff at every level.",5,2017,01,02
133,Excellent location and quality hotel ,"Stayed 27-31 Dec and mainly a good time.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Didn't eat in either restaurant,  so can't comment on the food,  but the Bar was pleasant and comfortable. 
Two things... Turn-down service was erratic,  as in removing drinking glasses and leaving us short. 
Room Keys were deactivated every 24hrs due to ""staff training""  or lack of!  
Overall we would recommend this hotel for location and quality. Couldn't hear any traffic from the 7th Floor. ",4,2017,01,02
133,Excellent,"I like the location of the hotel but you don't have a lobby to have coffee we must go to the restaurant for that,,  the hotel is located in very nice and quite place and near to the pound which mostly we go to.
",5,2017,01,01
133,Great location and convenient hotel with friendly staff,Good location and friendly staff. Bus stop outside goes to oxford street and to harrods location or underground 5mins walk. Cocktails in Berties bar best i have had - delicious and beautifully presented. Good freshly cooked breakfast. Quality Quercus toiletries in rooms plus tea and coffee making facilities. ,4,2017,01,01
133,Always a great experience,"The Royal Garden Hotel always provides a comfortable, well equipped room, many with great views over Kensington Gardens and beyond. But what brings us back, time and again, are the delightful staff. Warm, friendly and efficient they are always ready to go the extra mile. A valuable tablet left in my room was quickly located and safely returned to me - newly bubble-wrapped!  If it's where you want to be in London you can book with confidence.",4,2017,01,01
133,Excellent,Excellent hotel to choose for holiday . Location is great and located near by all facilities required by tourist . Friendly staff and helpful. Fast to serve whenever we request for anything. Internet wifi is free and fast ,5,2017,01,01
133,Exeptional Venue strategically positioned with afdfordable luxury,"Our visit here was for four (4) nights and from the moment we arrived we found the staff delightful, the amenities exceptional, the location extremely flexible for visiting around the city and most of all the accommodation extraordinarily comfortable with a hint of indulgent luxury.

The rooms are accommodating neither cramped or overly generous in size.  The bathroom is a standout, with a large bath, excellent shower and ample room for two to get ready.

Staff are always pleasant and looking to assist you and can be approached with any query and they are ready with an answer, direction or solution.

Importantly as a visitor to London looking to all the 'traditional' tourist sites, it is a practical location and of course the adjacent Kensigngon Palace and Gardens make it feel less cramped than perhaps other establishments.  Right outside is a Big Bus (blue line) departure point, the ordinary buses and across the road the train station providing every opportunity to get around the city.

Kensington itself is a wonderful borough of London and has much to see and do, and enjoy.

This could easily be one of those go to hotels, where you would easily feel comfortable and almost at home on return.

The only thing that let down the experience was an inconsistent and unreliable Wifi, which if you were on business would drive you crazy, but as we were on holidays this really was one of those first world problems that didn't affect the stay significantly, really if at all.",4,2016,12,31
133,"Mediocre Hotel, Good Staff","This well-managed hotel is plagued by poor design, cheap decor, and an overall cold ""faux fancy"" tone. The location is fine, but certainly not close to most tourist attractions or any tube stop.
Our room faced a dirty courtyard on the second floor, despite requesting an upper-level room.  Bathrooms are fitting for a luxury hotel, with heated towel racks, oversized tubs, and intricate shower systems.  Bedrooms, however, feature cheap, chipped furniture, faux wood headboards, and cheap linens.  Certainly not 'luxury' caliber.
On a positive note, staff was accommodating, professional, and friendly.  Rooms and public spaces were clean and well-maintained.
Overall, however, I can't recommend this hotel when London holds some of the world's finest hotels - at comparable rates.",3,2016,12,30
133,a great place,"A truly excellent hotel experience. We thought every aspect was outstanding. Room was great, view was great and the food and service was excellent. Staff, we found, to be friendly and very helpful. For our purposes, the hotel location proved to be advantageous.",5,2016,12,30
133,Wonderful Location - Great Staff,"A short walk to Olympia Stadium, Royal Albert Hall, and so many other London landmarks and great shopping to boot! 
All the rooms have been renovated. Very caring staff and old style. Great concierge, front desk, bell and door staff. 
Best dim sum up in the penthouse at Min Jiang Chinese Restaurant - overlooking Kensington Palace and Gardens - amazing views!",5,2016,12,29
133,Amazing birthday treat!,"My husband and I stayed here as a treat for his 40th birthday and right from booking the staff couldn't do enough to help. Lots of contact and information provided to us. A couple of days before we arrived the hotel contacted us asking for our expected arrival time and then arranged an early check in for us. As promised our room was ready early for us, a garden room overlooking Hyde park. The room was lovely and the views amazing, well worth the extra money. I had pre booked half a bottle of champagne to be sent to the room but was given a whole bottle with compliments of the hotel. No sooner had it arrived they called to say it was upgraded to help us celebrate my husbands birthday and asking if we were comfortable and had everything we needed. We used the bathroom to freshen up for the evening before heading out and on our return found bed turned down and towels etc all replaced...they had even set the radio to come on with chilled out music! Room service was lovely although we did have to wait a while. The bed was comfy but the pillows were a little too soft for my liking. I'm sure they would of done something about that but to be honest I was too tired to ask. Breakfast was nice although not sure it was worth ¬£25 but again friendly helpful staff where nothing was too much trouble. This hotel is fantastic and would definitely recommend. Nothing was too much trouble and was a lovely treat.",5,2016,12,29
133,A&R Manager,"Great services, cleanliness, location, piccalo, food, tv services, Bathroom, friendly people. Only thing we had to wait for 45 minutes for a room to be done for my colleague. It wasnt ready when we arrived.",5,2016,12,27
133,Brilliant hotel!!,We stayed at the Royal garden hotel as a Christmas treat. And I have to say it's the best hotel I've stayed in. We felt so welcomed from the minute we walked through the door. The receptionist were so polite. The room was fantastic with great views. Room service was excellent and the food was great too. we even booked scooters out from reception to scoot round Hyde park. A must do! We had the best weekend.,5,2016,12,26
133,Good location but poor parking spaces,"This five star hotel has a great location, just on the corner of Kensington Park, room size is reasonable, as well as the lobby and restaurant. However, due to the limited amount of parking spaces I found it very hard to help my clients to check in without getting a parking fine. This is very incovenient.",4,2016,12,26
133,Christmas Break ,We've stayed here before and we're welcomed back. Lovely stay so far and a good hearty breakfast wonderful views over Hyde park. Close to Albert hall and easy walking distance to all shopping and Lebanese restaurants. ,5,2016,12,25
133,Wonderful,Very pleasant did everything a hotel should except the Doormen who seems far more interested in talking on there mobile phones and each other rather thank helping us find a taxi in the rain or helping my wife with her luggage ,4,2016,12,24
133,Excellent stay," We had an amazing stay here.   We had a great view of the palace.
 There is a turn down service at night which meant the bins were emptied and the bath cleaned and water provided.  The room was spotless . 
The breakfast spread is fantastic.  We got it included in the room rate.   I am not sure it is worth ¬£25 a head.   We were surrounded by children, and it is a buffet, so that price is too high - it's not fine dining.  
We stayed in a king room and did not pay extra for a view.  The room is plenty big enough. And the bathroom is big. Furniture in room reminds us of upmarket students accom.  
The location is brilliant for Kensington palace. Close to Kensington high street tube. And the design museum.  
Staff all really helpful.  We had a lovely stay here and would go back. ",5,2016,12,24
133,Festive afternoon tea,"My mum and I came here for festive afternoon tea as a Christmas treat. The park terrace is a beautiful room - very clean, modern yet classic, and with views across the park. The pianist playing in the corner really added to the ambience. 

The festive afternoon tea was great. Sandwiches were very tasty and it's a nice touch to have the opportunity to order more of your favourite sandwiches - if only more places did this! 

The cakes were also very good, although one or two were a little on the dry side. The Christmas scones were something to look forward to although in reality just tasted like plain scones.

My only complaint would be that I had asked at the beginning of the sitting whether I could choose one tea first then change later. I was told this was only available to the more expensive champagne tea package. The price of a tea bag cant be that high (I only wanted English breakfast and chai!) and it was a bit disappointing. However, props to our waiter, who will remain unnamed, as when I asked for a fresh standard teabag at the end of the sandwiches round, he said he'd change to chai for me as his manager wasn't looking...! 

To make it a 5* review - just let people try the different teas if they choose, it won't cost much!",4,2016,12,24
133,classy hotel on great location,"two night stay close to xmas.
super hotel located at one end kensington high street.good parking and close to local shops and resteraunts.Walking distance of kensington palace, breakfast overlooking hyde park.spacious room on second floor, simply excellent hotel with all you could want for ashort stay in london, harrods close and tube station close as well.",5,2016,12,23
133,Fabulous child friendly stay,"The location is perfect, we stayed in an executive room on the 8th with amazing views and perfect size for our family of 4. Kids had their own beds (a sofa pull out and a camp bed). Spotlessly clean and very nicely furnished. The staff are super friendly and helpful, gave us an early check in. The kids loved it so much they didn't want to leave and turned down Harrods ice cream parlour to head back early.  The hotel was he best part of this trip and we will return very soon. Thanks a million a brilliant stay.",5,2016,12,23
133,Disappointed,"Had asked for recognition of 80th birthday of party member and reminded hotel by phone a week before trip.?Not acknowledged. Complained at checkout,verbal apology the staff member followed us to exit with bottle of champagne which was declined as we were heading to airport for journey home. ",3,2016,12,23
133,Theatre weekend,"Transport from an to airport at 85¬£ very good. The staff is very helpful and friendly, so you will take some little odds easy . Garden room is surprisingly small though and there is too much street noise at night if You prefer sleeping with window open, unless it is not facing to Kensington Palace side. It is really close to most places of interest like Royal Albert Hall etc., overlooking Kensington Garden nicely. Overall a  wonderful place to stay. Free WLAN works great, breakfast not included, but 15 ¬£ is a reasonable price for what they offer.",4,2016,12,22
133,Disappointing Park Terrace experience,"The hotel is lovely and staff on receptionist very good.  Our experience, special 75th birthday celebration was let down by poor service in the Park Terrace restaurant.  We had to leave before our deserts arrived although we had booked pre-theatre dinner and made clear we had to leave by 7pm for RAH and the restaurant manager didn't seem bothered at all!  We'll not rush back!",3,2016,12,22
133,Theatre Trip,"We chose this hotel for its close proximity to the Albert Hall and Kensington Palace. The hotel is modern, light and airy with several restaurants and hotel bar. We stayed in Executive room which had ample room with a large bathroom all suitable for 3 ladies. We had breakfast in the park lane terrace and cocktails in Bertie's bar.  A most enjoyable stay had by all, would stay here again. ",5,2016,12,21
133,Simply Superb,"We attended a Christmas event at the Royal Garden Hotel, having had lunch there during the day. The hotel proved to be a top class venue, with staff to match. The food served both at lunch time and in the evening was excellent - not just the quality of it but how it was served in such a co-ordinated manner. There is parking available underneath the hotel which is extremely helpful too.",5,2016,12,21
133,very good,"The hotel is in the center of London. Clode to everything. The staff is very kind and nice and they helped a lot! we enjoyed the spirit of London and the people of London. The room was warm, clean and nice. ",5,2016,12,21
133,First class hotel,The Royal Garden is in an excellent location away from the West End next to Kensington Gardens and close to the shops and tube station in Kensington. We have stayed there several times before. Our most recent visit just before Christmas was very enjoyable. We had a lovely room overlooking the park. The service is first class - polite and informal. The food is very good. The hotel offers 5 star quality at a reasonable cost - great value for a top hotel in central London. It remains our first choice as a place to stay in London.,5,2016,12,20
133,Highly recommended,Me and my partner stayed for one night in December. the hotel is such an easy and convenient location. The staff go above and beyond to look after you and make you feel welcome. I would definitely book again. ,5,2016,12,20
133,1st time at The Royal Garden,"Excellent location,Top class hotel. The staff have excellent customer service skills and nothing is too much trouble. We attended the Min Jiang on Friday 16th Dec, excellent food and service(you must try Gong Bo prawns)",5,2016,12,20

Thank you to all the lovely staff for making our weekend so special. Min Juang chinese fine dining on 10th floor overlooking Kensington gardens was amazing too.,5,2016,12,20
133,A friendly and comfortable hotel,"For us, this hotel is in a super location as we like to visit the nearby Kensington museums. It was also lovely to have a view of Kensington Palace and Gardens from our room, even on a gloomy December morning. The room (Queen) was not huge, but it was very well equipped and very comfortable. We would have preferred slightly thicker and firmer pillows. Everywhere in the hotel was pristine. All staff were friendly and helpful. We were served everywhere very promptly, staff were always immediately available. We ate breakfast in the ground floor restaurant, it was delicious, and we had a drink in Bertie's Bar which we also enjoyed.",5,2016,12,20
133,Theatre stay,Excellent and enjoyable stay. This pre Christmas stay was due to our attending a Concert at the Royal Albert Hall. This was a return visit since we thoroughly enjoyed our previous stay. All Staff are excellent.,5,2016,12,19
133,Excellent Hotel,"Very good hotel - if it is within your price range. Some floors quieter than others, I guess not the fault of the hotel

There are different room types, to further improve the hotel something could be done about the noise the door makes when closing, a necessary feature but could prove noisy at times",5,2016,12,19
133,"Exceptionally friendly, impeccable housekeeping service","Great location with secure garage parking.  Short taxi rides to most sights and museums, shopping and west end.  Friendly, superb breakfast.  Possibly the cleanest hotel room we've experienced in a long while.  Very quiet garden facing room, immaculately maintained.  ",5,2016,12,19
133,A Gem in London!,"i only stay here for one night, but i have to said that after visiting Rome and Paris during the same week, this Hotel was the best one, everything is super clean and the room was spacious and comfortable, the stuff is great and friendly, i have to said that David and his team at the concierge department did a great job. i would definitely stay here again next time i am in London.",5,2016,12,15

133,Holiday with my boys,"It is my first time with my boys in Europe! The location is decent and hotel staff are very friendly. The hotel is near amenities; bus stop in front, supermarket and Kensington High St Station 3 mins walking distance away.   I love it that the hotel is next to Hyde Park! I get to jog around the park and my boys take the scooter with me. A truly picturesque sight! ",5,2016,12,15
133,Excellent family friendly hotel,"Excellent family friendly hotel, perfect location and great price for London.  We felt very comfortable staying here with our two young children, staff were very friendly, and our room was modern and spotless. We loved walking through Kensington Gardens each morning, and being able to borrow scooters and helmets from concierge for the children was wonderful. ",5,2016,12,15
133,London Stay,"An excellent location and high quality hotel which provided a really good base to explore London.

I would reccommend this hotel for the quality of service - access to excellent shopping and entertainment areas - food (both within the hotel and also the surrounding area).",5,2016,12,14
133,Royal garden hotel,"The overall experience at this hotel was very good. The location is ideal for a weekend in London. The amenities and service levels are excellent. Breakfast was very good. Plenty of choice and good quality in terms of produce, ambience and service. ",4,2016,12,14
133,A real treat,"We arrived home this evening after spending last night at the Royal garden Hotel. It is sumptuous! From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we were welcomed with friendliness and politeness and the receptionists were so helpful, as were the concierges . Every member of staff seemed genuinely pleased to deal with us and there was always a smile. The public rooms were elegant and beautifully decorated for Christmas. Small, personal touches, such as free mince pies, not only on the Concierge's desk but also 4 waiting for us in our room when we returned in the evening, made our stay feel so much more indulgent and relaxed. The room, overlooking Kensington Palace, was spotlessly clean, spacious and bright, with up-market toiletries, fluffy dressing-gowns and slippers. I drank a delicious Christmas cocktail, which the waiter recommended, and breakfast was a delight, with beautiful and varied fresh fruit and plenty of cooked options. We shall definitely return.",5,2016,12,13
133,Great hotel,"Simply great hotel in a gorgeous location. Lovely room with beautiful bathroom, great staff. the breakfast is amazing - following which, no desire for lunch. Can't wait to return next year for the BBC Proms.",5,2016,12,13
133,Small rooms but great location and facilities,This hotel is brilliantly placed for all the shops of Kensington  and the green space of Kensington Palace Gardens and Hyde Park.  Staff are polite and helpful.  The room we had was pretty small but contained everything I expected. It's a good hotel to stay in.,4,2016,12,13
133,Most rooms with an excellent view!,The overall experience needs to be considered in association with the room price which is very competitive in relation to other London 5 star hotels.  The rooms are functional and clean. Some may consider that the Hotel is not ideally located for access to the west end.  taxis can be expensive. ,4,2016,12,13
133,"Amazing location, lovely hotel","The hotel itself is beautiful! The views from the rooms are amazing! Great location with many shops etc around and nearest tube 4/5 min walk! Rooms great, breakfast nice, reception staff are lovely we had a trainee checking us in and out and he was great! 

Just overall fabulous hotel, great value for money! ",5,2016,12,13

133,Work Xmas Party,We had our work xmas party here. Rooms were lovely a spacious. Good temperature in the rooms and easy to adjust to your preferences. We were in the downstairs banquet hall which was lovely and the food was great. Had breakfast in the York suite. Very impressed with the selection available. Would come here again.,4,2016,12,13
133,Great for families,"Design of the room was really nice. A setting area facing the hydepark. The room has lots of mirrors which augments the size and adds a sence of spaciousness. The turn-down service is very through and consistent. Lots of shops, grocery stores and department stores around. Many good quality Restaurants around.In addition a falafel place , Rannoush is around the corner. Very safe neighbourhood ",4,2016,12,13
133,"Great location, view from the room and breakfast","The location is great, short walk from the tube, right on the park which we were lucky enough to have a view of from the room. There is also a car park under the hotel which was a bonus.  The rooms were lovely, couldn't fault it. Breakfast was probably one of the best we have ever had, never seen so much choice. Next time we are in London will defiantly be back here.",5,2016,12,13

I had a meeting in one of their meeting rooms and technical staff all very helpful.",5,2016,12,12
133,A Good Hotel that not easy find,"The place and clear and tiny .  The price is moderate.  I enljoy the food there.  The staff is very friendly and olite.
You find it feel at home.  The traffice is so convenitent that you can take MTR to go every where.  I love it.",5,2016,12,12
133,Excellent Lunch,"I booked Sunday lunch for 16 friends before we went to the Royal Albert Hall. Everyone was really impressed with the food, service and value of the meal and said they would definitely return.

Valentina was a great help in assisting me to organise so many people and ensured a special diet was catered for - thanks also to the Chef for being so accommodating.

Very easy to find - a short walk from the tube with friendly helpful staff and a professional manner that ensures we will return and hopefully stay.",5,2016,12,12
133,Family trip to London,Next to Hyde park for a run around. Short walk to tube to all londons attractions. Lovely big family room and huge bathroom. The Christmas decorations were up which made it a truly magical experience. Staff were always very helpful and we all loved the breakfast. ,5,2016,12,11
133,Different point of views,"This review must be taken from two aspects- travelers outside UK, visiting Uk for the first time, or UK visitors. Why? If you are a visitor outside UK, you must know that, in standards of most of the countries ( Sweden,Denmark,Germany,Croatia,Slovenia, Austria, etc..) this is not really 5 star hotel in our standards, more like 4-star. This is based on experience of travelling  once-two times a month to 4 and 5 star hotels in Europe. And if you book 4-star hotel in London, you will get 3 star in our standards, so- if you are used to 4-star hotels, you must book this one with 5-stars or some other at that range. As for this hotel, I must first say that cleaning ladies are really doing their job. Location is pretty good and it is interesting that in the centre of London, you have peace and quiet in rooms in the night. But, if you like to sleep longer in the morning, that would be hardly possible (till 9-10am), because the room doors are not quite sound proof, so you hear everything that's going on on the hall, mostly the doors from other rooms. I haven't experience that in any hotel so far. You also hear people talking in normal voices, like they are in your room. You also must know, that if you don't want that hotel staff (cleaning ladies, room something service) comes to your room (knock on the door and than coming in while I was half naked, four times in just an half an hour!), you have a switch behind the door, and you must put the red light on. Rooms are clean, bed is comfortable with great pillows. It is great that you have loud speaker also in bathroom, and really  nice that when you come to your room, cleaning lady switch on the radio, so you feel better when you come into the room where the music plays. As for the breakfast- it is OK, but if you want for example scrambled eggs, you have to order it- they don't have it with other food (I've never seen that). But the food is tasty, especially cottage cheese-the best I've eaten! Lots of fruits. You will also have to wait for the coofe a little bit, but the great thing (and I really appreciate this in hotels) is that you can make a coffe in your room. Only anoying thing about breakfast is when you come to the restaurant and say your room number, you can't go and choose your own desk. No! The lady who works there leades you to your table and she will decide where will you sit. That's really anoying. So, all together, if you are visiting from Uk , and all those stuff I write that bodered me are normal to you, than the hotel really meets it's purpose and standards.
 But, if you are used to fine hotels around the Europe, you will have some things bodering you here.",4,2016,12,11
133,The worst staff attitude ever,"I have never been in a hotel where staff act in a rude and impolite way like this one especially the ones in the resturant. Hospitality is a big zero in this hotel, their location doesn't mean nothing when u get this level of service at what suppose to be 5 star hotel.",1,2016,12,10
133,Reservation issue,We have stayed many times and booked the Harrods promotion but were only given a standard room on arrival with no breakfast. We showed Reception our emails but they were disinterested in sorting out the matter so we left the next morning unhappy with the experinec. ,3,2016,12,10
133,Another fantastic stay at my home away from home,"As a frequent traveller I'm used to "" . . .  living out of my suitcases at yet another hotel . . . "" but the Royal Gardens Hotel is not just ""another hotel"", it really has become my home away from home!!",5,2016,12,10
133,room,"very clean and quiet
peaceful and a good rest
cocktail; bar pleasant and the location was perfect for our needs
two very good days were had and achieved most of our Christmas shopping
will certainly come back",5,2016,12,09
133,Quick Tip to London,"Hotel in a lovely spot right in the middle of everything, beds uncomfortable hard and pillows the complete opposite, staff very welcoming, rooms need to be cleaner walls particular were very dusty . Great choice for breakfast and good service  ",3,2016,12,08
133,Visit to london,We have stayed here a number of times and this is an excellent hotel with a great position particularly for the Royal Albert Hall. For a London hotel it is particularly good value for money. The restaurant food was very good and the cocktail menu is well worth a try.,5,2016,12,08
133,Perfect location and 5 star hotel incl service and food,"Once again we come back to this hotel, where we were threated in the best way. The room, garden view is very nice, the breakfast outstandig as were the other meals we had. We are impressed by the staff, professional and personal. ",5,2016,12,07
133,Hotel right next to the park,Great location this is hotel right next to the park which is what makes it quite unique. The service was good and the staff friendly. The rooms and bathrooms are not the most luxurious but are well appointed. ,4,2016,12,07
133,Just Book It.,"I‚Äôve been fortunate to have visited London dozens of times over the years and have written a few of those hotel reviews on TripAdvisor.  In past visits, I‚Äôve typically leaned towards staying in what I would call more ‚Äòbudget‚Äô properties ($100-$200 USD range). Not this trip.

In my opinion, if you can jump up into the $200-$250 a night range‚Äîyou can improve the quality of your stay a hundred fold from those lesser options. The Royal Garden Hotel is the perfect example.  It‚Äôs not an old house or apartment turned into a hotel where walls are thin, rooms are tiny and beat up, heat is poorly regulated, odd stair cases/elevators, water temperatures fluctuate, and staff is undervalued.  It‚Äôs a real hotel‚Äîa property with professional and well-trained people, and excellent accommodations. It checks all the boxes: easy check in, friendly employees, clean/quiet rooms, comfortable beds, modern bathrooms, good dining options and room service, workout facilities, solid Wi-Fi connections, turn down service, plenty of TV/channel options and the list goes on and on.  

The location doesn‚Äôt hurt either; minutes to the park, public transportation, museums, and excellent dining options. The only thing missing was an ice machine and pay for view movies!  So, here are my top 5 recommendations if you should stay at The Royal Garden Hotel:

1. High Street Kensington Tube station is a five minute walk away.  It‚Äôs convenient and cheap.  Traffic has become a horrible problem in London and Taxi service is not cheap or time efficient.  While we love Taxi‚Äôs in London, I‚Äôm sorry to advise you to stay clear unless traveling during non-peak times.  I‚Äôd be embarrassed to share with you how much we spent on Taxi‚Äôs and how long they took.  Plus, taking the Tube allows you to explore‚Ä¶ and get a little lost. 

2. While there‚Äôs a Starbucks across the street, go to Aubaine instead.  This is a wonderful little French Caf√© one block away with great food and wonderful service. Speaking of food, the best two pubs within walking distance would be Gloucester Arms (15-minutes) and Prince Edwards Pub (25-minutes). You can take Kensington Palace Gardens Road which is right in front of the hotel, past all the embassy buildings up to Bayswater Road to near Prince Edwards. Caf√© Diane is right there too if you want a late night dessert. Great little neighborhood places without a lot of tourists. 

3. Visit the Victoria and Albert Museum (25-minute walk). While I‚Äôm not a huge museum guy, this one is unique and a real treat to walk through. I'd plan 3-4 hours. Right next to the V&A Museum is the Natural History Museum... and its outdoor ice skating rink. Go!

4. Afternoon tea at the Park Terrace (first floor of The Royal Garden Hotel). Make reservations.  If you visit London and have never done a formal tea‚Ä¶ well, you should. 

5.  Take a morning run through Hyde Park. It‚Äôs one of the largest and most beautiful outdoor spaces in the world so use it. It‚Äôs a distance of about four miles to circle the outer pathways. Take a few breaks to feed the swans at Round Pond or grab a bench next to The Albert Memorial.  Take it all in baby!

I can‚Äôt say enough about our stay at The Royal Garden Hotel.  Our expectations were exceeded from the moment the reception clerk checked us in and then walked us up to personally show us our room (yes, that really happened); to the moment our bags were placed in the van to take us to the airport. My wife, daughter (9-years-old) and I will be back next year.

133,20¬£ FOR 3 SLICES OF BREAD - UNDER THE BANNER ENGLISH BREAKFAST,"When you sit down for breakfast a smiling waiter ask you if you would like some toast with your breakfast. All good and you confirm that toast can be good,  although there is plenty of bread and rolls on the buffet table.
Three thin slices of toast is served, and in our case we did not eat them as the rolls from the buffet table were good.
At the end of the breakfast you are served with a check of 20¬£ for the 3 slices of toast calling it English breakfast.
We all felt it was a rip-off, something that we would not expect from such a high priced hotel.",3,2016,12,06
133,Mostly good,"We visited this weekend for one night. 

First impressions were good. The lobby is very nice and the staff polite and helpful. 

The hotel is also very clean. The room and bathroom were spotless. The fixtures are fairly basic but perfectly functional. The beds are huge and comfortable. 

The view over Kensington Gardens from the room was lovely. 

The location is great. Walking distance to Hyde Park and The Royal Albert hall. 

The main issue we had was VERY loud music when we went to bed. It was around midnight when we got back and it sounded like we were above a night club. This really needs to be sorted. 

I would stay again.

133,Fantastic stay! ,"We stayed here for one night on 3rd December 2016 and what an amazing experience we had. 

Approaching the hotel from Kensington high street it certainly looks impressive, particularly with the lovely Christmas lights. There was also a beautifully decorated huge Christmas tree in the foyer.

From the moment we arrived the service was fantastic. We left our bags before our 2pm check in and explored the nearby shops which are right on the doorstep of the hotel. The tube station is also a stones throw away and Harrods is only a short walk. When we arrived back at the hotel to check in our bags had been taken up to our room-perfect! After we checked out there was also an option to leave our bags at the hotel. We asked two members of staff about getting to different places in London and both were knowledgable about the area and bus/tube routes. 

The room itself was lovely. A comfy bed, clean and with a spectacular view over Kensington palace and gardens. There is also free wifi. The extra touches such as robes and slippers were great, as was the heated towel rail and speaker in the bathroom allowing you to listen to the TV/music whilst showering. The shower was hot and powerful! 

Attention to detail made our stay so special. On turning on the TV my name appeared welcoming us to the hotel, there was also a personalised message when we rang the concierge service to order our complimentary newspaper. 

We had a cocktail in Berties bar which was great (lots of alcohol) and came with complimentary nibbles. The bar had a nice view over the lobby. 

Breakfast was very tasty with an impressive selection of continental and cooked breakfast choices. The waiter service at breakfast with hot drinks, toast etc added to the experience.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and can't wait to return in the near future. A fantastic hotel- thank you! ",5,2016,12,05
133,Location,"One of the best locations in London, staff were amazing, helpful and very delightful.
i lost my wallet but they found it for me very trust worthy hotel. will definitely visit again this hotel in the near future.",4,2016,12,02
133,Good hotel close to all attactions,"Here for a 'do' and very good it was to.
Nice sizable room overlooking High street but on 9th floor so quiet.
Good food and very clean as one would expect from this class of hotel.
Best rooms overlook Hyde Park .",5,2016,12,01
133,Simply the best !,"Excellent in every way........cannot thank the staff enough. Bed turn down service was very surprising and a great addition.
Location is a definite must. Right on top of all the stores.
Very clean hotel with excellent service all around.",5,2016,11,30
133,royal garden hotel,I find this to be a very nice hotel and if the servant in the bar had behaved as rest of the staff I would give top score to all of the questions. The rooms are well equipped  with very good beds. Breakfast is exccellent,4,2016,11,30
133,A perfect stay,"This hotel was located next to the park and Kensington Palace.  Perfect location for traveling with family.  We were able to walk to the Natural History Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum and Royal Alberts Hall.  We were a few blocks from the tube station and a short walk to many shops and restaurants.  The staff ere all so friendly and accommodating.  The restaurants and room service were top notch.  We had an executive room which was perfect for traveling with our nine year old son.  We also scheduled a traditional British Tea at the Royal Gardens and it was a lovely way to experience that truly British past time.",5,2016,11,29
133,Wonderful stay at the Royal Garden Hotel,"We had a wonderful 8-day stay at the Royal Garden Hotel.  The room on the 10th floor had a fantastic view of Kensington Palace and the park.  It was a comfortable room with a large bathroom (separate shower and bath), a sofa and desk.  The hotel is quite quiet if you have a room facing the park.  Hotel staff is very friendly and attentive and the rooms were always cleaned really well.  

The location can't be beaten!  The High Street Kensington tube station is a short walk away and several bus lines stop right in front of the hotel.  There's a Whole Foods up the block and a number of restaurants and convenience stores across the street.  There's a dry cleaning and shoe shine service across the street as well if you need it.

Seems to be a popular hotel with sports teams as we saw Everton and South Africa's Rugby team stay at the hotel while we were there...which was pretty cool.    

Overall a fantastic stay and highly recommended.",5,2016,11,29
133,Such an unhygienic place!!,"Such a disappointment! Their gym and spa ( even difficult to name it ""Spa"", I would rather call it a GP practice and not in a good area ) do not follow hygiene at all! They have NO sanitary bins in the toilets! I had to put my used sanitary towels in my handbag and check if there any other bins in the hotel. Likely, I found sanitary bin, in the toilet next to bertis bar upstairs. Why do you put sanitary bins in one part of the hotel but not in the healthclub?!?! I think this is very obvious, that people wants to use a toilet after treatment or workout!

Do not recommend this place!",1,2016,11,29
133,"COUNT ON IT AS A 3 STAR HOTEL, DOUBLE THINK WHEN YOU WANT TO BOOK!","The heater is very very loud and you cannot sleep when it is on. I ask the reception for a solution and they promised to fix it but they never follow up, it happened every night till the last night we spoken to the night manager and he himself managed to give us a portal heater what they were able to give us from the day 1. As I booked the room in non-refundable rate for the first time, even if I wanted to leave the hotel first day, they charged then I stayed hoping for an improvement. I had just one night sleep out of 4 nights stay.
All the furnitures got old and need to be replace for a five star hotel.
The floor carpet is dirty and iPod doc is still suitable for iPhone 4!
No body cares about you and the worse feeling is ignorance, even when I wanted to talk  with morning manager at the check out, he told me he is going to follow up the case and email me, which they send me an email few hours after I left the hotel with the note that we checked and during your stay it was all the time the room temperature 25+ but they never mentioned that if you turn on the heater for not freezing, you cannot sleep because it is the noisiest.  the point is that I was already there and I was unsatisfied maybe I felt better if they left me an excuse note during my stay.
AFTER ALL, YOU WILL FEEL COLD, IGNORED STAYIN IN A MODERATE FACILITIES ROOM, IT IS A 3 STAR HOTEL NOW. IT WAS BETTER IN THE PAST.

It wasn't my first stay there, then whatever I post is my experience over These years. The only plus point now is location for this hotel!",1,2016,11,29
133,Review,"A Superb Luxury Hotel where ALL the staff are helpful & friendly.  Breakfast is truly wonderful which caters for everyone.  Located right in the heart of South Kensington with everything right on your doorstep, from Restaurants, Coffee shops, bus stop right outside with tube a short walk. The room was very well appointed with the view over Kensington Gardens...it could not have been better....I WILL be returning to this Hotel that's for sure ",5,2016,11,29
133,A very enjoyable and comfortable weekend in one of the best locations in London,"We have stayed here many times and are always amazed at the quality of food and service at our annual dinner dance where up to 200 guests are served with hot food  (and plates) so seamlessly.
The quality and equipment of the rooms is excellent",5,2016,11,29
133,Excellent,"It was really nice to come in and received 2 bugs for the kids with lots of goodies and everything was clean and everyone was so nice 
The location was excellent and close to everything 
We will comeback hopefully soon ",5,2016,11,29
133,Five start hotel with less than 3 star service,"I booked a room for one night to celebrate my husbands birthday. A few days before arrival I contacted the hotel and asked for some truffles and a birthday message to be in our room upon arrival as a little surprise for my husband.

We arrived at 2.10pm and expected to be checked in straight away due to check in being 2pm at the hotel. We were told our room wasn't ready and to leave a phone number so they could contact us when it was ready.

We decided to leave our baggage at the hotel and take a look around Kensington High Street while we were waiting. It got to 2.30pm and we hadn't heard anything from the hotel so decided to get a bite to eat. We finished eating at 3.30pm and there was still no call from the hotel so I called them.
After around 5 minutes of waiting I was told our room was ready and they apologised for no one ringing me

Upon arrival we went to reception to get the key cards and was told that someone had left a voice-mail on my phone after we had left, this was a lie. I had full service on my phone and no missed call or voice-mail.

When we arrived in our room, I obviously expected the requested truffles and note to be in the room, it wasn't.
I went back down to reception and was told that these would be bought up at sometime before 5pm - I wasn't happy with this because i was assured in the email from the hotel that these would be in our room on arrival so they said they would get these sent straight away.
When I asked why these weren't in the room on arrival I was told that they are never sure what room we will be in until we collect the key cards - this didn't seem to stop them leaving our baggage in the room before we collected the key cards so this didn't make sense to me.

When the truffles did arrive, there were only six and I had ordered nine. I did mention it to reception when I checked out and wasn't charged for the truffles because of this.

Overall the hotel is lovely with beautiful views. The rooms are very small but comfortable. The continental breakfast in the hotel was really nice with plenty of choice but the cooked breakfast wasn't as good as we have had previously in other hotels. We didn't eat dinner in the hotel restaurant during this stay but have eaten previously and on that occasion the food was stunning.

We went to this hotel with very high expectations after reading the reviews on here but we don't feel these were met after a few things went wrong and tainted the overall stay.

Because of this, I don't think I would return here to stay the night.",3,2016,11,28
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"For a family break, an ideal place to stay given location of hotel and the staff. Children were made to feel very welcome indeed. At the top of Kensington High Street, next to the park and close to tube, buses etc, a perfect spot close to central London.",5,2016,11,28
133,Fabulous hotel and excellent value,"This is a wonderful hotel. Everything oozes quality, with highly attentive and friendly staff. Facilities are very good and the location by Kensington Palace gardens is excellent. Service is faultless, with a very reasonably priced and comprehensive room service menu and a terrific restaurant.
I've stayed in some decent hotels like the Ritz and other LHW hotels and this is my favourite.
Moreover, it is excellent value. You can get a room for 1.5x Premier Inn price and we're talking here of world class standard.
Royal Garden Hotel: I hope I can stay with you again!",5,2016,11,28
133,Luxury stay.,"The Royal Garden is excellently located with friendly, knowledgable staff and extremely comfortable surroundings. Our stay was pure luxury with an unbeatable view of London and Kensington Gardens. Would recommend to anyone.",5,2016,11,28
133,Exceptional Staff,"Only stayed one night , but staff were exceptional, warm , friendly and helpful.  Room was a little small but clean tidy and functional , quiet and well stocked , apart from lack of peppermint tea!.  Well placed for key points of interest.  ",5,2016,11,27
133,Not too bad,Stayed here over the weekend and my friend booked the hotel through secret escapes so the fact we paid less through a deal I think we got given a smaller room. Rooms very clean mini bar is expensive so didn't buy anything. Staff pretty pleasant. Would stay again as location is great. Wasn't wowed by the room but wasn't in it long enough really ,4,2016,11,27
133,Classy and convenient ,"I booked our family for a week's stay at the Royal Garden Hotel because it seemed like the kind of place that values its customers and treats everyone with class. I have not been disappointed! We opted for a nicer room to ensure that our 17month-old daughter would have enough space to run around. As it turned out they upgraded us beyond our wildest dreams and now we're enjoying a suite with plenty of room. I can't say enough about how friendly and helpful the staff have been, from reception to room service, the bellmen to the housekeepers--everyone has made us feel welcome. 

The location is great for enjoying Kensington garden and for shopping on the high street. There are good restaurants nearby (the Goat is our favorite) and Whole Foods is a block away. The Tube is two blocks away and several buses stop directly in front of the hotel to get into the city center easily. Both restaurants in the hotel are exceptional, but pricey. We found the room service menu to be extensive and cheaper than the restaurants. 

I know this review may be skewed because of our exceptional experience, but just the overall mood of the place is vibrant and friendly. I highly recommend it for families and couples. ",5,2016,11,27
133,Favourite London Hotel,"We recently had a 2 night stay at the Royal Garden Hotel. Everything was great from the moment we arrived. Staff on the desk and customer relations were exceptional. One couple in our party of 5 received an upgrade to a suite and we also had complimentary champagne. This all helped to make our special occasion (an investiture at Buckingham Palace) even more memorable.
We were all impressed by the quality of facilities, rooms and food as well as staff.
We will be returning to this hotel in the future.",5,2016,11,27
133,PEOPLE SMILING,"very kind welcome from all staff and everyone enjoying their job, everyone very professional with a smile , room very clean , to recommend to friends both for pleasure n business , excellent location , it's wordenfurl to walk to the park just 1 minutes oustside lobby.",5,2016,11,26
133,A Royal experience,"An excellent hotel.  Room (queen) perfect for one.  Staff very attentive and friendly.  Great breakfast,  either English or other. Gym, real,  extensive. Highly recommended,  ten minutes from Ken high St tube,  with a case.  As A former Londoner,  would definitely return",5,2016,11,26
133,Great function room and conference facilities,"This is the 3rd year my company has hosted the Winter briefing and party here. We have been provided with a buffet hot lunch , coffee breaks , cocktails and then a 3 course meal 
The hotel provides a great setting for our briefing and then converts the function room into a dining area with great table settings 
Service was good and timely . Staff efficient and personable",4,2016,11,25
133,Good experience,"Everything is great except the air condition. When we arrive, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Air condition only had cold wind the next 2 days. The room was cleaned everyday. I think if the problem of air condition can be solved, I will come here again",5,2016,11,25
133,"Solid Value and Service, but that's not the best thing...","The best thing about this hotel is it's incredible location.  It is literally at  the edge of Kensington Gardens on one side and, on the other side is the entrance to a street that is referred to as being home to the most expensive real estate in the United Kingdom--a billionaire's row that you must see.  In a way, it's like stepping back in time to where the family at Downton Abbey would have had their London home.  To walk in Kensington Gardens is truly a rare treat--the beautiful old-growth trees, the horses, and the dogs all acting like puppies at playtime.  This is a setting in which you can easily spend an hour or two in walking meditation--absolutely wonderful.",5,2016,11,24
133,Good clean hotel but no experience,"Returning guests here- we love the location and the size of the rooms. However, for the price payed you can do better. I feel it has gone downhill- absolutely no guest service. Members of the staff, even though polite, were impersonal and cold. As returning guests, we expected more. We had nice stays here, in exactly the same type of rooms, better view, bigger, airier...However, the last stay was not up to the expectations. We travelled for my birthday- as a special gift-room appointed (204) had absolutely no view and was cramped. Shower gel was never replenished even though we said this to the staff at the reception the 3rd day- had to buy shower gel from nearby supermarket. Also with the other amenities (like make up removal pads). HDMi in room did not work, room got cold during the night and the fan was noisy...The only positive thing I could say for this stay was the chinese restaurant in house which was very good and with the best view over London. It was expensive but I guess you can splurge a little sometimes and I am happy to do so to enjoy a short holiday but it is not the case with the hotel. For the money we payed we could have done better, even in Kensington area.",3,2016,11,23
133,Great trip.,"This is a good quality hotel in a great location with easy access to the city's transport network. Our Queen room was very comfortable, clean and fitted to a high standard. We stayed 3 nights and would happily return to this hotel.",5,2016,11,23

133,Superb as usual,"Cannot fault this hotel stayed only one night this time, every member of  staff works to ensure your comfort and nothing is to much trouble. The buffet breakfast is always superb and the view of the park just adds to the experience. I have been returning to this hotel for 15 years and will continue to return each time in London.",5,2016,11,22
133,Weekend of Leisure,Excellent accommodation which I would thoroughly recommend  - the attention to detail shown by the hotel staff was fantastic. We went to a west end show and the travel information given by the concierge staff was of great assistance and allowed us to plan our weekend with a degree of accuracy ,5,2016,11,22
133,A great experience,"We were at Royal Garden Hotel  23 years ago and our feeling has been confirmed today: top class hotel for quality, staff, comfortability, location and food. We will recommend it to everybody who wants to stay in the most charming London!",5,2016,11,22
133,Royal Gardens Hotel Kensington,"We have stayed in this hotel many times now,   5 Star accomadation  for far less money than Savoy or Dorchester with everything you expect from a  5 Star hotel.  Just a short walk for the Albert Hall and a brisk walk passing the Maclaren and Ferrari  Garages on the way   to Buckingham Palace and the center of London..... and a superb chinese restaurant on the 10 floor,
We had a super weekend!!!!",4,2016,11,22
133,Excellent hotel,"This is the third time we have stayed at this hotel this year and each time we have come away wanting to return.

Really good breakfasts and our pre theatre meal in the Park Terrace restaurant was exceptional.
",5,2016,11,22
133,Family Getaway,"We are regular visitors to this hotel and it never lets us down.
Its service, location, size, staff, food and rooms are always fantastic and that we always return.
The level of service and the overall quality of the hotel is second to none. We are probably slightly bias as we were upgraded to the penthouse suite but even if we hadn't been I would have been delighted with this hotel!",5,2016,11,22
133,As good as ever!,"We stay here each November for our annual family reunion and the hotel and its staff never disappoint.  Great location, luxurious rooms, friendly and helpful staff and one of the best hotel buffet breakfasts you could wish for!",5,2016,11,22

133,Superb stay - even for a business trip!,"Had a three night stay for a training course, I was upgraded and had a lovely view of Kensington Gardens. The room has spacious and had everything I needed. The staff are very attentive, nothing is too much trouble. The hotel is located close to High Street Kensington Tube station and is literally a 5 mins walk. The food is also very delicious!",4,2016,11,21
133,Fantastic venue for large corporate event,"First class hotel, offering excellent conference facilities and excellent event and catering team.  Made my life so easy in planning a week long, complex and challenging event.  A joy to work with.  This venue will now be one of our preferred suppliers!",5,2016,11,21
133,Royal escape,"Fantastic location, lovely staff, nothing too much trouble. Added bonus to have Kensington gardens right behind the hotel. Also visited the roof top garden - amazing! The food was excellent and attention to detail was incredible.",5,2016,11,20
133,One night stay,"Visiting the Royal Albert Hall for a concert. The hotel stay was a wedding present. Our room was lovely overlooking Kensington Palace on the 10th floor. Berties Bar was a bit of a disappointment as we were the only customers present at 10.30pm. The staff were superb, friendly and efficient. ",5,2016,11,20
133,Home away from home,I've been here dozens of times and staff know me and always make me feel welcome! Service is very good and always friendly. Special wishes are never a problem and it feels like they really understand what you mean and need. ,5,2016,11,20
133,Royalty Service at the Royal Gardens,"This is my second stay at this hotel, on the first visit was mainly because of location and ease of moving around London, however the friendliness, service, comfort and attention to detail from the staff was the crown reason for my return on the second visit and will be for my other visits..",5,2016,11,19
133,Corporate event,"I have no idea what it is like to stay here as only came for a lunchtime event. All I can say is if they treat their guests like they treated me on a day trip I would never stay here!!
My company had said about my serious nut allergy prior to the event. When I raised it there was an element of surprise! I was then told every main course on the buffet was fine. Really?!!! Thai curry with coconut milk??!! Are you trying to kill me or do you not care??!!
When i then asked for the spoon to be changed for the rice this was greeted with surprise and anger!
I then asked for an alternative dessert. After 30mins and 3 requests this did not arrive. 
5* really?! It might be in price but definitely not in service!!",2,2016,11,18
133,Fancy but flawed,"The inside is beautiful. But the service is flawed. I was checked in with a friendly reception. But was never asked if I'd prefer a smoking or non-smoking room. When I walked into my room, the HEAVY scent of perfume, the lingering smell of cigarettes and the presence of a fat ashtray alerted me that I'd been given a smoking room. I had to get the pillows swapped out, because they stunk. I ate at both restaurants on site. The one on the first floor was lovely. The food delicious. The staff accommodating and friendly. The Chinese restaurant was another story. The food was fine to good. But the staff was snooty and rude, sneering at my companion and I or offered clipped answers to our questions. Most troubling, the waitress served us a dish with cashews, which was not listed on the menu and which my companion is VERY allergic to. We told her once we saw them, and she insisted she had told us. Then asked flatly if we'd like the dish made again without. Nuts are a pretty common allergy. Her blase response stunned me. Then, when we asked for a takeout container for the rest of our food, she was baffled. She told us they don't do that. But suggested wrapping it in foil and leaving it at reception. It was the weirdest thing. You're a restaurant IN a hotel. Assume tourists will be there. Assume they might want to take food back to their rooms. Also, my last night there, there was so much ruckus in the halls I woke up with a start. I was so spooked it took me ages to get back to sleep. ",3,2016,11,17
133,Super stay ,"The royal garden hotel is In a great location right beside Kensington palace and Gardens. There are many pubs and restaurants nearby and good shopping. We were very fortunate to be upgraded and were given a suite overlooked Park and London. The hotel is modern spotlessly clean and has great staff. From the reception staff to the cleaning staff,all courteous and efficient. The buffet breakfast included hot food and a wide range of fruit yoghurt breads fruit juices etc.We will definitely return ",5,2016,11,16
133,Fantastic stay!,"Although it was just a one night stay, our room was so comfortable after a flight from across the pond. The room was quite spacious with a raised seating area and the most comfortable bed!

Great location with bus stop outside hotel and the venue only a 10 minute walk away.  When leaving Albert Hall after concert we caught a bus back to the hotel and couldn't believe that it only took 8 minutes from leaving venue to being in our hotel room.  Staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful.  The room that we had was compact but comfortable and clean with a good view of Kensington Garden outside window.  Excellent breakfast in the morning with lots of choice.  Hotel itself is also convenient for the shops in High Street Kensington and Kensington Palace for sightseeing.,5,2016,11,14

133,The rates of Hotel/Location,I think the hotel should provide an average rate valid for whole staying period and especially during normal season. The location of the hotel near Kingston Park/high street remains very attractive for relaxation and for business meetings   ,3,2016,11,13
133,Pleasant & Comfortable stay,"very pleasant hotel , and well located

133,What a fantastic staff at Berties Bar,"I have visited this bar with my friend in November.On the door was a very polite doorman I can't really remember his name( might be Carlo or Carol ). I asked him about the bar in a the hotel, he convinced us to try the bar. We had an extremely warm welcome from Wilmos and Adam, these guys were very friendly and knowledgeable!!!

Thanks again for a lovely service!!!!",5,2016,11,12

133,Hotel Heaven in Kensington,My husband and I recently stayed in the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington. We had a wonderful time. The manager and staff were extremely helpful and pleasant . The hotel facilities were excellent and our room was of the highest quality. The hotel was situated beside Kensington gardens and we were able to spend a lot of time walking in the gardens and shopping in Kensington High Street. The tube station was close by and we were also near the area of Notting Hill and Portabello market on Saturday morning is a treat . We look forward to visiting this hotel again.,5,2016,11,10
133,Very enjoyable overnight stay,We stayed here overnight when attending a concert at The Royal Albert Hall so location was perfect. We had a complimentary upgrade on our room which was ready on arrival and we were personally shown around by Receptionist. All staff were extremely helpful and friendly. ,5,2016,11,10
133,One Night Stop,"The welcome we received could have been a little more friendly, however they were fairly busy therefore I put it down to that. We did arrive a little early and our room wasn't ready and we therefore left our cases with the concierge which was fine.
We returned later and collected our luggage and went to the room to get ready to go to our function.
The room was very good, exactly what we needed.
We arrived back fairly late and had a good night's sleep and then we had breakfast which was very good. They also allowed us to store our cases for the day as we had another event to go to in the evening. This we did and collected them our way to the restaurant.
All in all it was a good experience and we would recommend this hotel.",4,2016,11,10
133,Another London Gem.,"Convenient location, great staff from reception to concierge. Nothing was too much trouble, every member of staff always had the time to accommodate any requests, The Royal Garden makes you feel very Royal. ",5,2016,11,10
133,Excellent stay,"Great hotel, excellent service. 
Nice room with everything you need. 
Great breakfast and most of all the location is amazing. 5 minutes from high st Kensington
lots of bars and restaurant nearby and seconds from the park for an stroll.
Perfect!",5,2016,11,10
133,"Great hotel, great location",Stayed for one night.  Location chosen for its proximity to Royal Albert Hall where we were attending a concert.  Lovely view from our room overlooking Kensington Gardens. Room very comfortable and staff very helpful,5,2016,11,09
133,Wonderful experience,"Great location. The high street ane high end shops are all closeby.  I was allowed to check in early.  Professional staff who were always helpful and responsive to requests.  The room was very clean and cozy, although not very spacious. I will definately stay there again.

",5,2016,11,09
133,Wonderful experience,"You have a brilliant and helpful staff. The hotel is well located in central London, allowing me to explore using it as a hub. From reception, to concirege, to your guest services, like room service to valet, I was very pleased!",5,2016,11,09
133,Excellent Location & Great Service,Great location.  Very close to shopping and the tube station. Excellent service oriented staff.  Overall it was a quite comfortable experience.  The room was small by American standards but quite adequate by European.  Pillows are very important for a good night's sleep when traveling.  Here the pillows were one of the best in this class of hotels ,5,2016,11,08
133,5* Service in an ideal location for Kensington.,"Just returned from a two night stay.
Service from all staff was 5*.This,and the room with a view,is what we will remember and encourage us to return.
I would suggest you book directly with the hotel for added treats/value.We received early check-in,a welcome gift of a bottle of wine and free room service for breakfast.
If your budget allows,book a room with views of Kensington gardens,use room service for breakfast and escape the 'rush' that all hotels can suffer from at breakfast time.Bliss.
My one gripe,and it's not the fault of the hotel,is that there is no outside space in which to sit and relax with a coffee or drink.Indeed,if you wish to smoke then you'll need to exit the front door and turn right 30 yds to a small seated area where you can meet all sorts of 'interesting' people not staying at the hotel.I realise,smoking is the new social anathema,but a decent cigar after a pleasant (and expensive) meal is still enjoyed by many.An elegant communal smoking room is provided by The Excelsior Galia in Milan.Perhaps the Royal Garden could consider something similar in future.",5,2016,11,08
133,Business meeting and night's stay at the Royal Garden Hotel,"Business meeting over two days with an one night stay. The meeting rooms were clean, well equiped, tea and coffee plus lunch and break snacks were lovely. My bedroom was clean and relaxing. Located in a very good position, easy transport links. Dinner there was a good selecton of food but the pre-dinner drinks' service was extremely slow. Check in and out were efficient",3,2016,11,08
133,Great location,"The hotel is placed in a great location because there are lots of shops such as zara, primark and etc Just a few minutes away. There are lots of cafes around as well that you can eat you breakfast. It's just by hyde park so you can easily go for morning runs. the only thing that I didn't like about the hotel was breakfast which was not my favourite but that was no problem at all because of the cafes around. 
The rooms have great views to enjoy. Overall you will be having pleasent and enjoyable time in this hotel.",5,2016,11,08
133,Great London Hotel,Great location and a really wonderfully run hotel.  Staff was friendly and helpful and the room overlooked the park.  Truly a find! I would not hesitate to both recommend the hotel whether traveling for business or leisure.,5,2016,11,07
133,royal garden hotel,"location is great, the rooms are spacious and comfortable however those on the side of the street are noisy. Very disappointed with the food, breakfast was ok but not excellent. Service of average level. ",3,2016,11,07
133,Best Hotel in Kensington,This is a five star hotel. We stayed for 10 days it was fantastic. We left London for Scotland in the middle of our stay. The Hotel was very accommodating the entire trip. Room service food was outstanding. The service was truly outstanding. I highly recommend this hotel. There are great view of the park and Kensington Palace. However the rooms with views are a bit more expensive. I felt it was worth the extra money.,5,2016,11,06
133,A First Class Hotel worthy of their 5 start rating,The best hotel we have ever stayed in with extremely attentive staff in all areas.  The hotel is spotless and the food is truly amazing.  The hotel is centrally located and is only a 5 minute walk to High Street Kensington Tube Station.  On the doorstep is Kensington Palace and their beautiful gardens and lake.    ,5,2016,11,06
133,"Quite, clean and Comfy in the City","If it wasn't for house keeping calling and disturbing my afternoon nap while DND was on. She said it was the hotel's policy. I couldn't waste time bringing this up checking that piece of info with the management.

I loved my stay otherwise, everything was perfect and would definitely stay here again and again, but will make sure I mention this little hiccup first, just in case.",4,2016,11,06

133,Always excellent,Stayed here lots of times in the past. It has always been excellent. Good food and ambience in the restaurant and at the bar. Very comfy big beds and quiet for central London so have always slept well. ,5,2016,11,05
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"Great hotel,professional and friendly! Would recommend to anyone! Had to change room from a smoking to non smoking room,the difference in the room was disappointing ,it was a lesser room,but still comfortable! The level of service was at the highest level,from check in to check out! Darius the doorman was a pleasure to meet! ",5,2016,11,05

good value for money.",5,2016,11,03
133,Nice hotel,"To continue, the breakfast area needs to be bigger as there are many people wandering around getting food, they could do with more waiting staff but it would then be even more hectic.  Needs a better  hotel bar.  That is the only aspect I would be critical of",4,2016,11,03
133,Superbly located London hotel with personal service,"Situated right next to Kensington Palace, at the end of High St Kensington, this is an upmarket but not impersonal hotel. 
Comfortable rooms, which are surprisingly quiet if you end up on the facing the street, and also quiet looking over the park)
The long standing bar staff always remember you, there's plenty familiar faces around if you've been a few times. 
On the tenth floor is an awesome Chinese restaurant which does superb Dim Sum.
It has great facilities for conferences and meetings downstairs in the Palace Suite (I've been there as a guest and production organiser). 
Frequented by occasional touring musicians, sports personalities, pilots and air crew, high end shoppers...",5,2016,11,02
133,Royal garden hotel,Our experience in this hotel was wonderful from beginning to end.  The staff are so accommodating and pleasant.  Our room was lovely and well maintained.  This location is ideal and we would certainly stay again.,5,2016,11,02
133,"Another Stay, Consistently high standards..","Back to the Uk after a break of three years, back to the Royal Garden and it's as good as it was last time.

Flawless check in, excellent concierge, room a bit small this time but it was entry level, however it was flawlessly keen, really well appointed.

The hotel has a consistent very high standard, it's priced a little lower than many of the more known brands, this equates to great value.

It's location is perfect with a 5 minute walk to High St Kensington tube station, handy for shops, pubs and just about everything else.

I would definitely stay ahain",5,2016,11,01
133,Kensington Hotel Gem!,"The Royal Garden Hotel is a gem in Kensington. The location is excellent and the rooms are lovely.

I only wish we were there longer.",5,2016,11,01
133,Great hotel and great location!!!,"Very attentive staff, excellent on site restaurants, comfortable rooms, and easy access to all of London.  The fitness facility was good, however it is supplied by third party and not within the hotel. It is also available to non-guests so can be a bit crowded. ",5,2016,11,01
133,Perfect hotel for a weekend break,"Staying at the Royal Garden Hotel was lovely, all of the staff were friendly, it's a great location for a weekend break whether couples or families. The view from our hotel room was breath taking. I would recommend the hotel for a perfect weekend break. ",5,2016,11,01
133,"Stained cup, no running cold water","Disappointing - stained dirty cup in the room. When trying to get a glass of cold water in the night due to my partner being ill, no running cold water - only hot! Not ideal but a great way to get you to buy overpriced water from the mini bar. ",2,2016,11,01
133,Lovely Saturday night experience,"What a lovely night at the Royal Garden. Stayed here over the past years many nights and always a solid choice!! Excellent value for money great location helpful staff, room clean and with all comforts! Will come back soon",5,2016,11,01
133,LOVELY !,"This hotel has so much going for it . 
The location is superb , adjacent as the hotel is to the Kensington Palace Gardens . This is a very smart and central part of London . The bus stop directly outside the hotel takes one down to Knightsbridge, the home of Harrods and the more manageable Harvey Nichols stores. 
Staying by myself , I had a Queen room which was impeccable. There was no sense of corners being cut . Good toiletries, immaculate bedlinen and spotless throughout. The room gleamed . Evening turndown too, a dying art . 
The choice of TV channels was vast and included Sky Sports , a paid subscription channel in the U.K. 
On checking in I was offered a red wine . I did not expect the full size French red delivered to my door . ' The Times ' newspaper was supplied free too. 
Tranquil and spotless . Recommended. 
The vast Wholefoods Supermarket is 3 minutes away and Le Pain Quotidian cafe in the side street next to the shop does excellent coffee and croissant .",5,2016,10,31
133,Hotel in Kensington,"We didn't know what to expect from the Royal Garden Hotel but we were absolutely floored!  When we first walked in, the staff were very friendly, accommodating and welcoming. They escorted us to our room and it was huge!  And the most important part (for us) is that it was squeaky clean!  Amenities in the room were spectacular. We had breakfast at their coffee shop daily.  Food was delicious and staff  were exactly the same as the front desk staff.  And as location is very convenient. It is close to several bus lines as well as a tube line.  I worked for hotels in Asia and I can say that the service we received here at this hotel is comparable.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit London.",5,2016,10,31
133,Business Trip,"The staff were excellent and highly professional. rooms are great value for the area, only disapointment was the extra charge fro Wi-Fi, when you pay ¬£260 one would expect this free. Would stay again, great location.",4,2016,10,31
133,great staff - average hotel for the money,"very small rooms for the money - no iron/board in room - awful refreshments in room for the money - over the top prices at bar and in the mini bar - car park was reasonable when using the code - breakfast wasn't that nice, hash brown was awful, bacon was nice",3,2016,10,31
133,Wonderful hotel close to Hyde Park,"If you are looking for an amazing hotel close to Hyde Park and full of facilities, Royal Garden Hotel is the right for you. With a rich buffet breakfast in the morning and good atmosphere overall, your stay in London will be a great pleasure",4,2016,10,31
133,Disappointed,"I did not like room despite the amazing room.
The room had mold, poor lighting & shabby couch. 
The bathroom has poor lighting especially the light bar above the mirror.
The night light in the hall is a great idea but is too bright & reflects off the side mirror into the room.
It was very disappointing especially for a 5 star hotel.
",2,2016,10,30
133,Good hotel in a nice location ,"Stayed here for 1 night with my girlfriend to celebrate her birthday.
We were presented with a bottle of wine and some chocolates in our room because of the occasion which was a very nice touch.

Hotel itself is is quite modern and in a very nice location of London.

Would stay again.

133,A Close Stay Next to William and Kate,"Nice hotel next to the Kensington Palace, where William, Kate and their children reside. Central location, easy walk to the gardens, several museums, and a decent 20 minute walk to Knightsbridge. I love how there's a Wholefoods on the same street (and boy, I couldn't believe Wholefoods in London is cheaper than the ones in the States!). The rooms may be a little small, but this is a prime location in London. Love the Penhaligon's toilettries as it's my favorite perfume house.",5,2016,10,27
133,Why wouldn't you book direct,"We looked at many rates for many hotels on the web. 
Becoming confused I called the hotel direct. A lovely receptionist matched the best rates around for this hotel. Sorry didn't catch her name but we did meet at departure and she remembered taking our reservation. Great detail
Checked in early, no issue. 5 minute wait for the room at 12.30am. Not even enough time for a coffee, but we did have one. Good coffee
Jason Dunn check us in. Fabulous service very welcoming. Apparently as we booked direct he gave us an upgrade, happy days
Later that evening we had a bottle of wine left in the room as a new promotion the hotel is running on book direct
We didn't eat but were most welcome at the Min Jiang restaurant and bar just for drinks. Great Margarita's
Large room, clean, everything worked. Best bathroom we have had for a long time
Next time in London will be calling the Royal Garden direct first",5,2016,10,27
133,My Stay At The Royal Garden,"very, very nice surroundings, comfortable room , great bathroom. The bar and restaurant (Park terrace) were also great but meat lacked any real flavour and was very very chewy.

Also i ordered extyra mini bar drinks which never arrived.

breakfats in the room although a little price was nice however the pastries could have been more fresh and or even warmed up.",4,2016,10,26
133,Looking forward to stay in Royal Garden again soon,"Stayed in the hotel for the third time already, the level of the quality service is keeping on the same pretty high level. Very nice clean  hotel, comfortable rooms, attentive personal  and perfect location",5,2016,10,26
133,A Stay up West,"Royal Garden Hotel proved an excellent location to visit the Royal Parks, Notting Hill Gate, Portobello Road and the museums on Exhibition Road. Location also convenient for travel into central London. Our King Size Room was simply but adequately furnished. Very clean and well maintained. Superb views over the City. Enjoyed a comfortable and quiet nights sleep. Breakfast was excellent with staff being informative and attentive. Our visit to London was enhanced by our stay at this hotel. Would like to return to enjoy a meal at the Min Jiang Chinese restaurant on the top floor overlooking Kensington Park. ",4,2016,10,26
133,Noisy A/C no sleep,Unable to sleep due to noisy a/c.  Called reception twice who eventually sent an engineer to unplug in the roof space at 1am.  Then room was hot and stuffy.  When asked by check out staff how was your stay and I said I had no sleep due to problems with the room she said no dear these things happen.  Other hotel staff very attentive.  Was surprised that breakfast was buffet and most other 5 star hotels are a la carte and as breakfast is my favourite part of a hotel stay I was disappointed,3,2016,10,26
133,Fabulous and friendly,"Great night away for my son's 13th birthday. Staff were very welcoming and the accommodation was fantastic, with a view overlooking Kensington Gardens. Chocolates and a teddy bear were a lovely touch. We felt very spoilt.",5,2016,10,26

I was surprised by a nice turn down service with chocolates mentioning my 35th wedding!!",5,2016,10,25
133,"Fantastic, fabulous and utterly regal",Another fantastic stay at the Royal Garden Hotel.   The room was overlooking the hustle and bustle of High Street Kensington this time (last time it was overlooking Kensington Palace) - another magnificent view.  Bedroom was spotless with a lovely modern bathroom with Villeroy and Boch bath and fittings.  Service impeccable and staff super friendly at check-in and throughout.   I would totally recommend this hotel.,5,2016,10,25

133,Fantastic,"Fantastic hotel in an amazing location. 
Wonderful attentive staff. 
Will return again when I have the chance.
Worth the price of the room for sure. Enjoyed a walk around Hyde Park, which is just outside the hotel to the left, and saw the palace.  

",5,2016,10,25
133,Beware!,"PRO
This is a beautiful hotel, in an excellent location for transport, nightlife, etc.
In other words, exactly what I hoped we had booked for a night on the town.
CON 1
After enjoying the local cocktail bars until early hours, and with no kids, we looked forward to a nice long lie before enjoying breakfast.
However, between 8.30 and 9.30, doors nearby us were banging closed around 30-40-50 times? I lost count, and gave up trying to sleep, and by 9.30 they were hoovering outside the room. This can only be attributed to housekeeping.
Why? We had a 12.00 check-out!!!
CON 2
I booked through Trip advisor, at least I thought I did.
It seems the final booking was via 3rd party, due to final room selection.
The ""Special Deal Free English Breakfast"" was not honoured by the 3rd party, and cost an extra ¬£50, which left a very unwelcome memory of the experience.
Now I have to waste my time fighting TA for a refund, and asking them to change the way such offers are presented to customers.

My complaint about housekeeping noise was brushed aside with the vaguest of apologies, and receptionist and manageress clearly didn't give a damn about stiffing us for the ¬£50. The readiness of their response also gave the impression this was nothing more than ""business as usual"".
Considering the competition in London, even at this location & price point, I would never consider staying here again. Far better service is available!",2,2016,10,24
133,Great stay,This was a special trip for my mother who had stayed at the hotel several times in her 30's and 40's (shes now 80!) we had a marvellous time and she wasn't disappointed. The meal in the restaurant was very good and the price was a nice surprise. Breakfast was exceptional and we were spoilt for choice.,5,2016,10,24
133,Excellent Stay in London,"Loved staying at this hotel.  People were friendly and were always availabel to answer our questions day and night.  They gave great guidance for questions about London and safety, and I have nothing negative to say.",5,2016,10,24
133,Royal gardens hotel,"I stay regularly for extended periods.
The value for money is very good for a central london hotel.
The staff turnover is low and therefore most of the people working there know me and my name.
That makes for a very relaxing stay and takes the stress out of traveling and doing business in a foreign country.
Rooms are clean and up to date. The park side room have the most spectacular. Views, some of the best in london.
Food is very good and Bertie's bar is always a good stop for a nightcap after a long day in town.",5,2016,10,24
133,Excellent location and staff prepared to go that extra mile,"Hotel is great, everything you would expect from a five star, and the staff made the experience memorable. The 24 hour business centre is excellent of you need some last minute printing done. Would certainly recommend for a business base when visiting London.",5,2016,10,23
133,"Professional hotel, appropriate business or vacation travel  ",Staff is attentive and helpful. Location great for hitting a variety  of sights; lobby bar overlooks beautiful Kensington Park.

133,Very confortable stay,"I liked it.
First very confortable bed and the level of the cleaning it is very good.

Excellent stay, one of the best I've had in London. Well done!",5,2016,10,20
133,A few changes,"Be aware that people do not always get up early so breakfast items must be replenished even if its 10 a.m !  More staff in the breakfast room/dining area. You really need more space/tables for guests.  I tried to give more feedback on the form before, but space ran out.",4,2016,10,19
133,TI meeting London,"good hotel, nice surrounding, i really liked the stay at the hotel. the prices for breakfast are terrible high, but that can be normal in london. the entrance is good, the people are nice, the rooms are great, the kensington park beatifull, much traffic in london",4,2016,10,19

133,Wonderful stay at The Royal Garden Hotel,I really couldn't fault this hotel. We only stayed one night (15th October) following a concert at the Royal Albert Hall but everything was wonderful from the moment we arrived (such a lovely receptionist)  until we left. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a Garden View room on the 8th floor (842) -  the view was amazing! We decided to eat in our room as it was so beautiful - the quality of the food and service was exemplary. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat! Good discount on the NCP car park too.

But we were genuinely and positively surprised by the hotel. Friendly, proactive staff, newly renovated, good rooms and a super central locations makes this hotel fully worth the price.

The staff went over and above and my quiet room & late check out requests were met.  The food is excellent and the rooms are lovely.  As I was running the Royal Parks 1/2 marathon they allowed me a late check out so I was allowed to keep the room until 2p.m.  The concierge and reception staff are amazing and can no do enough to help.

The Royal Garden Hotel hosted the wedding of my dreams. Everything was 10/10 right from the very start when we booked it. The operations team were an absolute pleasure to work with, they were always so patient, incredibly supportive and paid a lot of attention to detail. We had a seated dinner, (3 course meal) and that was all 5 star (we received so many compliments about how tasty and well presented and generous the food was). The waiters were excellent, very organised, friendly and professional. Everything about the evening at the hotel was just outstanding. I worked with the best people there, Bettina Sandner & Jerry Percival who helped us organise a very elegant, extremely organised and entertaining evening. I would highly recommend this hotel - it's in an excellent and prime location too (a 5 minute walk from High-Street Kensington tube station) and is literally next door to hyde park.

133,Never again,"My disabled son stayed there with his carer for 3 nights. I paid and stipulated a twin room and was disappointed to be told and see for myself from photographs, that the beds were next to each other with bedside cabinets either side making it look like a double bed.  A continuous buzzing noises disturbed their sleep.
The staff I've been told were fantastic but ¬£85 for a bottle of gin in a room was ridiculous.",3,2016,10,07
133,Good Hotel but with over too much disturbing from some staff,"Really friendly staff with very welcoming feeling when you come in. Good location. However, I just stayed for one night I have received so many door knocking from the service staff.

All staff were highly professional!",5,2016,09,30
133,Great Piece of Mind,"We wanted a hotel with less touristic traffic during the holiday season. This was great option. Less than five minutes away and you are in the Park. Tons of shopping and great dining options on the same street. Lots of great destinations within walking distance. Ubering around from this central point is great. Location wise, brilliant. The quality of the lobby and rooms is great for 4/5 stars hotel. Reception and concierge very attentive and helpful. Room service is not; they charge you for plates and utensils for daily use (they collect back and you reorder)No swimming pool, so less activities for the kids when staying longer time, but they offer paid activities as I understand.",4,2016,09,29

Our suite was utterly exquisite with an adjoining room for the children which offered us all space and the best night's sleep. Children are made to feel welcome at the hotel and the breakfast and room service as always, was utterly delicious with waffles being made for us at the buffet on the weekend too. We loved the quality and variety of food, with nothing being too much trouble from the staff (perfect for fussy eaters like my eldest). They even made yolk free fried eggs for him. So kind. We borrowed complimentary scooters and helmets from concierge too during our stay and played for hours in Kensington Gardens adjacent to the hotel.

133,Beautiful hotel,The Royal Garden Hotel was a really great experience for our stay.  The staff were all very helpful and extremely friendly.  Our room was beautifully laid out to make the most of the stunning views over Kensington Gardens.  Being able to walk out of the door and directly into the Gardens is a great advantage and doing so it is almost impossible to believe you are in the centre of London.,5,2016,09,27

The hotel is very close to the Hyde Park and other attractions in the area but a little far from the parklane hotels like inter and helton which in my case  required a 10 pound taxi ride to see my friends that stayed in the park lane hotels like the inter and helton etc.. 
I think this hotel is perfect for families that want to be close to the Hyde Park but away from the noise of the summer gulf travelers. 

",5,2016,09,26
133,Perfect for Royal Albert Hall,"Perfect hotel choice if attending an event at the Royal Albert Hall as it only takes 10 minutes to walk there through the beautiful Hyde Park.
We were originally given a room on 7th floor overlooking Hyde park and Kensington palace which was stunning. However, we experienced a lot of noise from the lift and so asked if there were any other rooms as my partner is very sensitive to noise. The staff were fantastic about this, they let us view an alternative room on 4th floor still with garden view but set further away from the lifts so minimal noise which we moved to.
All in all an excellent hotel, we were made to feel very welcome, staff are incredibly helpful and the hotel has a luxurious feel. ",5,2016,09,25

The breakfast was pretty good too , typical English Breakfast plus The waiters where informing people what the food was and just to give the Muslim guests a heads up of what they can eat. I  look forward in staying again at the Royal Garden Hotel. Till our next trip to London . ",5,2016,09,24

And after spending the last 26 years of my life working in the hotel and hospitality industry I am the worst critic and all I can say is well done to all at the royal garden hotel.",5,2016,09,08
133,"Attentive, Embracing 5 Star Luxury","As someone who flies over 100,000 miles each year, hotels can be a 2nd home for me. The Royal Garden is excellent, with perfect housekeeping, a concierge crew who are charming and attend to any requests, exotic or mundane. You are next to the Palace with the beautiful gardens and lake-a healthy morning walk through these lovely grounds transports one. I will always stay here.",5,2016,09,08
133,London vacation,Perfect London location on west side of Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park. Get the Park view rooms at half the price of Park Lane hotels. Communal facilities are limited but walking distance to all types of restaurants and food stores.,4,2016,09,08
133,Afternoon Tea,"My daughter in Law and I visited Kensington on 1 September, primarily to visit the Kensington Palace exhibitions.  Following our pleasant morning in the Palace we went to the Royal Garden Hotel for Afternoon Tea.  It was brilliant!!  Tea was served in the Terrace Restaurant.  A lady played the piano in the corner, very pleasantly, and expertly, giving a terrific ambience to the room .. I wish I had gone over to thank her before leaving.  Upon arrival at reception a most pleasant lady took us to the restaurant, where we were shown to a table for two by the window.  A tray of some dozen teas was brought to us so that we could order which tea we wished to have provided - I chose Darjeeling 2nd blush and my daughter in law a Thai tea.  Pots of freshly made tea of our choice were brought, and during the course of the afternoon were replenished.  Plates of sandwiches then came,  one plate for each of us, with a lovely selection including egg and watercress, beef, prawns, smoked salmon, roasted vegetable etc.  When our plates were empty a waiter appeared with a platter offering us more!  Then the three tier cake stand arrived .. A beautiful selection of cakes on the top two tiers.    On the bottom tier wrapped in a linen napkin were four warm scones, two plain and two fruit, along with peach jam, cream and raspberry jam.  At all times we were served pleasantly and discreetly.  A wonderful experience.",5,2016,09,07
133,Loved the hotel and staff,"The staff was fabulous as was our room. Very comfortable. We very much enjoyed the complimentary, continental breakfast that came as part of our package. This hotel is part of the Disney Vacation Club Concierge Collection. 
",5,2016,09,06
133,My Trip ,"Nice and clean rooms, friendly staff. Verioty of food selections, Deluxe rooms are recommended  it terms of room size. Location is near by Hayde Park, coffee shops, different type of restaurants near by as well. Every time I come to London , I choose to stay in this quite hotel.",5,2016,09,05
133,Lovely,This is a lovely hotel. The location is perfect near the tube and lots of shopping and restaurants. There views are spectacular. The rooms are a bit small for the price but the location is perfect. Definitely recommend it.,5,2016,09,05
133,excellent staff and hotel location,"i did love the hotel and staff , hope there will be renovation for the rooms and lobby in the future 
and there must be a swimming pool at the hotel .the sound proof between  the rooms need to be evaluated and improved . ",5,2016,09,03
133,One of the best 5 star hotels in London,"Everyone and Everything is perfect. I loved the friendliness of the staff, location just next to kensignton gardens. Rooms are elegant and speciaous. Service is excellent and the hoise keeping are always on time ",5,2016,09,03
133,Wonderful!! ," My daughter and I stayed here on a Voyage Prive offer for her 30th birthday.
Everything was first class, from check in and room upgrade to the chocolate truffles and birthday greetings in the room! My daughter was so pleased, thank you! Our room on the 9th floor had the most amazing views of London.
The room was a very good size, comfy twin beds and very comfy pillows! A large bathroom with an amazing shower and excellent toiletries made for a comfortable stay.
Breakfast was a delight, so much choice and very attentive staff. Everyone at the hotel was so friendly and helpful and the reception staff asked my daughter if she had been enjoying her birthday celebrations, just a little thought makes so much difference, thank you.
The location of the hotel is perfect for visiting London but staying in a quieter part. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to return. We had the most amazing stay, thank you Royal Garden! ",5,2016,09,01
133,Not a very pleasant stay at the hotel,"Negative: strong cigarette odor in my non-smoking room, probably through the ventilation system, loud noise one of the nights from a neighboring room, charging for basic internet service.
Positive: very good restaurant, good overall service, superb location
",3,2016,09,01
133,Superb ,The hotel is very luxurious as you'd expect from an establishment of this calibre. The food and service is top notch and the rooms extremely comfortable. The hotel itself is in a very plush part of London and its location is perfect for exploring the the city. If you have the money this hotel will not disappoint! ,5,2016,08,31
133,London Home,We love staying at this hotel. It has spoiled every other hotel we stay at in other places. Our room is always neat and clean. Your staff always has a room with a view we love. Everyone is always fantastic We have been coming once a year now for 8 years. It never disappoints.,5,2016,08,31
133,Fabulous stay at The Royal Garden,"Family trip, been to the Royal garden many times. Absolutely luv it. Everything 1st class. üíû
Used the big bus which stops right outside the hotel, you can hop on + off, perfect. 
Staff are very friendly especially bianca on reception. 
Fabulous stay. Luved it. üòÑ",5,2016,08,31
133,Great Service,"Service good, food fair (expect better), but overall would recommend a stay, but eat elsewhere - irritated slightly with assumed gratuity charge.

Room and welcome excellent, view on 9th floor brilliant ",4,2016,08,31
133,Essa,"Had and excellent stay , the staff the service the location and the comfort of the rooms all together were the excellent and the most convenient choice for families  , and will always be my choice in london,",5,2016,08,30
133,Magical Getaway,"My partner and I have stayed at the hotel several times over the past 4 years and each stay is always better than the last. From the second that you arrive at the hotel lobby you immediately feel special and are always greeted so kindly. The members of staff all pay such a great attention to detail to make sure that your stay is the best that it possibly could be. We also use social media very often and sometimes leave comments on the hotels webpages and they've even used certain things that we've mentioned to leave us surprises on certain events such as balloons in our room on our birthday and even a little goody bag for our son when we last arrived.

The Royal Garden Hotel is without question the greatest hotel that we have ever stayed in and we definitely will be retuning there for many many years to come.",5,2016,08,30
133,Family introduction to London,"The hotel was excellent and the staff could not have been better. We enjoyed being close to tourist sights but away from noise at night. London was very hot so we appreciated the air conditioning. The only noise was the odd slamming of doors from others at night. We were 3 generations so were able to open doors between rooms and felt very safe and secure. The washrooms were excellent - superior shower and tub with very good water pressure. I would recommend the hotel for families.
Breakfast was excellent and we could all meet over breakfast and be set for the day. Tube or taxis were very close.",5,2016,08,29
133,Birthday Treat,"Having just returned from the RGH I can not praise the hotel high enough, the staff go above and beyond to ensure your stay is memorable. Daniel and his team in the Park Terrance are outstanding and I would like to thank them for making the weekend so great.",5,2016,08,29
133,What a view!,"Great hotel, with a view that is changing and evolving every time I go back. The Shard and the new high scrapers that have been added to the London skyline are all visible from the hotel. Don't forget to treat yourself with a lunch or dinner to the Chinese restaurant at the 10th floor. One of the best in town. ",4,2016,08,27
133,Good Stay,"Great location, the rooms were incredibly small and they charged us extra to move to a different room because there were three of us and the would not fit an extra cot in the room which was surprising for us. Other than that the staff was very friendly, the concierge  could have been more helpful. Overall our stay was good.",4,2016,08,26
133,Birthday Treat,Birthday treat for my wife and the hotel could not have done more for us. Brilliant staff. Location is perfect for Harrods and Kensington Palace. Rooms overlooking the gardens give great views and the food is out of this world.,5,2016,08,26
133,"Good location, staff not helpful","Staff not helpful 
Complimentary water was not in room upon arrival.
No privacy, room can be seen from other rooms in hotel because no light drapes, or you have to close curtains at all times and lose view and natural light",3,2016,08,26
133,Royal garden hotel,Had a very good stay at the Royal garden there was a problem checking in but it got sorted very quickly and  efficiently the bed was also a bit hard so didn't have much of a good sleep however the friendly staff took this into consideration and offered  alternatives for my next stay with them overall I had an amazing time with my partner and would not  hesitate to stay at the Royal garden hotel in future ,5,2016,08,25
133,Picture Perfect,"A beautiful room with a stunning view on the 10th floor. The food was superb and the value for the food outstanding. The staff were all so helpful, friendly and cheerful. The location is superb for shopping and in our case, for The Royal Albert Hall Proms. Have had our eye on staying here for sometime and it more than met expectations. 5 stars. Foxella.",5,2016,08,25
133,Very friendly and efficient,"As soon as we walked into the hotel the check-in staff were extremely friendly and efficient.  Despite the position on Kensington High Street, our room was very quiet (we were on a high floor overlooking the Palace mews).The bed was very comfortable and the room had everything we required, including air-con, which is essential these days.  Breakfast was excellent.  The location of the hotel is ideal for visiting the Royal Albert Hall, the parks or shopping and not too far away from NHM, Science Museum and V&A.  All in all a great experience.",5,2016,08,25
133,Great location for business or vacation,"Have been coming here over the last ten years, so it is nice to see some of the transformation over the years. First thing, the car park, avoid with anything large with alloy wheels. It was built for a smaller car era, and it is a challenge not to damage something going down in a spiral to the basement. The hotel has had a refresh at the lobby and bar level, it has lost a bar that had character, and today I never visit the new location, and few others do too. But then you are a short walk from many pubs and bars.Rooms, well you really need to get a park view, and depending on the time of year, will be given a wonderful sunrise or sunset view over London, it really is spectacular. Rooms feel a little dated, but are kept clean and tidy at all times. Staff are always good, and I will continue to go back to this great hotel.",4,2016,08,24
133,Lovely light freshly made scones,"Overall a very good experience, beautiful sandwiches and mostly good cakes although some of them were very dry. The staff offered further sandwiches, cakes and scones throughout although if you want a fresh teabag, you are charged extra.",4,2016,08,23
133,"Great Place, friendly and professional staff",Always my fav place to stay in London but prefer to stay on higher floors. The rooms are very comfy with good facilities. The location is great and excellent for families. we enjoyed our stay especially the view of the park,5,2016,08,23
133,Great Location,"Located close to Hyde Park & walking distance to Buckingham Palace & associated gardens this modern hotel is well located.
Rooms are large, clean & with views of Hyde Park but I thought a little expensive for even though the Hotel is close to Restaurants & shopping.
Bus stop is right out front of the Hotel & only a short walk to pickup the Tube.",5,2016,08,23
133,Wedding event,Our stay at the hotel was a wonderful experience. We were there for a wedding which was amazing.  The staff at the hotel were extremely friendly and tentative to our every need. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and would certainly stay again.,5,2016,08,23
133,Family break,Hotel good location - check in staff need to display honesty and be truthful - not say thing that are not consistent - otherwise hotel clean good location breakfast average - Chinese upstairs 10th floor very good ,3,2016,08,23
133,Outstanding service.,"We were attracted by two factors: proximity of the hotel to Royal Albert Hall,which we were visiting, and the historical event which took place in the hotel 50 years ago: the Englich football team celebrating their victory in 1966. 
A twin room lookes a bit small on the website, giving the impression that there was not much in the room apart from two beds. So we were very pleasantly surprised to see that the room was spacious enough, with a sofa and a chair, and a comfirtable writing desk with a chair, a flat screen TV, and a good size fitted wardrobe. The lighting was bright, too. The shower room was spacious and clean, and the power shower was a real pleasure. 
But what was really outstanding was the service. From the very start at the reception, through the stay and on checking out, the staff went out of their way to help and to answer any questions we wanted to ask. If they did not know (as a lot of questions were about that historical event), they woukd go and find somebody who knew. i have never experienced that level of attention in any other hotel. 
One word of caution: there is an NCP car park in their building. If your car is wide, or if you are a nervous driver, be warned that the drive is so narrow you need to go at about 2 miles ah hour to avoid scraping your tires. Once dowstairs, it is spacious enough.",5,2016,08,22
133,AVOID THE CARPARK,"We went to this hotel for a friend's wedding and decided to take the car since it had a car park. It was a disaster as we scraped the tires of our brand new car which will cost us dearly. I checked the other cars' tired to be sure that it was not my mistake. They were all scraped. DO NOT PARK THERE. I wish they warned the guests with a sign. 
Otherwise lovely hotel with attentive and kind staff. Food was very nice, too.",1,2016,08,21
133,"Great location, friendly and super competent staff","Love the location, close to Hyde Park, the Tube High Street Kensington station, shops and good restaurant, and Heathrow airport. The refurbished gym is a plus. The staff is super friendly and competent. It is my favorite hotel in London. ",5,2016,08,20
133,Excellent Hotel,"This is a busy hotel, but the service and attention to detail is second to none, we have booked this hotel many times over the years for visiting family and shows in London, the rooms are always immaculate, and they do try and make non-smoking rooms stay non-smoking. The service given by the Concierges is first class, always very helpful, and we regularly use them for booking our theatre tickets for good seats. Breakfast and dinner in the restaurant is always superb and my 87 year old mother really likes the attention she is given, when we take her to London to see a show.",5,2016,08,20
133,"Great location, nice hotel",We stayed here for 5 nights. The hotel is only about 2 blocks from the South Kensington Station. It was easy to catch a train to all the main tourist sights. It is literally right next door to Kensington Palace (there's a gate entrance to the park next to the hotel). Our stay included breakfast in their dining room. You can choose a buffet style breakfast or order off the menu. An omelette bar is offered at Sunday brunch. The chef was really nice to make my husband one with lox. Our room was very nice. Had a hot pot to make afternoon tea and biscuits every afternoon in our room. A heated towel bar in the bathroom was a nice touch too. Would definitely stay here again.,5,2016,08,19
133,Afternoon tea,"We were a party of 7  and had booked afternoon tea for 4.30 - unfortunately our train was delayed from Yorkshire for three and a half hours and consequently we did not get into London until after 4.00 we then had to go to the hotel we were staying and get changed etc.  We kept the Royal Garden informed and apologised for being so late.  They were absolutely fabulous and could not help us enough.  The afternoon tea was the best we had ever had, the service second to none.  Because we were so late we had to rush as we had a show booked and we didnt have time to eat our cakes so they put them into boxes to take with us,  We were all so happy with this hotel they were all so lovely and understanding and the food delicious.  We would certainly go there again and would recommend them to anyone. Also rwo of our party it was for their birthdays and they were given a cake with a candle and a piece of chocolate with happy birthday written on it - nothing was too much trouble",5,2016,08,19
133,Always a great stay,"I have been staying at the Royal Garden on business for many years.  I always find the staff very efficient and friendly.  The rooms are clean and comfortable with excellent facilities and the food is always incredible.  
To be honest I don't think I have ever had a bad experience!! 
10 star all the way!",5,2016,08,18
133,Just perfect,"Booked in as it was close to the Royal Albert Hall.  Excellent service, staff, food - don't miss out on this wonderful hotel and the views from the garden rooms must be the best in London.  Truly first class.",5,2016,08,16
133,Small Rooms,"Overpriced for the small rooms which are also not very well appointed. Professional experts could sure improve layout.
Clientele is mostly middle eastern which are moving around many rooms and so you are disturbed by the notice in the corridor even though the outside view into hide park is quiet and pleasant.
Two people with bags is impossible in the standard room.
Will probably not be back to Kensington and stay in other parts of London.",3,2016,08,16
133,Not good not bad,"Choose to stay at hotel because of Chinese Restaurant which my Chinese friends like.
Arriving at check in I was attended by a trainee named Victoria which made an excellent job and was extremely helpful and friendly.
From then on however it was rather disappointing.

Room extremely small and not practical furnished.
Bathtub and no shower, everything ok however not up to 5 star standard.
Location quite a distance from next Underground
Clientele middle eastern which does not 
Care about fellow residents. Noisy in corridors etc.
All other staff I got in contact with rather reluctant friendly except Vicoria and guest relation manager
No priority for hotel guests in popular inhouse Chinese Restaurant which is not 5 star

Positive
Near Hydepark and Rooms have nice Green view and Windows can be opened.

Will not go back as there are better hotels and locations for that price",3,2016,08,16
133,Nice hotel,"very nice and clean Hotel i stay there for years very good breakfast all the stuff are very friendley and food is very good too. Yes i will stay there again and again 
Nice car park under the hotel.
thank you",5,2016,08,16
133,Family Vacation,Excellent service and staff.  Breakfast was amazing. Food quality generally was excellent.  We stayed in a King room which as of good size for London and was comfortable. Location of the hotel is very central and close to the parks.,4,2016,08,14
133,Nice visit to London,"We visited 07/18/2016, for 3 days. The hotel is near some great attractions in London, like Hyde Park and Notting Hill. The hop on hop off tour bus stops right across the street. The neighborhood is busy but not disturbing. Upon arrival we were treated very well by the hotel staff, they went out of their way to help any time we asked. The room was on the small side but very clean and comfortable. 
The only downside was we had to pay for WiFi. 20GBP/day

We would definitely stay there again.",5,2016,08,13
133,Welcoming Tranquility in the midst of Kensington Buzz!!,"Had a lovely meal with friends ( Pre-Theatre Dinner ) in The Park Terrace Restaurant ,at this lovely hotel, last weekend. From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by the Staff at Main Reception,Concierge thru to the Lovely Staff in The Park Terrace Restaurant where we dined. We were taken to our table by a pleasant Receptionist called Stefanias? Our table was situated by a large window(floor to ceiling high).We were welcomed and attended to by a very pleasant waitress called Khulan who was elegant, gentle, efficient and professional and who "" floated like a butterfly "" to our every need!!(without being intrusive.) We were also welcomed and attended to,by an equally pleasant, good-humoured waiter, called Daniel,who was courteous, professional, jovial and always smiling. He made sure we were,at all times,pleased with the service offered. 
The presentation of our meal was superb, artistic and inviting from the starter to the dessert. 
The ambiance was tranquil, with mild background music which didn't interrupt your table conversations. 
The neutral colours were restful and the lighting gentle for the early evening sitting. The chairs were very comfortable,(soft velvet furnishing)and the dining tables(covered with crisp white linen)were situated far enough from other diners so as not to hear any one else's conversation !!
At the end of our evening we were pleasantly surprised to receive gift vouchers(worth ¬£31. ahead) for our next dining visit which we cannot wait to use!!
This truly is a lovely restful setting to dine and wine where all the staff make it so worthwhile. I cannot wait to return soon again to this lovely Park Terrace Restaurant and with more new diners!!",5,2016,08,11
133,Royal Garden August stay 1 night,"Very professional staff and excellent location, with great views of Kensington Park.
Room was a bit on the small side.
Breakfast at restaurant was very good and free Wi-Fi appreciated. 
Would recommend this property for first time as well as repeat visitors",4,2016,08,10
133,Nice hotel but very unprofessional and unfriendly staff,"My experience at Royal Garden Hotel was unfortunately very unsatisfying. On the first moment of arrival we had argument with a member of the staff for giving us our room with one-hour delay. I raised this issue with the deputy general manager but unfortunately I did not find him very helpful and in fact he blamed me for why I am making this complain! I found him very impolite and unprofessional. The porters at the front door were also very impolite and each time I asked them to provide us with the space to park our car, they would ignore us and force us to leave. While there were most of the time two cars parked on the pavement in front of the hotel. But when I would ask to park our car for a very short time they would not allow us to do so while there was a space to leave the car for a short time, but for their friends maybe.
Nevertheless, I chose this hotel because I though this could be a nice Five-star hotel. However, the attitude of the staff and specially the manager made us so disappointed and for this reason I will never again choose this hotel in the future. Consequently, I will not recommend this hotel to anyone either.",1,2016,08,10
133,My stay at Royal garden hotel London,It was really good and I really enjoyed my first stay at this hotel and everything was so close to me such as Hyde park and Kensington street and harrods also Hollander park. I really liked the great view that was in my room.,5,2016,08,09
133,Not The Best,"Royal Garden Hotel is located in a very good area and it is very close of all the good attractions in London. Unfortunately, the hotel was too busy when we visited it in the summer of this year and the standard of services was not good at all. The house keeping team did a very bad job in cleaning the room. The AC was not working as you wish as it was mainly working as a fan and not a real AC. 

If you are visiting London for pleasure and are not going to stay in the room a lot this hotel may be a good option considering the location. However, if you are looking to stay in the room and spend more time inside the hotel then this Hotel is not right for you.  
",3,2016,08,09
133,Afternoon tea treat,"I had booked afternoon tea as a present for my mum. We were both very happy with the service, food and drink on offer. The lovely waiters couldn't have been more polite and obliging, and were even happy to take photos for us. I would definitely recommend AT at the RGH. ",5,2016,08,08
133,Wonderful stay!,"Excellent location in Kensington, close to the Kensington High Street Tube Station.  The room was spacious and clean.  Great breakfast available each morning.  Awesome breakfast staff...very friendly!  Good restaurants also available nearby.",5,2016,08,08
133,Enjoyable Stay,"Stayed in a Garden King Room for one night in May. The room was spacious, with a decent sized bathroom. It had beautiful views over Kensington Gardens. Staff were very friendly and courteous. We ate in the Min Jiang Restaurant for our evening meal. The food was delicious and the service was very good. This hotel is situated in an ideal location. We could not fault our stay at all.",5,2016,08,07
133,My experience,"Overall good experience. 
I was impressed by the location of the hotel. 
The staff were wonderful 
The Chinese restaurant was also wonderful. 
The business center well equipped and has helpful staff 
Overal all rating. 5 star. 

",5,2016,08,07
133,Fabulous Hotel,Lovely hotel looking towards Kensington Palace. Garden rooms are worth the extra cost as they look out on to Hyde Park and the Palace. The staff are really helpful and nothing is too much trouble. Breakfasts are very good as are meals at the Terrace restaurant.,5,2016,08,06
133,"Nice hotel, great location, beware of smokers","Very nice hotel, located next to a beautiful park, great for families. Just make sure your room isn't next to a smoking room. Our room smelled of smoke constantly. Otherwise, this is a fabulous hotel and would return!

We didn't visit any of the hotel's restaurants, bars, but they looked very nice. 

The hotel is also right next to great shopping including a Whole Foods!",4,2016,08,05
133,Golden wedding,Fabulous 4 days. Very friendly staff and excellent food and service. Location was ideal for access to many of the places we wished to visit . The bus routes were very convenient from immediately outside the hotel.,5,2016,08,05
133,Service is very good.,"Very good hotel. Every time I stay in this hotel, I feel I am at home. I like this hotel. I like the food. I always recommend this hotel to my friends. The location of this hotel is very good. It is very convenient for shopping and sight seeing.",5,2016,08,04
133,Disappointing,"I attended a Charity Fashion Show with Afternoon Tea.  The company and show were good.  The tea was disappointing; scones with runny coulis not jam (try putting cream on that!).  Sandwiches and cakes were quite nice but nothing special.  The service was just adequate but most of the staff spoke little or no English so asking for skimmed or semi-skimmed milk instead of full cream to go with my tea was a real problem.  In the end I had strong black tea which was awful as, by the time the milk came, the tea was cold!  The d√©cor is average and as London Hotels go it was not particularly exciting.  I didn't see any of the rooms, so cannot comment.  There is an underground car park - absolute nightmare to get into, even with a small car, as the access is narrow and spiral.",3,2016,08,03
133,Tiny rooms,"Staff were friendly, but you couldn't swing a cat in the tiny rooms. Almost impossible to have 2 people walking about simultaneously.
Good location, and has car parking underneath which is handy.
Park opposite for a walk or run.",3,2016,08,03
133,Tony Lungrin,Great location for getting around. The car park is not very accessible due to its very tight spiralling entrance. I would advice that you get the staff to park your car as they have experience in driving down to the lowers levels. The specification in the room was good but for me a little small.,4,2016,08,02
133,THE BEST HOTEL IN LONDON.,"My wife Christine and I have once again visited the RGH , on this occasion to celebrate my 70 th birthday which is next Sunday 7 th August. We had a fantastic lunch with my son Gavin and his wife Samantha along with our two granddaughters Eloise and Lilianna. The whole experience was superb.
We were greeted by the doorman Jimmy , a lovely bubbly friendly guy who offered to park our car in the underground car park. At reception we were met by and checked in by one of the staff stars of the hotel , a charming young lady called Charli, a real true professional who we went to several times over the weekend for help and advice for different situations and each time Charli sorted it out, this lady truly represents the hotel etos above and beyond the call of duty.
The management team at the hotel have got things perfect the "" Alf Ramsey "" who heads the team up is the charming Jonathan Lowrey a real leader who has set fantastic standards very high who together with his trusty right hand man Mark Anderson are a great example on how to run a 5 star hotel correctly.
From the great breakfast to the immaculate cleanliness of the rooms and the helpfulness of the staff the bar has been set high and it works perfectly.
A lovely guy called Stephen heads up the concierge desk and he was most helpful on Saturday afternoon arranging for us to borrow 2 scooters for our granddaughters to use as we wandered around Kensington gardens to show the family where my wife Christine and I had met over 52 years ago. 
A fantastic 70 th birthday weekend was made complete by joining in a a special brunch on Sunday morning with several members of the 1966 England world cup winning team including Sir Geoff Hurst. Gordon Banks. George Cohen .Jack Charlton. Roger Hunt and the charming Norman Hunter who was in the squad. This league of gentlemen have a fantastic camaraderie and team spirit about them, they are great friends and still look out for each other all true old school well mannered down to earth people and for me it was a mind blowing honour to be in there company. 
Thank you all in the Royal garden Hotel team for helping to make my early birthday present with you all the happiest day of my life.
If you haven't been to the RGH yet you must put it on your "" To do"" list for a unique special experience. We shall return.",5,2016,08,02
133,Fabulous as always,"We have stayed on quite a few occasions and have been lucky enough to be upgraded more than once.  The staff are lovely and the rooms are spacious, clean and very comfortable.  I would definitely recommend a Garden Room as the views are fabulous across Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. It is a great location too.",5,2016,08,02
133,Brilliant as always,"What better way to celebrate a birthday stop over in London.
From check in to check out the Royal Garden ticks the box.
Super safe parking directly under the hotel is a big plus in London 
Lunch in the restaurant on arrival while our room was prepared.
The check in was smooth with keycard brought to our table.
After lunch we retired to our room where our luggage was waiting.
Can't fault a thing.
Will return very soon.

133,Good location,"The hotel is well located on Kensington High Street with shops, cafes and bars.  Next to Kensington Palace and gardens.  A 20 minute stroll will get you to Knightsbridge.  The hotel staff were friendly and helpful.  We used the valet parking service which was excellent.  The only disappointment was the size of the room which was very small and the smallest hotel room we have ever stayed in, and therefore did not represent good value at a cost ¬£190.  We were here for one night to attend a function, but would not like to have stayed here for longer. ",3,2016,08,02
133,Great hotel in central London,"The Royal Garden is genuinely a very good hotel. Have stayed there many times in the past. The rooms have been refurbished to a much more contemporary feel and look, as has the rest of the hotel. If you are travelling with 2 kids or more, it becomes tricky for them to accommodate you, the rooms being very small and lacking in space with kids. Staff are generally pretty helpful, bar the odd occasion or 2 when not paying attention to what needs doing, mainly at the main entrance. Overall it's a great place to stay in, but over the years their standard had slipped a bit with change in familiar staff.",4,2016,08,01
133,Great Location and Service!,"I stayed here for a week while visiting London before going on a cruise.  The location is great with the hotel being near Kensington Palace, a five minute walk to the tube station, buses stopping outside the hotel, and several restaurants and shops to choose from within easy walking distance.  There is even a Whole Foods a block from the hotel which made it easy to get bottled water, snacks, and other things I wanted for my room at a reasonable price.  The concierge and staff were friendly and helpful, and you are able to request the number of towels, etc. that you want housekeeping to replenish your room with during maid service and the nightly turn down service.  The complimentary fruit plate on check-in was a nice touch, as was the complimentary pastry snack that arrived mid-way through my stay.  The Park Terrace and Min Jiang restaurants in the hotel were great places to have a meal.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will definitely return the next time I'm in London.",5,2016,07,30
133,Christina,"We were upgraded to a suite for our week stay, which we thoroughly enjoyed, room was very quiet. Spectacular views, very clean room. Front desk, concierge, and housekeeping staff were all very friendly, attentive, and accommodating. Hotel is in perfect location for Portobello Road, Kensington Palace, and bus tours. ",5,2016,07,28
133,Wonderful breakfast,Excellent service even at the front door. Our room was extremely clean and tidy and bathroom was super with amazing toiletries. We only stayed one night but all the staff we encountered made our stay really special,5,2016,07,26
133,Beautiful!,"Visited this hotel quite a while ago, but I still believe it's one of the most beautiful hotels I've ever been into! We had an amazing room with Hyde park view, on the 6th floor if I remember correctly, couldn't hear anything from the neighbour rooms. The room and the bathroom were impeccably clean and very big, good room service and friendly staff who kept our bags between our arrival and our check in time. This is a pricey hotel, but it's a 5* afterall so wouldn't really be fair me complaining about this aspect. Would recommend for anyone who wants to have a luxurious stay in the heart of London.",5,2016,07,26
133,small but comfortable high class hotel,"This is a very high class hotel. But unfortunately small rooms. or at least the rooms I stayed in. 
Everything you need was available in the room. 
The Chinese restaurant on the 10th floor is top notch. Breakfast was too expensive for what you actually get. AND NEVER DO LAUNDRY THERE!!! paid 180 pounds for half a bag.

My big suggestion would be, get a room in the back of the hotel (overlooking Kensington Gardens) because in front you have high kensington street. which is pretty crowded.

The surrounding is just perfect. you have Hyde Park just around the corner and all kinds of restaurants in the vicinity.",4,2016,07,26
133,Check the position of your room,"Enjoyed our one night stay but the traffic noise we could hear from our 5th Floor room was unpleasant and we would advise if staying there to make sure your room was not over the main road, or was high enough not to hear the constant busy London traffic noise.",4,2016,07,25
133,Royal Garden,"Very friendly staff and great location to visit Kensington Palace and Garden.  The two rooms that we occupied were clean, but the rooms were small but comfortable.  Perfect for one person, but not for two with multiple suitcases.  The view of London from Min Jiang is great, but getting to the other side of London during rush hour was difficult.",4,2016,07,25
133,Close to Kensington Palace,"The Royal Garden Hotel is fantastic; very close to Kensington Palace and Gardens, the Royal Albert Hall and within a 5 minute walk from High Street Kensington tube station.  The staff are very welcoming and friendly, the bedrooms are large, spotlessly clean and have large bathrooms with powerful showers, lovely toiletries etc.  My room (on the 10th floor)  had a wonderful view over Kensington Palace and Gardens, and was very quiet and extremely comfortable. I would be very happy to stay here again.",5,2016,07,25
133,Great Hotel Great location!,Excellent service from all staff members. Rooms were clean and fresh. Cocktails in Bertie's Bar well worth it! Even when we had a fire alarm and had to be evacuated at breakfast time all the staff kept calm and all was peaceful and dealt with promptly. Fresh breakfast served without fuss!,5,2016,07,24
133,Third visit,"Great location! Very clean,the rooms are large and comfortable and they have a wonderful staff! The food in the restaurants is first class! The breakfast buffet offers a huge selection, afternoon tea is plentiful and delicious and dinner, whether at Park Terrace or Min Jiang which offers authentic, elegant Chinese cuisine, is 5 star! We cannot wait to return!
",5,2016,07,23
133,Check your expectations ,An average hotel with a great view of Kensington park. Will probably never stay here again. Used to live nearby but never been inside. I guess it has been newly renovated but pretty bland an uninspired. I bet you can get a great deal on Priceline--I paid full fare and certainly wasn't worth it.,3,2016,07,22
133,Great Location but small rooms,"This is a nice hotel, and being adjacent to Hyde Park is a real bonus, however my room was so small that if I had to keep moving my suitcase around the room to be able to get to the door, or get into bed.",3,2016,07,21
133,Beautiful stay ,"Really stunning hotel, I would definitely recommend paying for a garden view room. We could of sat for hours overlooking Hyde Park. 
Room service was excellent, staff are very polite and considerate. Rooms are spotless, modern and good size bathroom. Really comfy beds. 
Would definitely recommend. ",5,2016,07,20
133,Great location & Good price,"While living in London, I had no idea this hotel was as nice as it actually is. What a wonderful experience. I stayed here with my daughter upon returning to London to visit friends in the city for 5 nights. The hotel is extremely child friendly. Upon our arrival, they gave her a backpack filled with activities for her to do during our stay. They also offered scooters (in a variety of sizes and number of wheels) to be used for any length of time (helmets as well if you want them). Our room had a king bed, desk, large closet, reasonable sitting area and large bathroom. It overlooked the park. My biggest concern was that I recalled the night club being very loud from when we lived in the neighborhood and wouldn't you know it that we were in the room RIGHT OVER the club. It was fine ever night except Friday night, which was AWFUL. I lay awake until 3am (closing time). I would have requested not to be in this room, but we had booked through hotels.com, so this wasn't possible. My only other gripe about the place was that the bellman was snarky with my daughter and I when we had waited 20 minutes for a taxi and tried to give our taxi to the gentleman behind us in the queue and then said, ""are you even saying with us""?. He has take. Us out of cans twice before and not that I expect him to remember everyone but no need to be so rude, especially to a mum and daughter. The wifi was annoying because you had to renter the code (which was extremely long) every 10 minutes. I wish hotels would just charge more and make wifi free for everyone without a code. Room service was not great. I would skip breakfast service and head out to Pain Quotidienne or The Ivy. Overall, however, this was an amazing hotel. The concierge staff was excellent. I highly recommend this spot, especially for people staying in London with kids. You can't beat the location for the price. ",4,2016,07,19
133,great location,"This is a decent hotel with a great location.  It is a short walk to Bayswater and the park. The hotel has easy access to a supermarket, M&S and a tube stop.  Rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. 

",4,2016,07,19
133,Third Visit,"This is the my third stay at the hotel, due to its Great location close to tube station, Excellent accommodations spacious and comfortable as well as excellent food and beverage outlets and finally great staff",5,2016,07,18
133,Bad service,"1 there is no regular cleaning
2 bad smell towels 
3 poor facility
4 staff are not avaliable 
5 AC is not working 

The only positive thing I found in this hotel is the location as it located in very calm area ( kensington garden",2,2016,07,18
133,"Comfortable rooms, some with a great view","Very, very cozy bed, nice bathroom, and expansive views, even if you don't have a room that overlooks the park. The staff are friendly, and really ,the location is extraordinary: steps from the park, perfect for walks or watching the morning fog lift from the breakfast room. Breakfast was what I'd call 'London pricey', but there are so many options on Kensington High Street, that it wasn't a deal breaker. ",5,2016,07,16
133,Anniversary weekend,"Weren't aloud our room until an hour and 15 minutes after check in. 
Bags turned up 30 mins after that.
Staff also tried to fob us off when we asked what was happening. 
Customer service wasn't good enough ",5,2016,07,15
133,"Great Location, terrific service!",We stayed at the Royal Garden for 10 days in June.  Staff were very helpful with many of the things we needed to figure out about enjoying London. Great location at Kensington Palace and very convenient for the tube and buses to get wherever we needed to go.,5,2016,07,15
133,A Wonderful Hotel in London,"The accommodation, facilities and staff are superb! We are regular guests at the Royal Garden Hotel and it never disappoints. The location on Kensington High Street is perfect, close to the fantastic parks, museums, Royal Albert Hall and Kensington shopping, and still within an easy commute to the West End.",5,2016,07,15
133,5 out of 5 - book it!,"Stayed here for 5 nights. The room was beautiful and had a view looking down the High Street! Couldn't be more impressed with the staff and the facilities of the hotel including Min Jiang restaurant and Bertie's Bar. The location is fabulous, very close to the tube station and a walk in Kensington park is lovely. The staff at this hotel ensure that you have a smooth, seamless stay - and we did! We will definitely return sometime in the future.",5,2016,07,14
133,Lovely View & Bright and Airy Room,"I didn't tell the hotel that we were staying for a 50th Birthday until when we checked in we were told that we had been upgraded to a Garden View Room. As it happens the hotel was also celebrating its 50th Birthday! I am not much of a fan of London Hotels to be honest as I find them rather pokey and dark or quite often rather dated. 1 don't expect 5 star in London to match 5 star in Dubai but I was very pleasantly surprised by the room. The view over Kensington Palace Gardens one side was lovely (with a hint of Kensington Palace in the background) and the view to the other side was of lovely green trees and the top of the Royal Albert Hall. I cannot fault the hotel, from check-in to check-out. After returning from our night out we pleasantly surprised to find a complimentary bottle of champagne on ice with some complementary truffles and a chocolate tempered plaque saying ' Happy 50th Birthday'. I thought it was a lovely touch. I cannot comment on breakfast as we were late risers the next morning and appreciated the midday check-out time. I would definitely book this hotel again as it exceeded any expectations I had. I would also pay a little bit more for a Garden View Room. I gave this hotel an excellent rating, however, if it was in Dubai it would only have made 4 stars. If I have to be picky then the only negative was the slightly uncomfortable bed as it wanted to roll you into the middle - but I am being picky here! Oh and actually the fact that there is a charge for internet (¬£25 a day) - so unnecessary in this day and age, especially given the premium charged for the room! I stayed at The Grosvenor last time in London and The Royal Garden Hotel is more modern and with better views. It is not the cheapest hotel in London but you get what you pay for in my experience and sometimes you pay just as much in London for a dark, small and airless room.",5,2016,07,13
133,Take That Weekend,"This was our second stay at this hotel, which is great for access to Hyde Park and Royal Albert Hotel.  Excellent treatment by all staff who are friendly and welcoming.  Rooms are beautiful and cosy.  Bathroom and facilities fabulous.  Have booked again for January 2017.",5,2016,07,13
133,My favourite London hotel,"You get what you pay for here: lovely staff; smart, clean rooms, excellent food and facilities, in the heart of High St Ken for shopping and transport links. So many London hotels are a bit scruffy and down-at-heel while charging not much less than the RGH. Choose it! You won't be disappointed.",5,2016,07,12
133,A truly  wonderful experience,"Like Louise L reviewer we had bought a dinner voucher through Travel Zoo and only expected ""half"" a meal and service. However we couldn't have been more wrong. The service was impeccable, the food excellent and cooked to perfection. With a cocktail to start and then 3 courses plus a cheese board to share it was stunning value for a restaurant in Kensington. The wine list is extensive but there are very few    bottles under ¬£30 however the bottle we had to go with our meal was very acceptable. Let's face it wine is never ""cheap"" in a hotel especially in London ! 

As a previous reviewer says the meal would have been good value even at full price. The staff did everything to make the meal a pleasant experience and were attentive but not imposing. Hopefully we will be back again on our next trip to London. Certainly highly recommended!",5,2016,07,12
133,The Perfect Weekend Break,"Fantastic Hotel. A warm and friendly reception from staff is assured. The view from the Hotel over the park and Kensington Palace is stunning. The skyline view even better.
The Park Terrace food was excellent. We will be back!",5,2016,07,12
133,Mitch,"Brilliant hotel, especially compared with what you usually get in London for the price. A truly great deal.One thing: don't waste time on breakfast, which is twice the price of what you can get right down the street at any of the half-dozen pubs and restaurants.",5,2016,07,12
133,60th Birthday Trip,The hotel was excellent good location excellent service good quality food. Only disappointment was lack of free wifi unless you book with the hotel direct. St aff were very friendly and helpful. Everyone seem to want you to have a good experience. The chef at breakfast made a fantastic omelette would recommend.,5,2016,07,12
133,"SUPERB LOCATION, LOVELY ROOM, SUPER HELPFUL STAFF 5*****","Great centrally located hotel, we had a view of Kensington Palace which was lovely, close to shops, the hotel parked the car for us too.
Ideal place for a break or a holiday, ideal for families or couples, book it before somebody else does :o)",5,2016,07,12
133,"Room's are small, cranky staff location. But would not recommend the hotel to anyone","Room's are small so always upgrade 
Staff can be cranky at times (not everyone is a millionaire!!!)
Min jiang restaurant very good .

Ensure you are provided with the right details  at checki in tendency not to give you wifi code and discount vouchers . 
For the price expected a better service but ow well .

Would not recommend to. Anyone 
Most 4  star in London are better",2,2016,07,12
133,Great location but no charm,"It is a hotel with an exceptional location but in my opinion no charm at all . just to sleep the nights not to enjoy it . My room was spacious but it was a smoking one . Manager Tyrone was excellent trying to solve the smelling problem and he did . He made the difference at the hotel . Rooms need a renovation , old carpet , dirty sofa ( at least need to have the fabric changed  ) and the bed sheets were ripped . Expensive for what it offers . ",3,2016,07,12
133,21st birthday weekend,"My daughter and I stayed here to celebrate her 21st birthday.  The weekend was perfect from start to finish. The staff could not have been more attentive but were in no way stuffy, we felt very at home here. The view from our 7th floor garden room was stunning and to top it off, we enjoyed a firework display over Hyde Park when we returned on the Saturday evening! We visited the Min Jiang restaurant on the top floor for our evening meal. This too was excellent, the staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. Overall a fantastic weekend and we certainly hope to return in the future!",5,2016,07,12
133,The escape that was needed......,"Having chosen the Royal Garden Hotel for a weekend break my wife and I were absolutely delighted to be greeted by such friendly, polite and professional staff on arrival. The hotel was a bit more expensive than hotels we would usually stay at however having a four year old son means we don't get away as a couple as often anymore so a treat to ourselves was in order. After being shown to our room we were immediately impressed with the size, appointment and cleanliness of the room. The room had everything you could need from a minibar and hairdryer to robes and more tv channels than you could ever need. The temperature in the room was adjustable to suit anyone's taste and it was lovely and quiet. 
The bed was enormous and so comfortable too. We were made to feel welcome in every area of the hotel thanks to the fantastic staff- in the Terrace and Bobby Moore bar in particular. The Bobby Moore bar was a treat for a football fan like myself with its items of memorabilia and bar staff in the iconic 1966 red shirts. A special mention also needs to go to the breakfast served in the terrace where the choice is extensive to say the least. I would have to say it is one of the nicest breakfasts and best choices we have seen. 
The very slight disappointment came via a scuffed alloy wheel achieved while entering the car park which is a very long and very tight spiralled ramp down to the parking. Having parking under the hotel is still however a big plus although taking a smaller car will be noted for our next visit! 
We would love to bring our son to this wonderful hotel next time and genuinely expect him to be as well treated as we were on this visit as it just seems to be a place that thrives on making guests happy. 
Thank you to all at the Royal Garden Hotel. 
",5,2016,07,11
133,6 stars needed for the Park Terrace!,"We bought a voucher via travel zoo for a three course dinner with a cocktail, and this turned into the best dinner experience either of us had ever had. This is such a lovely place, the atmosphere was perfect, quiet but not empty and subtlety classic. The three course dinner also includes a cheese course which was better than expected and breads before the starters which set a high standard. All the choices were extensive with fresh local ingredients and perfectly cooked and presented. The staff were excellent and I can not find anything to criticize or to suggest. This is such a brilliant restaurant that even if you are without a voucher it's still excellent value. We will look forward to a return visit.",5,2016,07,10
133,Honeymoon Trip,"Excellent hotel in great location. From the time we arrived the staff was very welcoming and helpful. We even had a bottle of wine and truffles waiting in our room, which was a very nice surprise. The rooms are bigger than most hotels in London as well as the bathroom and shower. They provide complimentary robes and slippers and a turndown service at night with free bottles of water-a plus when you are tired from your day and just want to relax. We had just came from Paris and Venice and the beds there were beyond uncomfortable, however the beds at this hotel were very comfortable. They have 2 restaurants on site and a breakfast available at one of them, which was very good. We will definitely be staying here when we return to London!",5,2016,07,10
133,Perfect Stay üòç,"Had a lovely couple of days stay here, staff where very friendly, room was very neat and clean. Food was delicious too. Also lots of shopping done I was very happy with everything.  Thank You ...........I'm finished now so let me submit this and carry on with my life. üòäüëç",5,2016,07,10
133,July 2016,"Excellent service from arrival to departure. Very helpful and service minded staff. The location is perfect for a London visit, with direct access to Kensington park and Hyde park. Bus station is right in front of the hotel and tube station is just a few minutes walk away. Lots of food option within walking distance. Ideal for family breaks. ",5,2016,07,10
133,Relax in comfort,"This is a hotel where the staff really do care. It's quiet, comfortable and welcoming and avoids the stuffiness that too often comes at this level. You generally don't need to ask for attention it has been anticipated in a discreet way. ",5,2016,07,10
133,Superb,The epitome of elegance and class. Beautiful rooms overlooking the park which is a nice way to immediately embrace London. Excellent for running through Kensington then Hyde Park to the Palace and Mall as desired. Easy tube location to get to the center for business as well. ,5,2016,07,09
133,good value for money,"one of the best in the area, and still affordable 
location OK, close to the tube station
Very good Chinese restaurant on the top
breakfast OK, not superior.
rooms are small, as everywhere in London...
Service quite OK

                                                                         ",5,2016,07,09
133,Afternoon Tea,This is a very disappointing experience. The cakes were very ordinary and could be bought in any supermarket. I cannot believe that the a chef in a 5 star hotel can have made these cakes and it is unfair to the London Tourist Industry to allow them to be continued.,2,2016,07,08
133,Better than expected,"Convenient, clean, and great breakfast
It's been 15 years since our last stay and it was better then remembered.
Hopefully we will be back in London sooner.
We had a party of 7 and everyone enjoyed our stay.",5,2016,07,08
133,A wonderful hotel!,"I would highly recommend this hotel...it ticks all the boxes: pleasant helpful staff, comfortable rooms
some with spectacular views over Hyde Park and the city, my only possible criticism would be that the room service menu could be slightly better and more extensive but otherwise 5 star in every way!",5,2016,07,08
133,''Fantastic services & staff'',"We had a King size room and an amazing view to Kensington Palace. The room was spacious and very clean. The beds were very comfortable. The services were excellent.
 All the staff was very helpful, polite, efficient, cheerful and friendly. We had a one month old baby with us and he settled very well and was very contended with the change in his surroundings! Lovely choice of breakfast!!
Super location and is close to shops, eating places, park, buses and underground. Would highly recomend it to anyone looking for excellent services and dedicated staff!!",5,2016,07,07
133,Great hotel and location,"We stayed here for 1 night as attending a concert at Hyde Park which is in walking distance. 
We arrived earlier than check-in time but was able to have our room early. We left our luggage and the receptionist rang us to say room was ready. 
Great choice of restaurants close by",5,2016,07,07
133,Good location,"Their service wasn't good,smoking room gave to family with small kids!
Dust finding in room 
But this time was our second time to stay in this holiday ,I couldn't compare a service between first time and second time",4,2016,07,07
133,Best Hotel Experience,"This was the best hotel experience I have ever had. From the moment I checked in to the moment I checked out I felt like a VIP. I work in the Event Services Industry and my experience at the Royal Garden Hotel is the perfect example of how every Guest should be treated. This hotel is also in a perfect location. Far enough away from the high tourist areas (e.g., Westminster) on the edge of Hyde Park and conveniently located next to bus stops and the Tube. The shops and restaurants near the hotel are fantastic (The Ivy Brasserie is my favorite for breakfast, lunch, and especially afternoon tea). I had a Queen Room with a breathtaking view of Kensington Palace. The staff went above and beyond to make me feel welcome. I would absolutely recommend the Royal Garden Hotel. 5 Stars. I hope to have the opportunity to return to London and stay at the Royal Garden Hotel.",5,2016,07,06
133,Unique view,Wonderful view of Hyde park from the garden rooms with comfortable and thoughtful accommodation. Courteous and efficient staff and a delightful ambience. A 5 star experience all round with convenient location for a stroll in the Park or a shopping trip along Kensington High Street. ,5,2016,07,06
133,Nice location,"Close to Hyde Park, this is a nice hotel despite the oldish look and feel. The rooms are on the small size but clean and nice. Staff is friendly. Would recommend mostly for the location close to Kensington, easy access to underground, close to Portobello. It is quiet at night which is an added advantage.",4,2016,07,06
133,It's all about the people,"We chose the Royal Garden because of its cloe proximity to the parks. Next to the Ritz this has to be the most friendliest and most hospitable hotel we have stayed in while in London putting other big names into the shade in terms of customer service. Nothing was too much trouble; every member of staff we encountered was personable, friendly and extrmeley helpful. Our room with a view of Kensington Gardens was extremely clean and comfortable with a sitting area overlooking the gardens. Would highly recommend to anyone who values a quality service.",5,2016,07,06
133,Best Hotel in Europe,"We visited Royal Garden during a recent trip to Europe and I must say it was absolutely the best hotel .We stayed at hotels in Spain ,and France and you're hotel was perfect .From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we received extraordinary service ",5,2016,07,05
133,Enjoyable experience.,"Great location next to the park. Our room was compact, but had everything we needed for our stay. It was clean and tidy. Good selection of food for breakfast and attentive staff.  Would stay here again.",4,2016,07,05
133,Family Stay,"Agreat stay for both children and adults. 
First class service from arrival to leaving.
Plenty to do around London, from amazing parks to museums.
Outstanding views from the park suite room and In house dinning.
NCP parking located by the hotel.

",5,2016,07,05
133,Great Stay,Perfect for the Albert Hall our reason for staying. However to have to pay for wifi at the prices charged for the rooms  is outrageous. It should be free as it is in hotels all over the world from the cheapest to the most expensive. Cheapens the experience. Though when I complained about it the charges were deducted from my bill which was a great gesture.,5,2016,07,05
133,First class stay,"There was a party of 24 staying for two nights
Everyone said this was a great place to stay with impeccable staff the views from all the rooms were fantastic 
The breakfasts were so good
All in all you are made to feel special and that's what counts  ",5,2016,07,05
133,Great stay,Enjoyed our stay. Staff and their service was excellent. The facilities were good relative to the property. Close by to bus and train station.  Lovely park nearby ( Kensington). Nearby to shops.  Will definitely stay there again ,4,2016,07,05
133,Soak the rich,"One night parking ¬£38 I was told the hotel has a discount. I was not told this has to be pre booked through a third party company. They got me there
The room rate was ¬£300 OK hotels of this quality charge that. WiFi extra! In this day and age
Set price breakfast for one ¬£25. Really? This is without doubt a quality hotel. But you are left with the feeling you are being ripped off at every turn",4,2016,07,05
133,Overpriced,For what can be considered top dollar the room was very average and not at all as depicted and described on the web site.  Room service was slow and would have been non existent if we hadn't asked for our room to be refreshed as late as 16.30 in the afternoon,2,2016,07,05
133,Fabulous,"The only downside to this hotel is the underground parking. Very narrow drive down to it = scraped wheel trims if your driving anything bigger than a mini!
That's the negative out the way.
My husband and I had a  garden view room  for two nights. Comfortable bed, sofa overlooking the garden and spacious bathroom with toiletries.
All staff members were friendly and welcoming with no exceptions. 
Gorgeous breakfast, everything you could want and more.
We definitely plan on another visit.",5,2016,07,04
133,we felt like being at home!,"It was our first stay in Big City London, so we needed some information for excample where to eat, how to use the public transport... The concierge-service helped us so much. They all are so friendly, helpful and charming. ",5,2016,07,04
133,Trudi,"The reception staff were excellent, nothing was too much trouble. Restaurant staff were extremely attentive and accommodating.  I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone. Every need was catered for in the rooms.",5,2016,07,04
133,Second stay at an outstanding hotel,"Beautiful, spacious room, outstanding full breakfast offerings, and a friendly, competent staff account for our second 5 night stay at this hotel next to Kensington Palace. Concierge exceeded expectations by providing our granddaughters with researched material regarding Harry Potter and our 10 hour visit to Oxford. Loved our second meal at an Indian restaurant (Zaika) across the street and enjoyed meals at Spagetti House and Wagamama, both steps from the hotel. Bar Boulud is a nice walk from the hotel and we greatly enjoyed our meals at this restaurant located in the Mandarin Orient hotel..",5,2016,07,04
133,london visit,"The only hotel that we consider when visiting London,and we have stayed many,many times.Car parking is so convenient and the buses into town are right outside the entrance.Easy walk the the Royal Albert Hall.Views of the park are great,or the busy High Street,with all the ""buzz"" of London.",5,2016,07,04
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"A wonderful hotel with wonderful sights and I. A great location in central London near landmarks like the Royal Albert Hall, Kendington Palace, Westfield Mall, Selfridges, Harrods, high street central London",5,2016,07,03
133,An excellent location coupled with great service,"I regularly use this hotel for a business meeting.   The service is consistently good and the staff go out of their way to be efficient and helpful.  The rooms with a Park view are especially nice.  The hotel is centrally located at the beginning of High Street Kensington, only a short walk from Harrods, for those who like to shop!",5,2016,07,02
133,"Comfy, functional but dated","First impressions on entering the hotel lobby was that it was slightly dated, however, the rooms catered for everything well and I liked details such as the additional hand shower attachment in the bath, TV volume control in the bathroom, the window seat, and the radio alarm clock by the bed. The bed was extremely comfortable and I had a great night's sleep. Breakfast in the Park Terrace was good. Whilst appearing dated d√©cor-wise, the hotel did not feel tired and still gave glimpses of luxurious fixtures & fittings.",4,2016,06,30
133,"Excellent hotels with views, service and standard","Stayed in the garden room and loved the view. Everything in the room are maintained to a very high standard. We experienced very good customer service throughout our stay. Location is very good, we are close to many attractions and shopping. Will definitely revisit. ",5,2016,06,29
133,"Great hotel , service & location ",Can't find any fault with the Royal garden  . I found the service very good and I really liked the location right next to the park try to get a park view if possible .Room was a nice size as was the bathroom ; food was also very good .Would stay here again . ,5,2016,06,29
133,London visit,"Excellent location, transport links with many buses from the door and walks in the gardens.  Easy access to the Royal Albert Hall.  Views are amazing from high floor rooms and rooms overlooking the mews are quiet.",5,2016,06,29
133,Relax and enjoy,"Good quiet location, walking distance to the museums. Very handy for a picnic in Kensington Gardens.1st class breakfast and the staff are some of the best I've come across in 30 years. The celebration package is a nice touch, and the beds are to die for üëçüëçüëç",5,2016,06,28
133,Excellent hotel,Lovely hotel. Comfortable well appointed rooms. Excellent breakfast. Location is great and easy access to the underground. Car parking is convenient but expensive. Would be great to have subsidised parking for hotel guests . ,5,2016,06,28
133,1st class hotel,"Wonderful hotel,staff very helpful,
Room very  comfortable 
Breakfast was very nice with lots of choice
Would stay here again and would recommend this hotel 
Paid ¬£50 to be upgraded to an executive room and was given an amazing suite overlooking Kensington gardens ",5,2016,06,28
133,"reliable, clean, comfortable and convenient","Always a good dependable stay. Rooms are comfortable and spotless and the staff is friendly and helpful. Very conveniently located near tube, walking distance to many sights.Nice view in most rooms and you can request a quiet room-I always sleep well here. Small complaints: My bed sagged in the middle which should not be the case in a 5 star hotel-might be time to replace some of the beds. And they should provide at least hard boiled eggs at the continental breakfast which is very good but very expensive. But I will certainly return.",5,2016,06,27
133,Family trip,"Excellent hotel. Friendly staff. Highly recommend. Location is just perfect, next to Park and Kensington Palace. We love walking in the park right next to the hotel. Bus stop is right next to the hotel and underground is only few blocks away.",5,2016,06,27
133,Fantastic Hotel,"Third time booking at the Royal Garden and it never disappoints. Spacious rooms, friendly and helpful staff and one of the best locations in terms of Tube access, cafes, Wholefoods, Notting Hill etc. The outlook over Kensington Gardens is a bonus. Highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be back.",5,2016,06,26
133,Dinner,Lovely hotel.  The food could have been better.  I would have expected better food from a nice hotel.  The burger wasn't seasoned but was presented nicely.  The fish was overly greasy again presented well.  The chicken was average.  The service was good and the staff were adorable and attentive.  Such a shame the food lets this place down.  ,3,2016,06,26
133,Delightful stay at the Royal Garden,"This hotel is so conveniently located with almost instant access to Hyde Park and the shops and amenities of High Street Ken. The rooms are excellently appointed and guests are given a friendly, warm welcome by genuinely caring staff. The quality of the food is exceptional. I cannot fault my stay or even make a suggestion for improvement.",5,2016,06,26
133,Third Visit,"Third stay at this hotel - excellent location, good rooms, and good service.  Would recommend to anyone visiting London.  Directly adjacent to Kensington Palace and the park. Good access to the tube, shopping, and restaurants.",4,2016,06,25
133,London 2016,"Lovely- but pricey and a bit less than what you pay for.  Centrally located, close to Underground so worth considering.  The staff are all very polite and aim to please.  Rooms a bit small for a family. No 110 electric as advertised for US appliances - make sure you have UK plug adapters",4,2016,06,23
133,Awesome view,"Classy hotel in nice neighborhood, plenty of shops, restaurants, pubs just steps away. Highlight was the awesome view out the back, looking over Kensington Palace and Hyde Park. The 50th anniversary mementos in the corridors were a nice touch.",5,2016,06,23
133,Perfect location great value,"Great Hotel which is big enough but still has a boutique feel.The service from top to bottom was impeccable, and I know my hotels.Everyone from the Room service front desk and housekeeping...this group is a well oiled machine.Just great.Location couldnt be better and prices  reasonable.",4,2016,06,22
133,Excellent hotel in Kensington,"Stayed here fore a week and really loved it. 

Very close to the Kensington high street station, close to great restaurants, and about a 5-10 minute walk to Hyde Park.

What I loved the most was the customer service! Top notch!",5,2016,06,22
133,"Details, Details","First off: this hotel is set the standard, for my 4YO, by which all other hotels will be judged. They gave her a backpack full of activities when we checked-in and she LOVED it and showed it to everyone we met.

It raised the bar for us adults, too. I stay in a lot of hotels; my family travels really regularly. I've developed a kind of wish list for the details that matter to me, at this hotel hit each one, and added a few things I hadn't known I wanted. I could wash my face in the sink without splashing water everywhere or hitting my head on anything! I could make my daughter an evening cup of cocoa! I could turn off almost every light from the bedside control panel--and I could charge my phone while keeping it on the bedside table! They even had a desk where the top opened up to become a vanity that faced the window, so I could put makeup on using natural light, and one of the options on the bedside control panel was a dim, blue-tinged nightlight.

The one place where I ran into trouble was in the shower: there were two shower heads, and in figuring out how to operate the one I wanted to use, I accidentally turned on the other one and soaked my hair, which I'd been trying to keep dry. I really wish hotels would label their shower taps as a matter of course. But everything else was absolutely top-rate!",5,2016,06,22
133,"Royal Garden Hotel, Kensington","We have stayed at this hotel several times in recent years and find it very convenient. The garden rooms have great views over Kensington Gardens and, for London, are relatively quiet. The staff are friendly and welcoming and do not intrude when you are having dinner. The fine dining was excellent and the food was a lot better than we expected.",5,2016,06,22
133,A really good hotel in a great location,"I have stayed here many times and the fact that I keep returning speaks volumes. Unfortunately, I can't always justify their headier prices but it is much more affordable on other occasions. The top floor Asian restaurant is outstanding.",5,2016,06,22
133,Nice hotel in heart of london.,"If you are coming here by underground train get off at Kensington high street station. It just across the road. I came here the staff were wonderful. I like the gym it open 24 hours. A big size with TVs, there is towels and water too. From here you can walk around London than catching underground train or bus. I will come back again.",5,2016,06,22
133,A wonderful hotel to stay in.,This was a great base for our weekend in London taking in a Coldplay concert. Rooms were beautiful and clean and well equipped. Breakfast was relaxed with an excellent choice of both  English and Continental styles.  We did not use the dining facilities during our stay but menus looked varied and interesting. Staf were always welcoming attentive and efficient. ,5,2016,06,21
133,Five Star Service,"We stay in this hotel every couple of months when we come to London from our home, which is in the country. We have been coming here for over ten years. Having tried many other hotels in central London, I simply wouldn't stay anywhere else. Ease of location, service is without a doubt the best I've experienced, and clean and classy rooms. We stayed in room 714. Its like having your own apartment in London. For the first time since we have stayed there, we decided to have lunch in the Park Terrace. For under twenty pounds we had a three course meal of the absolute highest standard. My husband had grilled seabass and I had roast butternut open ravioli. The portions were generous and (as I have said many times) the service - faultless.  The reason I am writing another review is because they deserve another mention. I left a coat behind in the room. One call and I had my coat sent back recorded delivery the following day.  Many thanks to the Royal Garden staff who did this for me. David in security and all in Concierge. I am most grateful.",5,2016,06,21
133,"Extraordinary hotel, unbeatable location.","One of the best hotels in London in location, staff service and comfort. The Chinese restaurant is one of the best, if not the best, in London and has one spectacular view. Staff is very friendly.  Highly recommended.",5,2016,06,20
133,Never disappointed,"Love the Garden Rooms, service and restaurant so good,we go back 
time after time. so much to do in the area, its a real treat to stay there.
Ideal to walk round Kensington gardens or Albert hall. Our favourite hotel in London",5,2016,06,20
133,Great accommodation and discreteservice,"Overall the hotel offers a great location, high quality facilities,,comfortable rooms and a pleasant ambiance. The service is first class and the counter staff, and other functionaries were helpful but never obtrusive. My rating is it is the place to stay in Londin",5,2016,06,20
133,Great place to stay,Love the location next to park and fabulous restaurants.  The staff is so helpful and friendly. Whole Foods across the street is a great plus.  Great shopping nearby. Next to Kensigton Palace.  Easy access to taxis. It is a beautiful hotel at a great location. ,5,2016,06,19
133,Good London Hotel for Family of 3,"We chose this hotel because it was highly rated and provided an affordable Executive suite with a king bed plus a pull out bed for our 16 year old.  As Americans, we were surprised at how rare 2 queen beds were in London -- paying for 2 rooms seemed crazy.  It was a perfect sized room. 

Other Pros: Easy walk to tube stop, comfortable beds and beautifully designed bathroom, Whole Foods 2nd floor food court nearby with reasonably priced meals, courteous hotel staff, bus stop across the street, safe and comfy neighborhood. 

Cons: The hotel website promised free wifi, so we booked on TripAdvisor via Booking.com. In the fine print, wifi costs ¬£20 per day when booking this way -- misleading. Fortunately, there was a nice little Starbucks across the street. I hate paying for wifi. ",5,2016,06,19
133,Very nice hotel Royal Garden Hotel,"Very nice, neat and quiet hotel with professional staff. I especially enjoyed the food, lots of very nice meal options and tasty too. The conference rooms were also very comfortable. I would love to visit this hotel again and I plan to.",4,2016,06,19
133,RGH does everything very well,"Wonderful choice for a week in London: super clean functional rooms, a breakfast buffet and entrees to die for and a tireless staff that can match you with the perfect restaurant or book a private car at the drop of a hat.  Clearly a well managed property with high standards across the board. ",5,2016,06,18
133,Not as good as my last visit,"Having stayed here for my birthday a couple of years ago and being really impressed with the Hotel, I was enthusiastic about recommending this hotel to my boss and colleagues for our night out in London. unfortunately it just didn't live up to expectations. We were all a little disappointed with the size of our rooms which were very small and basic and look like they are now in need of a bit of an update. Bedding still far too thin (as pointed out in my previous review)its all very well saying I can request another duvet, but the last thing I want to do when I'm tired is phone down to reception and sit and wait for the arrival of more sheets, surely spare blankets in the room is a better option? upon arrival we weren't helped with our bags/cases and I wasn't offered help to my room either. We were out for the evening but returned to the hotel for drinks in the bar later, service was good in the bar. At this point we asked at reception if our rate included breakfast (rooms had been booked through my company)we were told it was. I headed down for breakfast and ordered a coffee and the American Pancakes with bacon, the server was very friendly but the coffee took around 10 minutes to arrive and the food longer. They asked me to sign for the food which I explained was part of my room rate but she said it still needed to be signed for, when looking at the bill my breakfast had been listed as the full English for ¬£25 so I queried this because I'd only had the ¬£9.50 pancakes and a coffee, the server explained that they package up the breakfast options at that one price because if they work out exactly what has been had separately it would likely come out to more - however I didn't have any of the buffet/continental options so mine definitely  wouldn't have come to ¬£25 so I thought this was a little cheeky. Upon checking out I was told my breakfast wasn't included after all! So all in all my stay came to over ¬£300 which in my opinion is far too steep, if I had been in the room I was in previously I  could have understood the charge a bit more as it was more like a suite, but for such a small room it does seem overpriced and when that doesn't include breakfast either it doesn't warrant a return visit! ",3,2016,06,17
133,Ok,Berries bar is great the food was nice and they let me watch the football. Given the location I thought it would be a little more comfortable and luxurious but it was ok. Facility's were fine but at the price you pay for the rooms your better off saving your money to be honest,3,2016,06,17
133,good place for the quieter side of london,"Went here for business, was a good spot to be away from the more popular areas of London.  Kensington gardens close by, easy access to tour bus route, tube & cabs convenient as well.  Nice room with a comfortable bed, bathtub and shower, couch & desk.  The city view was great, too.",4,2016,06,16
133,Family weekend,"Car park access difficult
Rooms at front of hotel a little noisy during the night
Staff extremely helpful and pleasant
Breakfast was excellent with lots of choice
Super location for access to the underground ,local restaurants, museums and Kensington gardens which my granddaughter loved, especially the scooters the hotel kindly provided.
",4,2016,06,14
133,Great location and excellent service.,"Excellent service and accomodation. Friendly staff. Easy access to bus and tube. Fruits in the room to welcome us. Very close to Royal Albert Hall and museums. Good shopping around (Whole Foods, Marks&Spencer). Good restaurants (Cafe Concerto, etc.).",5,2016,06,14
133,Stay at Royal Garden Hotel,We stayed overnight in a Park Suite and it worked out really well. A very child friendly hotel with excellent food choices if do not wish to dine out. The park is literally next door. Great location for family stay. ,4,2016,06,14
133,"Superb hotel, faultless service","I stayed here for a recent business trip and found the hotel to be of an excellent standard. I took the tube to High St Kensington and then walked the short distance to the hotel. I was promptly greeted by the concierge outside of the hotel who offered to carry my luggage in. At check in, I was promptly attended to and told everything I needed for my stay by a very pleasant receptionist. I had a lovely room on the 5th floor overlooking the park. In the evening I had a drink in the upstairs bar where again service was excellent, before heading out to an evening function. Upon my return later in the evening, my room had been turned down and a complimentary bottle of water and a pastry had been left for me. I didn't stay for breakfast in the morning but overall I would highly recommend staying here and I certainly will do so when I am next in the area either for business or pleasure.",5,2016,06,13
133,"Very Nice, Excellent Staff","This is an upscale hotel near the side entrance to Kensington Park (palace). The rooms are very well appointed with comfortable beds and plenty of pillows.  The mini- bar has excellent options including a full size bottle of wine.  There is an electric kettle with coffee/tea supplies (including cookies) available (for free) also.  The bathroom are luxurious with a soaking tub and separate shower.  A heated towel rack is very nice touch. The breakfast buffet is excellent with a good selection of continental or hot foods. The lobby, restaurant, and bar are elegant but not off-putting. There are several quick-service restaurants, a very busy pub, and shopping nearby on High Street.  There's a nice group of grab & go options at the entrance to the Underground (subway) station just 3 blocks away. Kensington Park connects to Hyde Park for an area of vast greenery.  Nice if you jog or want to rent a bike.  Royal Albert Hall and many museums are less than a mile away and easily walkable.",5,2016,06,13
133,London experience,"This was my first visit to London. The rooms are a little small at the Royal Garden but the hotel is excellent in every other way. The location is beautiful, neighborhood is safe and clean and it is a short walk to public transportation. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,06,13
133,Good Position,"This is a very comfortable hotel and the rooms (well, the one we had!) spacious and comfortable as was the bathroom. This is very well positioned for Opera Holland Park, The Royal Albert Hall an museums in the area - not to mention Knightsbridge!",4,2016,06,13
133,Superbly located,"Fabulous hotel with very helpful and professional staff service. The hotel was booked, on my behalf, as easily located for an evening awards dinner so I would definitely consider it again. Excellent views over Hyde Park and Kensington Palace.",5,2016,06,13
133,Excellent service. Great Location.,"I stay at this hotel regularly because of its location close to the tube, Harrods and the Kensington High Street. Accommodation, Food, service always excellent. Doormen especially helpful with looking after my car.",5,2016,06,12
133,Fantastic stay,"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in May. It was an amazing hotel in Kensington, close to shops, restaurants, hyde park and Knightsbridge. We had a hyde park view room and it was amazing. I loved the view and our room was comfy, clean and quiet. For me cleanness of hotel is always very important and this hotel was like home to me. The room service was awesome and they used to clean the room two times. I also recommend the restaurant and bar. The food was really really good and staff were friendly and helpful.",5,2016,06,11
133,Best hotel in London,"The royal garden is an amazing hotel with one of the best Chinese restaurants ever. The rooms are spectacular especially the ones that look out over the Kensington gardens. The staff are as helpful as anyone could ever be making sure you are all set for your stay in the Hotel. When I stayed here with my family nothing went wrong the hotel is perfect. Only one downside the wifi isn't free in the rooms. 
Thanks lewis",4,2016,06,11
133,Great location,"I booked a ""garden twin room"" which looked out onto beautiful Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. Loved throwing drapes open in morning and seeing locals scurrying about in park exercising and walking their pets. We did not want to look onto another high rise, so this backdrop was perfect!! The only negative that I must mention is the acoustics (or soundproofing, if you will) are pretty bad...admittedly, I am a light sleeper, but I was kept awake a couple times by hallway noise made by staff and visitors which made me a little grouchy...",5,2016,06,10
133,Superb and convenient,"My recent stay was delightful!  Superb accommodations, convenient and lovely location, and every contact with hotel staff was professional yet friendly and helpful.  Fond memories, will definitely recommend this hotel, and hopefully one day will return.",5,2016,06,10
133,Expensive without Wi-Fi,"Great location next to the park and shopping, clean and high quality rooms, but se were very disappointed that they did not include Wi-Fi. Never experienced this before at a high range hotel. Goos service otherwise. ",4,2016,06,10
133,Wonderful hotel,This hotel is perfect.  We stayed for two nights and had rooms on the 7th floor over looking the gardens.  The bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept on.  The hotel kindly gave us complimentary fizz and chocolates as we were celebrating our 50th birthdays.  Breakfast was wonderful.  Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel,5,2016,06,09
133,Lovely hotel,"Very pleasant stay at this one. We'd booked a bunch of flights on a credit card and then accidentally used that one to book the hotel at the Marble Arch. We didn't realize and by the time we got off the plane from Canada we discovered the Montcalm at the Marble Arch had canceled our room without any notification. We're literally at the Paddington train station with no hotel room. We quickly jumped on Booking.com and grabbed a room here, at the Royal Gardens. I used Trip Advisor reviews too pick one on the fly, in the taxi lineup.
Fortunately this was a great hotel. In fact i canceled our room at the Montcalm for when we're back in London next week and we are staying at the Royal Garden again.

The Good - 
Loved the location. There's a pub around the corner, a whole food market one block over, and every bit of shopping you need. It's a main street so getting cabs is simple. The rooms are spacious and clean and very well maintained and updated. The hotel is very nice.
The restaurant was quite good.

The Bad - 
The restaurant is very pricey, more so than the hotel is. And the wait staff are hit and miss. We certainly had a rude one. She was not very polite and even bossy with us, the patrons...
The hotel isn't close to the underground so the tube is virtually useless without a walk.
No pool or hot tub.

The Ugly - 
No wifi... Come on, this is 2016. Every hotel needs free wifi. It's essential.

All in all, I recommend this hotel and will be back in a week.",4,2016,06,09
133,Perfect Stay,"This hotel is my home from home in London.  All the staff take such great care of me, from Gill and Josefina with my reservations, to the seamless check-in, excellent concierge run by Robert, where nothing is ever too much trouble, and meticulous room service and housekeeping.  The staff are most professional and yet make you feel welcome and remember every details about your preferences and make you feel very special.  Thank you to everyone.",5,2016,06,08
133,Personal Review,It is a reasonable location with good parking facilities and outside of the congestion charge area. There is an underground station nearby and right on top of Hyde Park. There are museums close by and plenty of bars and restaurants,4,2016,06,08
133,Perfect Stay,Everything  about this hotel is superb. The food quality is excellent along with the staff who serve it to you. The hotel has a friendly atmosphere and its location for central London is good. Room service was the best I have seen for a very long time.,5,2016,06,08

133,Royal GardenHotel London,Good position in Kensington high street near tube and museums and Albert Hall. Queen Room small and tv postioned not well so both people could not view it.  Staff very friendly.  Food (breakfast) very good.  Some noise from road at nights.  Roos clean and towels changed  twice a day and turndown service.  Free bottles of water person person per day. ,4,2016,06,07

133,Excellent Stay,"Wanted to stay here but prices were too steep so we booked at a cheaper hotel until... two days before we left The Royal Garden had a 33% off all rooms offer so we hastily cancelled the other reservation and booked.
So glad we did.
We had a ""Garden Room"" 6th floor and overlooking Hyde Park and Kensington Palace.
Room was immaculate and kept that way by our housekeeper, I particularly noticed the way every bit of chrome in the bathroom was polished and smear free.
Didn't eat here so can't comment on the restaurant but did have a few cocktails in the bar before leaving for nights out and on returning and these were expertly and correctly mixed (although my wife does prefer a twist of lime with her Cosmo rather than a wedge of orange).
We had a great stay and would definitely return - if the price was right!",5,2016,06,06
133,Very good stay,"Attended a series of meetings over two day but was impressed with the facilities. Room very comfortable, bed excellent, shower very good. food very nice and Breakfast excellent.

133,Everything is excellent,Hotel is very nice. It has profesional staff at the reception desk. It is very clean hotel with nice and clean rooms. They serve very good and fresh food at the restaurant. Hotel has very good location. Behind the hotel there is a huge park. You need half an hour walk trough the park to reach Royal Palace and 40 minutes to reach Big Ben or London eye,5,2016,06,06
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"The Royal Garden is a very nice hotel, but suffering a bit from from age. The staff are excellent and very attentive. Both Bertie's Bar and the Park Terrace bar suffer from a lack of seating at each bar itself, with the former really need a makeover in general. The location is great with lots of good things within walking distance. The room I had was small but nicely appointed, and even though it faced on to High Street Kensington was quiet for sleeping.",4,2016,06,05
133,Great Location and Staff,"Royal Garden is located right next to the Kensington Palace Gardens which will give you an idea of its awesome location. On the Kensington high street, almost everything is on a walking distance from Natural History Museum, Science Museum, Harrods, Hyde Park etc. The tube station is nearby as well. 
The hotel staff is very hospitable and warm towards your needs. The food was very good with generous proportions. 
The only flip side owing to its great location is the price. The tariff is steep and almost no complimentary services which one comes to expect like Wi-Fi, Breakfast etc. 
Ovearll, worth the money for the location and great staff.",5,2016,06,04
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"Comfortable room, friendly and helpful reception and concierge, excellent food in the restaurant. Nice relaxing stay, convenient location for Kensington High Street tube to all areas. Room was small but had everything we needed. ",5,2016,06,04
133,Lovely fresh weekend away,"Lovely weekend away for family wedding. Service amazing, rooms slightly smaller than thought for cost but clean throughout with perfect facilities. Only worry was very slippy bathroom when wet even with anti slip mat in the bath. So make sure you use the grab handle when exiting bath",4,2016,06,02

133,"Comfortable, relaxing, excellent location","Wonderful stay in a comfortable and nice from overlooking the park.

Right choice for money-quality. Staff was great with service !",5,2016,06,01
133,Great hotel but it is not a 5*,"The pictures of the website and the classification is misleading. The fa√ßade is definitely shabby and ugly however, the staff and the services of the hotel are great ,let alone the cleanliness of the rooms and especially the confort of the beds. So all in all, a great experience with a bitter taste because of the high expectations. (it's definitely not a 5* hotel)",3,2016,06,01
133,Perfect Hotel Fir Our Trip To London,"We were celebrating my wife's 50 th birthday . The hotel was perfectly located on Kendington High street lots of things to see and a shirt scenic walk through Kensington gardens to Nittung Hill . The tube was 2 mins away and being on the central line was 3 drops from Paddington. The staff were the most helpful I have ever experienced,Palona at reception made check in a great example of outstanding customer service. Our room was spotless and large with stunning views over the city's skyline - all the iconic buildings in a panoramic view while lying in bed or sitting in the lounge area. I would recommend rhis hotel to anyone 'I have stated in many 5 star London hotels and this was the best experience - better even than the mandarin oriental .

Although we got there two hours before the 2.00pm check in they allowed us into our room, which was great and upgraded to a garden room. The hotel was quiet as it was a bank holiday weekend. Nice chocs in the room later for our anniversary. Would recommend for a short break,but hunt around for a good deal.",4,2016,05,31

133,Best hotel in Kensington ,"If Your looking for a Hotel in Kensington area of London or a view to the park this is one of the few hotels that would be offering that. Ask for the Garden view room and you will have a direct view overlooking Hyde park. The hotel is chilled and quiet, but not the boring type though. 
The negatives are the gym and spa are not of high standards but if you are just looking for a place to stay this is a good hotel.
There is a Chinese restaurant on the top floor, great food and also a great Tea area where you can have snacks on the ground floor.",5,2016,05,27
133,Room sfety,Room was disappointing as it was above the front door and was a bit noisy. Also 2 steps up to sitting area very dangerous as at the side there are no steps and tripping there is all too easy and dangerous. Had one very bad fall.  This should be checked.  Room 130,4,2016,05,27

The room we had this time overlooked the park, and it was lovely.   The layout has a slightly elevated platform for the work area, with the bedding in the lower terrace.  There is ample closet space, and a lovely bathroom.   The room was very quiet, allowing sleep.  Ventilation was excellent.  All devices in the room worked properly.",5,2016,05,24
133,Fantastic Hotel,"Attentive staff, fantastic setting, right by Kensington Gardens. Many of the staff have worked there for a long time, meaning they appear to be well looked after and as a result are very hard working. Nothing was too much trouble for our conference. Highly recommend. ",5,2016,05,24
133,Lodon visit,"Nice central place hotel, bit crapped room nowhere to put my luggage and had to ask for an iron board

133,High street  hotel,"The hotel is situated in walking distance of the Royal Albert Hall. Everything about the hotel shouted five star London Hotel. It was so quiet in our room and you couldn't hear the traffic even though our room was overlooking the High Street. Mini bar and tea making facilities are just what a traveller needs after a day of sightseeing . 
Rooms are spotless, beds comfy and all toiletries adequate . Slippers and gowns but to be expected. Male visitors may be looking for a trouser press but I didn't see one.",5,2016,05,22
133,Fit for a visit to the Queen,"Stayed for 2 nights when attending a garden party at Buckingham Palace. Excellent staff, lifts, room, breakfast and restaurant. Well placed quite near High Street Kensington Tube station BUT cross the road at the lights before you reach the hotel, because it's on the other side of an extremely busy road (Kensington High Street) and the lights after the hotel seemed quite a long way away....",5,2016,05,22
133,On the Park,"Our favorite spot in London. End of Kensington High Street. Rooms look over Kensington Gardens (and London skyline if on a high floor) or the animation of the High Street. Both great. Particularly like the rooms with 2-seater couches.  Lovely spacious dining room with good value lunches and dinners and very friendly staff. Traditional Sunday lunch recommended. Bus stop right outside, Tube a 5-minute walk, entrance to park right beside hotel. Just a great location.",5,2016,05,21

133,Kensington's best,"Excellent property.  I consider the hotel as one of London's best.  Strongly recommended.  Without doubt, the most comfortable rooms in the city.  The fitness center is perfect for the active traveler.

133,Another great stay,Our stay was most enjoyable with every request provided. The Staff right throughout the Hotel are First Class. The standard of Cuisine in the Hotel is excellent. The rooms and the location of the Royal Garden make it very easy to enjoy London,5,2016,05,20
133,Almost perfect! Next trip already booked.,"This is my hotel of choice in Kensington, I have stayed here over a dozen times in the past couple of years, usually staying here for work I decided to use it for a trip whilst visiting friends. Check in was quick, the lady at check - in I assume was being trained up, so not the fastest but very attentive. I was given a room on the top floor which had a amazing view of the gardens and was extremely quiet. The queen rooms are extremely small this time in particular seemed to be smaller than normal even though I book the Queen room on most trips, but the view distracted me from the compactness, still only one large towel provided in these rooms, after trying and failing to get through to house keeping the lovely  maid I asked in the hall went and put a couple more in the room for me. I ate at the Park terrace for the first time during this stay, I tried in the evening and in the morning to call through to book a table but didn't get through until a hour before I wanted to book after several phone calls down 2 of which were cut off so maybe just go down and book a table as it would be quicker and would have been what I would have done if I wasn't on work calls all morning. This hotel comes so close to getting full marks but not quite their just yet, I have booked my next stay for June again for leisure so will be sampling the other bar and restaurant and will hopefully be getting full marks.",4,2016,05,20
133,Good location overlooking the park,"Overall good stay.  Rooms need to be soundproofed as can hear occupant next door on phone.  The Jin Miang restaurant was a real treat with great views over the park and London beyond
The staff very efficient and friendly. Did not like the way the loung bar has been changed around.  Should have more sofas.",4,2016,05,20
133,The perfect place to stay in London,An other wonderful stay in theis exceptional Hotel in London. A great thanks to Patrick and his reception staff for sorting out the muddle I had created in the booking process. As usual smiles all around. They make you feel at home here.

133,Report on 12 months permanent basis stay,"Excellent 1 year occupancy on continuos basis.

The general ambiance is one of efficiency, friendly and great room and dining services",5,2016,05,19
133,Always a pleasure...,"We have been coming to this hotel for at least 15 years and it is always a pleasure. The hotel staff are all courteous, the concierge are all wonderful, the rooms are clean, the location is such that you can get anywhere in London that's worth going to.",5,2016,05,19

133,the perfect hotel,As good a hotel as we have ever stayed in. All staff were very helpful and friendly. Breakfast in Park Terrace restaurant and dinner in Min Jaing were both delicious and the park view suite was well worth paying that bit extra for. ,5,2016,05,18

133,Fantastic location with great service,"The employees were very polite and attentive throughout: in the breakfast area, reception, room service, valet, housekeeping. We had a suite with a garden view for our family of five and it was a very good choice. The location is great since you are by beautiful Kensington Gardens, in good high street shopping area, very close to N Hill, Kightsbridge or South Ken and the tube station is 2mins away to go anywhere you like. The buses are also very convenient and taxis are aplenty most of the time. Internet connection included if you book directly with hotel and works very well.",5,2016,05,17
133,A great hotel,"I have used the Royal Garden Hotel in the past for visitors from my home country, this included Ministers and Prime Ministers. My dealings with the hotel were always easy and professional. Now I stayed at the hotel myself for the first time. I had a wonderful stay. The room was spacious and I was also lucky to have a view over Kensington Gardens. Rooms are very practical and have all a seasoned traveler requires. The bed was extremely comfortable, something I find lacking in a lot of hotels. Staff are very friendly and willing to assist. Don't forget to have a fabulous lunch or dinner in their Chinese restaurant Min-Jiang, the beste Chinese food I have ever had and that includes meals in Hong Kong!",5,2016,05,17
133,Excellent Service,"From the point of check in to check out all the staff were amazing. We ate in the restaurant and the food was excellent. You must leave room for a dessert...home made and delicious.  Comfortable bed, free newspaper. Service with a friendly warmth. Impressed.",5,2016,05,17
133,Delightful,I can't praise the staff enough always helpful.     The rooms are always fresh and clean and very welcoming.   Will be back again in June.   Can't wait.     There is nothing I would change about the hotel.    The view over gardens is my favourite.,5,2016,05,17
133,Stay at Hotel,"Staff very helpful, hotel was very comfortable and inviting. We were only there for one night and out most of the time. When we returned to the hotel our bed was turned back and mellow music was playing on the radio - nice touch",5,2016,05,17
133,Great View,"Our room overlooked Kensington Palace and the next morning after a wonderful full English breakfast, it was so nice to have a stroll around the Palace gardens. The staff is very helpful and we had a top notch stay. We will be back.",5,2016,05,16
133,Makes our stay in London comfortable each time,"A modern hotel often gets the answers right.  Good air conditioning, clean and comfortable beds, spacious bathrooms.  What a great location too.  We've experimented with different hotels over the years and feel that we have finally found a hotel that makes it so much more pleasant to do all our sightseeing in good comfort.",5,2016,05,16
133,GREAT HOTEL!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.  Rooms were a good size and clean.  Staff was very helpful.  Location proved to be close to many amenities, including Kensington Gardens, Whole Foods, restaurants, Royal Albert Hall and much more.",5,2016,05,16
133,Royal Garden Hotel Kensington,"Great hotel in an idyllic location looking over kensington park. Situated on the Kensington high street with very good transport links and close by to a variety of high street and designer shops. 

Very nice, modern reception and lobby area with friendly staff to greet you and check you into your room,

Rooms are comfortable with tea and coffee making facilities, mini bar, hairdryer, TV, bathrobe and slippers, Penhaligons toiletries , full length mirrors and ample storage space. Decorated in neutral colours , the rooms are modern in style. The rooms at the front of the hotel are subject to some street noise from traffic and passers by which can be heard so ideally a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the park would be a preferred choice. 

The hotel has lots of good meeting and event space to offer and can offer a lovely environment for business guests. 

The hotel has excellent dining facilities with a renowned Chinese restaurant with stunning views and a fine dining restaurant on the ground floor , the Park terrace restaurant. This is where we ate and the food was excellent quality with lovely presentation and great staff and the restaurant had a lovely relaxed atmosphere. There are also a number of local bars and nightspots near by to the hotel within walking distance. 

Breakfast in the hotel was excellent, loads of choice for both continental and cooked breakfast , with eggs and omelettes cooked fresh to order and a hot food menu to choose from if you did not want to eat from the hot buffet station. Again staff were very good and attentive at topping up your tea and coffee and juice. 

All in all a very enjoyable stay and a lovely hotel to visit.",5,2016,05,16
133,Consistently great!,"This was my 6th stay at this hotel over the past several years and I've never had nothing but a great experience at the RG! I travel to London often for business mtgs and the hotel is well situated to get around the city quick and easy. The staff is super friendly, rooms have everything you need, wifi is solid. I guess my only complaint is the means by which you have to go through to log into the wifi - as someone who uses multiple devices (laptop, ipad and iphone) - this experience is time consuming and a bit of a pain. It would be great if they could recognise my devices from previous visits and automatically log me in. ",5,2016,05,16
133,Meeting and jogging,"I spend 5 days meeting in this hotel. The location is perfect If you are intrested in jogging and nice location. Park is next door for beautiful jogging. Hotel itself is well maintained, peacefull and room was spacious and beautiful that to my experience is not the case usually in London. Actually I already made arrangements to stay in this hotel again next April. Only minus is that there is no free Wi-Fi in the hotel. I think it is part of modern world and should be part of a high rank hotel services.",5,2016,05,15
133,Great Location!,I really enjoyed my 5-night stay at the Royal Garden. The room wasn't large but it had all the amenities needed and a great view of Kensington Gardens. It was easy and convenient to get all around London but there was so much to see and eat right by there that I rarely needed to take public transportation. It was overall a great place to stay and I'll be booking there again on my next trip to London. ,5,2016,05,15
133,Absolutely lovely,"Beautiful hotel in excellent location. My room was at the rear of the hotel overlooking Kensington Palace and Millionaires Row, but did have the noise of generators outside when I opened the window. Aside from that the room was spotlessly clean, comfy beds, high class bed linen and all amenities I needed. Bathroom had fabulous walk in shower and large bath, luxuriously decorated with lovely towels, bathrobes and slippers. Lovely toiletries provided. 
Loved coming back late to find room had been serviced, tea tray replenished and bed turned down.
Would definitely recommend 100% and will certainly stay here again",5,2016,05,14
133,Birthday treat,"We have stayed at this hotel before and we think this is the best hotel ever!  We were greeted by Barbora who was friendly, smiley and so charming.  We were booked in efficiently and quickly and our room was ready immediately.  We went out for the day and upon our return we asked if we could have an upgrade.  To our surprise there was a room available.  Thank you to the kindness and friendliness of Gaelle, Simona and Bianca.  It was a treat for my husband's birthday, and he was excited to discover some yummy chocolates on a plate saying 'Happy Birthday' left in our room.  The room was fantastic, we overlooked the front of the hotel and was surprised at how quiet it was.  Bed really comfy and bathroom delightful.  Thank you house keeping for the work that you do!  This hotel is just fantastic and we cannot wait to return!",5,2016,05,14
133,London Walkabout,"Great location on Hyde Park.  If you like walking just about everything - Buckingham Palace, Harrods, Trafalgar Square, is within relatively easy reach.  Subway stop 2 minutes away places the entire city at your doorstep.",5,2016,05,13
133,Always top service,"I love this particular hotel for many reasons. Being a serial shopper, it's ten mins away from Knightsbridge and a no 10 bus to right outside Selfridges. As a single female, l always feel very safe staying in Royal Garden Hotel. Although it's a five star situated beside Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Palace, l find the room rates incredibly reasonable for such a classy, peaceful stay. I look forward to returning very soon. Highly recommended.",5,2016,05,13
133,Great place great view,"Definitely one of the best located hotel in London: just in front of the immens Hyde Park.
Staff is so kind that you'll be amazed... Lifts are the fastest I've ever seen. My room was quite small but really so comfortable!",5,2016,05,12
133,Superb location,"Nice convenient with excellent service ....
Only slight feedback is concierge might have better knowledge of travel options when underground services are affected at Kensington .....
Will be coming back",5,2016,05,11
133,By Tony,A fantastic hotel with excellent facilities and exceptionally friendly and helpful staff.The location is good and it was perfect for a one night stay as we were attending a function held at the hotel. The food including the breakfast was of a very high standard.Would definitely recommend it.,5,2016,05,10
133,Conference,"Good location and facilities, but let down by service when paying high room rates as had to remind for repairs to be done to shaver socket not working. TV situation was poor and remote did not work even when new batteries were requested.",3,2016,05,10
133,A Flawless stay.,"Me and my wife stayed for 1 night at the Royal Garden Hotel as we were going to the royal albert hall, it also tied in nicely with our anniversary. All the staff were amazing, from checking in to the 'house keeping'. When we returned from our evening at the R.A.H  and our room had been 'turned down' the perfect end to a perfect day. My wife and I will definitely stay again and would recommend the hotel to anyone.",5,2016,05,10
133,"Lovely hotel, great location","This place is lovely and the staff are fantastic. The only downfall is it's ¬£25 for breakfast per person. That's just ridiculous. Also the air con wasn't cold enough. Other than that, the place is fantastic! ",4,2016,05,10
133,"Great hotel, friendly helpful staff",We love staying at this hotel which never disappoints. This trip we were attending a reunion at the hotel. The evening was run really well. Food was delicious. Staff as always were friendly and very attentive.,5,2016,05,10
133,Anniversary Weekend,"My wife and I have eaten in Park Terrace on several occasions,but this was our first time of staying.We were not disappointed.The room, although fairly small,was very clean,very comfortable and very quiet,and with views of the Park and the Palace.We had a most enjoyable stay. Thank you. ",5,2016,05,10
133,"By Sergey, May 10, 2016","Wonderful location! Extremely friendly stuff. Good service. Good menu. When I'm in London I always stay here. For reasonable money you will get the good value.
The hotel practically is in the centre of London, so you could get elsewhere by taxi or tube without any problems. Ideal place to walk in Kensington garden.",5,2016,05,10
133,Superb hotel stay in London,"This was a weekend break booked through a travel website could not fault this hotel in any way !! All staff had the highest standard location was excellent for what we required , it was a lovely setting so close to Kensington Palace & Gardens .",5,2016,05,10
133,3 days in London,"Good experience overall.  Very convenient location, near buses and Kensington High Street underground station.  Plenty of cafes nearby.  But WiFi extra.  Ideally I'd like a room facing the Kensington Gardens.",4,2016,05,10
133,Great Hotel in London,"Right next to Kensington Palace. Great base to explore the city from! Walking distance from the tube and there is always a cab standing by at the front door. Staff at the front desk are top notch and the restaurants have excellent service. Book early for the Chinese restaurant on the top floor, because it is popular and we couldn't get in two nights we were there.",5,2016,05,09
133,Superb hotel used when attending event at Royal Albert Hall,"We stayed in a queen room which overlooked the park and was in an immaculate condition. Perfect for a one night stay as we were attending an event at the Royal Albert Hall, just a 10 min walk away from the hotel. We found all staff to be friendly and professional. Hotel is in a great position on Kensington high street.",5,2016,05,09
133,Quality of the highest standard,"The Royal Garden Hotel - and particularly the staff and location - are unrivaled in most of London, in my opinion! 

Great location on High Street Ken and Hyde Park, just a stone's throw from the Royal Albert Hall, Harrods, Oxford Street and Buckingham Palace, it's perfect for a short walk to anywhere. 

The staff are fabulous, the food quality of the highest standard, view from the breakfast room to die for (Kensington Palace Orangery!) and atmosphere laid back, yet luxurious. 

The only reason this hotel does not score 5/5 is that the corporate deal rooms (with my company) are very small and not necessarily value for money. Although I am sure",4,2016,05,08
133,Lovely experience,"This is ideally located hotel for those with excellent taste. There is beautiful Kensington gardens right next door, shopping, easy access to anything you may want or need.  The staff is wonderful and the food divine.",4,2016,05,08
133,Great Hotel,Fantastic location and room and overall experience. Must Hv been fairly recently renovated as great for a 50 year old hotel. The beds and linen and all room fittings were first rate and the service staff incredible both in restaurants and room service. ,5,2016,05,07
133,Quality in Kensington,"Clean hotel, very friendly staff - I always stay here when in London for business.  Conveniently located by the High Street Kensington tube station, the Royal Garden is an upscale hotel with a reasonable price.",4,2016,05,07
133,Great location & very comfortable,"Stayed here on a deal through secret escapes. The hotel is in a great location so close to so many attractions and restaurants. We didn't bother with the breakfast as there are so many good small independent cafes close to the hotel. You can walk to the Hotel from the nearest tube (High Street Kensington - circle and district line) and then don't need to bother with the tube as there is so much close to see. The hotel is adjacent to Kensington Palace and Kensington Gardens - you can walk through the park to Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace and St James Park. It is also worth walking North to Little Venice and the Regent's canal which is traffic free all the way to Mile End in East London. There is a canal boat that runs along the canal from little Venice to Camden lock. The hotel is very modern, well equipped and comfortable. From the outside, looking back to the Hotel from Kensington palace it does look a bit austere and ugly. ",4,2016,05,07
133,Attitude of Duty manager,Having had a great meal at the park terrace restaurant we had the cheek to ask for a discounted rate to stay over at the hotel for the night. The attitude of the the duty manager we spoke to was disgusting.  'do you know what our rate is  !'. Being talked down to is never pleasant and not necessary. A pleasant evening spoilt by a very unpleasant individual. Apparently he thought he could still sell the hotel out even though it was 10pm with numerous rooms available.  I suppose if you are based in Kensington park you don't have to worry. A bit of business sense would have turned our experience into one that was fantastic which earns the positive reviews.  Don't they teach people in this sort of position anything these days !,1,2016,05,06
133,Extended Stay,"Great location next to the park and shopping areas plus the rooms are a good size but the decor could be updated and the room service menu enlarged.
Customer was good as was the gym facility.
Central location for all forms of transportation",4,2016,05,06
133,Great weekend city break hotel,"Great location at the end of Hyde Park, right next to Kensington Palace.  Rooms quite spacious and nicely appointed. Great spacious bathroom. Breakfast was fantastic with plenty of choice, chef on hand to cook the likes of eggs and omelettes. Would certainly stay here again and would recommend for weekend break. Lots of choice of bars, restaurants and shops down Kensington High Street. 3 minute walk from underground station, easy access to all the other London attractions.",5,2016,05,06
133,Excellent stay,"An all-round successful trip with my elderly Mum. 
Staff were very helpful, warm and courteous. Went the extra mile to secure rooms close by. My Mum's room was upgraded and was spacious and beautifully decorated. Spotlessly clean.
 Excellent dinner in Min Jiang. Thoroughly recommended .",5,2016,05,06
133,Overnight stay,"This was our first stay at the Royal Garden Hotel. The staff were friendly, helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  We had a lovely view overlooking Kensington Palace and garden. Only a 10 minute walk to the Royal Albert Hall. I  highly recommend the hotel and would stay there again. ",5,2016,05,06
133,Best and friendliest hotel in London,"I used to have a flat in London. I sold it and now use the Royal Garden. The rooms are perfect the views magnificent the staff turnover is very low, they are all polite and they know my name. We are treated like family
What could be better ",5,2016,05,06
133,Five Star by Title ,I stayed here for four nights whilst attending a conference. The staff were kind and polite. The room was always mostly clean everyday. I travel quite a bit for work so I pay attention to detail wherever I stay. This hotel is five star so I expect the standards to match up with that rating. The heated towel bar in the bathroom was disgustingly dusty to the point I chose not to use it. This is the only flaw I found with the house keeping. The other thing that bothered me was a large crazy in the ceiling. I am aware that this could be newer but at a five star hotel these things should be noticed and remedied quickly. My scored this hotel a four because they did many things right besides my two issues. I would stay here again but the level of cleanliness would make me think twice before booking. ,4,2016,05,05
133,"Fab hotel, great location",A wonderful hotel with good rooms and comfy bed. We would definitely stay again.  Views from our upgraded room were stunning.  We used room service late in the evening which was fine if a little pricey but that is usual I guess.  Staff were friendly. Location was good too.,5,2016,05,05
133,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful experience","The rooms are exquisite, very high standard with contemporary design. Fantastic location, very helpful staff, great room service.

The wifi rates - if not in your room rate - are very high, this should be included in the room rate for such a high quality hotel.",5,2016,05,04
133,Wonderful Hotel,"Great Hotel with wonderful views over Hyde Park. Beautifully decorated rooms, very comfy beds and luxurious bathrooms. Staff are all excellent at their jobs and are clearly happy to be there. Food at Minjiang was amazing, along with the wonderful cocktails! Would definitely return.",5,2016,05,04
133,Relaxing treat,We have visited this hotel a couple of times now and always found it excellent if I could suggest improvements it would be that it's a shame there is no where to sit outside to have a drink on a nice day even if it was a rooftop terrace this would put thebicingbon the cake as they say for this hotel ,5,2016,05,04
133,Excellent stay,This was my third time stayed in Royal Garden Hotel. It is truly delightful to have stayed in a room with Kensington Park view. The hotel is just next to the Kensington Park and it's such a great bonus!,5,2016,05,04
133,Nice Place,"This hotel was comfortable, clean, and well located.  I would gladly stay here again.  It is right next to Hyde Park and the Kensington Palace.  It is easily accessible to the Tube and the Bus Lines.  The service is good and the people are friendly.",5,2016,05,03
133,"Great Location, Excellent All Around","Wish we spent more time at RGH..  We were there for only 1 night and service was excellent from the reception, dining, concierge and bellhop on departure.   Location is great next to the Park, Tube and shops.",5,2016,05,03
133,Excellent overnight,"Can't fault this hotel but were surprised to find that WiFi is not complimentary. The location s some way from the theatre district but compensated for by the beautiful sorroundings, we would definitely return.",5,2016,05,03
133,Satisfied,Good location welcoming staff and the room is agood size comfortable toilets good access to major city shopping and attractions easy access to the park and puplic transportation and a family friendly facilities ,4,2016,05,03
133,SURPRISE !,"What a perfect hotel for visiting London.
The hotel is really touching Hyde Park and at very short walking distance to Kensington Palace.
You will save taxi fares as the Kensington Palace Bus stop brings you  to Picadilly, Portobello, Saint Pancras, Regent-Oxford-Old Bond streets. Royal Albert Hall and Harrods at 5 minutes.
Ok but the Hotel itself ? we felt at ease by the time we passed the door. Modern, stylish, cosy, comfortable rooms with view either on Hyde Park or the city.
The food is more than reasonable, it is good and the reputation of the restaurant brings non-residents which is some kind of a proof.
After having checked all the hotels nearby, you won't find any better value.
We found our base hotel in London !",5,2016,05,03
133,Fantastic stay,Lovely hotel in a perfect location. We had a huge room in the top floor with a fantastic view of the palace. Breakfast was by far one of the best I have had.  Excellent service in particular the concierge Javier who made sure we were taken care of. Thank you for a memorable stay,5,2016,05,02
133,Noise.,"I asked for a quiet room when I booked two months ago. I was given one with connecting doors. I asked for another because the people in the next room were noisy, then I was given one next to the lifts. I spent my stay wearing ear plugs. The hotel staff could have been more helpful, they must have known rooms next to lifts are noisy.",2,2016,05,02
133,Wonderful hotel,"Had a lovely weekend stay here for our anniversary, in a great location over looking Kensington gardens and walking distance to all the museums and 5 mins from the tube, great full English  breakfast with so much choice  and all staff were so helpful and friendly, they re all doing a great job.
 Would definitely recommend staying here to famiy and friends and will return again next time we are in London.",5,2016,05,02

133,It is 5 star hotel,"Very well situated in the centre of London and has all luxury you would expect from such a 5 star hotel. 

Just a few things I was shocked to know: the hotel has no free parking. Also, it has  internet connection with average speed which keep log you from time to time and you will need to re-enter the log-in details!",4,2016,05,01
133,Great location. great staff.,"Perfect for a few days in London. Room was extremely comfortable. Staff were very helpful and friendly, particularly in the restaurant. Would definitely come back again. Great location. Close to tube station.",5,2016,05,01

133,Wonderful Weekend Stay,"Great location, great room, great views. The hotel is 5 minutes from the tube, has great views no matter what side you look out onto. Check-in was swift, easy and exactly as it should be. Room was clean, spacious and well equipped. Nothing major to raise at all. Bathroom water pipes did rattle somewhat during the night - other than this I would highly recommend the hotel. Turn down service was a lovely bonus and all coffee, tea etc topped up at the same time. Very happy with the quality - will return. ",5,2016,04,30
133,Afternoon tea at the Royal garden hotel,"Afternoon tea with friends nice tea very good and helpful staff 
We had the champagne & strawberrys tea ¬£41 each a bit pricey for what it was
Chap on the piano excellent nice touch park terrace very nice to seat in shame about the ladies toilets not quite up to standard for where you are ( not a patch on the Covent Garden hotel ) would I go again not sure  
Also shame that you could not get wi fi",4,2016,04,30
133,Room size was too small...,"The shower and the room were very small. I am 6'2"" and i had a hard time taking a shower. They really could have advised me before. The breakfast menu is limited but quality was good. The staff is friendly but the cost was high in comparison to others.",3,2016,04,30
133,Exceptional stay,"Excellent hotel, lovely stay. Everything was perfect.
No negative comments at all. Thanks for the housekeepers and the staff in reception. Breakfast can be better specially the quality of the coffe!!!",5,2016,04,30
133,Fantastic hotel ,"Wow, this is the best hotel I've stayed in in London. The rooms are not huge as you might expect in London, but they are beautifully laid out and comfortable.

The staff here could not be kinder or more helpful and the bar and restaurant are marvellous. Superlatives all around for me!",5,2016,04,30

Breakfast is expensive. ",4,2016,04,29
133,Should Stay Again.," Very warm out and spear and comfortable room. Right in the heart of London. Staff was very nice and helpful. Food was a little expensive but tasted good.  I would recommend this hotel to others.  Thank you for the hospitality.",5,2016,04,28

Make this a must see/stay if you have a chance.",5,2016,04,28
133,Great room with a view of the Palace garden,"I stayed here 5 days before Christmas solo.

Comfortable, large bed and a decent sized room with smart bathroom. Great view of the Garden too. I didn't use the restaurant or bar, but everything in my room was great.

There was a small desk space so I could use my laptop, as well as plenty of places to plug in electronics. Also great Wifi in the hotel too.",5,2016,04,28
133,We were handled like royalties :),"We did not have the best view, but still; looking over to the Israelian embassy, it was ok enough :) Hospitality was fantastic! The shopping is good near by the hotel, and the access to the tube is also close enough :) ",5,2016,04,28
133,Very good,"Very good and will for sure stay at the Royal garden again in the future. High quality of the hotel and rooms. The breakfast in the weekend is also very good. So is the room service. Nice location and view.

There's a Tube station a short walk away plus great shops and places to eat on the doorstop. ,5,2016,04,27
133,Excellent hotel,"Absolutely lovely hotel, in a great location in London. Staff were very welcoming and friendly and were happy to help when we wanted to change rooms as I wanted a bath, but forgot to ask. It was no problem at all for them. Unfortunately, they charge for wifi. Despite this, i will definitely be going back. ",5,2016,04,27
133,Annual Visit,"We feel so comfortable and relaxed and are always please that our special requests such as sheet and blanket are in place.  we like to specify where our room is to maximise the lovely quiet atmosphere and arrange the room to suit us, which is how it stays until we leave.  Great Service",5,2016,04,27
133,Perfect Hotel in London,"Ask for a parkside room to get a priceless view of Kensington Gardens.  Then make a reservation at Min Jiang and request the Peking Duck.  Say hello to Kenny, the best maitre d'/sommelier in the city.  This hotel never disappoints!",5,2016,04,27
133,A very good hotel !!!,"The room was comfortable,clean, and with a great view. The personnel was friendly and helpful. The third bed was not placed near the double bed which is very convenient when there are three adults travelling together. Overall,it was a very pleasant stay.",5,2016,04,27
133,Lovely afternoon tea,My family and I had afternoon tea in the hotel a few years ago and it was a really lovely experience. Everything was delicious and well prepared. We felt welcome and well taken care of. The view from the restaurant over Kensington Gardens was beautiful and the staff was poilte and provided good service. A place I'd very much like to return to.,5,2016,04,27
133,Fantastic night away for a special concert,"Excellent stay at the Royal garden.
We were upgraded, had fabulous views from our room, polite helpful staff.

Excellent location. ",5,2016,04,27

133,Janet & Melvyn Grady's review,"Rooms excellent, staff excellent,  Food at both Bertie's Bar and the main restaurant all excellent.

133,Birthday weekend,"Great hotel and staff, one not to miss! We plan to stay again later this year. The rooms are of good size and with large bathrooms, we had everything we needed. Close to Kensington Palace, Hyde Park and only a short walk to Harrods. ",5,2016,04,26
133,Great stay in London,Fabulous location next to Kensington Gardens. Shopped in Kensington High Street. Ate at the Island Grill a short walk through the park. Breakfast and Bertie's Bar in the hotel were really good. Exceptional service at all times.,5,2016,04,26
133,Tiny rooms,"This is not the first stay at this hotel
This time our room was tiny and we had only one tower and one cup so looks like we got single room but booked double room
Not many hotels in the world charge for wifi and at 30 pounds a day it must be over priced
",3,2016,04,26
133,"Good location, overpriced and nothing special","Location is good if you fly in to Heathrow, with the Express to Paddington and 3-4 stops with the subway and you are there. 

My feeling is that this is a ""big"" hotel. The staff is friendly but the hotel lack personality. It is my second time to stay at the hotel and if it wasn't for the conference I attended I would have chosen another hotel. I think it is overpriced.

I had written in advance asking for an early check in, 11 am, cause the conference started with lunch at noon. My room wasn't ready....and I had to wait until 2 pm which is no early check in.",3,2016,04,25
133,Restaurant review,We did not stay here. We went for dinner before Royal Albert Hall Show. The iced tea was excellent! Bread was very good. The food was not. Steak was dry and grisly. Fish was tasteless. Food was also only lukewarm. One of our party had a vegetarian dish with goat cheese that she said was very good. Service was average.,3,2016,04,25
133,Room With a View,"Never disappoints! Spectacular view of London, the Eye, the Shard and the city. Room had a step up study, very mid century & elegant. The concierge staff charming & accommodating. Service exemplary. From the moment you step in the hotel to departure, you are well looked after.",5,2016,04,25
133,Fabulous experience,"I stayed two nights in the Royal garden hotel and I had a wonderful stay......
Big modern suite on the 10th floor with a massive window and views right across London.
Extremely comfortable and great service from the doorman to room service.
You couldn't be in a better area for shopping,eating out,and Hyde park and the palace just next door.
Even managed to get my hair done.
Cannot wait to go back.",5,2016,04,25
133,Amazing trip,My recent stay at the Royal Garden was beyond words. The staff was so helpful and friendly in advising myself and my best friend on best routes to get to the destinations we wanted to see. The room service breakfast was out of this world. I cannot wait to come back ASAP!,5,2016,04,25
133,Lovely hotel enhanced by top notch staff,"in London last weekend and stayed here as part of a theatre / hotel break from Daily Telegraph. Not used this hotel before but will do so in future. Very convenient location , lovely room , and above all fantastic staff. From the moment we arrive they were , without exception, pleasant and attentive but never intrusive.
We eat in all 3 areas, Bertie,s Bar, The Lounge and the main restaurant and the food was faultless, the staff going out of their way to meet the "" small portions "" of 2 OAP,s with modest appetites. Breakfast each morning offered an amazing choice.
Needless to say we are already planning our next visit!",5,2016,04,25
133,Lovely Chinese,"Stayed overnight, and ate at the Chinese on the top floor, incredible views across the city and food to match.  Check in was easy even though the Everton team were staying at the hotel for the FA cup semi final and breakfast was fresh and varied.  Room could have been a bit bigger but this is a central London hotel",4,2016,04,25
133,Second time around,We decided to rebook the Royal Garden Hotel for our visit to the capital because we liked the location to the transport links and its closeness to the city attractions. The hotel it self was just as pleasing as last time the room was facing the Royal gardens and the palace. The breakfast was just as delicious.I give 5 stars this time because we had access to wifi in our room unlike the previous visit. Overall a top class hotel with very friendly staff.,5,2016,04,25
133,"Fantastic location, family friendly hotel","We were very happy with our stay.  The location is in the middle of everything but the hotel is quiet and we all slept well.  Close to parks, the tube, shopping...a fantastic central London place to rest ",5,2016,04,25

133,Excellent and central hotel,"This hotel is just excellent. It is centrally located for the underground system, and lots of busses runs from just outside the hotel. It is spotless clean everywhere. It is just a pleasure to stay there. The beds are very comfortable, and it is good to have a duvet instead of a dirty blanket. I hope I can come back sometime soon!",5,2016,04,25
133,Royal Garden Staff are First Class,"Had a high street room very clean a little noisy compared to Garden view room.

Nice spacious room, shower and bathtub, comfortable beds.
Overall - great hotel/",5,2016,04,21
133,"Great location, ugly building.","We stayed in a Queen Room overlooking Kensington High Street. The hotel lobby is spacious and everything you would expect from a high end hotel. The room was very well appointed with high quality fixtures and fittings, plus bath robe, slippers etc. The only thing that marred our stay was the noise from the traffic below, which made a good night's sleep difficult. Otherwise it was excellent.",4,2016,04,20
133,Good service but very small bland rooms,"Good helpful staff, very clean, food very good.
Good location, near to the underground and the park.
Rooms small, bland and not five star. 
They need a complete make over with imagination !!! They are disappointing.",4,2016,04,20
133,Most comfortable hotel experience in London,Spent seven nights for business. One of the most comfortable and memorable hotel experiences in the UK ever.

133,Book with caution !,Stayed here on the spur of the moment be warned check your room is not above the nightclub / restaurant at side of hotel facing Hyde Park ! You will not get much sleep on a Saturday night ! Disappointing given hotel not full so despite asking the next day why we were allocated such a room no reason was given and judging from the receptionists response we weren't the first to complain ! Not good enough !,3,2016,04,19
133,Long Weekend Getaway,"Made a booking for this hotel through DVC for a long weekend (School Break).  It is easy accessible by Tube or car from the airports.  The Hotel is located next to Kensington Palace and the sprawling grounds that you can access for an amazing walk on some great green space.  Once in the Hotel to check in, the staff were amazing.  They took us right away and completed our check in quickly with all kinds of information where to g and if any help is required they are there 24 hrs a day for you.  As we were leaving the Main Desk we noticed the Main concierge talking to our daughter.  He was with a positive smile and very helpful to us as well as those who came in the door as a customer of those staying in the hotel.  The restaurants were great, food was amazing, morning breakfast was great as we sat facing the park having a great cup of coffee and tea and in no rush to leave.  At last the vacation is over, and yes we would recommend this hotel as a great place to get away and enjoy ones self",5,2016,04,19

133,"Excellent location,excellent staff,very clean","The  location is marvelous- just outside Kensington Gardens.close to bus stops and the tube.Most popular shops very close.
The staff very helpful and friendly.
Very clean.Good size rooms.
Make sure your room is not on the 6th floor- there is smoking smell on that floor",5,2016,04,16
133,Superb stay,Had a very relaxing stay. The room was very clean and staff polite and very helpful. Breakfast was very good with excellent service. Plenty of choice. Had a room over looking Kensington Palace and the park. Will definitely stay here again.,5,2016,04,15
133,Ideal location & service,"With ease of access to the city and a convenient walk/run in the park I really enjoyed my stay! I appreciated the very pleasant staff and the peace and quiet of the 10th floor...
Have visited several times and very likely to do so again.",5,2016,04,15
133,Fantastic Location,The best thing about this hotel is the location. A bus stop is right outside and the underground is only a few minutes walk. The staff are very friendly and helpful.  The rooms are very clean and comfortable with big windows which you can sit by on a kind of window seat and look out over London.,4,2016,04,14
133,Great Hotel Stayed there last year and will be looking forward to staying there in May this year,"Lovely staff and the food was fantastic this hotel surpassed in everything in terms of decor and service. This hotel must be one of the best Hotels in London that we have stayed in.
I will be bringing my family in May to share the beauty of this lovely hotel",5,2016,04,14
133,A great place to be in the heart of London,Our short stay here was excellent with great staff and service. It is within walking distance of most tourist spots and of course a boon for those seeking retail therapy!! I found the sleeping pillows too soft (down & feather) and I hope that next time there will be options of firmer ones. We will definitely stay here again.,5,2016,04,14
133,Afternoon Tea ,"A totally wonderful Hotel. I took my mum here as part of a present for afternoon tea. All the staff were attentive and so friendly. The service we received during afternoon tea was exceptional as was the food. 
The pianist was also playing when we arrived which added to the atmosphere. Would love to visit again. ",5,2016,04,13
133,Nice afternoon tea,"This was a nice, midweek afternoon tea with a friend.  The staff were lovely and we never felt rushed. We had a good selection of teas to choose from but some carried an additional cost as they were apparently more expensive but we were alerted to this before we made our selection.  We had endless cups of tea and were provided with lots of extra hot water and we were offered more sandwiches after we had eaten the selection we were given, which was lovely.  We had quite a few dietary requirements and all were met with the staff coming over to check each time about what was ok and what was not and the staff  appeared to take a lot of pride in the care they gave us and were very attentive.  The cakes however, were only ok and my cake slices were a bit dry but the scones were good and we were supplied with loads of jam and cream.  The price was not the cheapest - ¬£31 without any fizz (that was an extra ¬£10) but it was still a really nice afternoon in a nice central location.",4,2016,04,13
133,Exceeded our expectations!,"We expected a high standard of service, comfort, cuisine, decor etc but this hotel surpassed in everything. This hotel must be one of the best that we have stayed at and last month we enjoyed such as Gidleigh Park, Waterside and several Spanish Parador suites. 
",5,2016,04,13
133,21st Birthday Weekend,"Excellent Hotel, excellent location. We arrived to a very warm welcome - all the staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay.  The rooms were excellent and views from both rooms were wonderful.  We arrived in time to enjoy a light lunch at the Park Terrace overlooking Kensington Gardens, it was very relaxed with great attention to detail. The Min Jiang on 10th floor served the best chinese we have had anywhere and watching the lights coming on the London Eye, The Shard etc whilst eating was fun. We walked from the hotel to The Orangery for breakfast, the walk was sunny and bright but I would just stick to croissants or scones here the cooked food was bland and the service terrible. We then walked to High St Kensington for shopping. Babylon Roof Terrace Restaurant was where we celebrated with a meal followed by dancing the night away.  Breakfast for the birthday girl was celebrated at Bluebird Cafe.",5,2016,04,12
133,An Excellent Stay - will be back again,"I have stayed at Royal Garden a number of times. My last visit had been Dec 2014 so I didnt expect to see so many familiar faces and I didn't expect the staff to recognise me.
However I had the most wonderful welcome and everyone was so helpful. I will definitely return!
The location of the hotel is great, the rooms are very clean and the food is of excellent quality but most of all the staff treat you like family!",5,2016,04,12
133,Home from home,"Excellent hotel, great views over the park. The staff are all very helpful and professional and it is good that over the fifteen years we have been visiting this hotel, we still recognise some members of staff and they remember us too. Great location, very convenient for tube and busses.",5,2016,04,12
133,Excellent but not free wifi,"Everything with this hotel is excellent, and the gym is amazing. Cleaning, service, bar and breakfast are all perfect. My one and only complaint and the reason I did not give this hotel a 5 is that you have to pay to get wifi. That is in my opininon not acceptable for a fivestar hotel in 2016 and was very unexpected.",4,2016,04,12
133,Royal Garden,"Great hotel with staff that are always smiling. Have stayed a few times and always been the same . Great view from the room out over the Park and London Skyline.
Food was excellent both in Bar and Park Terrace .
Stayed welsher when hotel has been full butt always return here as preference when in London",5,2016,04,12
133,Family hotel,This is my second time at this hotel frendly very polite stuff charming clean room secure all u need shops and caf√©s arund u but the only things upset me is I booked a room through booking. Com for facing the khensigton garden and I payed extra for it but I got a room only a partly of the garden. Also there is no free Internet in the hote. ,4,2016,04,12
133,"Great location, lovely rooms, exceptional restaurant",A lovely stay in really great rooms but it would have been a better experience to have had a special breakfast rate available - ¬£25ppn is a bit steep considering we'd spent ¬£500 in the wonderful Min Jiang. Hence we had brekkie elsewhere!  ,4,2016,04,12
133,Mediocre,"Staff was friendly and the location is great but the overall value was mediocre at best. Breakfast is bad value for money, and the building itself is mediocre. If you're looking for a couples Holliday, this wasn't great. ",3,2016,04,12
133,Family holiday,Everything was perfect.large and clean room with a large cot for the baby and also the breakfast was good. Excellent Location facing Kensington gardens.metro station just few minutes walk.we had great experience and woulg go back there,5,2016,04,12

Room service was very good and very fast for any request.
Love the view from my room.  The food requested from the hotel was delecios.",5,2016,04,12
133,Afternoon tea at Royal garden hotel.,"It was lovely . The staffs are very nice , worm, welcoming. I went for a afternoon tea with my family and we had a lovely time.
After we had the afternoon tea we went to visit the Kensington garden took a long walk.
We had a beautiful time.
I recomand this place .",5,2016,04,11
133,Very nice indeed,"An excellent and comfortable stay!  We had a lovely room overlooking Kensington Palace and Park.  It was larger than average, the bed was really comfortable and there was a free safe and a large flat screen TV with a good choice of channels. Fantastic breakfast (but expensive at ¬£25 if not included in your rate).  Try the smoked haddock or kippers!  A choice of three different sausages, lovely smoked bacon served by excellent and pleasant staff.  The bus for the west end stops right outside and Kensington High Street is right on the doorstep.  The only annoyance is that the wi-fi isn‚Äôt free and at the prices charged, it jolly well should be!  Bar was expensive, but there‚Äôs a great pub (The Goat) right across the street.
Will definitely return some day.",5,2016,04,11
133,seeing friends,picked out by booking.com and great choice with good locality to attractions although forgot buspass and found you cant use cash on buses otherwise good visit good and central to shops museums and shows and near parks etc,5,2016,04,11
133,Highly recommended,"Excellent stay. Efficient check in service with welcoming staff. We booked an Executive Suite and found our room to be modern, clean and spacious. Maj Jiang restaurant is a must with its fantastic service, food and views üòä",5,2016,04,11

Near to underground station 
You can find shops and restaurants in some areas 
I recommend it to my friends. ",5,2016,04,10
133,London stay,We stayed in the hotel between 5 and 8 April 2016 for business. Luxory hotel located just close to Kensington Palace. Excellent position and tube station close to the hotel. Excellent chinese restaurant on the last floor of the hotel. ,5,2016,04,10
133,Great location and room!,"We had just spend 6 nights in the Garden Room at Royal Garden Hotel and we had thoroughly enjoy our stay. Front Office check-in was fast and efficient. Concierge was knowledgeable and helpful. Housekeeping service was consistent and clean. Breakfast service was fast and efficient. We also found the service and food quality that was served at Min Jiang was the best. Room size is reasonable. Bathroom equipped with both bathtub and standing shower. It also has a heater towel rack and come with a branded room amenities. Should your package include breakfast, you can either have it at the coffee house or in the room with no additional charge.",5,2016,04,09
133,Lovely hotel,"We stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel on Friday night as we were attending a concert at the Albert Hall. It was such a treat to stay somewhere so close to the venue and not have to be running for tube stations before travelling home from St Pancras. The staff were very professional, friendly and helpful and the whole ambience of the hotel made us feel welcome. The queen room was very clean and well laid out and the bed was most comfortable. We had every amenity we needed. The only downside to our stay was the noise from the road as our room faced Kensington High St. (traffic, police sirens, people talking or shouting) It was almost as if the window was open but we had checked and it was closed. We would ask for a room overlooking the gardens next time and would definitely stay again.",4,2016,04,09
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"Great location right next to hyde park, 5 minutes from tube and walkable to harrod's. friendly staff and next door was wagamama's.
Great Breakfast - have it in your room, it was the best I've experienced

133,Amazing,"Nice rooms, great for families, very very friendly staff. 2 min away from the underground station. Less than a min in the Hydepark. Surrounded by a lot of coffee shops and restaurants.  I will recommend people to stay specially families. ",5,2016,04,09
133,Exquisite,"What a fabulous hotel.  Penthouse Suite was thoroughly exquisite with great staff, fabulous service, fantastically clean with plenty of staff and doormen to make your stay perfect.  They carried bags, lent umbrellas, you name it.  Afternoon tea was delicious with great views overlooking kensington park.  Thoroughly reccommend this hotel and will be going back",5,2016,04,08
133,Nice stay in excelkent location,"Enjoyed the location. Room size  was good and very clean. Friendly staff. However, I think the room is a little overprised since breakfast abd internet are nit included. Heater was not working properly so room temperature was a bit cold. Not to advise to take rooms with street view as it gets very noisy in the morning",4,2016,04,08
133,One night stay,"I shall return!  A very enjoyable, comfortable visit. Great staff, some remembering my name. Car parking facility absolutely ideal. Taxi service ideal, there was always a cab there for us. Late night drinks in the bar most enjoyable, along with toasted sandwiches.",5,2016,04,08
133,"Good location, spacious room","Had two executive rooms for our party of 7. One whole wall (long wall) of each looked over Kensington Palace Green, which was nice and made the rooms surprisingly light for the drab weather. The spacious rooms were far more comfortable than expected for the somewhere sterile corporate feel for the overall hotel. Nearby underground stop and Whole Foods made this location very convenient too. I was disappointed on checkout when I was shown the bill in GBP but was asked if I wanted it charged in USD (I said no), but the staff charged my card in USD anyway.",4,2016,04,07
133,Lovely hotel.,"Lovely weekend stay in a superb hotel.  Very close to the Alert hall and next to park and Kensington Palace.  Almost walking distance from Victoria coach station, especially when traveling light. Would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in London.",5,2016,04,07

133,More like a 2 star hotel,Horrible service. Had to wait in lobby for over an hour as they forgot to clean my room.  Staff didn't care.  Offered to give me a lower room but still pay for suite while they cleaned it . unacceptable.,1,2016,04,07
133,Best Holiday Ever!,"Best hotel and very generous staff next to all the sights and locations to really see London properly.  Near High Street Kensington which has easy access to the rest of the city, and if you are lucky, you can have a bit to eat in Kensington Palace.",5,2016,04,07
133,A lovely hotel with great staff.,The hotel is situated in a very good location.nthe food and service is well organised keeping a relaxed atmosphere whilst no doubt at times under pressure.  Well done to all the staff keep up the great work.,5,2016,04,07

The location is perfect for me and I am always impressed by the staff.
This is how a hotel should be run.The standard of cleanliness is always of the highest and the decor around the hotel is kept beautifully.It is my favourite hotel in London and I look forward to the next stay.",5,2016,04,07
133,experience,"Amazing experience not very good location but overall everything was perfect, hope the internet be free for the hotel guests , staff was very helpful and kind especially the room service staff for sure will come back again ",4,2016,04,07
133,A place to recommend,"Great location 3 minutes away from the High Street Kensington tube station, outstanding staff services at the reception, the room are clean but could perhaps be modernly refurnished - comfortable king size bed, the bathroom is big and pleasant, we definitively recommend this hotel and will come back again ",4,2016,04,06
133,Overnight Stay,"Me & my partner had an overnight stay at the Royal Garden Hotel on Friday 1st April.
 At check in the receptionist(Bianca) was very helpful & polite,seemed like nothing was to much trouble.
At breakfast it was pretty much the same, i think our waitress was called Paloma & again great service.
Would recommend this Hotel because of the service from the staff who are very attentive & friendly.",5,2016,04,03
133,Excellent hotel,Great location & excellent staff with good attention to detail. Comfortable rooms & excellent quality of food whether in restaurant or room service. I feel happy staying here when alone on business or with friends for leisure.,4,2016,04,03
133,Excellent as ever,"Best Sunday in London. Exquisite Sunday lunch, excellent service, wine and cocktails Now up to the 10th  to Min Jiang for a view to die for in surely the best Chinese in town. The Executive room is huge with large TV and sitting area, desk and super king size bed and a vast bathroom.Excellent doesn't do justice. ",5,2016,04,03
133,"excellent hotel, excellent location, excellent food, excellent experience","a very famous hotel in central London. a real gem. very kind and helpful staff. very quiet environment for sleeping. very clean and tidy. and as a traditional asian foodie, I found the restaurant within it (i.e. MinJiang on the 10th floor) is a really must-try for those Chinese food lovers. the only ‚Äòflaw' may be that its Queen rooms are a little bit small, compared with the other types of rooms.",5,2016,04,03
133,Excellent staff,"Lovely hotel, brilliant staff. Rooms good but ask for pillows with something in them!  Good location. Berties bar needs a facelift but overall an excellent stay. Highly recommended. Nice birthday wine gift much appreciated",5,2016,04,01
133,One night in the Garden,"Just stayed one night here to attend the Royal Albert Hall just down the road. Superb room with a view of Kensington Palace from the 9th floor. We did not take breakfast here as I consider ¬£25 to be far too expensive, we would come again though. Only downer was that we booked through Booking.com and the Hotel would not offer me free Wi-Fi because of it, the car-park too was more expensive than if I had booked direct.",5,2016,03,31
133,Excellent Property,Our stay was excellent and satisfying. It made it more satisfying by having a friendly environment and warmth smiles from the staff. Our morning started with our waitress Fatima who made our day bright. David in the front desk as the concierge was knowledge and friendly.,5,2016,03,30
133,Good stay as always,"Just one problem with late bedroom service on the second day, left room at 9am and when returned 4.00pm room not serviced. It was sorted out quickly by duty manager and staff very apologfetic so it has not put off the Royal Garden.",5,2016,03,30
133,"Just ""ok""","Hotel experience was just ok. Certainly not 5 star or worth the money. Far nicer and better properties in London. All very dated from decor to experience. 
Very nice location though next to Kensington Palace. ",2,2016,03,30
133,You  will feel like royalty,"Great location, staff, food and accommodations make this a home away from home. This was our second visit to the Royal Garden, London hotel and we were not disappointed. Enjoyed our garden room, and daily relaxing English Breakfast. Our rooms were clean and quiet. No complaints. If you want to dine at the Asian restaurant on the top floor - book it early as this venue is very popular. ",5,2016,03,29
133,Hillman,"Very good hotel, well situated for Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Palace. Very friendly and helpful staff who gave excellent service.  Requested firmer pillow which came quickly but unfortunately wasn't very much firmer.",4,2016,03,29
133,WEEK END BREAK,stay was superb been before and shall stay again it is in a great location for the tube theatres shopping and museums. the all round service was great and whenever there was an issue the staff was on hand to resolve things. we had a great deal with three nights for the price of two we both had a great time and will come back it is a place to recommend for that special break ,5,2016,03,29
133,Easter Break,Great location. Friendly welcome from reception. Room clean and well equiped. Nice quiet location at back of hotel overlooking gardens. Didn't use hotel restaurants/bar but more than enough choice within a short walk.,4,2016,03,29
133,Good Hotel,"Enjoyed my stay here. Very convenient location, and the staff were very nice and helpful. The Ming Jiang restaurant was also very nice, amazing views. Rooms were decent. Only thing that annoyed me a little bit was when housekeeping cleaned the rooms, instead of keeping the door open and going in and out they just let it slam shut every time. Usually wouldn't bother me, but in the morning it did. Overall really good.",4,2016,03,28
133,Exellent Hotel,"We stayed for three nights and from our arrival to departure, nothing was too much trouble. Particular thanks to Guest Relations for their consideration and helpfulness. The bedroom was delightfully situated, overlooking Kensington Gardens towards Royal Albert Hall. The Min Jiang Restaurant food was beautiful and once we established that we were not in a desperate rush to finish our meal there, the service was very good too. ",5,2016,03,28
133,What A Hotel,"All I can say is that this hotel is fantastic, it's in a great location with very friendly staff throughout delivering excellent service in a very friendly and relaxed atmosphere. I'd Definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. ",5,2016,03,28
133,unhelpful and rude,"Location is good and rooms clean. But air-conditioning was either blasting cold or none at all. Worst of all, I had to change the dates of my stay and was greeted with rudeness and absolutely no suggestion as to how to help my predicament. It was either get charged double or get out. So I got out. Very disappointing  - considering I have been a returning guest to your hotel for many years. ",2,2016,03,28
133,Fantastic hotel in superb location,Hotel has a lovely feel to it and from the moment you arrive the staff go out of their way to help. Our room was very clean and comfortable and had a lovely view of Kensington gardens - can't wait to come back!,5,2016,03,28
133,Excellent experience,"Stayed for three night, great location hotel excellent in every way. Rooms modern and clean. Breakfast first class, dined in The Park Terrace and Min Jiang Restaurant service and meals were superb. A very enjoyable time.",5,2016,03,27
133,overnight stay,"The room  and bathroom was very  small although everything there I needed. Felt given how much I had paid it wasn't value for money especially as I has stayed, 4  nights previously, at another establishment of similar quality for less than half the price. Hotel staff very helpful and friendly except for Bertie's bar. Good breakfast choice",4,2016,03,27
133,Incredible location and view!,"A great hotel in an amazing location. We had a wonderful stay, with very helpful and courteous staff.  Easy Kensington Gardens access, and walkable to Harrods.  Highly recommended!  The only downside was the pricy internet access.",5,2016,03,27
133,Great hotel in Kensington,Very well run hotel and friendly staff. No problems with anything but perhaps the Wifi should be free these days. We did not eat at the hotel as there are many good restaurants close by in Kensington Church Street.   ,5,2016,03,27
133,Wonderful,"Such a wonderful place to stay in the city!
Rooms are fantastic and service great. Bathroom stunning with lovely toiletries. Will return when on our next London break.
The breakfast is outstanding and a great start to a busy day :) ",5,2016,03,26
133,Restaurant was superb ,"Amazing lunch in the restaurant. Service was exceptional and each course was delicious. The value was also unbelievable - even if it made our drinks bill 4x food bill.

Can't recommend this place highly enough for somewhere not on the ordinary list ",5,2016,03,26
133,Short stay,"Great location being close to tube station, a good selection of shops and restaurants and nearby Kensington Park.  Well appointed room and bathroom modern and clean.  Struggled to get the room warm enough.",4,2016,03,24
133,Nice rooms - perfect service,"I had a upgrade to a deluxe/business room which was very big. Nice comfortable bed.
They had served breakfast - which was a nice change to the buffet style search and collect approach. Everyone polite and helpful.",5,2016,03,24
133,5 * throughout ,"Just came back from our 2nd visit in 4 months and an outstanding service as ever. Was apprehensive on arrival as my mother and I booked on returning from our last trip in November and requested a smoking room as we had last time, however there wasn't one available. We were very disappointed when informed of this as this was a special birthday long weekend for which I had been planning for my mother for some time. Nevertheless the two staff at check-in rallied around to ensure that they were able to provide us with our requirement. We had dinner in the park Terrace restaurant the first evening and it was so lovely to be warmly remembered and welcomed back by staff. The service was 2nd to none and the three course meal was delicious!! The Dorman and concierge were gracious as always and nothing was too much trouble. Early evening aperitifs in the bar were special and my champagne was always decorated differently with pretty flowers or fruits, again all the staff were tremendously attentive. We had a complimentary bottle of wine sent up to the room and hand made chocolates to wish my mother a happy birthday, for which we were so grateful for as it made it even more special. We had room service breakfast one morning which was fabulous as usual and immaculately presented and a wonderful city view room. The turndown service in the evening is a lovely touch and the maids are all lovely. The food is amazing the ambience and atmosphere is warming and I wouldn't hesitate recommending this hotel in Kensington every time. Thank you Royal Garden for another wonderful stay, we hope to see you all again sometime very soon!! Warmest wishes Gemma and Jane xx",5,2016,03,23
133,London weekend,"Well positioned hotel. not very attractive from the outside but the interior is good and well appointed.
Room was small but well designed and very clean. the bed was a little soft and not too comfortable.our room overlooked Kensington Palace and was quiet.Breakfast was excellent and was included in our room rate. Overall a busy city hotel in a good position with a good feel.We would definitely return.",4,2016,03,23
133,a great experience,"A superb hotel with first class staff who go the extra mile to help.
My daughter and i had a special birthday weekend and love this hotel.  Will definitely return again.
Conceige so helpful and room service 1st class.",5,2016,03,23
133,Excellent,"We have just spent 3 days sating in the Royal Garden and must say we were very impressed. We ate in the hotel on 2 occasions and had 3 excellent room service breakfasts. We had a lovely Park Suite which had amazing views over Kensington Palace. I would highly recommend a stay here if you are planning a few days sight seeing in the city. Close to all the shops, In fact too close!!!",5,2016,03,22
133,Bad service on arrival -  room not ready and just left to wait,We arrived at 2.00 to check in to be told the room isn't ready as we can't get the Prius guests out. We sat in reception for over an hour! This stay was for our wedding anniversary and hugely poor service ,1,2016,03,22
133,Weekend Break with friends,"Hotel very dated, staff in Berties Bar and at Breakfast were fantastic, breakfast was probaly the best we have had and we have stayed at a lot of Hotels. But the consiege vertically ignored us on arrival and the next morning,  all so we went for a drink in the Park Terrace in the afternoon ans we were overlooked so we left. In park Terrace there seemed to be a lot of regular visitors that the staff paid a lot of attention to and ignored other visitors.",3,2016,03,22
133,Royal garden hotel,"Hotel well situtaed fro Albert Hall, but could not get into our (upgraded) room until almost 3.45 p.m.,
and arrived back at 10.27 - so kitchen was closed. Room Service was good but not what we were looking forward to for dinner. Otherwise everything was very good - position, staff, breakfast all fantastiv  ",4,2016,03,22
133,Heven in All parts,"My and my girl on a tourist weekend we loved the hospitality of the staff werry friendly

133,Home from home,"Amazing as always, staff so friendly and always do everything possible. Great room and amazing restaurants. If you appreciate great service then this is the hotel for you. Sunday lunch in the Park Terrace should not be missed!",5,2016,03,22
133,Perfect for Albert Hall,"Very comfortable garden view room, but given the price that was to be expected.  Quiet despite vicinity of busy road.  Staff all very-well trained and beautifully turned-out.  Few minutes walk from Albert Hall and (in opposite direction) from great array of restaurants.",4,2016,03,21
133,Sleep,"The hotel was excellent the only thing I could fault was the the duvets , they weren't very thick and I got cold in the night , otherwise location and service was very good , breakfast wAs amazing .a lovely hotel",4,2016,03,21
133,very nice stay,Free wifi should be complementary.  And an automatic Nespresso or similar in room would be welcome.  Hotel quality is very nice.  Staff were very attentive.  The complementary bottles of water in the evening were a nice touch.  High Street Kensington tube only 5 minutes walk with a bus stop directly on the hotel's front door.,4,2016,03,20
133,Just a great hotel,"A bit of a regular haunt now for our trips to London, this hotel is absolutely perfect in so many ways. A great location, adjacent to Kensington Gardens, well appointed rooms, excellent staff displaying a very high standard of customer service and a fantastic top floor restaurant in Min Jiang offering top drawer Chinese cuisine overlooking the London skyline. The hotel is exceptionally child friendly, a couple of times now our 5 year old daughter has received a rucksack goody bag. Not over the top price wise for a five star in central London either.
A great hotel.",5,2016,03,20
133,First class hotel!,Fabulous hotel ideally situated for London weekend. Reception and room service superb. Queen room was perfect. Excellent bars and restaurants nearby and perfectly located for Royal Albert Hall. Adjacent to Kensington Gardens so has everything you would wish for. Would highly recommend ,5,2016,03,20
133,Stay and Play at the Royal Albert Hall,Perfect hotel if you plan to visit The Royal Albert Hall. I believe the facilities for business meetings to be excellent too. Had a lovely lunch which was made perfect by the staff who accommodated my daughter's vegan tastes.,5,2016,03,20
133,Good hotel,"Good hotel and the chickin was fast and the staff was lovely
The double bed room little bet small if  you are traveling with kids. 
The conected rooms are  noisy
The room is clean. 
No coffee machine only water heater 

",5,2016,03,19
133,One of the best in London!,"Convenient to Paddington station and loads of good restaurants, shopping, and attractions.  They have a superbly attentive staff and nicely appointed rooms.  There may be cheaper options, but in my experience with London hotels you get what you pay for.  Royal Garden is worth it.",5,2016,03,19
133,A good business hotel and venue,"Good business facilities together with excellent location adjacent to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace, and a rather very good Chinese Restaurant with views on the 10th floor, made this an excellent choice for our Congress event. Recommended.",5,2016,03,18
133,5 stars ? not for breakfast...,"In a 5 star hotel, at a rate of 300‚Ç¨ a night, no extra cost should be claimed for hot food at breakfast. Rooms are clean and comfortable, staff members are friendly, and the location is good. Pitiful that the breakfast experience was so poor.",3,2016,03,18
133,Good Hotel,"In London, being central is key, this is a good hotel, I don't usually eat in hotels, just regard them as a bed and a base, but this does both, try Min Jiang.  

So great location, probably expensive for just a bedroom, but can't be faulted.",4,2016,03,17
133,very nice hotel.excekkent service,"in this kind of hotel, the wi fi should be free all over the hotel. the room was very nice and clean.It is a perfect location if you want to enjoy the city but you need a quiet place. transportation to and from the hotel was very convenient.",5,2016,03,17
133,"Nice property, poor management","They save on every piece of soap (teabag, internet, towel, blanket) and this spoils whole experience. If you can push them it is ok. But feels cheap and unpleasant to to me.

Staff is ftiendly and helpful.",2,2016,03,16
133,Treated like Royalty,"Amazing hotel. Lovely rooms with fantastic views across Kensington Park. Wonderful, polite and attentive staff. Champagne afternoon tea sublime and room service fantastic and just what we needed after a late night at the theatre. Have stayed here before and the experience was so good we knew we had to stay again when staying in London. Wouldnt stay anywhere else. ",5,2016,03,16
133,Great Hotel,"I stayed here for 5 days and it was a really nice hotel.  The service, cleanliness and location are amazing.  Hyde Park is right next door, 2 minutes to a subway and there is pretty much nothing to complain about.  The bathroom was outstanding.",5,2016,03,15
133,Royal treatment!,"Very stylish, posh hotel next to Kensington Palace and Gardens. It is a perfect location if you want to enjoy the city but you need a quiet place. A real 5 star hotel, with professional staff, comfortable rooms, and perfect breakfast. I stayed there with my child, and he also had a royal treatment.",5,2016,03,15
133,Needs some work,"Good location, friendly staff, nice Chinese restaurant on the tenth floor. But this hotel is overall worn and in need of refurbishment. Suffice to say that this morning I had to shower with cold water because maintenance were busy doing repairs. The doorman comes in at 7am. Cutting corners? Definitely.",4,2016,03,15
133,Superb hotel and staff,We have stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel several times and have never been disappointed.  Our room was superb in both lay out and cleanliness. The staff are brilliant and no request or question is too much trouble for them.  Our recent stay was to celebrate my birthday and I was made to feel very special thank you.,5,2016,03,15
133,Trip to London,"Very nice hotel - large room for London.  Overall great experience.  If ever I return to London will stay there again.  Close to High Street Kensington tube station.  Very nice area of town with good places to eat within walking distance.  Backs up to Kensington Gardens.  Great staff, friendly.",5,2016,03,15
133,No where better,"From the moment you step into the foyer everyone is so friendly and willing to help, I couldn't fault the staff or hotel at all, and would recommend 100% every time. Ideally situated for easy access to all of London's attractions, couldn't ask for a better place to stay when in London.",5,2016,03,15
133,Cost efficient for business travel,"The room was cozy with an incredible view of Kensington Gardens, and as a plus, UK, EU, and US electrical sockets were all available at the desks in the rooms. The room and bathroom were both pristine, and a few nice-to-have toiletries (e.g. shower cap, small sewing kit, cotton) were also available in the bathroom. ",5,2016,03,15
133,"Excellent location, great view from a comfortable, design room","The Hotel is located next to Kensington Palace, Kensington Garden (Hyde Park), close to Royal Albert Hall and some 20 minutes walk from V&A Museum, on a busy Kensington High Street with great shops and little restaurants. Our King room was newly refurbished with a very nice seating area and new bathroom with tabs and separate shower, Keuco and Grohe high end vanities and faucets. The large double bed had 2 mattresses but one large blanket. You find in the room recessed large television and mirrored closets, minibar, plugs for continental 220V appliances. The continental breakfast was ca. 20 GBP and the full English breakfast was ca. 25 GBP per person, which fully worth its price. Clean rooms and excellent services everywhere.",4,2016,03,15
133,Superb,"Lovely hotel, lovely towels and robes and slippers, crispy white sheets, great location, well priced, welcoming staff, good restaurants near by, walking distance to tubes and museums.  Felt a little claustrophobic in 'rain shower' cubicle but then used lower shower head and that worked fine.",5,2016,03,15
133,Weekend Family stay,"Fantastic hotel -- my son loved the  welcome pack.  Typically a 5 star hotel does not appreciate children - this hotel is super for families visiting London, and I would gladly stay again.  Dining options were excellent and overall I could not find a fault",5,2016,03,15
133,Great cost/efficeny option1,"Super friendly staff, Chinese restaurant very good. Conveniently located...all good! I visited with my son and we enjoyed since the welcome friendliness of the staff, rooms are clean and big enough and the hotel y very well situated. ",5,2016,03,14
133,Excellent,"Stayed here for 4 days for Hubby's Birthday treat - Hotel was lovely and in a great location approx 2 mins from Kensington High Street Tube - so ideal for exploring London. The staff were lovely and really helpful and attentive. We had the afternoon tea in the Park Terrace restaurant, which was delicious, the homemade Scones were really light and fluffy. We also had the Sunday Lunch which was expectional! The Roast Beef was an excellent cut of meat and was so tender it almost melted in your mouth. We unfortuantely did not get time to visit the 10th Floor Chinese Restaurant - but from what I heard it was also very good.",5,2016,03,14
133,Excellent Hotel,"Clean, well appointed room with a great outlook; friendly, courteous service and an excellent breakfast - what more could we want? The best London hotel we've stayed in. Relocated us from 5th to 1st floor on check-in when I mentioned my wife's phobia of lifts, even though this involved a room upgrade.",5,2016,03,14
133,Average,"no free wi-fi.
lots of noises from other rooms and could hear clear of what they say, no privacy in soudproof rooms.
we were couples and they gave us double bed room instead of queen or king bed!! 
location is not bad. staff friendly. ",3,2016,03,14
133,Hotel Regular,You I here a lot.  Excelent location.  Clean rooms and well operated hotel. Good facilities and well located near tube in Kensington.  Very good business hotel but not my first choice for romantic getaway. ,4,2016,03,14
133,Great place,Excellent hotel. Great location.  Check-in process was smooth and young lady at the desk was so pleasant and welcoming.  Breakfast is excellent (¬£25 per head if not included in your stay) and the service impressive. ,5,2016,03,14
133,Almost Perfect,"I will split this review in 2, the positive then the name and shame over the wifi.

I booked 2 nights here as it is in a perfect location for the Royal Albert Hall and pretty well placed in general. The hotel is full of friendly staff, a relaxing bar and the food/service of the Min Jiang restaurant both excellent. 

I was a little apprehensive about the room size as I had read the reviews and I booked a queen room for 2 nights. As it turned out, it was exactly like the photos and very pleasant.

For the majority of travelers, the review can end here. Its a fab hotel and I would stay here again.  My below complaint is not unique to this hotel, it's a fault in a lot of nicer hotels. 

For me, I have one issue and I have an obligation to do my part to educate hotels on this. I booked this hotel indirectly because their own site kept saying night 2 of my 2 night stay had no queen rooms available. For some reason I could book it everywhere else though and that is what I did.This should have been the end of it but apparently it had a consequence.

Unless you book direct, there is no free WIFI, not even in public areas. This is a problem for me as unless I'm in the middle of the ocean I will never pay for hotel internet on principal. So as a guest let me explain and I hate talking about physical costs but it's necessary to prove a point and the wording will also be changed from talking to the reader to talking to the hotel. Unknowingly I saved ¬£30 on the room by booking indirect, but still in the first 8 hours I spent ¬£150 in the restaurant and ¬£100 in the bar but I still can't have complimentary WIFI? I want you to know I was insulted by this, I want you to know that instead of feeling like the cost is for quality, I felt there is a hint of greed in your operation. All of this because of something that I estimate can't be costing you more than a pro rata cost of 10p. You will happily give me olives and nuts with my drink, but heaven forbid if I want to reply to an email here so I can stay longer? There is an extremely weak EE signal in the bar area.

This is how you lost your 5th star I'm afraid.",4,2016,03,13
133,Disappearing face cloths,"Convenient location, helpful foyer staff, cleaners who insisted on removing face cloths after permitting a brief usage. Ultimately an hotel that markets its location and status rather than its essential worth as somewhere pleasant to stay.",4,2016,03,13
133,Fabulous hotel,This is my thirteenth annual stay at the RGH for our conference. . Thank you Tim and Jonathan and your amazing team for making our staff and our delegates so welcome as only you know how. Already looking forward to next year's conference,5,2016,03,13
133,had very good experience except for slow housekeeping service and tight rooms,"hotel recommended for a short stay. the proximity of the location is excellent.
staff very friendly and concierge very helpful. car park too expensive. residents in the hotel should be treated at lower rates. ",4,2016,03,12
133,Excellent Kensington hotel,"Faultless in every way; excellent  location, friendly and helpful staff, scrupulously clean and comfortable accommodation. Also super value booked in advance. Happy to recommend inreservedly; Will  definitely return.",5,2016,03,12
133,Overnight stay,"Excellent from start to finish.Beautiful hotel.Smart and well groomed staff give a good impression on entering.Underground NCP a real bonus.Well placed for local amenities ,Kensington  High Street life/caf√©s and easy access to public transport.",5,2016,03,12
133,"Staff were brilliant , room  let down","I would recommend this hotel for the staff and the location . The breakfast service was second to none , and the waiting staff so very helpful . We stayed in a queen room however found it very basic for the price paid . ",5,2016,03,11
133,Something Should Be Done About the Front Desk,"I have stayed several times in this hotel over the years. Its location in the vicinity of upscale (but unpretentious) Kensington High Street and beautiful Kensington Gardens, is one of  the best in London. The rooms are of adequate size by London standards and the quality of both the service and food at the hotel's restaurants is excellent.
Unfortunately the hotel does not live up to its full potential due to the obvious little expenditure on the renovation of common areas and rooms- the feeling is that of a building stuck in the 60's, the time when the hotel was built. Another short-coming is the rather unhelpful and patronizing attitude of the front-desk staff. The switch-board operator could also be a bit more courteous when connecting a caller to a guest.
Overall a hotel with tremendous potential. Too bad, it's falling short of it.

",3,2016,03,11
133,Weekend break,Royal Park is a well run and well kept hotel when ever we are in town we use the hotel rooms are modern and well stocked and in mint condition staff couldn't be more friendly or helpful also with the car park underneath the hotel all makes for a stress free stay,5,2016,03,11
133,Great stay,The rooms can be expensive but they do say you get what you pay for.  Ive stayed here several times now on business and never had a bad experience.  Location is great.  Good access to Hyde Park for some exercise.  Great access to the city via road or tube station at South Kensington.  Not a heap of options nearby for food and drink but certainly enough if you're on business and not looking for non stop entertainment.  Staff are always friendly and engaging and extremely helpful both before the stay and during the stay.  They've made some pre-arrangements for me a couple of times so I can hit the ground running with work.  ,5,2016,03,10
133,It's like home,"Great hotel , nice people,so  friendly which makes me feel no stranger and as if I am at home . I love you people and I will always stay at The Royal Garden Hotel when ever I plan to visit London . So until next time.",5,2016,03,10
133,Small room & bathroom,"Though the staff is amazing, the size of the regular room is not good at all, definitely not worth such a high price. The bathroom is also sadly small. Unless you can afford a suite, this hotel isn't interesting if you stay in its regular rooms.",3,2016,03,10
133,room for improvement,"I asked for blood pressure measurement device ,hotel did not have one ,so I went to Chelsea hospital ,
room temp can not be set in room ,and I was cold and I had to ask central computer to set it higher?",4,2016,03,10
133,Excellent location and quality,"Perfect location and great food, very comfortable room and excellent facilities.  Bertie's bar was great for a pre meal drink and the food was delicious.  lovely breakfast, polite and friendly staff all in all a great experience.

133,No connection,No Internet connection in a 5 start hotel is ridiculous  never saw that not even in a third world country.  I come for business and I left like a outside.  And for 300¬£ a night ? Come get really people is 2016 already,3,2016,03,10
133,Good hotel good location,"Would definitely stay there again and again.
Breakfast was ok, staff members very nice and very helpful. Executive Rooms clean & spacious. Excellent location would recommend it to people traveling with our without kids. ",5,2016,03,10
133,Brilliant,"My home from home , service exceptional , hotel exceptional , can't praise the Royal garden enough . I stay here regularly simply because of the very high standards the hotel sets , nothing is too much trouble to help a guest , indeed the guest is king",5,2016,03,10
133,Wonderful stay,We had a very relaxing stay. Room well appointed and spotlessly clean.Meal was delicious with a good choice of menu. Staff particularly friendly & helpful without being overpowering We will certainly return,5,2016,03,10
133,Best London Hotel Experience,I was tired when I arrived at your hotel. Reception staff Bianca made me felt at home immediately and escorted me to my room explaining the facilities. Kudos to her for her excellent Customer Service. The view from my room of the Kensington Palace & Gardens was breathtaking! I slept very comfortably which is unusual for me when I'm travelling. The next morning I was spoiled with a sumptuous English Breakfast! The breakfast staff were attentive and very forthcoming. Lunch at Min Jiang was sinfully delicious! The views from the restaurant were a constant inviting distraction. I totally recommend this wonderful hotel!,5,2016,03,10
133,Good hotel,"My room was small but quiet, overlooking Kensington gardens. Enjoyable stay.. Breakfast was included but alacarte was extra. So I had no choice but the english breakfast . Lively hotel bpwhich was near my meeting but not am area I would.usuaully stay in ",4,2016,03,10
133,Weekend break in the city,"as ever a lovely stay next to a fantastic park. staff very friendly and room very relaxing. meal choices were great, ate in park terrace for the first time and it was very enjoyable with a relaxed atmosphere.",4,2016,03,09
133,A very nice hotel in the west-end of London,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights for an ""off-site"" conference. 

The bedroom was quite spacious except for i) the bed was not very comfortable and ii) the desk which was a bit small to work on a laptop (see photo) but the internet connection (LAN) was very fast and allowed for VPN-based telephony.
The bathroom was quite large, the amenities very practical and the (power) shower was fantastic. 

The staff at the reception was very courteous and both check-in and check-out was very swift despite the large conference (200-300 guests). A great help was the advice that the breakfast buffet would be very busy and that I would order room service at no additional charge. On both mornings, breakfast was served on time and was very generous.  

It's a shame I didn't get a chance to try any of the hotel's facilities other than the large conference room which, unfortunately, was in the basement without any daylight.",4,2016,03,07
133,RUBY WEDDING CELEBRATION,"Excellent. We were upgraded to a suit, plus a bottle of champagne, which really got the evening off to a good start, as we were having a celebration dinner with friends in the restaurant. Beautiful view over the Kensington Gardens, and Palace.
      ",5,2016,03,07
133,satisfactory,this is the 1st visit to London. your staff is very friendly and escorted me to the right direction. arranged the taxt to the airport in time. very friendly and i would like to recommend my friends use your hotel accomodation.,4,2016,03,02
133,"Brilliant location, brilliant hotel, brilliant service.","The hotel is in a very central part of the capital close to a couple of tube stations.  They seem to have in-house chauffeurs around the entrance of the hotel for people to use when needed.

The reception is very large with enough room to do everything you need plus sitting and relaxing with a coffee and paper if you like.  We didn't eat in the restaurant bar at the far end of the lobby as we had plans elsewhere.

The room itself was very big.  We had an executive King I believe.  It had what seems like one of the largest beds I've ever slept in, a modern TV hung on the wall which could be moved to point towards the bed.  A large living room area in the bedroom and nicely finished bathroom.

When we got back from our evening out we found that there had been a turn down service and that the room seemed to have been quickly cleaned for us.

I will be 100% coming back to this amazing hotel.",5,2016,03,02
133,Liked it,"We booked this hotel as part of a theatre and hotel package and were pleasantly surprised by it. We normally stay in the Covent Garden area but this hotel is right next door to Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park and on a fine day it is a very pleasant walk through the park to Oxford Street. It is also convenient for the Royal Albert Hall and Knightsbridge. We only had breakfast at the hotel but this was good with no wait for a table and very attentive staff. 5 Minute walk to High St Kensington Underground Station.
Our bathroom had been recently updated but the bedroom was a bit bland and tired but bed very comfortable with a modern TV.",4,2016,02,29
133,Perfect hotel in a great convenient location,"Stayed here for a weekend seeing friends and attending a concert. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk to High Street Kensington station which was easy to travel from as a non-Londoner. All of the staff were very pleasant and attentive and went out of our way to help us as a large group and make sure we were all happy. The bar has great food and staff were again very helpful with nearby restaurants. Room was clean with brilliant views, no complaints at all. A great stay, I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to treat themselves!",5,2016,02,29
133,very well located and the view of the kensington park is amazing although i didn't get it last time.,"I like the hotel and wish to come more often....overall, the hotel is clean, service good. May be for this kind of standing level it requires a better food choices which is not the case today and they should encourage the clients by offering some incentives (price discount for regular clients)   ",4,2016,02,29
133,Very good location and service,"Great hotel in the middle of London city center.
Quiet rooms, very professional staff. 
Excellent food.
Kensington station is very close and many shops are surrounding the hotel. In addition to the enjoyable Kensington gardens and Nottinghill area.",4,2016,02,26
133,"Great Location, Vibrant Night Life","I wanted so badly to give this hotel a 5 star rating.  While in London on business, I took some personal time to get to know London and stayed a few extra days on my own dime.  I was set up in a queen room, which was smallish, but not claustrophobic.  The staff was very attentive and helpful.  I found the location excellent, you could easily walk to Picadilly Circus or Trafalgar Square.  You are a block away from Circle line tube station, which gets you easily anywhere you want to go in central London.  You are right next to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace, close to museums, dining and shopping.  I really enjoyed my stay, but spent most of my time either in meetings or touring London.  Anytime Fitness was available for guests in the same building.  Lots to like.  My value rating was based on my company's rate that I paid personally.  I did have the buffet every morning of my business sessions and it was very respectable.  The other dining at the hotel was prepared for a couple hundred people and was passable, but nothing to write home about.  Finally, I had an iron brought up to press clothes, and it failed, and it was reported to me by other colleagues they had the same experience.  I slept very well, stayed on the 6th floor and found it pretty quiet.  I would stay again.  It is hard to beat the area and location.",4,2016,02,25
133,Excellent stay,"Loved it! Location, room views, food, comfort. Rooms are on the small side, but thats the only issue, the rest is just perfect! Got a goid rate from hotel website 33% off for min 3night stay so also a great rate of ¬£135!",5,2016,02,25
133,Great Hotel in Kensington,"We stayed at this hotel for a weekend break in London to see a show at the Albert Hall (10 minutes walk away). Very impressed with the friendly helpful hotel staff and the fantastic room with great views over Kensington gardens. 
Would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,02,24
133,One of the best hotel in London,"I recommend this hotel for everyone since it has very good location and clean room.
I have one comment regarding to the internet, I suggest if the internet would be a free of charge as complimentary service ",5,2016,02,24
133,One night City break,"stayed here before, lovely rooms, attentive staff, great breakfast.  Good location into central London, Hyde Park & Kensington area. etc   Onsite carparking a bonus, albeit quite expensive, but not unusual for London",5,2016,02,23
133,Great suite,"The location is very good. We didn't use the spa or gym facilities. The suite on the 10th floor was great - incredibly spacious, clean and the views over the park and the London skyline were great. Good in-room facilities (nice toiletries, nespresso, walk-in closet, large bath). ",5,2016,02,23
133,Poor service for price,"For the price you would expect out of this world service and same with the quality of food however the room heating did not work so was cold but did get rectified the next day, The breakfast in the room was delivered cold with hard poached eggs, The following day breakfast the toast and tea was forgotten, I have had better in premier inn on work related stay",3,2016,02,23
133,Great Location- Beautiful Scenery,"Front desk needs to appreciate business travelers who fly all night and are expecting an available room to shower and get to work
Expensive, a great location, food good but pricey. Restaurant staff-great!",5,2016,02,22
133,Always a pleasure,"Our annual trip to this hotel did not disappoint.  Staff very friendly.  Room had everything we needed and was very clean.  Garden view room is exactly that: gives a good view of Kensington gardens.  Hotel ideally located as a base for travelling around London.  Another big plus: unlike some other hotels, there is no surcharge for room service (at the moment)",5,2016,02,22
133,Feels like home,"I love to stay at this hotel--it feels like home! The staff is very warm friendly and helpful. I would recommend it to family and friends.
I have just one comment about the room--the noise insulation between rooms is not great and I was disturbed by people talking in the adjoining room till late at night.",4,2016,02,22
133,A Perfect Hotel in a Perfect Location,"We arrived on Monday after a stressful rail journey only to be met by  charming reception staff, concierge and doorman.After checking into one of the king rooms which had a lovely outlook, the room itself was a good size with a seating area and lovely bathroom, we walked around the area, which is delightful. Many London sights are right on the doorstep and the Kensington High Street underground stop is only 5 minutes walk. We had breakfast each morning which was excellent and the staff were attentive and helpful. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone mentioning that it ia also terrific value for money. We shall be returning!",5,2016,02,22
133,Royal Garden hotel,"The Park near the hotel was a lovely walk, especially afte a big  breakfast
The view from the restaurant overlooking the park were exceptional especially the rooms overlooking the Royal Albert Hall 
Highly recommended",5,2016,02,22
133,My stay ,"When I got there it was raining. But the staff kindly gave me an umbrella. The room was the perfect size it had a bathroom with all of its amenities, a shower and a bathtub. The food was excellent. They had a very nice breakfast and a very good lunch. My stay was amazing.",5,2016,02,21
133,Dinner at Park Terrace,"The meal was absolutely lovely, service impeccable. I thoroughly recommend the Park Terrace, The waiters and waitress were attentive, the food beautifully presented and tasted lovely. I will be going back, one of the nicest restaurants I have been too.",5,2016,02,21
133,Short break in London,"This is an excellent hotel ideally located  with an elegant yet relaxed and friendly atmosphere; very close to all main transport, so easy to navigate through London.
The in-house Chinese restaurant is a must..!!
We will definitely using this hotel again when visiting London.",5,2016,02,21
133,Disappointing,"As far as I am concerned, the hotel is not a 5 star. The rooms are tiny. It took a technician 3 hours to come and look at a faulty heater and a day later was still not fixed. The restaurant however was very food and the staff very friendly.",4,2016,02,21
133,Outstanding stay,The hotel staff was excellent as was the hotel.  We chose a garden view room and was a great decision.  We had lunch at the Spagetti House directly across the street and I highly recommend it for a quality lunch.,5,2016,02,20
133,"This maybe the last time we stay here, smokey rooms","2016 not the 1960's, you think this hotel would have moved on in time, with regards to smoking hotels, Even in the none smoking rooms you can smell the smoke from the hallways.  

The complete disregard to nonsmokers as the smoke travels down the corridors and under the doors and into the nonsmokers rooms. Plus you will need to hold your breath to get to the lifts if you don't want to experience the passive smoking issue in this hotel. 

Also don't bother with breakfast as you can have a better breakfast over the road at one of the French cafe's. What a shame that the owner of the hotel does not stick to a clear no smoking rule in all rooms.",2,2016,02,20
133,50 style stay,It was a great opportunity to stay on Royal garden hotel I felt like home & experience the real English soul . We enjoy the journey with 50!years of hotels finest one .the staff and laundry lady were so kind and welcoming.,4,2016,02,20
133,great location  nice bedrooms very pleasant staff,I had a short but very pleasant stay.The staff was very nice the room very comfortable.The location is exceptional overlooking Kensigton gardens and millionaire allee near an excellent choice of shops on Kensington high street,5,2016,02,19
133,Better than the Palace!,"This is the finest hotel you could chose to stay at in London. It's location is ideal, next to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace and three blocks from the underground. It was very easy to go anywhere, yet the neighborhood has everything in terms of shopping and restaurants. The concierge staff was friendly, helpful and professional.  The rooms were very large and bathrooms were new and filled with every amenity. Our stay could not have been better. We were a family of four, with two teenagers.",5,2016,02,19
133,"Great hotel, great location for both business and pleasure","My room faced Hyde Park. Incredible view. Very functional room well set up for a business traveler. The location is fantastic for both business or holiday travel. Great restaurants, shopping and museums all in walking distance.",5,2016,02,19
133,All you want is there,"The location of the hotel is great. It is near the beautiful park, the Kensignton Palace, the public transportations, shops and nice restaurants. Staff were polite, friendly and helpful. All you want is there. ",5,2016,02,19
133,Excellent,"What a great experience - friendly staff, clean and luxurious hotel with great views. The hotel is location conveniently for shopping and a short cab ride to theatre land (we did both). The staff couldn't be more accommodating.",5,2016,02,18
133,The Hyde Park - your backyard!,"the hotel is very well located, the garden rooms have a breathtaking view. The rooms are modern, with excellent bed and linen - nothing fancy, though... Bathroom looks brandnew and very clean! Service is correct and friendly.",5,2016,02,18
133,A nice stay in London,"I've enjoyed every day spent at Royal Gardens. The staff is friendly and professional, while the rooms are clean, comfortable and offer great views. I would've liked free wi-fi since it's a 5-star hotel, but the paid one worked very well.",5,2016,02,18
133,5 Stars all the way,"I was attending a social function at the Royal Garden Hotel and decided to stay overnight rather than travel home late on a Sunday night.
The experience started the moment the taxi pulled up. My car door was opened, my luggage was unloaded and carried into the hotel and the door was held open for me - all small things, but in an age where good manners are a rarity, they were very welcome. Booking in was straight forward as I had booked my room several weeks before.  My room was spacious, with a queen size bed, en suite with everything I could possibly need and a wonderful view of Kensington Palace. The food was freshly cooked, nicely presented on the plate and good size portions. The staff were friendly but maintained their professional approach.
Everything about this experience was amazing. 5 star luxury from start to finish",5,2016,02,17
133,Is WIFI included or is Free WIFI included?,"My reservation specified that ""WIFI access was included.""  However, upon checking-in, it became obvious that, while WIFI access was included, ""free"" WIFI access was not included. And just to rub salt in the wound, internet access was GBP20/day, which seems very expensive.  It became more frustrating when I saw numerous ""room packages"" offering ""free"" internet access.  When I asked the desk, they assured me that no room reservation made on travel websites ever includes ""free"" internet access. I guess shame on me for not catching this slight of hand however this certainly seems like a business practice beneath a hotel like the Royal Garden.  The hotel is very nice but this will bother me for a long time and I will not stay here again.",2,2016,02,17
133,Great Hotel,We were travelling to London on a family trip. We loved the location of the hotel which is near the park and also close to public transportations. My wife loved the variety of shops around and my son loved the proximity to the park. ,5,2016,02,17
133,The perfect hotel stay!,"We stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel 12/13/14 February, from the moment we arrived we were made to feel very special and welcome. The room was perfect, the views gorgeous across the Park. The food exceptional, location excellent for exploring. Just the perfect hotel. ",5,2016,02,17
133,Wife's birthday weekend,They helped make this special weekend very special. They could not do more for us.we stayed here to see cirque du solelil at the Royal Albert hall. It is so close we walked from the hotel.we also went to the V&A museum walkable as well.,5,2016,02,16
133,Stay,"Convenient and pleasant place to stay. Needs more supplies for in room teas and coffee.
Staff friendly and efficient. Good place for meetings with good facilities. Tube station nearby and park land on hand for jogging etc.

133,"Great hotel, great location!",Fab hotel with good sized rooms right in the middle of Kensington high street! Perfect base. Would recommend for anyone looking for a decent hotel that isn't too over priced. Staff were all very good as well.,5,2016,02,16
133,Fabulous customer service - highly recommended,"A lovely welcome and superb customer service. Excellent location, well priced and comfortable - we highly recommend this hotel. We did not eat there so cannot comment on the food but the ambience seemed good. Room superb and very comfortable (sadly the air con was noisy at night so a bit chilly when this was turned off hence only 4 stars for sleep quality) - bed very comfortable . Staff were incredibly helpful and we were welcomed with champagne and chocolates due to a special occasion - we have emailed to say thank you - we will be returning due to the high standard.",5,2016,02,16
133,Good Hotel,"We were attending the Royal Albert Hall and the hotel is just 10 minutes walk so was very well placed. The staff and the hotel itself was very warm and welcoming, food was good, rooms are a good size. If you were visiting Hyde Park you couldn`t do much better as the hotel overlooks the park.",4,2016,02,16
133,Stay,"Was very unhappy as credit card kept getting charged after checking out of the hotel. Was not happy with this. This was our 7th time staying in 18 months. Was very unhappy about this matter. Would not book this hotel
Again. ",4,2016,02,15
133,Quite expensive,Great rooms and very friendly staff.  Also great location for the Royal Albert Hall.  It's a pity there's not enough teabags and milk (only enough for 2 cups) but very clean and modern. Will definitely stay again if I receive an offer.,4,2016,02,15
133,Short stay at the Royal Garden Hotel,"Nice, friendly and clean hotel, set in a great location for visiting points of interest or taking in a show.  Pricing was not overly high, although we had a problem with room service, where they mixed up our breakfasts, which was a problem as my wife is a coeliac.",4,2016,02,15
133,A great hotel in a great location,"I recently stayed here and its a great hotel. 

The people on reception were very welcoming and the people working on the door were particularly helpful and accommodating.

I thought that the room was spacious and very well laid out. The amenities in the room were very good, with a great TV that you can plug another device into should you choose (we didnt and you would need the cables for this), the clock also had an iphone dock if you wanted to play your own music. The bathroom was large and very nice. 

The room was clean and tidy. 

The breakfast was fantastic, with a great choice and I couldnt fault it in any way. 

The hotel location means that it is right next to Kensington gardens which are beautiful.",5,2016,02,15
133,Another great private function at TRGH,I spent a very enjoyable evening at The Royal Garden Hotel at a private function. The dinner served was lovely; beef that melted it was so tender accompanied with fresh green vegetables and creamed potato lightly saut√©ed. The entree was crab rosti and a beautiful raspberry and chocolate sweet followed by coffee and petit fours. As usual the service was spot on and the staff ultra polite. For London the wine was fairly reasonably priced. I'm looking forward to my next visit.,5,2016,02,14
133,"It's not the Palace, but the next best thing!","Without question, the nicest hotel you can pick from every facet .  Located next to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace, it's convenient to everything, surrounded by nice shops and restaurants, has an amazing, helpful and friendly staff.  Rooms were perfect, large, clean and basically almost new. Nice bathrooms, good housekeeping. Will come back!",5,2016,02,14
133,Good hotel at an expensive price,"I hot a Very warm welcome. The hotel was confortable  but it was not suited for the forum i was attending.
The cost/ value is not very good.
The location is optimum, the dining experience was on average with a nice staff",4,2016,02,14
133,"Nice place in Central London, for attending a congress","Good location, easy to reach from Heathrow or Gatwick by public transport. Food is fine, and not too expensive. Nice place for attending an Investment Forum (full of small places where you can have quiet discussion).",4,2016,02,14
133,excellent,"great stay again as usual after seeing cirque de soleil at the albert hall.
Room was ready early, so we could go straight up.
Very clean hotel with brilliant views of the park and palace.
Very comfortable beds with an amazing clean bathroom, always well equipped with all accessories needed.
Breakfast was superb, with all staff attentive at all times.
Will definitely be staying again in the near future.",5,2016,02,13
133,Freezing cold room for ¬£230/night,Room was freezing even with heating turned on full.  Complained and told heating would be turned up.  Why in the middle of winter is it turned down.  Lost a customer.  Would not recommend.  At this price I expected better.,3,2016,02,12
133,Wonderful dinner,"We were staying elsewhere but wished to have one fine dining meal during our stay  , the menu on line convinced us to eat here .We were booked for 8 and arrived at 20 to 8 .We had pre dinner cocktails ,I had a marvellous Singapore sling and hubby great g&t .All the staff very knowledgeable and pleasant ,from meeter and greeter To Maitre D no one was condescending or impatient .They found time to have a small conversation to make you feel welcome .Great training and great staff .
The meal was wonderful .Fresh bread was served first .Ihad smoked salmon souffl√©,halibut and the raspberry dessert All fantastic but especially the dessert ,the pastry ...and the flavour hit of raspberry..wow .Hubby had beef ,Dover sole roulade and limoncello souffl√© and enjoyed every mouthful.We could only manage one plate of cheese and biscuits between us .We had coffee and liqueurs in the lounge area .
Really recommend this restaurant and next time we are in London will eat there again",5,2016,02,12
133,Amazing,Can't fault this hotel at all. 5 minute walk from high street kensington tube station. Upon booking I had requested a higher storey room and upon checkin the request was met as we were given a room on the 6th floor with an amazing view onto Kensington high street. The room was bright and spacious courtesy of a lot of mirrors and had a separate raised seating area with a comfy sofa. The beds are a very nice size and the bathroom with separate bath and shower is spectacular as well. Everything was immaculately clean. Housekeeping offers a morning and evening service and if you have opted for do not disturb they ring and ask weather Housekeeping is needed. Room service is fantastic and the lovely gentleman who brought us our food was lovely and chatty. There are a lot of restaurants very close to the hotel so it's very convenient. Book your stay directly through the hotel to get complimentary WiFi as apparently otherwise WiFi is charged pretty expensive. All in all looking forward to staying again!,5,2016,02,12
133,Good location,Overall the hotel is in a good location and the bed is comfortable . I didn't have any curtain netting  but overall the room standard was pleasant and certainly  functional . I would use again if in this area ,3,2016,02,12

133,"An extremely pleasant Hotel, perfect for longer stays","Great view on Hyde park from the Park side Rooms

Extremely fast elevators

Excellent Eggs Benedict

Very convenient desk with nice view on the Park for those who work from the hotel room

Very Good room layout

Only the A/C & Heating fan is slightly noisy and not too effective",5,2016,02,10
133,Resdient and conference for 3 nights,"Helpful staff and overall a very nice place to be.  Small issues that arose and if honest rivial were dealt with professionally and made to feel most wecolme.
Great location car park underneath with NCP and outside the congestion charging zone Plus plus.",4,2016,02,10
133,Very good but check in took a very long time,"We booked for business several rooms for 6 persons via booking.com. It was really a hassle to check in even when we got the copies, emails and the corresponding booking numbers. It took almost half an hour to check in, very ennoying after a long trip.
Then it also turned out that if you book via booking.com you do not receive free WiFi,  but you have to pay 25 GBP per day, come on!
However we received a voucher for wifi, so that was very nice :-)
Serving breakfast takes - depending on the staff - too much time, I sat on my table for 10 minutes and no one came to me to serve coffee or tea. I had to ask for it and the lady was somewhat ennoyed by it...she told me: I am coming and after another 5 minutes she finally came to take my order. She was very busy talking to her collegue, but please have your staff meetings not during breakfast time. Not every guest is staying for a holiday. I am in London for business and I need to be on time, I don't want to spent too much time on breakfast. Then after we almost finished our breakfast and we sat on our table for surely half an hour she came and asked if we would like to order some breakfast (scrambled eggs etc) and we all thought that was really odd and very late...
Besides these things, I had a very nice cosy room with a lovely view on the parc and the staff is very friendly and helpfull!",4,2016,02,10
133,Best Hotel in London,"best location, biggest room sizes, five star service, five star discreet hospitality. Excellent views, excellent dining. Proximity to park. Have recommended to others. Will be my company's hotel of choice in London. ",5,2016,02,09
133,Amazing afternoon tea,"I can't say enough good things about having afternoon tea in the Park Terrace restaurant in the Royal Garden Hotel.  The surroundings are modern yet luxurious and every detail was thought of.  When I booked I asked for a window seat and was told that this couldn't be guaranteed but when we arrived we got a lovely table by the window.  

We all got to choose the tea we wanted and there was a lot to choose from, we were all happy with our choices too!  The sandwiches were gorgeous, once again we were all really happy with the selection.  The scones were so tasty too and the cakes were to die for!  The whole experience was so nice, I am wanting to go again!

Finally I should mention the staff.  They were so attentive yet not overbearing.  I can't wait to return!",5,2016,02,09
133,Excellent location in Kensington,"One of the more comfortable beds and pillows in London! The location, 100 meters from Tube station Kensington High Street makes it hard to beat in busy, congested and expensive London! As a perk, the Whole Food Supermarket is across the street :)",4,2016,02,09
133,"Great value for money, excellent location","We visited in February and got a great deal. 
The hotel is well situated for exploring London, overlooking Kensington Gardens, it is on a number 10 bus route which takes you through the centre of London, along Oxford Street and as far as Kings Cross. The tube station is a very short walk away and there are restaurants and shops in the close vicinity.
The hotel staff are very welcoming and helpful. We were able to check into our rooms even though we arrived mid morning.
The rooms are spacious, well furnished and very clean. There are tea and coffee making facilities and water it provided by the bedside each evening.The beds are extremely comfortable with lovely crisp bed linen. 
The bathroom was immaculate, it has both shower and bath.
An excellent place to stay.",5,2016,02,09
133,Great hotel,"Perfect location at the hedge of Hyde Park, a walk away from Mayfair, Notting Hill, Knightsbridge and South Ken. Great service, clean rooms with all 5 star amenities, great park views from rooms and restaurants. I enjoyed the Chinese restaurant on the last floor, which served excellent dim sums. ",5,2016,02,09
133,Try the set menu in Park Terrace,We weren't on a budget but were having pre-theatre dinner so wanted to eat and go.  We had two courses at ¬£23 per head which for a 5 star restaurant in London we were surprised.  The steak was melt in your mouth and tasted delightful. I would recommend to anybody to go there.  Ok drinks are pricey but again you are in a fie star hotel in Kensington.  To be expected.,5,2016,02,09
133,"Wonderful hotel, excellent location","Nice rooms, welcoming staff,
Great location accessible to Hyde Park,
Tube & shopping. Walk to whole foods for
Yummy treats. Rooms pretty with spacious bathrooms, terry robes & good products. Room size typically on smaller side but large windows which open for ventilation. Fanastic Chinese restaurant on penthouse floor. Don't miss

133,nice hotel but poor rooms,"nice hotel but poor rooms, u can hear everything in the room next to yours.
the price is a little bit high, cause u r not in mayfair, 
service and staff are very kind
the real problem is the noise in the room: a 5 star hotel MUST have soundproof rooms!",2,2016,02,09
133,False advertising,"I was glad that the hotel call me right after my booking to understand my request. I was glad when she understood that I booked a garden room to enjoy the view for my girl friend birthday. However, I was scared when the lady pushed the 2nd floor button of the elevator to show us our room. And I confirm. The garden view is not applicatible on second floor. However, the price is as expensive as a room with the nice view",1,2016,02,09
133,A little spot of oriental grace in the middle of Kensington,"We chose an executive room and originally went for this hotel because of how close it is to the Royal Albert Hall, but the brilliant service, room quality and general feeling of the hotel make this our new ""go to"" hotel for events in this part of town and for romantic get aways!",5,2016,02,09
133,Perfection,"We took a sentimental trip to this hotel.  My husband has fond memories of vacationing here forty years ago when he was a child.  It is nice to say the hotel lived up to the nostalgia.  Though there were no sightings of celebrities this time, this hotel has an air of glamor, luxury, and sophistication.  
The rooms are well appointed and immaculate.  The staff is friendly, accommodating, and courteous.  
The location is perfect.  Many attractions, shops, and restaurants are within walking distance. We could not have asked for a better London destination.  I suspect our children will return one day with their families to share this wonderful experience.",5,2016,02,08

133,Thanks,"Great hotel and location, the service was good, the staff friendly and the room nice. I got a park view which makes the experience that much enjoyable.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone for business or pleasure.  A little on the expensive side but worth it.
",5,2016,02,07
133,Fine location,"Excellent location by the Kensington park and close to all services and transport connections. Everything works, room is ok, services are fine, but very standard. There is no special soul or spirit.
Things to improve: wifi should definitely be free and available everywhere, to charge from wifi is from the past.",4,2016,02,07
133,February in London,"Excellent location - very close proximity to a great neighborhood, and pleasant walks in the park while not attending our 2-day conference at the hotel.  The staff were well trained and made me feel very welcome.",5,2016,02,06
133,The Amazing Royal Garden Hotel,"Amazing hotel, very friendly staff nothing is too much trouble, the rooms are of a very high standard and the little extra in there make your stay even more enjoyable. Perfect location, highly recommend ",5,2016,02,06
133,Highly recommended,"A bit expensive, but deserve it. 
Gorgeous hotel to me. But highly recommended as there are friendly and well- trained staff with top notch facilities and amenities.
I would like to stay there again when I go to London next time.",5,2016,02,06
133,Highly Recommended,"Our first time to the Royal Garden Hotel for a four night stay.  Overall  probably one of the best values in London.  Very well run property.  We reserved a Garden Room which had a spectacular view over Kensington Gardens.  Very few hotels, at any price, can top that view.  Don't expect a traditional ""English Garden"" d√©cor. It is very sleek and warm modern, rather masculine, very tasteful.  All the staff that we encountered were very professional and helpful.  During the week, breakfast is a continental buffet with hot items ordered from a menu. Weekends featured and excellent hot buffet.  As noted in other reviews, the location is great: 20+ restaurants within a 5 minute walk, tube station just a few minutes farther. Wi-Fi was very fast and is free if you book directly with the hotel or their reservation partner.  I would not hesitate to recommend the Royal Garden and would book it again.",5,2016,02,06
133,"Gorgeous hotel, fantastic staff","From the front desk to the bar and room and all in-between, everyone & everywhere you look at this hotel is a delight. The gardens view was glorious, & both breakfast and drinks delicious. Highly reccomend the Royal Garden Hotel, and would stay there again on business or pleasure.",5,2016,02,05
133,Perfect Place to be,"Very central place and beautiful environment.
Staff is very polite and aware. Bar, breakfast and Restaurants are perfect.
Only restriction is the external access to the Gym (you have to leave the hotel for a few steps).",5,2016,02,05
133,Perfect place for weekend.,"King room was very nice and comfortable. perfect helpfull staff, Perfect room service! Excellent location. Close to Underground station, easy to get to the airport, easy to walk in central London. The breakfast is very expensive  and complicated, you have to wait to be seated, then to choose what kind of breakfast you prefer and then to wait tea or coffe or toast, 5 min from the hotel- cheaper and better. WIFI is also too expensive: 20 pounds / day! My card was debited twice for  apr.680 pounds.
",4,2016,02,05
133,"Nice room, friendly staff!","A very nice hotel, friendly staff and good overall service. My room, though, was a bit noisy. But apart from that, everything was fine. Especially the shower was great! Breakfast was good but took some time to be delivered.",4,2016,02,04
133,My favourite London hotel,"I would recommend to anyone , Royal Garden Hotel is in a league of its own . Impeccable service and rooms are wonderful , staff perfection . The views are spectacular .
I wouldn't stay anywhere else .",5,2016,02,04
133,Recommended ,"Very clean and Comfortable room, professional staff, effective concierge services for recommendations and bookings, great breakfast....Excellent hotel and an overall very positive experience. I highly recommend to the business traveler.  The Chinese restaurant on the top floor has amazing views of London and superb cuisine.",5,2016,02,04
133,Grear business location,"This hotel manages to create the right ambience for both the tourist, and business visitor.  Very helpful front desk staff.  Good range of restaurants.  Ming Jian is consistently good. the overall level of cleanliness is commendable.",5,2016,02,04
133,Best Value in London and close to Whole Foods,"I am a regular visitor in London and stayed in many five star boutique and large hotels. This though became my base hotel. 

It is the same price as a small apartment in the area on airbnb. But with all the hotel services, brilliant free to use gym, and Whole Foods across the road with takeaways and restaurants and fresh juices! 

For someone who is used to healthy eating and struggles in the hotels - this is the place to be! 

Everything is a short cab ride away! Also, I find that the air quality is much better than in nearby Knightsbridge for example. ",5,2016,02,04
133,conference,"good Location, excellent staff with friendly and welcoming attitude. rooms are quite small but guess that comes with a central London location. as we had the conference in the Hotel, it was convenient and saved me time to commute. ",4,2016,02,04
133,"Lovely room, friendly staff. More attention to detail needed to warrant 5 stars.",The room was lovely and very high quality however more attention to detail should be looked at to warrant 5 stars. No iron in room. Pillows too soft. Annoying nightlight that I couldn't turn off caused disturbed sleep.,4,2016,02,03
133,A magical weekend!,"We arrived for a 3 night weekend stay and were shown to a beautiful room, overlooking Kensington Gardens. The view was simply fabulous!  Inspecting our room we discovered that it had everything we could possibly need and the adjoining bathroom was wonderful too and the complimentary toiletries were gorgeous. We had pre-ordered afternoon tea - I believe there were 6 different finger sandwiches, all delicious, and then came scones and lovely cakes. We even got to choose the type of tea we drank! In fact, ALL the food and drink we consumed in the restaurant and via Room Service was first class. Service is excellent too - the staff are  friendly and helpful at all times and utterly professional. You get the feeling that this is a happy working environment and there is a friendly atmosphere which is perhaps the very nicest thing about this great hotel!",5,2016,02,03
133,Perfect Weekend Venue,"Have stayed here several times, staff go the extra mile.
Breakfast is exceptional (worth getting up for.!), staff cheerful.
Bar tender on the 10th floor is a 'top bloke' - literally.
Ming Jiang is a bit prices but food is delicious.
Back soon.",5,2016,02,02
133,Anniversary break,We are well travelled and this has to be the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff were very friendly. Our room and stay was exceptional. Would be the first hotel we would recommend any friend or family member. We will look forward to returning.,5,2016,02,02
133,Great all round!,"Great hotel and really good experience! really friendly, knowledgable and professional staff, lovely room with great views. Basement parking was convenient and secure. Would definitely recommend to anyone",5,2016,02,02
133,The place to be in the heart of London,"Great Hotel, nice staff, excellent chinese restaurant. Buffet breakfast all you need and high tea with piano just sublime. If you want to have an excellent experience in London with the royal family as neighbour go there.",5,2016,02,02
133,Fantastic Hotel,Stayed here the night before my daughter's wedding and loved the place.  Great rooms and views.  We had several rooms and a suite.  breakfast served in the rooms.  Nothing to dislike.  Well recommended for weddings and functions.,4,2016,02,01
133,room size is perfect,the non smoking rooms get the smoking smell from the smoking rooms on the same floor through the ventilation and this is why we couldn't put the heating on and had to settle for an electric heater all through our accommodation.,4,2016,02,01
133,Love the Royal Garden,"I have been using the hotel for a couple of years and have loved the place.
the Housekeeping, restaurants, bars, front desk etc are very attentive.
The staff turnover is low and therefore the quality of service is high.
They have got to know me and the personalized service is lovely to have.

",5,2016,01,31
133,Business Stay,"Beautiful Hotel, right in the heart of Kensington. Superb location. The Staff, I can honestly say everyone I came across were most warm and all genuine smiles. All very helpful and most courteous. 

Great stay great people,  I will be coming back . ",5,2016,01,31
133,One of the best hotel in London,"The staff are the most friendly in London for a 5 stars hotel . Peaceful setting in a very busy area of the city,not far from all amenities. We stayed here before and decided for a longer stay 4 nights was a great idea to enjoy this fabulous hotel . We will be back very soon.",5,2016,01,30
133,A lovely hotel!,"I booked a room at this hotel as I was attending a function there and did not want to have to leave early to try and catch a late train home. The price was reasonable to the extent I did not realise it was a 5 star hotel until after I arrived. I regularly visit London but tend to stay in the Marble Arch area, so seldom venture over to Kensington. 
The reception area is very smart and I could only see the bar to the right; it looked inviting but I did not have time to try it out. My room, which must have recently been refurbished, was on the 8th floor. It had a double bed and a seating area and a desk by the window. The room was of average size for London but it was very well appointed. Apart from very good toiletries and a full sized bath/shower, it had tea making facilities with very nice china cups, saucers and a two cup tea pot. It also had a safe, a selection of snacks and sweets and a refrigerator fully stocked with various drinks. I did not avail myself of any of these as I do not like to pay over ¬£25 for a bottle of House Wine, as an example. 
That evening I attended a function for more than 200 people at the hotel. To start we had a Seared Beef dish with Peppers and a main course of Chicken on a bed of Risotto. The reason I mention it is because the meal was first class and it is a testament to the hotel that they can prepare such perfectly cooked dishes for so many people. The organiser was complimented by many guests for the choice of venue and the food and service.
In the morning, I opened the curtains and was treated to a marvellous view of Kensington Palace and Kensington Gardens. I was very lucky that my room faced that way. I was in room 809, so you would not go far wrong if you asked for a room with a similar view to that one. 
I was so impressed with the value this hotel offered that I may well book it next time I am in the Marble Arch area; three stops west on the Central Line and one stop south on the District or Circle Line is a short trip worth taking!
If you arrive by car, an NCP Car Park is directly under the hotel, so it is very convenient.
I really like this hotel and will be back!",5,2016,01,29
133,Happy with everything...,Had a really nice stay and look forward to returning again. It was nice being by Kensington Gardens. Also had access to many nice attractions in the area via the Big Bus tours.  Go to the Sky Garden in town for a free view of London from 35 stories up.,5,2016,01,29
133,London Relaxation,Great hotel in a brilliant location.  I've stayed many times before and never been disappointed.  The rooms are so comfortable and the heated bathroom floor is a joy during the winter.  I have no problem recommending the hotel for all types of traveller.,5,2016,01,29
133,OUTSTANDING AS USUAL,"Our 6th visit to the Royal Garden and as usual it delivered on every level.
The staff are extremely professional and courteous. They also have that uncanny knack of making you feel special without being overbearing.  We had afternoon tea and it was exceptional as was the full English breakfast the following morning which in my view is the best anywhere, always so very fresh.  If you are looking to stay somewhere near the Royal Albert Hall and don't want to break the bank then The Royal Garden Hotel is without doubt a must.",5,2016,01,29
133,"Nice, well maintained hotel in great location - not too pricey either","We stayed for 2 nights at this hotel - the location is excellent, and with great views if you have a room overlooking Kensington Park. One thing I particularly liked was the straight grain wood panelling in the rooms - not sure if it is an original feature from when it first opened - but it adds to the understated feel of luxury in the room which was also very comfortable. 
Word of warning, but probably typical of any hotel car park in London - the car park is very tight and the narrow and long corkscrew ramp is not really suitable for bigger cars of today.",4,2016,01,28
133,Perfect location friendly staff,Very comfortable stay with perfect. And friendly staff Abd great location in addition very close to the shopping area as well great proximate to sight seeing all in all every think wash yet perfect and to our expectations ,5,2016,01,28
133,Look forward to going again,"Would loved to have stayed longer to enjoy more of the facilities, great view, rooms clean with nice touches and breakfast good but best of all staff genuinely care that you are happy.
Walking distance to High St Kensington Underground and Albert Hall",5,2016,01,27
133,Birthday treat for my husband,"We found the staff were excellent and efficient. We have eaton in the Restaurant on many occasions but this time we stayed for one night. 
The food is always very good. We will return to the Restaurant again I am sure.",5,2016,01,27
133,Great hotel with great location and friendly staff,"I visited London in January 2016 with my dad. We were very satisfied with our double room with twin beds on the 9th floor. The room was spacious with two chairs and a table in the ""lounge area"" and big screen tv with numerous channels. A big bathroom with a tub is always a great feature as well. Staff were super friendly and welcoming. I will definitely come back to Royal Garden Hotel.",5,2016,01,27
133,A brilliant hotel,"These have to be the best rooms in London: stunning views, spacious and quiet. There is no traffic! The staff are wonderful, the food is excellent, our weekend was like a dream and we are coming back.",5,2016,01,26
133,Excellent stay,"We had an excellent stay at the Royal Garden Hotel  We had a lovely room(343) overlooking Kensington Gardens. The room was spotless. We were close to the lifts though so the whoosh of the lifts prevented us from getting to sleep initially. The breakfast was very good with plenty on offer, but ¬£25 each was a bit pricey. I suppose that's London prices. However i would not hesitate to stay there again.",4,2016,01,26
133,Fantastic experience,"Excellent location, staff very helpful and professional, clean, fantastic views (of the park), rooms very well equipped. 
Great place to eat, to rest, to go from there to a lovely walk in the park, to experience some of the small cafes near by, easy transport to get to the West end and at the same time to be in a quieter area. ",5,2016,01,26
133,Excellent,"Having lived in Kensington for many years, it was slightly odd to stay in a hotel. I chose The Royal Garden for reputation, location, price and onsite parking and booked the hotel and NCP Car Park online. Everything from parking, check in to check out and exit went smoothly. Our room was spacious and well furnished. A lovely bathroom with shower cubicle, bath, luxury complimentary toiletries and white fluffy towels - plus dressing gowns made the experience of getting ready to attend a Wedding Reception elsewhere, pure joy. The bed was very comfortable with wonderful pillows. (Unfortunately, the noise of the police cars kept us awake throughout the night because we were no longer used to hearing the sirens.) We treated ourselves to a tasty Continental breakfast in our room while we watched Kensington High Street come to life on Sunday morning before checking out. Every member of staff with whom we came into contact was friendly and courteous. ",5,2016,01,26
133,One nights stay,Good value and great location. We were welcomed by friendly and helpful staff who were very helpful. We were more than happy with the look of the room and it was extremely comfortable. We would definitely stay there again and recommend to others,4,2016,01,25
133,Quality hotel,"The Royal garden hotel is our favourite hotel to stay at when visiting London . From driving into the hotel and handing the car keys to the doorman to park it for me to the reception staff nothing is to much trouble for them
To do for you efficiently and happily . The garden veiw rooms are a joy to overlook and very peaceful from the hub hub of the main road fronting the hotel. The breakfast is a real feast you name it and they have it and cook it fresh for you and it's delicious and well served to your table for you . The check out is as pleasurable as the check inn apart from you are leaving a well run established and that is always sad . The hotel is well placed for visiting the sites around London and also the amazing shopping opportunities you have a choice of . You will defiantly not be dissatisfied with this hotel .",5,2016,01,25
133,Great stay,"We stayed for one night, we were very comfortable, the rooms were light and airy with a great view of the park. The resturant was excellent. The cocktails were tasty and reasonably priced.
The staff were very helpful and attentive.
The room service was very well presented and enjoyable.",5,2016,01,25

133,An Excellent Hotal,"I have stayed at this hotel several years in a row now and always look forward to going back to it as I know that it will be a great experience. All staff are efficient, friendly and helpful. The 24 hour gym is a great addition to the facilities and it is very well equipped. Fantastic location with many cultural and shopping sites within easy walking distance. ",5,2016,01,24
133,Review,Stayed 3 nights last week and have stayed here on regular basis for past 6/7 years. Always request quiet room very hit and miss if we get it on last visit despite booking over the phone on a pre paid basis no cancellation policy I was in a room next to lifts hotel lifts and staff lifts right opposite my room horrific to say the least all night long noise of lift going on hardly any sleep met with public relations member on my departure to discuss this and left letter for general manager mr Lowry  felt embarrassed and humiliated about the whole situation on a positive note the staff are the epitome of professiolism and kindness l await a response from the management this visit was a disaster to say the least,2,2016,01,24
133,Fantastic Afternoon Tea,"We had afternoon tea at the hotel the service was very good and staff attentive without being overbearing the food and theatre was really good, and the homemade scones amazing we had a late booking and were offered extra champagne and and sandwiches but we declined as we had a theatre show to get too if we had not we would have stayed longer and indulged in the extra perks being offered I would definitely recommend trying.",5,2016,01,24
133,A truly enjoyable stay,"Everything, accommodation and staff, were excellent, the most enjoyable and relaxing hotel stay we have experienced in some time.   We would have no hesitation at all in recommending the Royal Garden Hotel.
",5,2016,01,24
133,Great hotel right by Hyde park and Kensington,"This is a very classy hotel, conveniently located on Kensignton High street 
Great public areas, great restaurants and very helpful staff. The full English breakfast is well worth it. 
Only small issue is that some rooms are quite small. Otherwise great",4,2016,01,24
133,A genuine 5* stay,"Arrived to a very friendly and efficient welcome. Not robotic, genuinely friendly. Room was immaculate and offered everything I needed, except an ironing board and iron. A quick call to housekeeping and they were there within 3 minutes. Iron fused and when replacement (which arrived very quickly) didn't work. The gentleman who brought it said he would call maintenance and took my shirt to iron!! Maintenance and my shirt were both back within minutes! Brilliant!  Breakfast was ordered in my room And arrived on time and as requested. So overall I can't fault the Royal Garden. I'll stay again. ",5,2016,01,24
133,Good stay but ¬£20 for internet????,Been staying at Royal Garden several times and always had a good stay and service. HOWEVER...still being charged ¬£20 for 24hr internet connection feels like going back 10 years i time. Time to realize it's 2016!,4,2016,01,23
133,No problems but breakfast reception staff rude,"Good hotel, but breakfast reception staff judge people...  Very rude, completely blanked us when asked a simple question. Good location, everything else fine, lots of concierge / security., plenty of restaurants around",4,2016,01,23
133,Business trip,"A really professional team at the Royal Garden Hotel - who work hard and are courteous and professional at all times- to everyone - making my 1 night at the hotel a good experience - more likely to rebook with them as they made a difference to my stay! 
",5,2016,01,23

133,Great stay,Very welcoming and amazing food and drinks. Would stay again. We also ate at the Terrace restaurant and the food and service was incredible. I had to call to reception to ask for an iPhone charger and someone came to my room and collected my phone and charged it for me.,5,2016,01,22
133,Great Hotel Great People,"Very smart hotel - room was very clean and perfect for my stay
The welcome was great and the aftercare brilliant
I was stupid enough to leave my wallet in the room as i checked out - not only was it returned to me but the effort from everyone to help was fantastic - they really care about customers
well done everyone - and thank you",5,2016,01,22
133,"Professional staff, but very dirty room","On arrival the staff was very proffesional and helpful. Unfortunately I was running late for a meeting and didn't have time to check my room too much before having to rush out. It was only when I came back late that night and was going to bed that I found the room was very dirty. Especially the linnen had a lot of stains and was covered with long black hairs. Also the bathroom was not very clean. I'm sure they would have arranged another room for me, but as it was already very late and I had to get up very early the next day, I just went to sleep.",3,2016,01,22
133,Wonderful hotel with Royal Location !,"This top notch hotel is right next to Kensington Palace you cannot get a better location to enjoy the gardens and the Palace. Local shops are terrific, hotel rooms are very nice and the restaurant is very good. Highly recommend would return for sure!",5,2016,01,21
133,A warm welcome back,"Excellent location for Kensington High Street and West End.  Having stayed here previously it was a pleasure to be back.

Excellent room service on the one night I stayed in.  Hope to revisit soon.",4,2016,01,20
133,Nice hotel,"Good and perfect location 
Small rooms but good
No free wifi 
And I will visit them again 
Good and very welcoming staff 
And everything in the room good 
Should to be the review at least 100 no more 
Thank you ",5,2016,01,20
133,Miss,"All over very good, but rooms starting to need som refreshing. Service is exellent. Location is good if you use Heathrow as airport. Walking distance (in about 20 min) to Knightsbridge and Oxford Street. ",4,2016,01,20
133,First class accommodation,"Staff were friendly, welcoming and helpful .  Our room was very clean and comfortable with excellent facilities. There is easy access to central London and to the park.  The hotel is good value given its location.",5,2016,01,20

133,Excellent value for money,"From the moment you enter reception it feels more like New York than London, with elegant decor and impeccable and friendly service. We booked a park view room and were glad it was on the first floor as there's something very relaxing about looking out onto trees, and we were high enough up that no-one could see into the room yet we could see everything going on in the park below.  The room was spacious, the bed very large and comfortable and the bathroom large and modern with all the amenities you need. We tested both the bar and the terrace cafe where again the service was impeccable and food and drinks very reasonably priced and delicious.  This is a great location at the park end of Kensington High Street and excellent value for money.",5,2016,01,19
133,Happy Customer,"We have stayed at this hotel a few times now and will come back again in the future, lovely friendly staff and the rooms are beautiful and clean.  Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a relaxing stay in London.",5,2016,01,19

133,Mother and daughter break,Stayed at the royal garden over a weekend. Staff very customer focused makes such a change. Garden rooms are very nice with lovely views. Breakfast excellent. Special mention to Gabor who had excellent customer service. Little pricey in the  park restaurant but food very good. Very comfortable stay. This was our second visit and will not be our last.,5,2016,01,18
133,Excellent,"Have to say from the moment we arrived to leaving the service we received was excellent, our room overlooking Kensington Gdns was lovely. Dining was also of the highest standard especially Ming Jiang the Chinese restaurant on the 10th floor",5,2016,01,18
133,3rd trip to wonderful hotel,Absolutely wonderful. Staff couldnt be more polite and helpful. Nothing too much trouble. Very welcoming. Accomodation and food first class. Clean and comfortable. Excellent location. Good value for money. Will be back!,5,2016,01,18
133,Royal Service!!,"Recently stayed overnight, fabulous greeting from doorman to reception team. Really made us feel special. Our room I would say was adequate for a one night stay but I don't think I'd feel the same if staying longer (compact). Breakfast (full English) was a little disappointing, a bit bland to be honest maybe I should have been healthier & stuck to the buffet which looked delicious.  Overall, I'd be happy to recommend & would stay again.",4,2016,01,17
133,Not a food lover's hotel,"Average hotel for the price but the Min Jiang is nothing special and the full breakfast was worse than a Little Chef.  Bacon like old leather, fried bread was tasteless, baked beans in a sauce lacking in flavour.  Having stayed at the Rembrand and Hilton,  the Royal Garden is a distant third.",2,2016,01,16
133,Break,Staff ......  Very friendly .........   Very  professional ........... Nice hotel ......... Great location ..... would definitely return .. Only thing is the pillow and the mattress are not good at all and food also little bit expensive . ,5,2016,01,16

The location is ok l. Internet service is good but little bit expensive 

",4,2016,01,12
133,Best Hotel Experience without exception!,"We have now stayed several times at this hotel, both as a couple and as a family of four (2 boys under 11) and without exception I have never came across a team of staff who have way beyond and above the call of duty to make our stay spectacular! They have it just right from the smallest details to the biggest and everything in between!

Even from the booking experience they think of things I would normally not think to mention and it just makes you feel like you are a genuinely appreciated customer!

The saying 'you get what you pay for' is most definitely true here!! worth every penny!",5,2016,01,11
133,Best Hotel in London,"I have been fortunate enough to stay at some of the best hotels in the world and now the Royal Garden Hotel is on that list. Apart from the luxurious rooms and attentive staff tell me another hotel which is better positioned in London? Shopping, pubs, restaurants and as I had my family with me the park next door is like an extension of the hotel. Was sad to leave but will be back! ",5,2016,01,08
133,escellent place to stay,staff and service was excellent The location was also perrfect for my stay.  I have stayed at the Royal Garden in the past and would recommend it to all my friends for a perfect place to stay in London,5,2016,01,08
133,Efficient Organisation,"I was in the hotel for the holidays to begin the new year. I was impressed by the speedy to solve the little problems, which could happen during a staying at an hotel. In my specific case the very short time to solve the electric shock when I tried to charge my I-Phone.
Above all I was very impressed by the courtesy of all the staff (reception, concierge, room service, staff and waiters of the breakfast service).",5,2016,01,07
133,Great Hotel,"Warm staff, lovely and extremely well kept rooms.  The food offered and I only used Room Service in a pinch was wonderful.  As a set my expectations over and senior it is of the utmost importance to assure my accommodations are comfortable as well as located in an area that is accessible to what I wish to see,  This hotel met my expectations over and above.",5,2016,01,05
133,Weekend brake,"My wife and I stayed at the weekend and were impressed by the level of care and attention of the staff and the room was a very good standard, only wish we had asked for a park view! It was close to all the amenities we wished for and staff helped us with taxis etc. It was a wet weekend made more pleasant by the hotel. ",5,2016,01,05
133,A lovely hotel,A lovely place which ensures you feel well looked after.  Nice and quiet considering you are in the middle of London.  Lots of mirrors for the vain traveller and a good sized bedroom that ensures you feel comfortable.,5,2016,01,04
133,Superb!,"Superb! The room, service and restaurant were fantastic. They went out of their way to make our stay perfect including securing us a table at dinner with a perfect view of the London Eye for the fireworks on NYE!",5,2016,01,03
133,"Not really a 5 star hotel, or certainly don't act like one!","Outside staff don't open your car doors, offer to help with baggage, or even open the hotel doors. Trainee on check-in, so that took 15 mins. Then told wifi wasn't free for guests booking through booking.com. Why? We were the hotels guests, not guests of booking.com. We felt decidedly like second class citizens, but there was no way your man on the front desk was backing down on such a major policy initiative... Came back from a week in Dubai, at the Grand Hyatt before this, you're not exactly doing London proud Royal Garden Hotel. You should go over there and see how it should be done. The precious ¬£5 of wifi we were told it was hotel policy not to be given has ensured I'll never come back to you. So small minded and stingy. Not again my friends. ",2,2016,01,03
133,The staff are friendly and helpful,"I like this hotel ,excellent location to central London, Easy to go to anywhere in London, Good proximity to Kensington palace so we can excise every morning in the palace .Hardworking  staff ,comfortable rooms.",5,2016,01,03
133,"Fabulous 12 nights in December, the exceptional staff went above and beyond.","We stayed twice in December once for 5 nights and again for 7 and we just can't say enough.  The incredible staff in all positions especially housekeeping make this hotel so special.  The speed of service is something to be admired. Always spotlessly clean, and very well appointed our rooms had wonderful views. We've already booked again for spring.",5,2016,01,02
133,"Great location, excellent hotel","Stayed here for 3 nights between Christmas and new year. We had a king room but not a garden view.  We were very happy with the room, the view over Kensington rooftops was fine for us, we didn't spend too much time in our room. There is some traffic noise but that is to be expected in London, didn't keep us awake. Room was bigger than expected with a separate sitting area, a real bonus in London. Bed was huge and very comfy. Bathroom was excellent, huge walk-in shower and a bath.  All very modern and spotlessly clean. The room was cleaned every day and beds turned down on an evening and a bottle of water left by the bed, nice touch. 

We didn't eat here but did have a drink in the bar which to be honest I thought was lacking in atmosphere. Staff everywhere, however, were very friendly and helpful. 

Would definitely stay again. ",5,2016,01,02
133,Birthday visit,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay apart from the whistling window in our room which needs some attention. Bar staff unfriendly and over attentive. We felt we were being continually monitored. Restaurant staff excellent,4,2016,01,02
133,NEW YEAR! ,"Upon arrival we were greeted by various members off staff all of which were very polite and chatty.  We were made to feel very welcome and we were even escorted to our room so we didn't get lost!  

Entering the room it was a little smaller than that we expected but it was still a very nice room and we had an excellent view off Kensington and Hyde Park.  We also visited Bertie's bar located in the hotel and was pleasant and not too loud although fairly busy.  

My only real complaint in our entire stay was that the duvet was far too thin considering it was freezing cold outside and my wife was forced to sleep wearing a hotel dressing gown for the entire night.  

Would stay again as its in a brilliant location and as previously mentioned we thought the staff were excellent.  One in particular, her name was Bianca and she was a lovely lady with great customer skills.",4,2016,01,01
133,Poor Atmosphere,"I chose to stay in this hotel for two nights between Christmas and the New Year. 

The hotel is nicely situated on Kensington High Street and a stone's throw from the park if you want to go walking in the park. 

The rooms are well appointed, although in some respects a little old-fashioned. For example, I was surprised to find the temperature control device is organised to blast out cold air once the room is 21 degrees, making it very chilly if you leave the fan on, and stuffy if you don't. I was also let down by room service, which took nearly an hour to deliver a pizza.

I don't think the hotel was particularly busy, but I was surprised to find the main bar shut at 11, and the other bar on the mezzanine level had only one other person in it when I visited and he looked like the manager. In fact, the lack of atmosphere in the festive season was highly noticeable, and in total contrast to the Mondrian on the South Bank where I had stayed the week before. It was also considerably more expensive than the Mondrian.

If you want somewhere stylish, modern and fun there are better places to stay, better value.",3,2016,01,01
133,Cleanliness and comfort,"It is always a pleasure and enjoyable staying at the Royal Garden. The location and the view are the best!

133,Excellent Hotel,"I cannot fault this hotel. The staff, the accommodation and the food are of a very high standard.
There is a warmth and friendliness about the hotel.  We have stayed here before and will continue to do so whenever we are in London. We had a couple of health issues whilst there and the staff supported us magnificently.
I definitly reccommend this hotel.",5,2015,12,29
133,"Relaxing, comfortable and friendly stay over Christmas period.","We chose the Royal Garden because of its location, we travel to Richmond and Kempton Park over Christmas and the hotel is ideally situated. Staff are very friendly and helpful.
Rooms comfortable and well equipped.",5,2015,12,29
133,Feedback,"I had a great time staying at the Royal Garden hotel, the lacation is perfect for someboday who enjoys  walking in the park, cause the hotel is near to hayde park as well as for Shopping in Harrods. It is quite and safe to stay at this hotel.",5,2015,12,29

133,Great location and spacious.,Overall we really enjoyed our stay. Spacious accommodations for us. My only complaint was the initial room assignment was a bit disheveled and housekeeping wasn't consistent. Also pillows could be replaced as ours were very uncomfortable (flat). But the service was impeccable and staff was always friendly.,4,2015,12,26
133,Outstanding stay!!!,"My girlfriends 30th and when arriving there were chocolate and a happy 30th  chocolate piece which was a brilliant touch :) The gentleman that took us to the room was welcoming and very funny with it. In the morning breakfast was served to us by a very happy and helpful staff member, as my girlfriend is a vegetarian he suggested a side or of avocado that was superb. This hotel should be very happy with there staff they are outstanding!!!",5,2015,12,24
133,Lovely friendly clean and luxury hotel in Kensington,The location was convenient to tourist attractions and historical landmarks. The friendly warm staff exceeded our every expectation. The room was immaculate and well appointed and functional. The food offered a variety of choices beautifully prepared with attention to detail and delicious fresh ingredients. Highly recommend the English breakfasts. If we travel to London we will stay at the Royal garden hotel.,5,2015,12,24
133,I didn't realzie this was a 5 star hotel!!,"I stayed here in October for some industry awards, the main bar had been shut for some Rugby function going on so we had to have a drink in the restaurant, which wasn't the best atmosphere to be honest!! Breakfast was a funny set up, although we had included breakfast on the booking we had to pay an additional fee for a cooked breakfast which I found very unusual!!! I would stay here again but if you asked me to guess the star rating it wouldn't be 5 star.",4,2015,12,23
133,My top of the list choice when Londoning,"A very good and elegant place that I always come back to for its great location, service and friendly staff. high in cleanliness, warmth in atmosphere and lovely views and overlooking. basically, on of the best choices.",4,2015,12,23
133,Romanatic weekend,"Superb accommodation, friendly, knowledgeable and attentive staff. Excellent hotel which was spotless and great great breakfast. From the welcome at reception to the baggage collection on leaving, everything was perfect. Well done!",5,2015,12,23
133,Tradition,"I use to stay in this hotel every  year at the same  moment for many  years.
It is ideally located according me.
Walk a cross the parks to reach Picadilly is a pleasure

133,Eisa Al Marzouqi,"The royal garden hotel was one of my favourite hotels during my regular visit to the UK. The location is great. However on the last day of my stay u have requested for an extension and the receptionist told me on the phone sorry we are fully booked. the same minute I went online I found room type options available. I have complained but nothing was done and I was forced to stay in another hotel. I am frequent guest to the hotel and also known to many members of staff for my frequent visits. I expected both receptionist to walk the extra mile unfortunately they didn't. I was in London few days back and decided to stay somewhere else. However Alexander (reception) was really good with me, and I'm sure if he took the complain he would have dealt with it better.  ",4,2015,12,23
133,London's choice of the sporting and cultural ,"We visited as part of the Ashes tour and stayed at the hotel with the Australian team. Staff were absolutely fantastic ... The hotel has the best Chinese restaurant in all of London ... And the breakfast choice means you don't need lunch. 

Rooms are really nice and spacious by European standards, with the sitting area really adding to the rooms feel. 

So close to everything in Kensington ... Just great!!!",5,2015,12,23
133,My Always Place in London,"The Royal Garden Hotel is a handsome building in a fashionable central London location.  The settings besides Kensington Palace & gardens is stunning, particularly when viewed from the 10th floors. The rooms are extremely comfortable, the food is good & the staff are straightforward and helpful. I can unreservedly recommend the RGH to anyone planning to visit London.",5,2015,12,22
133,5 star food and service at the Terrace restaurant at very reasonable prices,"A 3 course lunch at a 5 star hotel in Kensington, London for ¬£20??? Unbelievable but true!!! What a pleasant surprise this was! From the minute we walked into the plush foyer of this centrally placed hotel, to the friendly welcome of the serving staff, we knew we were in for a treat. Starters of breast of pigeon on a bed of puy lentils with pancetta, and curried fish cakes with salad and a creamy jus were tasty and well presented. Main courses of minute steak with red cabbage and potato cake, and turkey roulade stuffed with apricot and sausage meat, roast potatoes and sprouts were beautifully done and again very tasty. Dessert of chocolate mousse with raspberry flapjack and coulis, and sticky toffee pudding with Cornish icecream finished off our meal beautifully. Special mention must go to Paolo the chef for his innovative and well-constructed dishes and to Marco and Zoltan for their friendly, attentive service. We will definitely return!!",5,2015,12,22
133,london visit,"Excellent hotel, great position next to the parks, yet easy to get to areas of interest  around London. Staff and facilities all you would need and high standard. Bus stop directly outside the hotel with an Oyster card and the help of the london city apps it is cheap and easy to see the capital.",5,2015,12,22
133,So called 5 star hotel but in fact only worth 3 or 4 star tops,"+ : very friendly staff, clean room and bathroom, complimentary bottle of water & newspaper, turndown service.
- : small and dated (queen) room (in dire need of a restyling), NO FREE WIFI (hello, it's 2016 !!!), expensive room service / breakfast.",3,2015,12,22
133,Royal Garden Hotel London - Great Service,"Having, over the years stayed in many top quality hotels I can say in all honesty this one has been the best overall. The staff were superb in every way and our only issue, noise from inconsiderate next door guests, was dealt with quickly, efficiently and to our satisfaction. 
The food was excellent, options at breakfast were overwhelming. The rooms were quite adequate for our stay of four days. 
My only minus point would be having to pay for wifi, most unusual.
Would I return? Yes, without any hesitation.",5,2015,12,21
133,Theatre trip over night stay,"Excellent service at reception on arrival. Service in the restaurant and Berties Bar just as good. Breakfast food quality exceptional. Thank you for an excellent stay.
I think I have said it all now and will certainly recommend the Hotel to others.",5,2015,12,21
133,Not worth the money.,"If you compare this hotel to, for example, a Marriott, the Royal Garden falls short on all counts. It's a place where it's hard to get a cup of coffee! Coffee in the room is instant powder! Room service is likely to bring hot food that is cold!  I tried to dine at the Chinese restaurant (which was fairly empty), and wanted to sit in the lounge but they wouldn't let me order from the dinner menu saying it was a 'policy' that I have to sit by myself in an empty formal dining room. I left.  I tried to charge my phone in the wall's USB port, it didn't work so they sent up technical support who declared ""those don't work.""  When I suggested ""why not just put up a little sign saying they don't work?"" he looked like that was something from Mars. When I checked in, they gave me the wifi password and said ""just open a browser and follow the prompts.""  Turns out that's not the case at all, you have to specifically not follow the prompts but, instead, click the word ""voucher"" and enter the password.  Spent a lot of time and frustration right after check in on this one.

Back to the coffee, when leaving and my taxi waiting, I said to the staff it's a little weird that I can't get or even buy a coffee, and the concierge (who was the only excellent staff there) nicely called down to the kitchen asking for a coffee.  They were resisting him (too early in the morning, how do we bill a guest who's already checked out) until he finally said ""just bring me some coffee""!  

They brought coffee in a pot and ceramic cup...he had to go back and put it in a take-away cup.  I finally got into my cab, sat back, took a sip, it wasn't instant but it wasn't far off and it wasn't hot...and that is the story of the Royal Garden.  It needs management to focus on the customer experience, not adherence to old rules and policies.",1,2015,12,19
133,Awards evening,"Recently attended an Awards evening at the Royal Garden Hotel and had a fantastic night. While we didn't get the chance to eat in the main restuarant, the quality of the food and service in the function room (circa 300 people) was excellent. Staff were attentive and helpful and the venue facilities were all you could hope for.",4,2015,12,18
133,Queen bedroom,"The room was small and not as expected, different than the pictures on the website. 
Location is perfect. The staff was very friendly and I would come back again. 
Bus stop is just in front of the hotel ",3,2015,12,18
133,Work Christmas party,"I was fortunate enough to attend my works Christmas party that was hosted by the staff at this hotel. 

A very friendly welcome and checking was speedy and efficient. 

The room wasn't big but it fitted our requirements. 

Great location and concierge and door personnel who are constantly ensuring that you are OK. 

The car park is a little tight but this is a hotel that has parking which in London is a luxury. 

Thoroughly enjoyed the stay. ",5,2015,12,17
133,Six years staying at the Royal Garden Hotel,"I have been staying in this hotel for the past six years. I feel it's like home and like everything about the hotel the friendliness of the staff and efficiency and help, and room service is excellent  ",5,2015,12,16

I would recommend this hotel as location is excellent and staff are very helpful. Kind regards and merry Xmas.",5,2015,12,15
133,Fairly typical,"Pretty much as you would expect. Rooms are a decent size for London and nicely furnished, very noisy on the road side so get a park view if you want any sleep and if you don't have a breakfast included in the room rate they will try and rip you off so suggest eating out! Kensington has about 1000 places to choose to have breakfast in. An average 
London hotel, nothing wrong with it really but nothing special.",3,2015,12,15
133,Didn't feel welcome,"Location was excellent for our needs (Royal Albert Hall)' but I feel that as we arrived carrying backpacks I/o designer luggage, we were not the most desirable of guests!  We had walked a few blocks carrying said bags, entered reception, dropped bags to check in, when the security guy questioned the bags!  Had he been watching he would have seen us.  Room was average for the price.  I'm sure there's better value around ",3,2015,12,15
133,Wonderful stay,"Will be back üëç Couldn't do enough for you. Happy with the overall service. Location was brilliant room was clean and lovely view of the park and the palace.

133,Friendly hotel,"Was with friend for night in London came across the hotel on a wander booked looked impressive not that expensive compared to some, staff extremely friendly and helpful, only thing I can fault it for was the ¬£25 breakfast ",5,2015,12,14
133,Great value and hospitality,Received a very professional and warm welcome. Service throughout stay was of the highest caliber. Staff were gracious and willing to go the extra mile. Room was very nicely appointed with rich fabrics etc. Cost would have been a good deal at a 3 star but was a bargain for this 5 star. ,5,2015,12,14
133,Good location,"Check in and check out staff were extremely friendly, however your concierge were very rude. The room was extremely tiny. Positives were the bed was comfortable and good location. Central to tourist attractions. ",4,2015,12,13
133,Great Hotel,"Great Hotel and location with the best views in London from Garden rooms. 
I often stay at the Royal Garden as it is a friendly modern five star hotel next to Kensington Palace and Hyde Park located on the High Street near tube station shops and restaurants. ",5,2015,12,12
133,How on earth did you get such a good score?,"We ordered a room with a view overlooking the garden and the city and not the alley. And when you are 183cm why would you get a handicap room with a sink that reaches you to your knees. And we have to pay for wifi?! 

This is the first and last time at this hotel.

If you are in the mood to get dissatisfied and all around disappointed, this is definitely the place. 

And if you are hungry, don't go to the hotel restaurant, unless you like to wait as long as possible for the food and service. The only waiter looking at us was a sweet girl who worked harder than all the others together. And I say looked at us, because the man who was taking our order was more interested in looking at another table. Would have given tip, but the girl had to share it so I just didn't feel like it.

Now I'm going to sit back, relax and enjoy my view... No wait I'm going to enjoy the alley. 

",1,2015,12,11
133,The most fabulous location!,"I cannot come up with one reason why this hotel would not get an excellent rating. It was in a beautiful location, next door to Kensington Palace and it's beautiful Gardens. It is modern, clean, the food is great and the staff is over and above expectations.
We will return!
I suggest walking in the neighborhood, as the shops and people are lovely!
You do have to pay for wifi, unless you book directly through the hotel.",5,2015,12,11
133,Really good hotel,"I booked the hotel for one night. I arrived at 8:00am and wished to leave my suitcase. I was told that a room was already available and I was also offered an upgrade. 
The room was nice, in immaculate condition and well equipped. Breakfast was good, although part of it is served through waiters and I had to wait for about 12-15 min in order to get my omelette. The price I paid for a room in London was more than reasonable. I may also remind the exceptional location of this hotel at the edge of Kensington Gardens and 200 yards from the High Street Ken station. 
",5,2015,12,10
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"Good place to stay.  Good location for shopping, sight seeing, strolling through the royal gardens.  Staff friendly.  Room above average with nice bath, shower, bed, table usable or working.  Easy access to restaurants.",4,2015,12,09
133,British Music Hall Society Annual Ball,"The beds were extremely comfortable and a decent size shower and bath.  Disappointed that there were no bathrobes for our use.   We found the coffee/tea tray difficult to lift as it was in the bottom of the cupboard and was rather heavy (for a disabled or elderly person).
However, having said that, we would definitely stay there again because, for me, the comfort of the beds and the size of the bathroom are what make it a pleasure to stay at this hotel.",4,2015,12,09
133,Royal Garden - Excellence,"Fantastic experience at hotel.  nicely located.  Walking distance to a park, Harrods, and other local favorites.  A cab was always available.  Staff extremely helpful and quick to offer advice.  I really have no complaints but if pressed I would say the carpet in our room really is stained somehow and should be replaced or deep cleaned.    ",5,2015,12,09
133,"Good hotel, but...","* The wifi should be free of charge for a five star hotel, also when you book the room via travel sites
* Quite much noice from the road during the nights

Everything else was very good like; concierge, service, location, cleanliness etc.",4,2015,12,09
133,Impressive,"Lovely hotel, spacious, and very clean.  The breakfast staff were excellent, very attentive and the cooked food was perfect!
The door staff were more interested in those that appeared to arrive in expensive cars than those that came via the car park.  They must have been the larger tippers!  Not once did they acknowledge me, even turning round when I approached.
The entrance to NCP car park underneath is very narrow and scary to get into as it winds its way down, but once there its very good and secure.  I lost my ticket but the guy on duty there was really helpful.",5,2015,12,09
133,Disappointing,"Usually our hotel of choice when coming to London. After many trips previous our expectations of excellent service and fine food were high, however the reality this time was far from enjoyable.
Check in was made impossible by a staff member who had a clear problem with English as his first language, the communication was strained, cumbersome ans awkward, not what you want when you first arrive. I was presented with two tickets for the palace, when i enquired what they were for i was told that they were entry tickets to the restaurant for afternoon tea the following day, i questioned why they had ""Kensignton Palace"" written on them i was assured they were for the restaurant. 
So, finally booked in we were escorted to the first of our rooms, we booked two. The first room was great and up to the usual high standard, however it took another two and a half hours waiting for the second room to be ready, ruining our afternoon and setting us back in getting ready for the theatre that night.
Our room subsequently was missing tea/coffee and milk so no drinks available there, we decided while we were waiting for the other room to be ready we would go to the bar, imagine it, going to a restaurant bar in the middle of the day to be told NO you cannot come in because we are busy serving afternoon teas !!! REALLY !!
So back to our half finished room, eventually other room became available, we quickly made ourselves ready and left for the west end.

The following morning, breakfast was, as always, brilliant, they really know how to do breakfast at this hotel, it was a real pleasure. Afternoon tea was next on the list, we presented our tickets as instructed the previous day, to be told that these were in fact entry tickets to the palace !! they had nothing to do with the restaurant....... and it was now too late to go to the palace..... BLOODY FURIOUS !
Afternoon tea would have been a joy had it not been for the attention of the hotel manager trying to offer apologies for her staff, then the final insult.... here is a gold card, i have credited it with ¬£50 to use against your next room reservation............. BLOOD BOILING NOW.... I have just spent ¬£1500 for two nights and you think ¬£50 is anywhere near a reasonable gesture of apology.
Luckily London was a big enough distraction this time, but when we returned to the hotel that night it was the icing on the cake...... TV broken, turn down service only on one side of the room ? WHY ??? no replenishment of tea/coffee/water.",2,2015,12,08
133,Luxury stay,Wonderful parkside location in Kensington. We stayed here overnight whilst attending Statoil Tennis Masters at the Albert Hall. I would highly recommend this hotel. Room service was excellent and and staff very helpful.,5,2015,12,08
133,Work Christmas Party,Stayed here last weekend for our work Christmas Party. The rooms where very spacious and clean. The bathroom was brilliant! Large bathtub and also an equally large walk-in shower with overhead shower. Would definitely visit here again,4,2015,12,08

133,She said YES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I've just come back from a amazing stay at this hotel and can't thank the staff enough for making my proposal to my girlfriend so perfect. They arranged afternoon tea in our suite plus champagne and chocolates . we came back from visiting winter wonderland to find bottles of water by our bed , radio on , lights dimmed and beds turned down, to top the weekend off we had breakfast laid out on our table in our room which was fantastic. all of the staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough to make our stay so wonderful.
thank you guys",5,2015,12,07

133,Coming home,"Great hotel, great location. Super friendly staff and always very well taking care of me. It's a hotel where a solo female traveler doesn't feel uncomfortable having dinner alone. F&B is very good too, especially the Chinese restaurant on the roof top with a fabulous view over London.",5,2015,12,07
133,Comfortable stay in a good hotel,"Stayed there for one night on business in a standard double room. Unfortunately they had no upgrades available when I checked in but to be honest when I got to the room it was fairly big and had a nice bathroom. 

I didn't eat at the hotel but had drinks in the bar which was great.

133,"Convenient Location, Nice Hotel","Overall, great hotel in a great location.  

I'd caution that the budget rooms are ""budget"" - not quite what is shown on the website, but they are clean, the beds are comfortable and they are perfectly fine (just a bit small with cheap furniture).   For the cheaper price, I thought it was a great hotel and would recommend.  

Also, it's 2015, wifi should be free.",4,2015,12,06
133,Luxurious days in London,"The staff is very kind and helpful, the position in London / behind Hyde Park very central, the room was good with a beautiful view above Hyde Park. Everything was organized as planned from the hotel staff. Thank you!",5,2015,12,06
133,Classy but not snooty,We keep coming back to this hotel because it's classy without being snooty.  We like the attitude of staff and the interior is very nicely designed without being over-the-top.  We like the location - the station isn't too far away and the local shops are okay.,4,2015,12,06
133,Ok Hotel,"Charges for Wifi! The hotel are like the old London still in a time warp that doesn't exist anymore. But it is clean and the beds are perfect so you will have a good stay, but charge for wifi 2015 strange. ",3,2015,12,06
133,Great location and quiet rooms,"The rooms vary in size, the executive ones are very nice, the budget ones not that large but they are quiet and the beds comfortable. Quite nice but try to avoid parking your car in the garage, the price will be only slightly shy from your room price.",4,2015,12,05
133,Less than 24 hrs in London,"Easy hotel to stay in for business or long weekend. I love being able to go for a walk/run in the park. Staff is super helpful and friendly before, during and after our stay. Convenient to get to LHR and access to various shopping areas. Will definitely continue to come back. ",4,2015,12,05
133,Amazing,"Nice s√©jour in a best venue . But the room was too small for rugbymen . The best place in town .RWC ENGLAND 2015 was a great time in a great place and all facilities were done to be easy. I will return  in this hotel for my next trip in London in 6 months.

133,Fab,What can I say ..fab this hotel was in an area where I would like to buy the breakfast was ok and the rooms were quite a decent size would stay here again and I would recommend it to friends and family,4,2015,12,03
133,Fantastic location being so convenient,This Hotel its location and very helpful staff proved to be just perfect in every way and would have no hesitation to return for a longer stay. Whilst being right in the heart of South Kensington once you enter it is offers peace tranquility. The bedrooms are spacious with mine having views Park being a delight in every respect.  Very well appointed throughout and the breakfast to suit everyone's palate,4,2015,12,03
133,"Great central (but quiet) location, nice rooms, excellent room service","We stayed in an Executive Suite for 7 nights, as we had our 9 year old with us.  The Suite was well situated for the pull out sofa-bed for our son, and the hotel provided an activity backpack for him at check in.  They also have scooters to borrow, which was great fun in the park that backs on the hotel.  The hotel was graceful and quiet, all the lobby could get a bit busy as there was a wedding in for part of the weekend, and several corporate meetings in the evenings during the week.  The room service was DELICIOUS and served quickly (with a availed-upon request to bring the ice cream up 20 minutes after dinner was served.)  They have an extensive middle-Eastern menu for room service, and provide congee at breakfast, which speaks to the very global clientele.  My only complaint is that, as we booked 7 nights, even thought I called to request a higher floor with a view, we were still placed on the first floor.  I find this not uncommon - longer stays get worse rooms (freeing up nicer views for several guests over time.)  I don't think a phones request would help, because I tried both early phone call and reconfirmation, but no luck.  Still nice back corner view of the street (never any cars, I imagine it may be guarded) then mossy wall with trees.)",5,2015,12,03
133,New bride,"The atmosphere at the hotel was excellent, a buzzing foyer, with receptionist able to deal efficiently with each customer and with a smile! Flowers were beautiful. I would just love to have a repeat performance!",5,2015,12,02
133,Best Hotel in London,"I have to say I've never stayed at such a wonderful hotel.   It's right off the park and centrally located to many thing.   The staff are amazing, the facility is amazing, and the view I had was amazing.   I can't wait to return for another stay!",5,2015,12,02
133,Great weekend stay,The room was excellent - from the quality of the soft furnishings and appointmnet of the room - great! The gym was spotless and well-maintained. Breakfast provided a quality choice of both hot and cold treats! A short walk to Kensington High Street tube- perfect location for a London weekend trip!,5,2015,12,02
133,Celebration lunch,"Didn't stay here only had lunch, absolutely lovely food, excellent service and a lovely atmosphere.
We were greeted very warmly, our wet coats and umbrellas put in the cloakroom, I would certainly go again.",5,2015,12,02
133,Great place to stay in London,"Upscale modern hotel in a great location, overlooking Kensington Gardens and Palace. A 5 minute walk to the Kensington High Street tube station. The room was terrific! The staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was very good.",5,2015,12,01
133,Good Hotel. Good Stay,Stayed over for a Celebration Meal. My View was not great...but the frosted glass half obscured the large outside aircon ducts   Room104. I was very tired so the lack of view did not concern me too much,4,2015,12,01
133,Well located - modern,"Spent time in November. Very good experience overall, from front desk, concierge to the size and appointment of the rooms. Excellent location. Only disappointment was the poor quality of the marttress.",4,2015,12,01
133,Excellent service with very friendly staff,"We were welcomed with a friendly smile she even showed us our room, the room was clean and tidy and very spacious.the hotel was very clean and up together. We would recommend and would stay here again.",5,2015,12,01
133,Great Hotel and so well located,"Would not hesitate to recommend as the place to stay in London. We will be returning in April.
The Hotel is so well positioned to Kensington gardens and Local Restaurants.The Staff are excellent and will assist in every way.",4,2015,12,01
133,Yet another excellent reason why we always stay Royal Garden Hotel - a truly unique location against terrorist threats.,"Here are three excellent reasons why we always stay at the Royal Garden Hotel-

1) The Royal Garden  Hotel must be one of the safest places in the whole of London at this worrying time of terrorist threats; enjoying the truly unique neighbourly benefits of the special high security of Kensington Palace on the one side and the further high security on the other, guarding the major international embassies.

2) The many younger staff of the hotel are a shining light of hope in this world of ours, following the excellent example of their management of going out of their way to provide such a welcoming and caring service.

3)  Value for Money at their Park Terrace Restaurant - where else in such a desirable Central London location can you find a such a high quality 3 course silver service luncheon for ¬£20?   Yes ¬£20!

There are many other such reasons why we  wish to thank all of the staff for continuing to look after us so very, very well",5,2015,12,01
133,Hotel trip Nov 15,We stayed at this hotel before going to the Royal British Legion Festival Of Remembrance. The view from our room looked over Kensington Palace. We booked a meal at the Chinese restaurant on the 10th floor. It was the best Chinese food I have ever had and we will definitely be returning.,5,2015,12,01
133,Weekend trip to London,We had a great stay at this hotel.  We had an Executive  suite with a view of Hyde park.  We were 3 people staying in the room.  Large rooms and very comfortable.  Bathrobe and slippers.  Hugh bathroom.  Close to the underground station.,4,2015,12,01
133,Enjoyable stay at the Royal Garden Hotel.,"Room was excellent, two ladies sharing and room to separate twin beds to give some privacy.  Bathroom was very large and excellent facilities.  Did not have breakfast as rather expensive.  Used the bar which was very good and staff very friendly.
Would definitely stay again.",5,2015,12,01
133,London Late Booking,Having just arrived at Victoria Station and needing overnight accommodation rang this hotel  as we had stayed before.A room was available and an email confirmation was received before reaching the hotel.On arrival the staff were very friendly and most helpful and we were offered an upgrade to one of the best rooms overlooking the Gardens. We will certainly  wish to use the excellent facilities again especially if attending an event at Albert Hall which is an easy walk.,5,2015,12,01
133,A very good stay,Great convenient place to get around the city with comfortable rooms and quality staff. Room rates per day are not cheap however and there are other options at a much lower cost. I stayed there twice over a period of about a month and a half. ,4,2015,12,01
133,Excellent Hotel,"After all my visits to London I must say I have finally found my favorite London hotel.  The rooms are beautiful, the staff is incredibly friendly and the gym is fantastic.  The location is a little off the beaten path which was a wonderful experience.",5,2015,12,01
133,Short but perfect,"This is a great hotel, we had a view of Kensington Palace and gardens which was just perfect. Everyone is friendly and helpful, the rooms whilst compact are well furnished and spotless. Great location for getting around town with good shopping & restaurants right in the doorstep.",5,2015,12,01
133,Great atmosphere,"Wonderful location comfortable room and nice staff. Bar food was the only let down, it arrived cold and therefore was unappealing. The bar was quite busy as it was the evening of the royal variety show but still no excuse for cold food. It wouldn't put me off going again but would be great to see improvement in this area. ",4,2015,12,01
133,"Very happy customer, will return again","Great hotel, i have stayed many times before and will continue to do so. Centrally based and the hotel staff cannot do enough for you. I thoroughly recommend the Min Jiang restaurant on the 10th floor, the views and food are amazing.",5,2015,12,01
133,Very comfortable room.  Polite and welcoming staff,"The hotel was a venue for an award ceremony which we attended.  The service was excellent at all times.
Our room was quiet and we weren't disturbed by other guests.
Although we didn't go to Bertie's Bar after the event, we did here that a good time was had by all who went.",4,2015,12,01
133,Stevan Ilija≈°eviƒá,"I really enjoy at my staying in hotel. It was memorable experiance. Room was very good, bed is grat to sleep. Service is really awsome and friendly. Location o Hotel is huge adventage because it is very close to sity center. ",5,2015,12,01
133,Great location...get a garden view room,"Overall, it was a lovely stay, although not the best looking building from the outside, there are great views in the garden rooms. Staff were lovely. Would definitely stay here again for the convenient location and garden room.",4,2015,12,01
133,Very |Good experience,"Apart from a mistaken service call at 5.30am (It was to the wrong room!) we enjoyed our stay and would use the hotel again, The hotel did give us a discount on our bill to apologise for the error. Having a car park under the hotel is an advantage",4,2015,12,01
133,A wonderful global first class hotel !,"I stayed in the hotel all of October . The staff were among some of the most professional but friendly and approachable I've encountered anywhere in the world , from the check in desk , concierge service , restaurant staff ,business facility, room attendance and room service and especially those staff on breakfast . Whenever I had any problem or queries it was attended to promptly . I would recommend it equally to business and leisure travellers . Just first class .   ",5,2015,12,01
133,Brilliant experience,"We stayed in the hotel in October and could not have had a better experience. The staff were wonderful, the food delicious and the rooms excellent . Many, many thanks for a wonderful stay. We are recommending you to everyone we mee.",5,2015,12,01
133,What a Pleasure,"As usual the royal Garden team, was exceeding expectations. Great room with a fantastic view and with staff that bend over backwards to meet your needs. It's a sheer pleasure to have such a great place to stay in cental London.",5,2015,12,01
133,Home from home,"A lovely hotel in a great location where the staff make you feel very welcome and nothing is too much trouble.  The restaurants and bar offers choice of cuisine, style and cost and for a location in a bustling area there is a calm in the hotel and quietness in the guest rooms.",5,2015,12,01
133,Long Weekend Away,This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in when visiting London. Everything was excellent from room to services. This will be the only hotel I stay in from now one when in London. Super Long Weekend,5,2015,12,01
133,London at its best.,"If you want a proper 5* Hotel, at sensible rates, with excellent facilities, staff and travel links, stay here. This hotel cannot be faulted on any level. A wonderful London experience not to be missed. ",5,2015,12,01
133,Royal Garden,"Had a very warm welcome and check in was effortless. Room was very comfortable,great. bathroom, comfortable bed.had early dinner as going to theatre and it was very good, service a little slow ,but once we explained we needed to be prompt it was soon dealt with.
Check,out was just a sufficient as check in. All in all  a very pleasant experience.",4,2015,12,01
133,top location,excellent location and great service from start to finish. The food is very good especially the made to order omelettes in the morning and staff are very attentive. Rooms are good although   a little on the small side but functional enough,5,2015,12,01
133,Home from home,"This is my 10th year at the Royal Garden. The staff are just like a family. 
It's located in one of the best parts of London. 
I stay at the Royal Garden almost every week travelling down from Yorkshire.  The Royal Garden has undergone various Renovation programmes improving the facilities all the time.

133,Recommended hotel,Location excellenct comfy i liked it only the house keeping didn't satisfy me but after I complained it was ok   Unfortunately they don't have loyalty card or membership. I would visit again if they gave me good prices or upgrade me because it's expensive hotel,5,2015,12,01
133,Comfortable and well located,"Although their special offers are not as special as they used to be, generally putting it outside my budget, this is a very comfortable hotel. The Chinese restaurant is one of the best in London and the breakfast staff are outstanding. Some rooms are getting a bit tired and the linen is not as super smooth as it used to be but it is still my hotel of choice on their side of town. Be warned though, they continue to charge guests a hefty fee for a seriously weak internet service if they book online or through an agent.

133,A Bed Too Far,"My wife and I stayed here 20th November in a room costing ¬£280/night. Hoping for a wow factor weekend away but left bitterly disappointed by the lack of attention to detail, mainly in our bedroom.
On the surface, everything looks and feels as you would expect, however, spending a night there proved differently.
I won't go on with poetic prose but to the point.
(I) Pillows way too soft (ii) bath plug that wouldn't lift out (iii) two mattresses pushed together but at different heights (iv) noisy A/C
In all, we've had better nights at chain hotels. The staff are very attentive though.
Have to say, we wouldn't stay again.",3,2015,11,27
133,Wonderfully convenient great hotel!,"We have stayed here on many occasions in years past. The hotel is beautifully situated to central London and of course the park borders it. The rooms are really comfortable and well fitted out and we always feel very good staying here.
The concierge desk s great and they really do perform miracles in getting one reservations at the impossible to get restaurants in London. At absolutely every restaurant we requested they got us a reservation. Not a single disappointment! ",4,2015,11,27
133,Comfortable hotel in an excellent location,"This hotel is a high class hotel within a reasonable price especially for London. It is located in High Street Kensington, perhaps 200m away from the tube station. It is also next to Kensington gardens. The rooms are specious and perfect for both leisure and work. Hotel is clean and staff are professional.",5,2015,11,25
133,Excellent hotel very good restaurant.,"Excellent 5 star hotel in a great location. Our room overlooking the Kensington gardens was very comfortable.The staff were all excellent, friendly, very helpful and efficient.
Special mention to Charli at reception who made us so welcome.

On the downside WiFi is changed at ¬£20.00 per day. First time I have paid for WiFi in at least 10 years !!",4,2015,11,24
133,Just Wonderfull at The Park Terrace,Lunch here is the best value anywhere in the country let alone London. The food is also just lovely with seasonal produce at its best and OMG the puddings. The service as you would expect in a five star establishment was faultless. I cannot say a bad thing about this restaurant.,5,2015,11,23
133,Good five star hotel,Good five star hotel in excellent location overlooking Kensington gardens. It is as described: luxurious but very expensive. Staff are all helpful and friendly .good selection of restaurants near by and all the London sites within easy access. Only compliant was that it was extremely noisy . The maids were constantly banging and crashing outside our room from mid afternoon to early evening and then again from early morning. And cant get away from the noise of the road.,3,2015,11,23
133,Location ,"Lovely place, clean, friendly staff. View was great over Kensington Palace, quite room. Breakfast was fantastic, fresh and you could eat loads. Location good for most places to visit in London. We walked loads.",5,2015,11,22
133,Not Tourist Friendly,"While staying at the Royal Garden Hotel, our charge card number was compromised and quickly terminated by our charge card provider. As a result of this incident, our charge card provider attempted several times during our stay to guarantee payment of our hotel bill as we were without a charge card by which to reconcile our hotel invoice. The hotel refused to accept guaranteed payment by our charge card provider, after the charge card company explained the situation we were in. Keeping in mind that our charge card provider is a world-wide provider of financial services and instruments, the hotel decided they wanted payment in cash or by using another form of payment. Our charge card provider was forced to wire us cash to a banking institution in London. We were forced to race across the city, obtain the cash, return to the hotel, and pay the hotel invoice. I've never stayed at a property that would not accommodate its guests in such a situation. Very poor service for a 5-Star venue.",2,2015,11,20
133,Pleasant over night stay,"My Partner and I stayed for one night as a Birthday/xmas shopping trip so the underground car park (although pricey at ¬£36 per 24hr) was handy for dropping bags off after a long days spending. The room was nice but despite booking for two I was informed the Queen sized room was predominantly for single occupancy so extra towels would duly be delivered. The extra towels arrived and the room size for two was fine, overlooking Regents Park which was nice along with a well equipped clean bathroom and the usual facilities - including a good air con which actually did what I programmed it to!. We made use of the bar for cocktails upon our return that night which was welcoming but when arriving at the room we found that the turn down maid had removed the aforementioned extra towels. A small blip on an otherwise pleasant stay and a Hotel I would happily frequent in the future.",4,2015,11,20
133,A FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE .,"My wife Christine and I stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel last week-end as part of ours and the Hotels 50 th anniversary celebrations and we were overwhelmed at the fantastic standards and service offered by this unique idyllic Hotel. We were greeted by Daniel the head doorman who organised a porter to take our luggage from the car to reception Daniel then offered to park my Mercedes in the underground secure car park. At reception we were checked in by Adrian who was excellent in every way explaining in every detail what we needed to know at that time one of the management team Martin Myers introduced himself , a charming bubbly guy who was a true professional . Adrian took us to our suite on the third floor where we drew a deep breath at the fantastic park Suite location overlooking the park and gardens, in my opinion the finest hotel room view in London.
Not long after entering our suite we were greeted by the lovely room service duo of Nora and her colleague Romero, they bought our celebration champagne chocolates fruit and flowers and were so friendly and yet oh so professional , both a real credit to both the hotel and management team. 
Our meal on Saturday night was in the Min Jiang Chinese Restaurant on the 10 th floor this I would recommend as a must do for anyone who visits the hotel.
Breakfast on Sunday in the Park terrace was superb for us as their was an excellent buffet that caters for everybody. Our meal on Sunday night was also in the park Restaurant and this was also magnificent 10 /10 we we looked after and served by Salvador and his charming assistant the lovely Sonia. 
We left Monday morning after so much good feeling about our experience as it was a very special journey for my wife of 50 years and I as this is where we met in the early 1960s whilst I was working on the construction of the hotel and my now wife Christine worked nearby and we met one lunchtime whilst strolling around the park and gardens so this hotel is a fantastic icon for us particularly for the fantastic standards and friendliness of ALL the management and staff. I would highly recommend you give this unique establishment a visit for yourselves as it is first class.
Upon checking out we met the Hotel Assistant manager Mark Anderson a very charismatic eloquent guy who live and breathes the hotel ethos, a true gentleman. I am so looking forward to returning to the Hotel again soon and I will be there on 29 th July next year to celebrating England's world cup win from 1966 when they held their reception at the Hotel and came out onto the Hotel balcony overlooking Kensington High Street to receive a standing ovation from all of us who had sang their way up from dancing in the fountains at Trafalgar Square to cheering our Heroes and thanking them , I was a young 19 year old football mad Londoner at the time and that is an experience that I shall take to my grave.
Thank you all at the Royal Garden Hotel. We shall be back.",5,2015,11,19
133,"Royal Garden Hotel, South Kensington ","I've probably stayed at the Royal Garden at least a dozen times over the past three years. It's a good location for Kensington, but about 20 mins from the centre of town by tube. You can easily reach it from South Kensington tube station. There's also a very good under ground car park, run by NCP, which is secure and costs ¬£35 per 24 hours. 

As you arrive at the hotel you'll probably see numerous Lamborghinis or Bugatti Veyron's parked in the valet parking bays just outside. A good indicator that this is a top quality hotel. It's a popular venue for celebs and sports teams to stay at too, on my last visit the all blacks were staying there and they happily mingled with guests. 

Staff are always first class as you check in and as a repeat visitor I would occasionally get a free room upgrade, if one was available. All of the rooms are great, with rear facing rooms having views over Kensington palace. There is everything you'd expect in the rooms, flat screen TV with high end multi media connections built into the desk, a decent size wardrobe, a safe, complimentary toiletries and slippers. The beds are very comfortable too. 

The bar is a great place to dine, have a drink and watch TV. The guys that run the bar are attentive and polite. The food is very good and the prices are very reasonable too. ",5,2015,11,19
133,Outstanding place to stay,I was surprised to find out this hotel was fifty years old. It wears its age very well indeed. The impression is of great comfort. The luggage was taken and delivered to the room. The reception (Tyrone) was very efficient and polite. The room had a splendid view over Kensington Gardens and the bathroom was immaculately clean. I was very impressed by the hotel and my only complaint is I was not staying longer! I will be very pleased to return to this hotel.,5,2015,11,18
133,"Great hotel, cheap mindset","The hotel is a very good place to stay. Everything is neat and the staff is pleasant. They have a full bar and a great chinese restaurant in the rooptop.
BUT, in my opinion, to charge for the wi fi connection in the year 2015 is just so narrow minded that, for me, it ruined my stay. It feels like a mere detail, but for me it is the attitude that counts. I asked the front desk about it and it is ""only because I booked with Booking.com"". To make a few more bucks out of it (20 pounds for 24h wifi) is just cheap.",3,2015,11,17
133,Lunch Visit,A return visit to the ground floor restaurant this time for lunch as we had dinner there on my last visit to London . It is quite simply superb. The food and service is first class and very reasonable. Shame it's 200 miles away from me !! However it will certainly be top of my list for eating out next time I am back in the city. Can't fault it . A special thank you to the young Italian trainee who looked after us so well during our visit. Apologies I can't remember his name !!,5,2015,11,17
133,Very nice stay breakfast underwhelming,"Everything was great until it came to breakfast.

First impression was there was too many chiefs and not enough Indians at breakfast.

Plenty of supervising which meant that the clearing of the tables and the ordering was chaotic to say the least we ordered a pot of tea which we had to ask  for three times and brown toast and then white arrived. 
 The room was adequate and clean the bedroom wasn't the best I've slept in the comfort wise.
Very good location 
Nice views of Kensington Palace
Reception especially Felicity were very efficient.

133,Afternoon tea 10/11/2015,"After a promising start, where we were offered a selection of afternoon tea to suit our taste, things went quickly downhill.

Having made our selection, we were served our tea, plus a selection of sandwiches.

The waitress came to the table, and although I had mentioned when booking, that I was a vegetarian, said that most of the cakes contained Gelatine.  Fortunate then, that I do not have a sweet tooth.

Fifty minutes later, we were sitting with a pot of cold tea each, and no communication as to when the scones and cakes would arrive.

When they did, there were scones, a thin slice of chocolate cake and a thin slice of lemon drizzle cake, divided in half, and four very small cakes.

The scones were lovely, although plain and small, and as for the cakes, we asked for a box and took them home, the magic of the occasion having by this time, passed.",2,2015,11,14
133,Memorable Experience,"This is truly an outstanding hotel.
Excellently situated at one end of Kensington High Street a stones throw from Kensington Palace and a few minutes walk to The Royal Albert Hall.
The hotel offers excellent food and drink and the bedroom I had was modern and well furnished.
Above all this hotel has superb staff both efficient at their jobs, friendly and helpful.
Five star comes at a price , however if you are looking for a special treat this hotel should be on your list.",5,2015,11,14
133,Lovely location.,"Friendly helpful staff. The room was nice, clean, spacious and had a lovely view of London. The bathroom was very elegant with nice equipment. Breakfasts were outstanding. Would choose to come here again and have already recommended it to others.",5,2015,11,13
133,"Royal Garden Hotel ...... amazing staff, bit pricey!","We had two rooms at the Royal Garden Hotel, for two nights which I booked through an external well known website.
Tip 1 book direct
Tip 2 book a park view - we didn't and I regretted not paying the extra.
Tip 3 take money, quite a lot if you are planning on parking there (it isn't included in the hotel cost) eating and drinking there - 2 glasses of wine, rice each, sweet and sour chicken, chicken in black bean sauce, mini spring rolls and 1 apple juice ¬£99! it was absolutely fabulous but ¬£99!
Tip 4 be nice to the staff they are absolutely lovely and could not be more helpfull, polite and professional.
The positives are:
The position- absolutely right next to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, so just lovely to stroll through on Sunday and for shopping on Saturday - perfect. 
The staff just so so helpful, even when my daughters fluffy bunny (she's 16 mind) got taken away with the sheets all the staff could not have been anymore helpfull in relocating him (the concierge even gave her a Hotel Bear to keep and cuddle until he was found).
The food- gorgeous.
The decor and ambience downstairs really calming and clean. 
The negatives are the rooms are nice, clean and large enough but not the best in London at that price, but having to pay extra for everything is a complete drag, it's just sooo frustrating I wish the hotel upped the price and it was all included.... the basics; parking the car, using the wifi and having breakfast adds an additional ¬£125 to each nights stay :-(
Would I stay there again? mmmm yes, yes I would but I will try a few more London Hotels in the mean time.",4,2015,11,13
133,Lovely stay in London,"This was our second visit to this lovely hotel and upon arrival we were advised we had been upgraded to a King Room which had wonderful views over the vibrant Kensington High Street. The staff and service received was both friendly and professional. The room was spotlessly clean and spacious with a lounge area, very comfortable king size bed and large bathroom with lovely complimentary toiletries, bath robe & slippers. Would definitely recommend this 5 star service and hotel.",5,2015,11,11
133,As usual ........perfect,"Was left in a massive pickle on Saturday Night after turning up at a pre arranged hotel ????? Near Olympia booked by a mate 
Why do I do it ??? I wouldn't have kept pigs in it , cutting a long story short , I contacted the RGH who got me in straightaway to make my night mare end. Once again many thanks to all at the   Royal  ( international rescue !!! )",5,2015,11,11
133,Lovely!,I attended an event so decided to splash out and spend the night here.  From the minute we checked in to the minute we left the service was excellent.  All the staff were friendly making you feel welcome.  The room was spotlessly clean and comfortable.  We slept well due to the comfortable bed and minimal noise in the corridor.  The hotel is a short walk away from the station and plenty of shops.  I would definitely stay again.,5,2015,11,10
133,Quality,"Stayed as attending a function in the hotel ballroom. Its clean, efficient and in a great location on Kensington high street. Staff were polite and helpful. Can't fault anything - a worthwhile place to stay for that part of London.",5,2015,11,10
133,Royal Garden - Great location,"The Royal Garden Hotel is in a great location on Kensington High Street. The High Street Kensington tube station is a few hundred yards away. We enjoyed riding on the top deck of the buses, number 9 to Aldwych passing by Trafalgar Square, and number 10 up Parklane and along Oxford Street. The Knightsbridge shops and museums are only 15 minutes walk.
Our room overlooked Kensington Gardens which are beautiful to look at and to stroll in, or exercise in for the joggers.
The room was quite large with a lounge area with desk by the window. The bed was a king and very comfortable. a nice bathroom with constant hot water. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, however other friends were very complimentary of the chines restaurant on the 10th floor.
A very enjoyable stay.",5,2015,11,08
133,Excellent stay,"I booked the RGH as a one night stopover for a charity ball that my wife and I were attending. To be honest, I did no research prior to the booking - it was the most convenient location close to the event - but was delighted by the overall experience.

The staff were uniformly superb, the room (831) excellent and the general atmosphere of the hotel thoroughly enjoyable. It wasn't especially cheap, but I would say it was very good value, especially as my wife very much enjoyed her evening.

My only regret is that we didn't have enough time to enjoy a meal at the RGH or do any shopping, however it is a very good reason to plan a return trip.......",5,2015,11,08
133,Good service,"Stayed a while back for about six nights at about ¬£250 a night

Location ok and service good as there was never a queue at reception

Room overlooking park was nice with a sofa area and good shower

Room service good and is nicer than it looks from the front as the signage is not classy",5,2015,11,05
133,Only wanted egg on toast!!,"Took the family for a short break to London. At breakfast I requested egg on toast, because of dietary needs. When my egg was cold and asked for it to be changed, I was horrified when the waiting staff couldn't care less, not just one of the either! Never again!!!",1,2015,11,04
133,Fabulous meal,"Good food fabulous service once again served by Daniel our charming waiter and excellent value for money.  Plenty of choice on the menu and the atmosphere and comfort of The Park Terrace restaurant is very good.
Have been before and will go yet again.",5,2015,10,29
133,Another great stay,"My firm favorite in London. At the price the RGH is the best value for upmarket accommodation in Central London. This was my fourth stay, and they have again delivered on their promise of being superb. As the hotel was full they hotel offered to serve my groups breakfast in the Min Jiang restaurant on the 10th floor. Wow. The view is spectacular. The rooms are very modern, and service here is tip top. I will again stay here when i visit London. The staff here are as always immensely helpful and accommodating. Definitely 5star",5,2015,10,27
133,"What it lacks in character, it makes up for in (almost) everything else","I usually do a tremendous amount of research before booking a hotel, especially overseas. But, this time, the hotel was offered as part of a theatre package so, with only the knowledge that it was 5-star, accepted it. Well it was a pleasant surprise! Although large and somewhat business-like, the service was friendly and professional, the breakfast and bar were nice, the room was the largest I've found in a large European city, everything was impeccably clean, and the location was great - right on the corner of Kensington Park with bus and tube stops close by. Although it didn't have the charm of The Milestone (where I stayed on my only previous trip to London), it was great in every other way. The one drawback was the relatively high charge for wifi (although it worked quite well). It is located away from the West End theatres and some of the major tourist attractions, but the neighborhood is very nice and easily accessible. I would stay here again.",5,2015,10,26
133,Another safe and happy stay ..,"I have just had another very pleasant stay at Royal Garden Hotel, while clothes shopping in the many fabulous stores of London. I particularly adore the huge bathrooms with  sound system an option, and the fact that no one will bother you once you're in your quiet space. Everyone is totally helpful and ready to attend to your needs. This is one lovely place to be .. ",5,2015,10,26
133,I Like This Place,"I have stayed here several times on business and I love it. The staff are so friendly and helpful and it is central for the Albert Hall, Hyde Park, Kensington, Harrods, the museums, and just a short ride into the west end. The breakfast is comprehensive and the poached eggs are first class, never rock hard. The rooms are well presented and comfortable with complimentary water everyday as I always forget to get some. The view from the upper floors to the front are great  over south London, and the lifts are quick and plenty to the upper floors.
Taxis are quickly summoned by the staff and and as I say it is perfect for me in the right price range.",5,2015,10,23
133,Great location,"Great, great location.  Wonderful view of the gardens and perfect location to the Shops.   Good rooms, bathrooms bit old fashioned and need updating.  Cleaning service in the room was erratic.  Some nights they turned down, some nights they didn't.  Not what you expect from this class of hotel.",4,2015,10,23
133,Perfect,"Initially booked a Queen Room for a Wednesday night business stay at a fantastic rate. Checked in early, and was upgraded to a King Executive room, which was very large with a huge bed, sofa area, desk and separate dressing area with plenty of mirrors. The bathroom had been adapted for disabled guests so was more of a wet room. Big TV and all the amenities you would expect of a five star hotel.

The gym is excellent, not your average hotel gym add on, and caters for those of us that like to lift heavy free weights as opposed to the lighter Dumbbells and resistance machines you find elsewhere. Open 24 hrs too.

Situated on Kensington high street, and although I had a street facing too on the 2nd floor, I didn't hear the traffic. Being on the high street also gives you a lot of food and drink options.

My only issue was that you had to pay ¬£20 for wifi, as I had booked through a comparison site rather than direct. However, as I had received such a favourable rate, and the wifi was excellent, I didn't mind, although I would imagine some guests used to free wifi would. 

Overall, an excellent experience and will stay again. My only fear is that I have been spoilt by the upgrade! 

",5,2015,10,22
133,"Central, smart but why ¬£100 to use the Internet ?","Great hotel.  Top service and food for breakfast. Amazing views from the tenth floor of the park. Rooms are quite small, but all you need really. 

Except mad prices for using the hotel wifi. It's the kind of thing that will make me book another hotel next time. Pity.   

5 minute walk to the tube station with some good shops in the street. ",4,2015,10,19
133,"Great Hotel, Some Distractions","We really enjoyed our stay at this very well appointed, comfortable, high standard hotel in an excellent location.  The room was excellent in all respects, reception and all service staff highly attentive, responsive, helpful and friendly.  The Chinese restaurant on the top floor was superb.  The hotel was not inexpensive, with pricing commensurate with its very high standards of accommodation and services, although some ancillary pricing markups (69 pounds for a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc that retails in Australia for the equivalent of 13 pounds) seemed high.  Of more significance, we felt that a charge ¬£20 per day for Wifi (apparently because our booking had been paid through a travel agent), a service routinely available free of charge in many other hotels and even in large department stores, was excessive. While the service was essential and, hence, we agreed to pay the fee, it's operation fell far short of what should reasonably have been expected for such a large cost. The processes for connecting were complex and counter-intuitive, compounded by a need to reconnect at 24 hour intervals and, worst, re- connection details (UID & password) being provided by an email that would not be accessible if the connection period had passed while we were not connected or away from the hotel. Fortunately, capable and helpful reception staff were eventually  able to get us past frustrating, dysfunctional and time consuming re-connection processes, but only after considerable inconvenience and delay. The hotel waived 40 of the 100 pounds this unsatisfactory service would have cost us over our 5 day stay.",4,2015,10,17
133,Superb!,"Modern, luxurious hotel.

Very clean.

Comfortable bed with super soft bedlinen. 

Staff are very friendly and attentive.

I had a problem with the bath plug, someone was sent to my room and it was fixed within 15 minutes.

Fantastic, central location.

Overall, I would thoroughly recommend. 

",5,2015,10,16
133,Good Hotel,"Used this hotel for business and it is very good, rooms are big and clean. The breakfast is very good. The member of staff we had at reception was a bit smug. I would not book this hotel for personal use as you can get just as nice hotels for a lot less money. Overpriced even by London standards.",4,2015,10,16
133,"Good Location, Small Rooms","Hotel's location in central London makes it a great place for business trips, however my room was rather small and the view from the window was uninspiring as it  overlooked a shipping container converted to an office.  
The restaurant was quite good and the rooms were well maintained during my stay; the staff was courteous and efficient. Overall, a good hotel but you won't be wowed.",3,2015,10,13
133,Lovely stay,"We stayed here for one night in October.  We booked the trip with theatre tickets and originally booked a queen room as this was the only option available on the website.  I called to change the booking to a twin room.  I was advised that there was a room available which was an executive twin and there would be a supplement for this.
We arrived early and were checked straight in.  The room was lovely however I am not sure why is was classed as an executive room.  
The twin beds appeared to be cheap maybe a valance thrown over would improve the look.  Saying this there were comfortable and we slept well.
The bathroom was great with a large shower and large bath. There were robes, slippers and the usual comfort pack.  There was a well stocked mini bar as well.
We asked for a few items for the room while we were there and they were delivered quickly.
Continental breakfast was included in the rooms with a ¬£4.50 supplement for a hot breakfast.  The selection available was fantastic.  Beautiful fruit salads, cheeses and meats.  The only think we felt could improve this would have been a selection of fresh crusty breads.
Well worth a stay.",4,2015,10,13
133,Our trip to Kensington,"We booked a table for  lunch with our son and his wife on a beautiful day on 8th October.
Our lunch was delicious and we were extremely well looked after by Gabor.  He was very attentive throughout our meal.
The only disappointment, was that I was told the restaurant on the ground floor overlooked  Kensington gardens.. We had a table by a window but our view was the road below and a high brick wall with the tops of trees showing above this. Overall our meal at The Royal Garden Hotel was very enjoyable and with staff members like Gabor, our experience was delightful.   Joroly",4,2015,10,12
133,Well located hotel with tiny tiny rooms.,"If your room is an important part of your guest experience and you get claustrophobic then this hotel is not for you. The rooms are the usual tiny spaces you get in some London hotels. I was expecting small....but not that small. It really was cramped in there.
The hotel is very well located next to Kensington Gardens, with good service and a nice bar. I will not however be staying here again due to the tiny tiny rooms.",3,2015,10,10
133,Great place to stay,"We stayed here for 3 nights.  It was our first trip to London and recommended by the travel agent.  Thank god she did.....  It was great.  The room is not over large but it was still very good and the bathroom was excellent.  We had breakfast included and had the buffet. The choice was excellent and ample of fresh food.  Location is great to walk, catch the bus or tube.  Would defiantly stay here again.",4,2015,10,10
133,Great Stay. Perfect Location.,"We really enjoyed our stay at Royal Garden Hotel.  

Staff with friendly, helpful, and very curious. 

The location was perfect on the high street, as we like to walk.  We walked every where from here including Museum Row, Piccadilli Circus (long walk), Nottinghill, Holland Park, etc.  

We had our daily breakfast in the restaurant. Good food.  Staff was very helpful during the week. Weekend staff was not very help. 

Room.  Our room overlooked the palace, so the view was beautiful!  good size room for London.  kept clean.",4,2015,10,10
133,Good stay,"Very close to park.  Good to have Sunrise in the park.  Nice room.  Good service, allow changing room if feel good for the provided room.  Nice breakfast on the ground floor restaurant.  Many choices for tea.",4,2015,10,09
133,Royal Garden bar balcony,"We had a few drinks on the cosy balcony on Tuesday 6th of October. The drinks were nice and the service was lovely and friendly. It was a nice, relaxed evening after a hard day.
We will definitely go back.",4,2015,10,08
133,Very nice hotel for a business trip,"The hotel itself is literally next to Kensington Palace, which is quite nice. My room even had a view of the palace which was amazing and much appreciated. When I checked in around 11AM the room was available which was quite unexpected and nice after such a long flight from the U.S. The room would be small by American standards, but since it was just me it was adequate. The room was very clean and appointed nicely. The maid and turndown service was also a nice touch. (They did replace my towels even thought I hung them up to be ""green"") I had few interactions with the staff, but when I did they were very pleasant and helpful. My daily rate was inclusive of the continental breakfast which was a very nice spread. Not sure if I would have paid the 20 pounds if I was on my own dime. There is plenty to do in the area with Kensington gardens and Hyde Park being adjacent to the Hotel I took many walks and even rented a Santander Cycle a couple of times. The Tube is close and there are tons of pubs, restaurants, coffee and even a Whole foods nearby,",4,2015,10,05
133,"Nicely updated, park views","We booked a garden king room, which ended up putting us on the 7th floor with lovely, sweeping views of Kensington Gardens. Near the window was a step-up area that contained a desk and a small sitting area for enjoying the view. The room had a safe, A/C, minibar (stuffed way too full of items), hairdryer (in the desk drawer), and free wi-fi if the room was booked on the hotel‚Äôs web site. The tiled bathroom was large and looked new, with a separate tub and shower. It did not have much counter space or outlets though, and it could really use a few hooks or places to hang stuff. There was decent closet space in the room and handy outlets on the desk, but only a couple of drawers.

Our room had an unusual feature I‚Äôd never seen before: a light you could set to either privacy (red), housekeeping (green), or none (no light)  for the outside of your door. Because of this, our room was always made up when we wanted, and we could skip the nightly turn down service. I really wish other hotels would adopt this feature.

The hotel itself is a short .2 mile walk away from the High Street Kensington station (District and Circle lines), and there‚Äôs excellent shopping along this road. The staff was surprisingly friendly, even though this seems to be a high-end business hotel and we were obviously tourists. We had a few glitches with the room key and an extraneous charge that showed up on our bill, but they were dealt with quickly. Overall a good stay.",5,2015,10,04
133,Always stay here!,We have been coming to this hotel now 4-5 years. Always nice here at Royal Garden Hotel. Room is large and nice and clean. We were 3 of us and had a nice large triple room. Everything was nice and comfortable. We will come back again soon!,5,2015,10,03
133,"Wonderful location, stay and staff","This hotel far exceeded our expectations.  Not only was the room large, clean and very comfortable, but the staff was exceptional.  Everyone we interacted with was very friendly and accommodating.  The concierge helped us book an afternoon tea at the Goring (which was great), offered lunch ideas and helped us with directions.  The location was great - right next to Kenisngton Garden and a short walk to Kensignton High Street underground stop.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  The one complaint - I did not particularly care for the pillows (too flat).",5,2015,10,02
133,Lovely hotel ,"Stayed here in June for 1 night. Beautiful hotel, our room overlooked Kensington Gardens which was nice. Staff very helpful. We also ate in the restaurant in the hotel and the food was lovely! Would recommend and look forward to staying again soon!",5,2015,10,01
133,"Second Time, not so lucky","This is the second time we have stayed at the Royal Garden. It is beautifully placed for Kensington Palace, Kensington Gardens, the HighStreet shops, restaurants and the tube. The welcome is very good and our pre booking was all easily done. We had a 'garden room' again as these afford beautiful views over the park and have a little more room. This accommodation is air conditioned, there is a turn down service and overall is very comfortable. The concierge staff are very helpful and were able to book our lunch at the Portrait Gallery and theatre tickets which were printed out for us at the hotel. All very good you may say well here are our gripes. One bar is excellent, courteous staff and a pleasant welcome, the other ughhhhhhh. Bertie's Bar lets the place down. We arrived back from the theatre and wanted a nightcap. Off we went to Bertie's we were welcomed with a curt 'yes', ok not good. 'Table for two please' was greeted with, 'Over there' with a finger pointing to two hard chairs. To be honest I wanted to finish a lovely evening with a large G&T, I didn't want an uncomfortable seat so I said that I'd rather sit somewhere else. We were told that every other table was reserved. It was 11.15 pm on a Tuesday night, there were 4 other people in the bar and we felt unwelcome. So to bed. We like the Royal Garden and at over ¬£400 a night, not cheap and I am still cross that so many excellent staff have been let down by an incident that has tarnished our stay.",4,2015,09,30
133,First class hotel perfect location and a touch of luxury,Beautiful hotel first class accomodation.  Great choice for breakfast. Views looking on to Kensington park from our room were a great bonus. Would recomend this hotel for a  special occasion as you will be truly spoiled,5,2015,09,27
133,"Great hotel, excellent location","Hotel is located right on Kensington Gardens.  You can easily walk, cab or take public transport from right outside the front door.   The rooms are pristine.  Mine had a lovely view on Kensington Palace and Gardens.   Breakfast with made to order eggs is decadent.  This is my new favorite hotel in London.",5,2015,09,27
133,WOW!!!!,"I have been coming to this hotel every December for the past 4 years for a work conference and have never been let down.
The rooms are stunning where ever you are in the building. The breakfast is sensational,wide variety and cooked to order. 
The confeconference facilities are amazing and would make a great wedding venue...
Its right next door to Hyde park and the shops are just out the front door. 
Very spectacular hotel....
Home to the stars too as I have star spotted a few times.....share a lift with matt le banc and little mix..bizarre! 
You have got to stay here.....",5,2015,09,24
133,"Flawless service, perfect location",Rooms in London are never big but all the expected amenities were there and maximum care was taken to make sure the room was in pristine condition everyday. Very efficient room service. Excellent location very close to High Street Kensington on Circle Line.,5,2015,09,24
133,Afternoon Tea,"My fiance booked for us to have afternoon tea as an early birthday treat for me. Have to say we were VERY impressed with the service our servers Daniel, Igor and Johan were all incredibly friendly and the smiles from their faces never dropped whilst dealing with customers. They were all very attentive and informative with describing all the different tea's available to us (although as we arent tea drinkers we kindly declined) they knew everything they were serving and described every detail to us perfect from sandwiches to the cakes and even the condiments that came with the scones. 
My favourite by far was the chocolate cheesecake (so good i didnt even share it) the cakes were all very tasty even the slices of fruit cake were very moist and delicious. The scones were some of the BEST ive ever had, although i do think they could have been a little larger. 

We were also served hot chocolate as an alternative to the tea which was really tasty and again amazing service. As we also dont drink alcohol we were given ""mocktails"" which both tasty and refreshing. I had a strawberry puree and mango one and my fiance had a mint lime and lemonade one. 

I would also finally like to make a special thanks to how the hotel and servers were so accommodating towards my allergy to mustard, and changed my sandwich fillings to fit my needs. 
 
Will visit again soon :) 
",5,2015,09,21
133,"Fantastic 5 star stay, best London hotel I've stayed in!","Stayed recently for 4 night business trip. Very impressed all round.
Staff are lovely - friendly but always professional. Valet parking when we arrived was swift and efficient, check in faultless.
Room overlooked High Street but noise was minimal. Room absolutely spotless, excellent housekeeping. Only complaint was there is no dressing table area so nowhere to dry your hair unless you plug hairdryer in by door. Very comfy bed.
We returned late each evening and on two nights ate in the bar. The food was amazing: beautiful black leg chicken with the best chips ever, gorgeous Pad Thai. The service in the bar is excellent, the staff member who served us was outstanding, sorting out our complicated (and demanding!) special requests without any problem.
Concierge recommended we visit Mr Chow restaurant which was fantastic! 
Every staff member we met was extremely helpful & professional and put us at our ease.
The location of the hotel is perfect...5 minute taxi drive to Olympia, 10 minute walk to Royal Albert Hall area.
Parking charge in the adjacent NCP was ¬£127 for 4 days which seemed a lot but is probably the norm for central London.
Highly recommended, the best London hotel I have stayed in, will definitely return.",5,2015,09,18
133,My favourite place ,I stay at the Royal Garden for business often when I travel from Australia. The service is wonderful and I can't really fault it and the hotel very nice. It always feels like a home away from home. If you get a room on the hyde park side you can often gaze at Kensington palace from your room. A great spot in London.,5,2015,09,16
133,Great hotel with stunning views,"Great hotel, all the staff where very helpful  and couldn't do enough for you
It was backing onto the Royal gardens and my room had a superb view over them that you would never expect right in the heart of central London",5,2015,09,15
133,Just your average star-gazers paradise,"Look, if you're hoping to see the Australian cricket team and Matt LeBlanc at breakfast, you won't be disappointed. But if the texture and taste of the scrambled egg is your key ingredient for happiness, then Royal Garden is a disappointment. The breakfast is decidedly average. The same breakfast rooms transforms into a much better fine dining room in the evening. Rooms are tiny (at least mine was). Smoke from the smoking rooms tends to spread around the hotels. Bed was ordinary, as was the shower-over-the-bath. Bertie's Bar needs a make-over - it has all the ambience of an accountant's night out. BUT there is a big plus: Min Jiang Chinese restaurant has just the most superb Beijing Duck, and a breathtaking view of London. Book, or you won't get a table! Otherwise, service at the hotel is good, no complaints. We had a large conference at the hotel, and that worked well; conference food was good. Excellent access to the delights of Kensington, including the park next door.",3,2015,09,14
133,Excellent service and location,"Great location for shopping on Kensington High Street, visiting the royal gardens, or just being in the centre of London.  Traffic can be a bit of a nightmare so try to take the train if you can.  Kensington station is literally a couple of hundred meters walk to the hotel, in a straight line.  
The service is excellent from reception, to the concierge to the doormen.  Really top notch.
Ask for a room on a higher floor, I was on 9th and had an uninterrupted view over Kensington Palace.",4,2015,09,13
133,Awesome Location,"Really great area to stay.  Near underground stations and the Hyde Park and Kensington Palace.  The restaurant in the lower level looks out to the park, and has very serene feel.  The rooms are good and service is impeccable.",4,2015,09,13
133,One of the best hotels I've ever visited!,"I had the absolute pleasure of visiting this hotel for a weekend in March and stayed in a Garden Suite. Now, this room is not cheap (it can be more than ¬£1000 a night) but it is so worth it.  The suite consisted of a private marble lobby with a marble bathroom to one side, a double glass door (open and closed by a switch on the wall) into the split level living room and dining room and another door leading to the split level bedroom, bathroom and second sitting area.  Huge glass windows provided stunning views of Kensington Palace and Hyde Park.  Due to a mistake which the hotel had made on our booking they had also given us private check in, fresh flowers in every room and breakfast in our private dining room for each day of our stay.  Guest services were phenomenal and treated us like VIP's. 

The main bathroom attached to the bedroom was the size of a normal hotel room! It consisted of a double sink, toilet, bidet, full size bath and walk in shower (seriously you could have fit around 5 people in the shower...if only my life were that exciting!).  The bedroom was immaculately presented with turn down service each evening and a bottle of fresh water waiting for you when you woke up each day. 

As you can see from the pictures, breakfast was simply wonderful...chosen from a menu with at least half a billion options the evening before, delivered at the time you specify and laid out (all while you're fast asleep in another part of the suite)...the butler left with a light tap on the door to announce that breakfast was served!

Life.Simply.Doesn't.Get.Any.Better.

One of the best experiences of my life, something I will not forget.  I will definitely be back!",5,2015,09,12
133,Excellent afternoon tea,"We were given a voucher to have afternoon tea here at Royal Garden Hotel and we were pretty impressed. A massive selection of teas on offer including some decaffeinated varieties for my wife which pleased her no end. They even had three different varieties of green tea to impress me too! When the sandwiches arrived I remember thinking that it didn't look like there would be enough to fill us both up. How wrong I was. When the sandwiches were demolished the cake were brought out  and we couldn't finish them which is unheard of for me. We both agreed the service was exceptional. The food was excellent though my wife thought the bottom tier of cakes was a bit dull / lemon sponge, chocolate brownie type slice and something else which looked pretty bland. I don't wish to do the place a disservice though as we were very happy with all aspects of our experience here and would be very happy to recommend. That said, it ain't a patch on the glamour of Claridges, The Ritz etc al.....",4,2015,09,11
133,Great location,"We stayed here and were able to zip back-and-forth to wherever we wanted around town quite easily. The hotel was quite nice and had all the amenities that we needed. 
Nothing extravagant but nice and clean with a very courteous staff.
We had a great view of Kensington Palace grounds from our room, which was very nice.
",4,2015,09,05
133,Don't bother,"We are currently staying and will be leaving tomorrow. I have never been so disappointed in a hotel. My expectations were high and very misplaced. Apart from a couple of members of staff, on the whole the staff in both restaurants are beyond miserable and sour faced. Don't expect any smiles. The restaurant downstairs is an absolute rip off. If you like steaks cut into part strips and in our case, a little tower of 5 chips for a main course, then you will be happy. The list of gripes is too long to mention and in fairness the Duty Manager did try and help. Bring a jumper as both restaurants are freezing. The Chinese restaurant is good, nice food, very pricey for what it is and sour staff. Rooms are fine. Nothing special at all and small. Make sure you turn your light on at your bedroom door, otherwise house keeping will walk straight in. Overall.. Over priced, very ordinary and definitely one to be missed ",1,2015,09,05
133,Early Afternoon Tea,"A generous gift from some friends brought us to this hotel for tea.  It is difficult to write a review on a gift but as we have had experience of other afternoon tea venues I will just be objective so here goes.............
* waiting staff were 5 star and so was the service
* terrace room pristine but lacked atmosphere(should have booked later when the pianist was present)
* dress code was smart casual so was surprised to see a male guest in shorts & gym t shirt
* was expecting to be asked if we would like more sandwiches but was not and I did not feel comfortable to ask for more.
* was expecting to be asked if we would like more fresh tea instead was asked if we wanted more hot water.
* our compliments to the pastry chef cakes and scones delicious.",3,2015,09,05
133,Luxurious relaxation with style,"Had a nice relaxing time with my friends. There was nothing at all to complain about.  The top of the stay was dinner in Min Jang restaurant. Best Chinese food I ever tried, no doubt here. Thank you very much.",5,2015,09,02
133,Just 'okay',"I'm not sure if this is 5 star but I'd say about 3 star would be correct.  Arrived by cab but the doorman nowhere to be seen as we struggled up the stairs with our case.

Pleasant check in (never been asked before to write down where our next destination was?) and once in the room, the view was great.  But why so many mirrrors - smacked of 1970's decor with wardrobe doors all mirrored and huge mirror as you come out the bathroom.

Beds (singles) were very soft and sped across the carpet on their castors - funny at first but not when you're trying to get back into bed after a mid-night wee.

Breakfast the next morning was peculiarly inept.  It was a buffet for the hot food (my bete noir) but should you ask for poached eggs, THEY were delivered up to the table but then you had to join the queue to get your other items.

Being offered fruit juice (glasses on the table) was hit and miss, as was asking if you wanted toast.  Getting service meant having to catch people's eye each time - and there were LOADS of staff on (one poor trainee perpetually stirring up the items on the buffet table!)  Upon getting tea but no cup and taking one from another table, I informed a waiter who assured me he wasn't going to tell me off and 'shhh' he'd replace it - eh? what about giving me a cup and saucer in the first place!!

It wasn't expensive (London wise) but nevertheless, I'd rather pay more to get better rooms/service or less and get something less souless",3,2015,08,31
133,Comfortable and roomy - a great place to stay for this family of 5,"We stayed at this hotel as part of an exchange with our vacation membership.  It was great!  I'd stay again.  From the moment we were greeted, the service was excellent.  It was only a couple blocks from the High Street Kens underground station and the city bus had a stop just outside the hotel.  I booked 2 rooms for our party of 5.  Each adult (3 of us) had very comfy beds to ourselves with my 16 year old also getting her own bed.  My 13 year old son (same height as my 16 year old) was comfy on the rollaway bed.  We had water waiting for us when we returned to our room on our 2nd evening - what a treat after a long day taking in the sights!  We had free Wi-Fi but because we booked this hotel as part of our vacation exchange, I am not sure if all guests receive this complimentary amenity.  The concierge was very helpful and informative.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,08,30
133,Luxury in a great setting.,"In addition to being located next to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, the Hotel provides ease of access to other London areas. (i.e. A Hop On - Hop Off bus stop is located opposite the hotel). 

The hotel is luxurious in all aspects - foyer, rooms and restaurants, etc.  I highly recommend the ground floor restaurant - whether for drinks, snacks, dinner of a delightful afternoon tea. 

My only ""negative"" comment is the lack of free wi-fi which is a service that one expects at a hotel of this calibre.",5,2015,08,28
133,Top Notch,"As one who 'Likes a deal' this place is normally completely off my radar and budget, but for a trip to the Smoke for a Northern Lad and the Mrs I thought for once we'd push the boat out.
What can I say? It is exactly what you expect from a high quality hotel and we were in awe for the whole time we were there, which incidentally happened to coincide with the stay of the Australian cricket team!!
It's not cheap as is usually the case with all good things, but it was simply fantastic and well worth the extra - it's like comparing a Seiko and Rolex watch; they both tell the time but one makes you feel special. 
We also got upgraded to a 'Park view' room - you would not believe you could have such a view from a London hotel room - awesome!",5,2015,08,23
133,Mixed views but overall good. Great location,"Ok...so we have just had 2 weeks in a suite. I was expecting a suite to be more luxurious than it was, but It was ok. We had room service 3'times a day which I have to say was exceptional ...always bang on time, good quality, reasonably priced, fantastic room service staff. Very disappointed with the laundry..don't use. Very expensive and clothes come back half the size they were and not very clean., however the valet staff were very good. The hotel has a great location right on Kensington Park and overall I would recommend this hotel .. It was all of the staff who made my trip memorable.",3,2015,08,19
133,Afternoon tea,"I took my wife here for her birthday, the hotel is very upmarket but welcoming, there was a lady playing on the piano during our meal which was lovely , and when the staff bought out a special birthday surprise for my wife, the pianist switched to playing happy birthday, i will remember the smile on my wife's face forever!. if you have the Chinese tea i would definitely recommending paying the small supplement of ¬£3 , its well worth it ! Overall i can highly recommend this for a treat , and not just for special occasion. Plus if its a nice day you can always go and sit or stroll in Kensington Gardens which is literally next door to the hotel !",5,2015,08,19
133,Loved this - ALMOST perfect,"We booked two rooms one for us and one for our children and specifically asked for rooms next to each other. Unfortunately we weren't told this wasn't possible until we checked in which was disappointing and did put a bit of a downer on re stay as we kept having to walk right down the corridor. It didn't ruin our stay! 
Upon check in we were served by the most amazing and attentative Jamaican customer service rep. He was thorough and so helpful which was the theme for the rest of our three night stay. Extremely helpful staff especially breakfast staff. Breakfast was first class. The chef bought special gluten free food for us. Just amazing attention to detail. Would recommend it.
Unfortunately our only complaint was extremely noisy neighbours that had booked for quite some time, we were sadly placed next to the maid and the children and were woken up at all hours. We did complain twice and staff said they would inform management.  That's only one problem that unfortunately happens now and then. It wouldn't stop me staying there again however I would insist we were moved if we had the same problem. I forgot to mention that this is the most amazing location for Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens, science museum.",5,2015,08,17
133,Comfortable luxury,"At the end of a 3 week 2-country trip this was our last night before Heathrow. Comfortable, attentive and understated luxury are the words for this hotel. Nice view of Kensington Garden, easy walk to Harrod's and shopping streets and lovely Hyde Park. Very easy cab ride to Heathrow in the morning. Had some trouble with the wifi.",5,2015,08,17
133,Superb Service,This Hotel is very conveniently placed overlooking Kensington Gardens and very convenient for walking around central London. The staff were very helpful lifting up the pram to go up the stairs and helping with travel arrangements. The car park descends quite steeply and is very safe underneath the hotel. Well worth visiting.,5,2015,08,13
133,A perfect base to see London,"The two of us stayed at the hotel for six nights. It was a weird but great experience. First the weird. We booked through booking.com and because of this upon check-in we were told there was a 20 pound fee per day for use of wifi. We were told if we had booked our stay through the hotel, we would have had free wifi. We found this hotel because we went on booking.com. I thought this was a strong penalty to pay because we went through a 3rd party booking.
The concierge was very helpful with directions, and restaurant reservations and recommendations. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and a good size. We had a room with 2 twin beds and a sitting area. 
The location of the hotel is the best! It is right in the heart of Kensington bordering beautiful Hyde Park. There are great clothing stores on the High Street along with wonderful restaurants and a few supermarkets as well. The tube is right down the street and of course, London is a great city to walk around.",4,2015,08,11
133,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel with the family during school holidays. The hotel was beautiful the staff were friendly and the kids lived it. We got a large family room and the staff made every effort to ensure we had everything we needed.
Thank you for a great holiday.
",5,2015,08,10
133,"Great hotel , great service","We been with our family in this hotel
Locate near the Hyde park 
Great hotel very good staff 
Great restaurant and perfect breakfast 
I say YES 
In this hotel there is Chinese restaurant very good duck dish 
There is some shops in this area so you can make some shopping 
But it's about 20-25 minutes from Oxford street 
",5,2015,08,10
133,Afternoon tea ,"Booked this for our 25th wedding anniversary and hubby's birthday. 
Beautiful surroundings. Clean. Great service. ¬£26 sandwiches with 8 fillings 4 types of dessert 4 types of sponge 2 types of scones. 3 pages of tea to choose from. Lady playing piano. Overall excellent ",5,2015,08,09
133,Park Terrace Restaurant.,"We visited the Park Terrace Restaurant yesterday as part of a break in London. We had a great evening, which was contributed to by the Restaurant Manageress, the Barman who made our great cocktails, Sonia our Waitress who was professional & friendly & the Team in the kitchen who produced some fantastic flavored food. We will be definitely going back on our next break in the capital.",5,2015,08,06
133,Hotel Retaurant,"We've never stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel, but we spotted an excellent meal deal recently for their restaurant. As we were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary, we made a booking and were very impressed. Pre dinner cocktail, followed by a beautiful cooked 3 course dinner and small cheese course was wonderful value for money. Coupled with excellent service, we were extremely pleased with our choice. If there is a similar deal at this restaurant when we next trip London, then we will make a return visit.",5,2015,08,05
133,Never a bad stay at the Royal Garden,"I stay at the  Royal Garden every year when on business in London and I've never had a bad stay yet.

The rooms are lovely, the concierge is always friendly and the breakfast is one of the best hotel breakfasts I've had. 

I especially like this hotel as it's upmarket but not snooty,",5,2015,08,05
133,Tranquility right in the heart of London,Rooms are perfect. Service and staff are extremely friendly. I keep going back every year and I feel at home because the rooms are large and you don't hear noise from the busy street downstairs. The food is also great because there's a whole range of different menus. Definitely recommend for all visit types. ,5,2015,08,04
133,Weekend anniversary break,"I need to try harder to write reviews for the accommodation I stay in and thought I would start with our wonderful weekend at the Royal Garden Hotel in London. 

An anniversary treat for my husband and I, with many fond memories of this hotel. Our stay in a garden suite room with an amazing view of Kensington gardens whilst drinking champagne was a wonderful arrival to our Saturday afternoon. The parks are within a minutes walk and is a perfect location for families with children. The bustling high street of Kensington and within seconds Kensington Palace, gardens and Hyde Park. My boy received a welcome bag on arrival with a few items to keep him occupied until we got to the park. A brilliant night sleep with no interruption from other guests and reception staff and concierge were always very welcoming and accommodating.

We ordered room service on Saturday night and breakfast in our room the following morning. The food was lovely and plentiful, (you don't mind paying a bit more for quality). A picnic meat hamper on Sunday afternoon in the park finished our weekend retreat perfectly. 

It's the little touches  that you appreciate in hotels nowadays that makes the difference and you really felt looked after. The staff all seem genuinely happy working there, it says a lot about management. Free wifi is always a good start when checking in! 

Thank you to everyone at the hotel for our wonderful stay. We shall return.",5,2015,08,03
133,Modern Hotel in Kensington,We enjoyed staying at this Hotel on our first trip to London. The room is spacious for a family of four. Room was clean and we had turn down service every evening. The location is great right next to Kensington Palace and Kensington Garden. We will definitely stay at this Hotel when we come back to London.,5,2015,08,01
133,High class.,"Amazing service, beautiful, spacious rooms, room service with delicious food (quickly prepared and delivered), bathrooms comes with nice equipment, in general just my favourite hotel in all of London.",5,2015,08,01
133,Missing the extras ,"Having stayed at a couple of 5 star hotels in the City I don't know if my expectations were too high? The hotel itself is nice and very well positioned. The surrounding area has everything you need and the tube station is a short walk away to get around the rest of London. 
When I say missing the extras, I feel a 5 star hotel at these rates should provide bottled water, not charge ¬£2.75 for a 500ml bottle in the minibar. On arrival not one, but two members of door staff walked into the hotel and left us to bring in our own cases. The rooms are a good size but very basic and bathroom toiletries weren't replenished. On the plus side, the do not disturb lights are actually acknowledged, no noisy maids in the morning banging about in corridors and other rooms trying to wake you. The hotel is good, but not particularly value for money. ",3,2015,07,31
133,Afternoon tea not as expected,"We booked here for afternoon tea for 3 people and at the beginning we were amazed by the beautiful views and the setting of it all. After we were sat we were given a menu and we noticed there were supplements for some teas so we decided to stick to the ones included in the price. We were extremely hungry as we had booked for 1530 so picked our teas and asked if we could have our sandwiches first. We were asked if we wanted our Pimms first (included in price) or our tea we said we will have pimms with the sandwiches. After our sandwiches were bought to us - 1 place with around 6 sandwiches the tea was bought too, we raised the fact that we wanted the Pimms first and the lady apologised and said we can have it afterwards. We could see the bar and saw our Pimms had already been made up but rather then throwing them down the sink the barman proceeded to put these in the fridge! After we had our plate of sandwiches there were a few that we liked so we asked if we could have more, the lady mentioned that the cakes were 3 tier and quite filling so suggested we have those first rather then more sandwiches and then mentioned she would have to charge for extra sandwiches. Now this is not the first time i have been for afternoon tea and i do not think it is unreasonable asking for more sandwiches but clearly this is the type of place you have to pay extra for everything. We decided we would have the cakes which were delicious and oh yes you dont get more tea they simply give you hot water and you can top up your kettle. This meant the tea was getting bitter towards the end. Once we'd finished the barman resumed to take out our Pimms from the fridge as we had predicted and presented us with these. By this point we simply had a couple of sips and paid and left. Nice hotel though.",3,2015,07,28
133,Excellent High End Family Option in London,"We were completely spoiled at this hotel recently, with a beautiful room overlooking Hyde Park.   This hotel excels in making children welcome, from the friendly approachable staff, to fabulous little extras such as a great back pack full of goodies on arrival, and scooters (and helmets) to take out into their glorious ""back garden"" Hyde Park.   The food's great - breakfast will certainly set you up for the day, and for excellent Chinese Food and amazing views of London's Skyline, book a table at Min Jiang on the 10th floor.   Perfectly positioned for a family stay in London, a very memorable stay...",5,2015,07,27
133,Great Hotel,"I stayed here for a conference. Although I didn't see much of the hotel as we were located in a room on the lower ground floor, what I did see was lovely. The room was very clean and had a very comfortable bed. My room was on 5th floor but I did go to one of my colleagues room which was on the 7th floor and was much bigger and had a view of Hyde Park which was lovely.
The food that we had as part of the conference was lovely and the staff were helpful.
The breakfast the following morning was exceptional. The staff were fantastic and very attentive even though it was busy. The buffet breakfast was plentiful and had everything you could want.
The hotel itself is very close to shops and the tube station. I would definitely recommend this hotel, it's fabulous.",5,2015,07,26
133,Luxurious hotel in Eilat,"I visited with my family. We had a wonderful time.
The hotel is VERY big, it has a very big pool with slides.
You can have a kitchen in your room and cook for yourself.
Go and see the ""wow"" show there.

Awesome hotel :)",5,2015,07,26
133,Revisiting after many years,"My husband stayed here when it had just opened 50 years ago when he was 10! We have not visited it for some 35 years ourselves but stayed recently one night on way to Heathrow as it is convenient for Paddington for Heathrow Express. We were lucky enough to get an upgrade to a lovely room overlooking the park. We were unable to get into the roof top restaurant (it was a summer Saturday) so should have booked, We ate at the modern Indian opposite which was excellent. We had a good breakfast though service was a bit slack and as usual it was expensive - don't usually do hotel breakfasts but we were in a hurry. We will definitely stay again especially if on way to Paddington!",5,2015,07,23
133,A wonderful time at a wonderful hotel!,"We stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel for my in-law's Ruby Wedding Anniversary and had the most amazing time.  The hotel is incredibly family friendly and the consiege team greet children with a bag pack full of kiddie treats, they also have a vast array of scooters you can borrow during your stay.  The staff are very friendly and make you feel very welcome.  I also experienced a very helpful reservation team before we arrived who ensured that everything was perfect on arrival.  The bedrooms are lovely and spacious and our room had an amazing view of Kensington Palace and gardens.  We ate in Min Jiang and the food was absolutely sublime.  What a stay, what a hotel! Would definitely recommend it and would love to come back",5,2015,07,22
133,Best room with a view in London ever - Kensington Palace and Gardens in July!,"My husband and I were tourists for a day in West London, having travelled in from the London Borough of Bromley!  The hotel facilities and staff were excellent.  It was hard to believe that the receptionist who guided us to our room was only a trainee, she was so professional. The room had a simply stunning view across Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and was comfortable in every way, every attention to detail cared for.  The full English breakfast was clearly appreciated not just by us, but by as well the Australian cricket team and accompanying entourage who were visiting us at Lords. (Note to catering department - we noticed they had brought their own 'vegemite' maybe in four year's time you could provide them with that too - although judging by the cricket result (they won so easily) perhaps you should confiscate it next time - only joking of course!   It was a really enjoyable stay - shame we could not stay longer. Very clear to see why tourists flock to London, with hotels such as this in the heart of a vibrant and exciting city.",5,2015,07,20
133,"Convenient location, friendly staff, clean","We visitied the hotel at the end of June for a 4 day stay and had 2 rooms. Upon arrival, we were greeted by very friendly staff. Our rooms were both decent sized and very clean. The hotel is located on High Street, next to Kensington Palace, an easy walk to the underground. The free wifi was an excellent bonus and the breakfasts were fabulous. Would definitely return.",5,2015,07,20
133,Fab hotel location,"This hotel is so well located in west London. Right in Kensington and nex to Hyde Park.
Everything is walking distance (tkmaxx, gap, whole food market, uniglo, m&s, bars, restos..)
Stayed there for 2 nights and room was nice but a bit compact. There is a full mini bar and plenty of other snacks.
Didn't eat there due to limited time schedule.
The downside was the TV as you could not rotate to watch from the bed
Room is a bit pricey for what you get - i guess it's due to being in Kensington",4,2015,07,19
133,A Favorite!,"Incredible location right next to Kensington Palace and Hyde Park.   I walked the Palace Gardens every day.  The hotel is beautiful and very upscale.   The staff is incredible, clearly loving what they do, and some have been there a very long time, which speaks for itself.  The restaurant is great, with a fabulous English breakfast, and the top floor is an incredible Asian restaurant with an unbeatable view and outstanding food.  My room had a terrific view of Kensington Palace.  The GM clearly wants guests to have a great stay there.  I can't wait to return!",5,2015,07,19
133,Top of the Line in every way,"Our king room was modern in decor. I loved the special touch of a complimentary bottle of water delivered every night. The towel warmer and surround sound in the bathroom was a nice touch. Free continental breakfast daily was great. Ask concierge for free access for wi-fi. For quality Customer Service ask for David, Aaron and Javier.",5,2015,07,19
133,Traditional and well connected,"Extremely pleasant hotel on one of the most beautiful streets in London. Great for an afternoon walk around the suburbs if time permits. 

I loved the multi level room and have always chosen the street view room. It is great to see the bustle on the street as you relax in the sitting area. 

Staff is courteous and breakfast in the restaurant overlooking the park extremely relaxing. 

Recommended. ",5,2015,07,17
133,Bridal Shower in style,"Attended a bridal shower for just under 30 women for afternoon tea in Park Terrace Restaurant, within the private room. Beautifully prepared room, champagne reception, fabulous afternoon tea,sandwiches scones, cakes pastries with excellent service.   All tastes and dietary needs taken care off with aplomb!  explanations and flair.  A superb venue for any bride considering a tasteful celebration.  Superb!",5,2015,07,14
133,"Air bnb debacle, Sunday night saved","I stayed here last night after my air bnb host decided he was going to take the liberty of sleeping in the spare room of the flat I had rented, I had paid to have it to myself and thus left and slept on a couch for two nights. Anyway on arrival just after 11am I was told that there was a room ready, the receptionist was an angel, so very helpful, I went to my room to dump my bag and then went for a wander. That evening I treated myself to room service, chicken wings, pepperoni pizza and fries, lush is all I can say. This morning I treated myself to breakfast in my room with a glass of champagne, top top breakfast. On checkout the receptionist commented on my predicament and I told him, that the previous evening and this morning more than made up for it. Thank you very much.",5,2015,07,13
133,Excellent quality hotel,"Stayed here for a weekend trip to london with the family, very close to the tube.
Its a great place to enter after the hussle and bussle of the capital. A very calm and relaxed atmosphere and high quality.
After being on honeymoon to some exotic places and treated like royalty, this place is on par I would say.
Bed turned down in the evening, curtains closed and radio on, very nice to come back too.",4,2015,07,13
133,Very convenient & comfortable,"Used this hotel for a 3 day business trip, but would recommend for leisure purpose as well, very convenient and beautiful location. Friendly staff (there was a tube strike, and they were very helpful). Had dinner once in the Bar, which was good value for money. Breakfast, both service as food quality were excellent. My room on the 7th floor was rather small, but was clean and had all I needed. Excellent Wi-Fi connection. Would recommend!",4,2015,07,11
133,Good old fashioned British elegence,"Don't be put off by the modern exterior of this hotel, inside is elegance personified.

Set right at the end of Kensington High Street, overlooking the stunning Kensington Gardens and Palace, this hotel is a perfect base for any visitor to the capital.

We were two friends with our two little girls, heading to see the princess of pop, Taylor Swift and we knew this would be a great option as was within walking distance to the gig in Hyde Park if cabs were scarce.

We checked in at 4pm and they were just brilliant!  Reception treated our girls like little princesses, engaging with them and giving them some lovely gifts, we were then told we had been selected for an upgrade - which as you can imagine, was a lovely surprise!

It wasn't until we got the room we realised just how lucky we were.  We had been checked into room 741, a master suite with THE most stunning views of Kensington Gardens and all of London!  Everything was just superb from the walk in wardrobes and dressing area, to the spacious lounge area, to the Penhaligons Quercus toiletries in the bathroom (and we're not talking tiny, it's a generous 100ml sizes you're given.
There was also a kitchenette for making tea and coffee with a well stocked mini bar.

Our girls now really believed they were princesses - ah who am I kidding, we Mummy's did too!

For breakfast we opted for al a carte room service (it was rude not to with the fantastic dining area in the suite!).  It was delicious and very good value for a hotel of this quality.

I see a few comments re d√©cor and car parking, so let me clear that up.  The d√©cor is not clean lines and contemporary, that's not the feel of the hotel.  The ambiance is traditional and chic and so the furniture is reflecting of that style but this doesn't mean it needs a refurb, it's simply the style of the hotel which is elegant and luxurious.

We were going to use the train but I changed my mind at the last moment and drove (it's a control thing!).  The entry to the car park is quite tight, but I managed easily in my 7 seater mom-mobile, so I;m sure it's fine for most cars.  The charges are reasonable for hotels in London and I paid ¬£45 for the two days.  If you want public transport though there are good links here, including the tube at high st Kensington, plentiful taxis and the wonderful no 9 bus.... such a great route, stay on board and see some of the great sights of London on your travels!

I can't recommend this hotel highly enough.  Just superb!  Thanks to everyone who made our stay incredible.",5,2015,07,10
133,Pricey but totally worthy,"I have spent a long weekend at the Royal Garden Hotel to celebrate an important family occasion. I advised them upon booking and we have been welcomed like royalties. Super friendly and helpful staff, quiet and clean rooms and perfect location at the beginning of Kensington High Street and a stone throw away for Kensignton Palace and Gardens. Totally worthy the special treat",5,2015,07,09
133,Fantastic food but is a refurb planned?,"The rooms feel as if they are from the 70's and really do need modernisation. This is a shame because the staff and the food in all bars/restaurants is excellent - but then again they have one of the best executive chefs in London (and the UK) at the helm. It would be great if the far eastern owners could step up to the plate and spend on the rooms. The location is very close to the Albert Hall, next to the park, and on the doorstep of shopping. If you drive beware - the car park entrance is extremely tight with high kerbs so extreme care is needed to avoid scrapped alloys. ",3,2015,07,08
133,Great as always,"I stay at the Riyal Garden a couple of times a year. Most recent stay this month fantastic as always. Go for a garden view room with views across Kensington Palace.  Min Jiang Chinese restaurant on the top floor, with great views of the London skyline, is a highlight.",5,2015,07,07
133,Brilliant Service,"We stayed at this hotel in May for my daughter's 18th.  We took 3 rooms and we were looked after spectacularly well by staff who couldn't do enough for us.  Our rooms were great, spacious, very well appointed and comfortable, and as soon as the reception staff heard why we were staying a complimentary bottle of champagne arrived unexpectedly at our room.  They also were incredibly helpful in keeping the cake in the fridge for us.

We only used the hotel for the rooms and didn't eat in the restaurants but based on our limited experience I would say this hotel provided probably the best customer service we have experienced in a very long time.",5,2015,07,05
133,Just right,"Stayed 2 nights here for the first leg of our UK trip before heading to Scotland. Location is good with a large supermarket, some decent shopping as well as full meal cafes close by. The area was not too crowded like the major tourist spots. Nearest underground at High Street Kensington connects to major attractions. Buses outside the hotel also provide good connections to shopping areas like Oxford Street/Regent Street. Venturing through the Kensington Garden just next to the hotel is also a pleasant walk to more choices of restaurants in the Queensway/Bayswater area. Hotel was quite kid-friendly with each of children receiving a complimentary backpack with goodies. The Executive room fitted our family of 5 comfortably with the double bed, pull-out sofa bed, extra bed and baby cot leaving us enough space to move about. Breakfast was good with both English or Asian cuisine. Overall, the hotel was just right in terms of location, comfort and service. Would love to be back.",5,2015,07,05
133,best concierge desk of any hotel I have stayed in,"This hotel  is clean, modern, perfectly located right next to both the tube and bus with a beautiful view of the park. If you stay you must make sure to go up to the top restaurant to sit and have a drink, the view from the top of the hotel was gorgeous. In addition to that the concierge desk was incredible. No matter who was on staff they took pleasure in helping you. Not only were their recommendations for restaurants superb but they called on the spot to make reservations for you. That is only one of the many things they did daily to make our stay easier.  They always asked us if we needed them to do anything and then checked to make sure if we were satisfied with what they had done to help us. They helped make our stay delightful.",5,2015,07,02
133,What a wonderful hotel,I recently stayed at the Royal Garden hotel for a International conference.  My room overlooked the park and was very well equipped.  The services were excellent and the location in London was in easy tube and bus rides from the main attractions. The business facilities were modern and well presented and the F&B quality and service were extremely professional.,5,2015,07,02
133,Excellent hotel on High Street Kensington,"Spent here 2 nights. I chose the hotel because had some business in this part of London. Hotel has an excellent location on High Street Ken. Spacious room&bathroom. Comfy bed. Good service at front desk, fast room service, nice bar with wonderful service.",5,2015,07,01
133,"Location, location, location","My third time here and probably my best experience. I stay here only because of the location which suits my needs. The rooms are ok, nothing special, clean and functional. The staff are
courteous but dont go out of their way to help. I didnt eat in the restaurants (why would I ?).
The health club is not as it used to be - there are no facilities such as steam room and sauna as there were previously. It would help customers if the hotel mentioned that on their website - they dont.
For this reason and others, I give this hotel only an average rating.",3,2015,06,30
133,Superb afternoon tea with attentive staff,"We came here after a disappointing experience at a nearby hotel. They found us a (great) table at short notice and served up an excellent-value tea in a lovey light dining room with jazz pianist playing throughout. The waiting staff were super attentive and brought out a cake and candle, totally unprompted, for my sister's birthday. We'll be back.",5,2015,06,28
133,simply great in all aspects,"stay with family -can not ask more,geat room with amazing vew,perfact location-service  one of the best i have seen(we are traveling A LOT).close to the shops,hydepark and tube.it is not the most touristic so a fantastic choice spacialy if it is not your first trip to london.start the morning by walking in the park can be a batter start of the day.
worth every pound!!",5,2015,06,28
133,spacious spotless rooms and well located property,"I've stayed here several times and it never lets me down. Great spacious rooms, well located-even if Kensington is a bit crowded, it's easy to get anywhere and terrific service. Breakfast is overpriced but there are cafe's everywhere and they can empty out your fridge if you like -I had yogurt most mornings bought from one of the many stores nearby.
My only complaint is the wifi-you had to put in the user name and password every single time  you left the property or turned on a device- it was really annoying and they need to fix this asap!",4,2015,06,28
133,Great Hotel,"This was my second stay at this hotel. We love this place.  Family friendly, great staff, good rooms, great breakfast.  We only stayed one night on this trip but we will be back.  Also, this hotel is right next to Kensington Palace which is a big plus for going for a walk or jog in the morning.",5,2015,06,27
133,Stunning luxury hotel,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Royal Garden with our two small children. The hotel staff went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable, and the room was absolutely gorgeous. Beautiful bedlinen, fabulous amenities and we were made to feel like a King and Queen.
The location of the hotel is absolutely brilliant too - being just up the road from Harrods in Knightsbridge, and right on Kensington High Street where all of the best shopping can be had!",5,2015,06,21
133,Amazing afternoon tea!,"My daughter and I had afternoon tea which was a Virgin Gift Experience.

We arrived early and were welcomed by courteous and friendly staff and shown to our table by the window overlooking Kensington Gardens.

We had a choice of two afternoon teas, one was the standard tea we have paid for or for ¬£10 you have a glass of champagne served with strawberries with balsamic vinegar and icing sugar. My daughter doesn't drink so was happy with the standard tea and I had the champagne and strawberries.

A wide range of teas were brought for us to chose from, some with a small charge. We opted for Earl Grey and Chai.

The sandwiches were served first after I had my strawberries and champagne.  The selection and range of filings were superb and they were absolutely delicious. Our tea was served in excellent china with plenty of extra hot water for top ups.

Once we had finished the sandwiches a cake stand of superb scones, cakes and pastries with clotted cream and two jams were served. These were amazing and beautiful creations!

Overall, a fantastic experience and one I can highly recommend.  Everything was of the highest quality and the staff were faultless.

Well done to all concerned!",5,2015,06,20
133,Simply Lovely,"In an excellent location, virtually alongside Kensington Park and Palace and only few minutes walk from the underground station it is ideally situated. The hotel is spacious yet extremely comfortable and welcoming and as you would expect the staff are friendly, courteous and most efficient. The Park Terrace restaurant serves excellent food cooked and presented beautifully, all in all an excellent hotel.",5,2015,06,20
133,Fantastic say in Kensington,"Really enjoyed my stay at the Royal Garden.  Arrive mid-morning and provided option to check in immediately to room with view of Kensington High Street.  Did so, and no regrets as room was very comfortable with up to date bedding, furnishings and bathroom. Despite location on busy street sides, admirably quiet and restful.

Extensive complimentary selection of tea and coffee (including biscuits) was a nice touch.  

All staff interactions were very positive, and I found them professional, attentive, and when desired, unobtrusive.

The room service experience was terrific.  Timely, properly served, with hot foods hot and cold foods cold, and available 24 hours to serve international travelers.

My first hotel stay in Kensington, but will put this high on my list for future London visits.",5,2015,06,19
133,Solid hotel for business travel,"This is a good, solid 4-star business hotel located on High Street Kensington, adjacent to Kensington Palace and about a 5 minute walk to the tube station. You will find the rooms comfortable and a bit bigger than what is common in Europe.They serve up a good breakfast and although I was not able to try it, their Chinese restaurant is rumored to be one of the best in London. 

This is definitely a BUSINESS hotel and you will find that everything is centered around convenience and efficiency. So you will find that there is not much atmosphere or character here. The neighborhood is also pretty quiet at night so you can be assured of a good night's sleep. If you're looking for nightlife, other than a few pubs in the immediate neighborhood, you'll need to travel elsewhere in the city. But with the tube station close by that shouldn't be a problem. 

Since I like to go out at night, I don't know that I'd stay here again but you could do far, far worse. I do have to give a shout out to the night staff, who were very good-natured and friendly when I stumbled in after a long night out.",4,2015,06,19
133,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed here for three nights in a King Garden room, overlooking Kensington Gardens. Location was perfect for our visit, as the Royal Albert Hall is only a few minutes walk away. The room was beautiful, spacious and comfortable, as was the bathroom. Welcoming and helpful staff. Will stay here again for our next visit to London",5,2015,06,17
133,Great location next to Kensington Palace Gardens.  Royal Albert Hall not far.,"As part of my niece's hen weekend 12 of us had afternoon tea at the Royal Garden Hotel.  The sandwiches were delightful, as were the cakes and tea.  They put is in a room to ourselves (probably a good idea) so we could giggle and have fun.  
It brought back memories for me as I stayed here for 5 nights a few years ago with my now deceased husband when we celebrated his 65th birthday.  We enjoyed a meal in the top floor restaurant which I think was called Xth or something like that. Anyway, a very nice hotel next to Kensington Palace.",4,2015,06,15
133,Just a little bit sad :-(,"Nothing about our stay was nice, everything was just tired, ordinary and just basically a little sad. Check in was okay, but no assistance provided with our luggage, and as we had six bags, it required a lot of trips up and down the lifts ourselves. The room was okay, but felt a bit drab. Worst part was a step mid way in the room, a dangerous hazard at night. Through our three day stay, coffee was not replenished and the tissue box in the bathroom remained empty. The mattress was lumpy. Promised vouchers for resteraunts never eventuated. No smiles, no service. On checking out I hoped they would at least ask ""how was your stay"" so I could share my views, but no. They did not ask, so I did not say. Plenty of other hotels in London, many of which delight and make you smile. I won't be staying at the RGH again.",2,2015,06,13
133,Wonderful hotel,"A very luxurious and clean hotel. Quite reasonably priced, given its high quality. Amazing food and the staff can't do enough for you. A great location too, just a stones throw from Kensington Gardens.",5,2015,06,13
133,Spacious room,"The rooms here are considerably larger and nicer than similarly priced London hotels I've stayed at.  We had a large bathroom with a separate tub and shower.  The bedroom had a sofa and a desk in addition to a king- size bed.  Our room overlooked Kensington Palace Gardens.  The location is excellent, near the tube and lots of shops and restaurants.  Avoid the over-priced internet and breakfasts.  The hotel is right near Starbucks, Pret a Manger and Marks &Spencer,  which have caf√©s with free wifi.",4,2015,06,10
133,Great Hotel Great Cocktails,"This was our second visit.  We returned because our previous visit was so successful and the hotel is in a convenient location and suited our requirements very well.

What I shall take away from this visit was how helpful the staff are.  Nothing is too much trouble.  I booked on line through a booking agency and made a mistake.  I thought I was booking a double room but ended up booking a single one. When I rang up to sort things out Chris in the reservation department was very helpful and I appreciated that.

We did not eat in the hotel but I remembered how good the cocktails were and so we enjoyed those. We did have room service and one evening shared a pizza.  We had eaten a really good lunch and fancied something light.  The pizza was one of the best I have had in ages which is pretty good for room service.

The room was spotless and the bed comfortable.  We slept well.  I hope to come back soon",5,2015,06,09
133,'location',"Travelled with my daughter, stayed in a twin room with views of Kensington Gardens and Palace. Good sized room, very clean with lovely views. Easy check in pleasant and helpful staff.  We didnt eat in the hotel but there was plenty places only a couple minutes walk to eat. we had breakfast across the road and we ate at Prezzo one night which is also just across the road with enjoyable food and is good value for money. Hotel is only a few minutes walk to the tube station and within easy walking distance to The Royal Albert Hall. Not the cheapest hotel in London but you get what you pay for and I would happily stay here again.",5,2015,06,08
133,flawless,"It is not my first time in this hotel. and I know why. if you wish an experience without an incident, where you smile from beginning to end. This hotel has a very professional staff, and their rooms are all impeccable (had 3 different ones). Of course the ones with view on hyde park are amazing. The breakfast is extraordinary. The sleeping quality - sound proof rooms - is very good. .... so , I will go again ...",5,2015,06,07
133,A pleasant surprise,"Upon arrival at the reception was greeted by a very competent and charming young lady called Laura , offering hotel complementary Wi Fi connection and making sure that I'm well taken care of. My room on the 10th floor with the view of the London was modern , clean with the all the modern facilities available. Staff at the Hotel restaurant on the ground level were very friendly and knowledgeable , good selection of the light food and excellent selection of the wine. Hotel location is very convenient with London Underground at high street Kensington just 5 minutes walk away.
Hotel is both suitable for business or pleasure stay and definitely I intend to come back next time I'm in London .",5,2015,06,06
133,Extremely well located and very comfortable.,"I always stay in the Kensington High Street area although my choice of hotel depends a lot on prices available at the time of booking. I booked this trip well in advance which meant that I got a fantastic deal on a hotel where I would not usually be able to stay. 
The reception staff were extremely friendly and jokey, not only to us at check-in but also to our friends who came by to pick us up and then later, on being asked to take pictures of us all as we left for a party.  
The  room was very light and comfortable, with nice products and all the bits and bobs that you would expect in a good hotel, even though the decor and trim was a little bit dated, and with a view over Kensington High Street which I thought was going to be noisy, but actually wasn't. For what I paid I certainly wasn't expecting to get a park view!
It irks me to have to pay extra for wifi here or anywhere else for that matter, and on our whole stay in Europe, this was the only hotel not to have wifi included...and an expensive extra it was too. It just seems mean-spirited not to include it these days, especially when just about everybody else is. Having said this, I would still happily stay here again if the price is right!
A high point of our stay was bumping into an extremely heavily made-up ""lady"" in towering high heels, huge boobs and a completely see-through nighty, wandering around the corridor and muttering loudly in Russian. We hope that she found what she was looking for!!!",4,2015,06,05
133,The hotel is ok but not 5 stars,"Staff at the reception were very friendly, also when you call from your room they are very welcoming.  Rooms are small and barely can take 1 piece of luggage, in addition the room's carpet is stained and looks filthy.  No slippers in the room!, the WiFi service was poor, but the technician was kind enough to give me a complimentary access code as the one I purchased had stopped working before I finish my 24 hours.

I found the complimentary water bottle was already open .. I guess one of the guests drank the water and filled it back with tap water thinking he/she will be charged for it!! Probably didn't read or understand that it was free.
My room view was nice, so the overall experience wasn't that bad.",4,2015,06,04
133,Splendid,Great hotel.  Spotlessly clean: attentive & friendly staff: good sized rooms: prompt room service & willingness to go off menu.  Convenient for V&A & Royal Albert Hall.  Many good restaurants nearby.   200m or so from Tube.  I've already booked to come back later this year.,5,2015,06,04
133,5 nights in May,"I recently spent 5 nights at the Royal Garden. Hotel is well located and surprisingly quiet (I had a garden room). The view overlooking Kensington Gardens is a nice break fro the busy city. Great location for venturing out on foot into Kensington, Notting Hill, museums, or the gardens. 

Room was comfortable and as expected. It was a pleasant surprise to find that the hotel had worked hard to prepare my room in anticipation of my early morning arrival form the US. I landed at Heathrow before 8AM and was checked in and showering by 10:30, not bad. Room service food was prompt and tasty.

Every staff member I encountered was polite, courteous, helpful and professional.

My only complaint was that my room was near the service storage room, which starts getting used very early in the morning, and while there was no noise from other rooms, it was audible from the hallway.

One side note: the WiFi is free IF you book directly through the hotel.

All things considered, a very pleasant stay and I would certainly return.",5,2015,06,03
133,Great room with excellent views,"Stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel as part of a business trip. Staff were very polite and willing to help with any query. Was given the hugely impressive Garden Room with stunning views over Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. The room was spacious with a sizeable double bed and lounge area and a comfortable bathroom. 

Situated within a couple minutes walk of Kensington High Street Underground station and with a bus stop just outside, it is perfectly placed for visiting the rest of London. It is also a short distance from other sights such as Royal Albert Hall, Natural History Museum and Kensington Palace.

Breakfast was delicious with so much choice both in terms of continental and English options.

Would recommend this hotel for couples and families alike.",5,2015,06,03
133,Relaxed stay with great location!,"Everything you need in a London Hotel-great location,service, cleanliness. Room nicely proportioned, great bathroom with separate bath and shower. Impressed by quality and reasonable price of of room service-have the Pizza!. Staff really friendly, charming and helpful.",4,2015,06,02
133,Fabulous stay & dinner ,"This was our second stay at this lovely hotel. We took advantage of the very easy valet parking, and had a great room over looking the city sky line and park. The main event was dinner in the Min Zhang restaurant. Such attentive service & great food - we had pre ordered the 'signature' duck, and we're not disappointed  ",5,2015,05,31
133,Perfect King size rooms,I tried two rooms at this hotel. The Queen room adn the King room. The Queen room is kind of small but it is really nice and new. The King room is PERFECT and one of the biggest rooms I have ever stayed in London. It os really nice with perfect seating area facing the Hyde Park. This hotel is really nice and It was really good price the night was 300-350 USD for the King room.,5,2015,05,27
133,Great for people in wheelchairs,My husband is in a wheelchair and the staff could not have been more helpful or attentive. All the staff helped me in which ever part of the hotel we were in. Breakfast was also exceptionally good. Choices were excellent and most of it cooked to order for you - except on Saturday morning. Concierge were great at letting you know how long it takes by taxi to get to everywhere we were going. Room service was so quick i could not believe they had time to cook everything!!,5,2015,05,26
133,Excellent day and evening,"We held our annual conference at RGH and must say from start to finish everyone that we dealt with either beforehand or on the day were more than helpful and courteous.

Our event manager Martin went above and beyond the call of duty helping us to organise a very busy day and evening. No one said no which made it probably quite hectic for the staff but a breeze for us when he had last minute requests.

They kitchen even managed to swap out a food order at the last minute, placed incorrectly which saved us an unhappy face at the dinner table.

The rooms were beautiful and the price and location you're staying in are acceptable considering the quality you are receiving.

Hopefully we'll be here again next year and can enjoy another fuss free event!",5,2015,05,26
133,Perfect,"Absolutely nothing to complain about following my stay at the Royal Gardens. Granted, it was a bargain and I certainly wouldn't pay the full price for our room, but as a crash pad for one night it was great. Music was playing when we entered the room, and the front desk helped us with every query. The whole thing was seamless. 

The slippers were very cosy and might have come home with me. We had a smoking room but you would not have known - it was as fresh as new. 

Great location surrounded by bars and restaurants and all in all a bit of a treat!",5,2015,05,26
133,Memorable stay,"This is an excellent hotel situated in a gorgeous location. We stayed in a garden room and had fabulous views over Kensington gardens. Our room was beautifully appointed and both stylish and functional.

I was delighted that the bathroom had a separate shower to the bath and quality toiletries provided. There was a comprehensive and interesting choice at breakfast and I can recommend pancakes with maple and bacon - delicious! In the evening we visited Berties bar where I tried a new cocktail - Dark Candy- which was gorgeous.

Everywhere is beautifully arranged, comfortable and well kept and displayed. Best of all was the delightful and helpful staff who really made us feel special staying there. Everyone we met spoke to us and I was pleased to bump into the manager on the steps of the hotel to tell him how much I was enjoying the stay at the hotel.

I can't wait to return to London and have another opportunity to stay at this wonderful hotel.",5,2015,05,24
133,Great experience with wonderful staff,"I stayed here for a 3 day long business conference and it was top notch all round. The staff were wonderful and facilities very good. 
The general manager raised the experience up a level by adding a very personal touch and hoping to welcome me back in the future. 
Wholeheartedly recommend this venue for both business and leisure should you wish to be in the luxurious heart of London.
Looking forward to returning soon.",5,2015,05,23
133,A Palace at Kensingto,The Royal Garden Hotel adjacent to Kensington Palace never fails to deliver on my expectations. This wonderful hotel on Kensington High Street compares favourably with the best in the world. The rooms are fantastic and spacious. The staff are great and I would be hard pressed to seek alternative accomodation in London. ,5,2015,05,23
133,Fab hotel - look forward to returning,"My husband and I stayed for 2 nights in an executive room. Our room was spacious and modern with a lovely large bathroom with a bath and separate rain shower (I can't stand showers in baths !)
Check-in was fast and smooth and all reception staff were friendly.
During our stay we visited the Min Jiang restaurant on the 10th floor which is lovely and well worth a visit. We also really enjoyed Bertie's Bar, great selection of drinks, very attentive service and lovely comfortable seating. However, it was only open from 5pm, even at weekends. It would have been nice if it was open earlier at weekends for a nice cocktail or glass of wine after a busy morning in London shopping !",5,2015,05,22
133,Fantastic hotel perfect for Albert Hall,"Stayed here for one night only for a concert at the Albert Hall which is literally a 5 minute walk along the same road. The hotel is very plush from reception through to the rooms, I would have given it 5 stars if it were not for the poor service in the restaurant where we were seated and subsequently ignored for approximately 20 minutes whilst trying to order lunch and then again to re-order drinks with staff doing everything they possibly could to avoid eye contact.",4,2015,05,21
133,"Conference - superb service, fabulous hotel","I organised a conference at the RGH in May 2015. I can't praise the hotel enough. All staff were superb - they couldn't do enough to help. Efficient, friendly, wonderful service throughout. Gorgeous and plentiful food. I'll definitely use the RGH again and highly recommend it to all event organisers.",5,2015,05,21
133,Excellent service. Superb food,"If you want to enjoy first class food with excellent service in a great location you cannot do better than visit this hotel. From the moment we entered the staff did everything possible to make us feel welcome.We enjoyed delicious cocktails and really tasty food beautifully served and our waiter Daniel made the evening with his polite friendly and 
efficient service. A place not to be missed.",5,2015,05,18
133,A Relaxing Weekend in Kensington,"Stayed here with my husband and toddler for a weekend away. Normally our trips to London are hectic but staying at the Royal Garden made our visit ever so relaxing. From the moment we arrived, we were well looked after. Our 2 year old was given a Royal Garden teddy which he was made up with. We were escorted to our room by the reception staff and were made to feel special. The room was perfect as a base for us and our little boy. The cot was a lovely high quality bed although our own bed was so big that we just all slept together. We had an amazing view overlooking part of Kensington Gardens. The light that flooded into our spacious room was delightful. Our toddler loved it and we had such an enjoyable stay. We were spoilt with lovely walks around Kensington Gardens and Kensington's residential streets, a spot of shopping and not to mention all the lovely eateries nearby. We enjoyed the Royal Garden's breakfast and what was nice was it was a relaxing environment in the restaurant and we didn't feel uncomfortable with our toddler as he likes to run about and isn't exactly quiet! Excellent staff who always made you feel welcome and nothing was too much trouble.",5,2015,05,17
133,Very nice hotel in the heart of everything,This hotel was very nice indeed. Stayed for 2 nights. Managed to check in a bit early. Staff on reception were very helpful and friendly. Room was a good size. Managed to get a room one on the 10th floor. I recommend a garden facing room. Breakfast was really good with lots of choice. Good for shopping and good links to rest of London. Oh and free WIFI!!,5,2015,05,17
133,Mr& Mrs J A McShane,Recently stayed 4 nights service second to none the staff very friendly and extremely helpful great location ****** one of the very best We have stayed at numerous hotels in a number of countries .Look forward to staying when we are next in London.,5,2015,05,17
133,Royal Garden Hotel was the beginning of a wonderful week in London,"The Royal Garden Hotel made us feel like royalty (excuse the royal reference) but the staff could not do enough for us. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel like our needs were their priority. The room was very comfortable with all the necessities and a few extra treats thrown in. The hotel is next to the beautiful Kensington gardens where a stroll at the end of a busy sightseeing day is a lovely way to unwind. It is close to excellent transport, good restaurants, and we loved every minute of our stay.",4,2015,05,17
133,Average,"Was there couple of weeks ago,  the hotel is OK and the conference room is good.location is far if you are going for attractions.staff are very friendly,  the food is limited .the near by park is beautiful.nothing special about the rooms .but service is excellent.",3,2015,05,15
133,"Superb location, overlooking Hyde Park","Super large hotel in a great location, with many shops and restaurants just a short stroll from the hotel. Nice area of London, felt safe even late at night. We enjoyed an amazing evening at the Albert Hall, again a short stroll past the Albert Memorial. The hotel room was contemporary and roomy encompassing a sitting area which allowed an interesting view of city life! On our first evening we dined in the hotel restaurant and chose the Chinese menu which was supplied from the hotels Chinese restaurant on the upper floors, which was delicious! Please do not miss the opportunity to catch the Alexander McQueen exhibition when visiting.....it is absolutely spectacular!",5,2015,05,14
133,Beautiful hotel with attentive staff.,We stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel as it was close to the venue for a party in Knightsbridge which we were attending that evening. On arrival we checked in and found the staff to be very curteous. We were accompanied up to our room and shown around. The room was spotless with a small but very well appointed bathroom. We had views across London for miles.  The room was tidied and the beds folded down while we were out in the evening.The check out time was not too early and so we had a lie in in the morning. It was a most enjoyable stay.,5,2015,05,14
133,Great location,"Booked here for a family gathering. Checked in and was given a smoking room which stank, we were moved to another room with not such a good view.  Wifi was not free expected it to be free in this standard of hotel. Didnt have breakfast as it was ¬£25 per person, even  London prices this was expensive. Nice touch from the  managment leaving wine and chocolates for parents as it was their 50th wedding anniversary .",4,2015,05,13
133,Lovely Stop off for Lunch,"If your in Kensington, pop in and have a drink and a spot of Lunch, Staff are lovely and food is wonderful after a long day going to the Museums and shopping, you never know who you may bump into as well, as a lot of famous people have stayed here, I'm sure I saw Joey from Friends(Matt) but I was too scared to go and ask :)",5,2015,05,12
133,"Great hotel, perfect location","We stayed for 3 days in April, 2015.  This hotel is the perfect location for anyone wanting to tour London's main attractions.  This was our first visit and we were pleased to find it was directly next to Hyde Park and we could see the gates of Kensington Palace from our room!  Our tube stop was 5 minutes away.  There were numerous stores and restaurants next to the hotel.  Every staff member we encountered was wonderful and had great service.  Everyone at the Concierge desk was extremely helpful and gave us wonderful maps and directions.  The breakfast was ridiculously expensive so we only ate there once for breakfast.  The dinner was good and not terribly expensive.  You expect to pay more for a dinner, so it wasn't so shocking.  London is just an expensive city so  don't be surprised! This hotel is highly recommended and we would stay there again.",5,2015,05,11
133,Elegant Modern Palace Suites,"Attended the ZAA GALA 2015 and the setting was fantastic. It's the 2nd year I have been & this year I had to write a review. 

The Palace Suites are perfectly set with their own entrance. The layout of the suite makes it easy for you to have your registration desk leading through huge doors  to a bar area which served as a cocktail area. The couches at the far end leading to the lobby provided a relaxing place to chill away from the bustle.

The main function room was decked to 5 star perfection modern & sleek - fitting 29 tables of 10 and leaving enough room for a dance floor & stage. 

The food was amazing and my compliments to the chef for the succulent Angus beef. The staff were polite , well coordinated & they kept the drinks coming. 

One place that most people never comment about are the toilets but I have to give these special mention to the ladies ...not only because of the number of cubicles -the design & layout is well thought out & a great use of space. 

",5,2015,05,11
133,"Great hotel, great location","Stayed here for the night.
Right next to Hyde park..
Good shopping at your doorstep. .
Bus ride to Harrods....
Nearest tube is Kennington park...
Did not try the bar or food.... 
So many restaurants to choose from a stone's throw away..
Would stay again and recommend",5,2015,05,08
133,Top class hotel in great location,"Everything about this hotel is classy.  Rooms are big for London and the porter and concierge staff are extraordinarily helpful.  The breakfast was excellent and probably about average price for London, and the Internet was very expensive, so try and get this as part of your package.  Location is great, right next to Kensington Palace and with many, many choices of restaurants, both classy, value for money and chain restaurants nearby.  If you can find a well priced package here, take it.  It is certainly 4 to 4.5 star hotel with services and facilities to match",5,2015,05,07
133,Flawless,"Flawless hotel.
From our early check in to our late check out everything about our stay at the Royal Garden Hotel was flawless.
Great staff, professional, polite, attentive and always with a smile.
Spacious room, 1st class bed linen and towels, nicely furnished.
Very close to High Kensington Underground Station and bus stops. Great shopping variety and restaurants in walking distance,
This is the place to stay in London.

Very close to High Kensignton Underground Station and bus stops, 
Look no further, stay here.",5,2015,05,06
133,"This family-owned hotel is managed superbly, as though the staff are part of the family.","This family-owned hotel is managed superbly as though the staff are part of the family; with many of them having been there for years and years.  How good it is to be greeted by so many of them, from the senior management down to the chamber maid; all with a big welcoming smile.

Is there any wonder we return there whenever we are in London?

 Oh, for our next visit of more gentle pampering.  Please!",5,2015,05,05
133,Lovely evening at Park Terrace Restaurant,We visited the Royal Garden Hotel for dinner last week and were very impressed.  The young man at the restaurant desk was very welcoming and showed us to a table in the bar area so we could have a cocktail before our meal. All three of our courses were delicious and very well presented .. the starter risotto was amazing as was the souffl√© for dessert! Our waiter Daniel was really friendly and professional at the same time and helped to make a really special evening.. he is a credit to the hotel.  We will certainly visit again when in London!,5,2015,05,05
133,Afternoon tea - excellent for gluten & dairy free,"One of our group can't eat dairy or gluten, and the Royal Garden Hotel staff were excellent about it. She had her own full afternoon tea with cakes and sandwiches, all of which looked and tasted great. She was thrilled to be able to join in the full afternoon tea experience with the tiered plates and everything. 

We went for a hen party, we were given our own booth, and although told we had to leave by a certain time, we were never rushed. Service was excellent, as was the food - especially the cinnamon scones! I had the chai tea, which was nice but a bit strong once it had brewed for a while. Good value at about ¬£35 including a glass of champagne, pot of tea, strawberries in balsamic, finger sandwiches and a selection of cakes & scones.",5,2015,05,05
133,Park Terrace Restaurant,"We have just been to the restaurant at Royal Garden Hotel, but it is really excellent. We did not stay  in the hotel.  The food is wonderful, and the service could not be better.  The waiters go out of their way to make sure that you are happy with everything, they are friendly and put you at your ease.  Eating there makes a truly enjoyable evening.",5,2015,05,04
133,Front desk staff,"I was unable to find details of a booking of a hotel I'd booked in the area via Last Minute.com.  I knew it had the name 'Royal' in it and it was in the general area of Kensington.  It was 27 April, coming up for 10:00 pm and I was feeling a little desperate.  I wondered into the hotel, asked if I was booked in (I realised it was unlikely as this hotel looked a bit too up-market).  The kindly staff at the desk confirmed I wasn't booked in and I explained I couldn't access my email account to check the booking and all my credit card told me was that it was through Lastminute.  He then phoned someone at Lastminute and found my booking at an establishment a block away.  He insisted on carrying my bag down the steps and offered me a map.  I am so grateful for their kindness, they helped me without me being one of their guests.  A credit to the human race, thank you.",5,2015,05,04
133,Afternoon tea simply fabulous!,"A group of us enjoyed a wonderful afternoon tea - our only complaint that we couldn't eat all the cakes, too may delicious sandwiches first! We were offered a section of different teas, interesting small sandwiches, scones, cakes and pastries in a relaxing atmosphere.",5,2015,05,04
133,Superb,Undoubtedly the best hotel we have ever stayed at.  Service and comfort is second to none.  Beautiful attention to detail and a fantastic view over Kensington Palace gardens. This is our second visit and the standard of service has not slipped.  As last year we were visiting the Royal Albert Hall for a show and this hotel is so convenient with it's own underground car park. We will be back again.,5,2015,05,02
133,Excellent ,"This is one of the best hotels we stayed in 
The room is spacious and has a living section full of sun 
The view to the Kensington gardens is wonderful 
Wifi is free
The staff is very helpful and professional 
The  location is very good 
The management attends to any thing you require 
Will definitely visit again 
I highly recommend staying here",5,2015,04,30
133,High Expectations Delivered,"We stayed at The Royal Garden for a  long weekend. You expect something special from a hotel that is rated five stars and we were not disappointed. For the entire stay we were the most important people of the moment. The entire staff, from reception to restaurant, concierge to housekeeping were extremely attentive, polite and helpful. 

Our room was spacious as was the king size bed where we slept like logs. The air con worked a treat, including blast chiller mode after a warm day walking the streets and parks. Despite being in London we were not disturbed by any traffic noise or late night revellers (do they do that in Kensington?) even with the window open. Our room overlooked Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. For all this luxury and convenience we did not think the price extortionate.

It's been twenty seven years since I last stayed in this hotel. Can't think why it's been so long.

However, it's nice to know that although times may change, The Royal Gardens very high standards have been maintained.",5,2015,04,30
133,Close to royalty! Treated like a Princess.,"I stayed here and was so impressed with the service. I am returning for a longer stay later in the year. The conceige was helpful at all times, polite and helpful at all times. The office staff were professional in assisting me in finding a doctor. 
I had a afternoon tea which was delicious and fresh and very generous in size. The breakfast which was included in the accomodation there was a great choice to choose from. The rooms were spacious and with lots of natural light.
The location was fantastic close to public transport, a great shopping variety in walking distance, the park was just outside the door. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who wishes to stay in Kensington.",5,2015,04,25
133,Almost 5 stars,"A very pleasant stay that was almost a five-star experience.  This hotel enjoys a lovely location at the edge of Hyde Park and close to shopping  restaurants, and Kensington High street tube station.  The regular room is very small but modern, clean and arranged to maximize the space.  Nice built in seat by the small desk with a nice view to the park.  I got a good rate (3 nights pay for 2), so I got value for price.  There are so many good hotel choices in London so hotel has to really hit the high points to compete for my money or offer an exceptional bargain.  This hotel almost reaches its ambition of being a high-end option at a reasonable price.  Helpful, friendly, professional staff.  Clean and quiet.  Very comfy bed with notably nice linens and pillows.  Downside -  only one bath towel ( women with long hair need two), I stayed 3 nights and although i used the little bottles of shampoo and lotion, they were never replenished.  I used the little package of 2 cotton pads the first day and they were never replaced.  Only one little bar of soap that I had to move from the shower to the sink for use.  Warning - bring your hair condition - they do not supply.   Ordered coffee from room service - small pot and it cost 10 GBP.  expensive!  Go across the street to Starbucks!  good free wifi.",4,2015,04,25
133,Cannot fault this hotel,We held our conference and awards dinner here and accommodated many of the speakers in the hotel. All were very complimentary about the accommodation and the food. . The staff across all areas of the hotel are excellent. e.g. the maid on Floor 7 who waited and looked after my bags after I had to go back to Reception to get a new room key.,5,2015,04,24
133,Relaxing afternoon tea on a Sunday,"Had a very chilled afternoon tea with two friends.  We had comfy soft seats near the window with good views of the park.  Very much enjoyed the sandwich selection, scones and cakes assortment.  The presentation of the teas was a bit more interesting than most places as we were left with the selection tray and we could open the jars to smell the teas.  The staff were very friendly and attentive and the atmosphere was pretty busy but very relaxed.  The pianist came on later in the afternoon which as a nice touch.  Not as impressive as other 5 star hotel afternoon teas I've had (e.g. patisserie quality/presentation, no option for extra sandwiches, cakes, etc.) but very good value for money in comparison when considering the overall package (we paid just ¬£26 each).  Would definitely recommend it!",4,2015,04,23
133,Excellent place to stay,"London hotels often dont offer the quality one expects. I certainly enjoyed my stay in this property- the location is good- right next to the park, the staff polite and friendly and the room very comfortable. Note that this is one of the rare hotels to have a european plug- useful attention to detail. I also enjoyed the Chinese restaurant- excellent quality.",5,2015,04,23
133,Lovely hotel,"Attending a concert at the Royal Albert Hall, we chose the Royal Garden Hotel as it was closest and seemed to receive good reviews.  We were not disappointed.  Our spotlessly clean, well-appointed room looked out over Kensington Gardens.  So not only was it quiet, but we had a lovely view from a big picture window.  All the staff we encountered were smart, polite and helpful.  I particularly liked the nice little touches like the coffee/tea and water being replenished during the turn down service, and the incredibly fluffy, huge towels.

The only very minor downside was a slightly hair-raising entry and exit to the car park.  Okay, so we drive a Chelsea Tractor, but the ramps are tight spirals and need to be taken carefully.  Unless you drive a small car, in which case I would imagine it could be quite good fun.

It‚Äôs not cheap, but it‚Äôs worth every penny.  Can definitely recommend.",5,2015,04,23
133,Very nice & clean,I liked this hotel. Had a pretty view of Kensington gardens. There were every kind of outlet in the room which was great bc I had broken my outlet converter. People were raving about the Asian restaurant upstairs but I never had a chance to try it.,5,2015,04,22
133,Excellent!!!,"We stayed 4 days at this hotel  in May 2014,travelling from Toronto.
Everything is beautiful, superb location and the room was very clean.
Toiletries are such high quality.
From our room located at the 9th floor we had an amazing view to Kensington gardens.
The breakfast was not included, but there are plenty of amenities around to enjoy all your culinary preferences.
It truly deserves 5 stars !",5,2015,04,22
133,Mr ilan geva,"Spent 3 days in a conference and stayed for 2 more for fun.
The location is unbeatable, the staff helpful and accommodating. Ask for a room overlooking the gardens, awesome calm view. The trim was spacious and very comfy with a corner for business needs, and in case of emergency the business center helps.close to many restaurants, shopping and tourists attractions.",5,2015,04,21
133,Yet another wonderful stay !,"Spotlessly clean room, luxurious bathroom, wonderful park views and excellent dining in Min Jiang with faultless service all round.
We can not imagine staying anywhere else when visiting London ; The Royal Garden is our favourite !!
Thank you everyone.  We very much look forward to our next visit !",5,2015,04,21
133,Midweek Stay at the Royal Garden Hotel,"The service provided by this hotel is quite remarkable. Without exception all the staff are so helpful and friendly. Our room was not ready at 2pm (the designated time), and there was no hesitation by the reception tean, for an upgrade to be provided at no additional cost. The quality of the food offered for lunch, and breakfast was exceptional. I would certainlt recommend that you book durectly with the hotel, since there are discounts available for meals and the car parking under the hotel. Wil certainly visit again.",5,2015,04,20
133,Great stay as always,We stay at least a couple of times and year and have always had a lovely experience. The staff are all very attentive and welcoming.  The views are superb looking out at the London skyline and Kensington gardens and Hyde Park. The hotel has a nice personal feel and we would highly recommend. The location is good too.,5,2015,04,18
133,Miss S,"As a treat my partner and I booked this hotel for my birthday and chose the celebration package .Upon arrival the staff at the front of the building were very attentive to the person in the car before us, but once they pulled off and we drove up they completely ignored us and had a conversation for a short while before coming up to the car and asking if we were here to use the car park.When we said we were here for both their attitude changed.Once we were shown to our room, Although the room was nice there was nothing 'wow ' about it.As part of the package included champagne and luxury chocolates, the say itself was a nice sunny day and both of these were left on the table directly in front of the windows.So upon our arrival the chocolates were already melting and the ice in the ice bucket also.

The air conditioning was not working and we called to report this and was told they would sent someone straight up.20 minutes later we were still waiting and when we called down we were told that it had been adjusted from their end.When I stated the room was getting hotter and hotter, they sent someone 10 minutes later who informed us that the valve had been closed from the previous winter and that the problem was now fixed.To be fair the issue was only slightly better and we continued to over heat and resorted to opening the windows which made it very loud in the room from the traffic noise.

We also has a issue using the shower as there seemed to be a problem with water drainage to the plug.So we had to take quick showers  and then wait for the water to go down for the next person to use as well as the temperature barely lukewarm warm.

All this was mentioned at check out and although polite the staff member offered a polite apology but little else.We spent a substantial amount of money to us as well as using the hotel restruant  and feel that I didn't get the experience that I had dreamt of.The room was noisy at night sleeping at the front and we both woke up hot and exhausted.",3,2015,04,13
133,Great Service. Great location,"Conveniently close to Kensington Gardens and within a walking distance of Hyde park, this hotel puts you in the heart of London. Only downside for me was it's modernity and I'm a history buff; many others will see this as a bonus. The service is professional and the staff well trained",4,2015,04,12
133,All round top quality experience,"I stayed at the Royal Garden with my husband and 19 month old son over Easter weekend for 2 nights. Overall, we had a fantastic stay. The rooms are lovely, they provided a proper cot and bedding for my son and even gave him a small teddy bear on checking in. The breakfast was good quality as well and overall service was very good. Really nothing I could find fault with at all. HIghly recommend.",5,2015,04,12
133,So disappointing,"I'm still here and everyday I've been let down at this supposed 5 star luxury hotel.

First at check in, the receptionist offered me a free newspaper, a table booking for afternoon tea and the WiFi password. I didn't get any of these.

Then the duty manager left a plate of fruit in my room that was spoilt and brown. 

Today, I ordered for dinner, a pasta aglio olio with chicken and vegetables, and this was after asking if they can do customisations and being told yes. Guess what I got? A plate of pasta, a plate of grilled chicken and a plate of veggies. Shocking considering what I asked for is the easiest kind of pasta to make.

Wonder what's going to happen next.",1,2015,04,11
133,Beautiful Hotel,One of the beautiful hotel in Kensington with quality professional service. Very comfortable well equipped rooms. Very close to tube station with great places nearby to hangout. Very beautiful view of Hyde park from some rooms. Great bar and restaurants to have quality food. Very Royal. Everything about the hotel creates great ambience and memorable visit. ,4,2015,04,10
133,A little luxury,"Stayed here on Good Friday with my sisters.  Had a lovely room overlooking Kensington Park.
Dined at the Park Terrace restaurant and found the staff attentive and friendly.  Exceptional service all round.  I think you would be hard pressed to better the service anywhere in London.",5,2015,04,09
133,Best hotel in London,"We stayed at RGH for the first time on honeymoon 37 years ago and have been coming back regularly as we love this hotel, the ambience and staff. Well done to all concerned for making the hotel so welcoming. The Park suite (403) is amazing and one of the best rooms we have stayed in anywhere in the world.",5,2015,04,09
133,40th Birthday,"My fiancee surprised me with a trip to London for my 40th Birthday. We stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel. We stayed in a lovely room looking over Hyde Park on the fifth floor. Room was excellent and very spacious . After checking in we headed out for the afternoon , once we arrived back later in the afternoon , there was a complimentary bottle of champagne and some chocolates , waiting for us in the room , which was a lovely touch.
We had lunch in the hotel and were very fortunate to bump into "" Rock Royalty"" the one and only Brian May from Queen. 
We had breakfasts in the hotel which were excellent , a great choice of fruit , cereals , pastries and cooked. All the staff were very friendly and helpfull. We had cocktails one night in Berts Bar, which were excellent.
Location of the hotel is very good , there is a tube station 5 mins walk along Kensington High Street . And has been mentioned in other previous reviews , the Albert Hall is only a 10min walk away as well.
Overall i would definelty recommend this hotel., and i will stay again some time in the future.",5,2015,04,06
133,"Great, modern hotel, very convenient","The Royal Garden is a good quality modern hotel, suitable for both business and leisure travel. It has everything you need, and is convenient walking distance to vast parks, the best shopping, countless restaurants, the Royal Albert Hall, museums, etc, etc, etc.",4,2015,04,06
133,Great memories!,"We stayed 4 nights on a group tour, and the service was fantastic.  The  most memorable is the restaurant on the ground floor.  Most of the time the service was great, the waiters and waitresses were very attentive.   The food was absolutely wonderful.  I do not drink very many alcoholic drinks, but the waiter presented me with a wonderful jasmine green iced tea decorated with grapes draped over the glass.  Also love the music that is played in the restaurant.  The concierge is awesome as well!",5,2015,04,04
133,Fantastic Stay,"Everything about our stay was fantastic from the moment we arrived. This was a surprise trip for my partner's birthday and he was not disappointed, the garden room l booked had a stunning view of the park. All the staff were so friendly and polite and our visit was so enjoyable. Thank you!",5,2015,04,04
133,Disappointing!,"Chaos at reception, no one cares and you just get excuses. I was trying to celebrate an important anniversary and saved for ages. I feel robbed, disappointed and sad that I can not get my time back again. Staff need to realise that not everyone can afford to throw money away at poor service and that their total indifference can break your ability to relax and enjoy your hard earned break. Luxurious suite when we eventually got our room but bad service spoilt entire stay.",2,2015,04,02
133,Great location and excellent service,"We stayed the night at this hotel while attending a performance at the Royal ALbert Hall and the location could not have been more convenient, about 8 minutes walk!  Our room had a garden view and was well appointed and comfortable.  The staff were all extremely helpful and knowledgeable.

There is a NCP carpark under the hotel offering guests preferential rates and it was definitely worth using it (the hotel is outside the London congestion charging zone).  However, the ramp down into the carpark is a very steep and narrow spiral and requires a certain courage to navigate it.  And a small car!

Definitely an hotel to return to.",4,2015,04,02
133,Top class service in the heart on Kensington & Chelsea,"We stayed 1 night on Saturday night for a romantic break and could not have chosen a better hotel. I used some BA airmiles for this mini break and i have to say the hotel lived up to its 5 star rating. From the moment we checked in we were treated as if we were their special guests which is unusual in some hotels. The room we had was so quiet at night we could not hear any late guests going to their rooms or leaving early so our sleep was not disturbed at all. The doors close very slowing which allows them to shut quietly without the usual slam etc. We chose to upgraded the breakfast from the continental to the English and glad we had because the choice was fantastic and very Delicious with an egg man to cook your eggs to your own taste. The only downfall was we had to wait too long for our tea and coffee, but that was the only thing i can say negative. We were due to check out at 12 noon which is standard but we both felt a little tired after a late night on saturday and also the clocks had gained an hour so we lost an hour but i called reception and asked if we could check out at 2pm and they graciously said we could - very happy about that! So in summary I would stay again and recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in this location.",5,2015,04,01
133,Afternoon Tea,"We visited for the afternoon tea and it was absolutely lovely. The staff was friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was calming, elegant and relaxing. We enjoyed every minute of our visit and I will happily return.",5,2015,03,30
133,Very nice hotel in a great location ,"Stayed Friday to Sunday

Took the offer to upgrade our booking via booking.com to a garden view room which overlooked Kensington gardens. And was lovely 

Not so lovely is the check in request for ¬£20 per day for wifi access because ""you booked through booking.com"". Staggering!

Needless to say given even the coffee shops provide wifi the hotel saw the error of their ways & soon offered free access. 

Breakfast buffet is lovely but expensive and the coffee is dreadful. Plenty of restaurants around so try them. 

This is a classy hotel & on the right deal worth the extra money ",4,2015,03,30
133,Afrernoon tea,"We visited here for afternoon tea with a couple of friends.The staff were very helpful when we advise of dietary requirements.

Lots to choose from and the food was lovely. Atmosphere was very calming. We will more than likely visited here again and possibly stay at the hotel.",5,2015,03,29
133,Superb in every way,"We had an excellent stay in this beautiful hotel. The staff were superb on reception, in the bars, and in the dining room. The domestic staff were superb and our room was immaculate! Facilities are perfect! Highly recommended.",5,2015,03,29
133,Excellent Stay,"This was my second stay and I intend to book it again. The setting is gorgeous next to  Kensington Palace and the park. Rooms and staff exemplary. Notably, Mick, the concierge was so helpful and made the extra effort in securing difficult event tickets. My highest recommendation.",5,2015,03,29
133,Five Star Excellence,"I stayed here for two nights last week with a conference delegation.  This is a truly excellent hotel in every way - a great location next to St. James' s Palace, great rooms and conference facilities,  great food (even the mass catering for the conference was very good indeed), and very welcoming and friendly staff.  Well done, and thanks to all!.",5,2015,03,28
133,Park terrace restaurant,"Exemplary service,Daniel and Odon were really attentive and the setting was fantastic. The food was amazing. I highly recommend this hotel. Every couse left you wanting more. All the staff where extremely kind and smily",5,2015,03,28
133,Park Terrace Resturant,"Excellent  service, amazing food. The staff could not do enough to for you.
We were a party of seven  and Daniel was attentive and service was stunning.
The atmosphere was great and the service did not interfere with our conversation around the table.

",5,2015,03,28
133,Girlie catchup,"Great hotel, all staff can not do enough to make sure stay memorable one. The cocktail bar on the 10th floor amazing...  Excellent location for taking in all the attractions, plus right next to the park for pleasant walks.",5,2015,03,23
133,Very Good Service,"Stayed at Royal garden hotel in february and this is my first review.The hotel is on hyde park with direct access at the right of the hotel for nice walks through the park.At the left of the hotel is Kensington high street with shop,restaurants,and coffee shops.There is a shopping mall 15 minutes drive by taxi.The rooms are a confortable size with beautiful views of the park.The 2 onsites restaurants are high quality.The service from the staff is very good,always available and happy to help.Salam Ya Madjid.Thank you for all your help and see you in summer.Yes I would recommand this hotel.",5,2015,03,22
133,"Great Experience, Next Door to the Queen Mum, Loved Every Aspect, See Below - Why Not?","The hotel I usually stay in the Chelsea area is being remodeled during this year.  

This hotel is beautiful, the rooms nicely appointed, tastefully decorated, with high end finishes.  The staff is by accommodating and they are fully staffed. The restaurant is excellent. 

Best of all, this location in Kensington is next to the Queen's home, and many of the  embassy's.  Immediately behind the hotel is a beautiful tree lined street with many of the stately embassy's and what appears to be Royal property based upon the designations.  

The street has armed guards at both ends, and the driveway is gated, however one can walk on the sidewalks and does not need special permission. It's a quick walk to Kensington Palce and one can see it immediately behind the hotel. 

Why not be neighbors with the Queen?",5,2015,03,17
133,What 5* should be,"Stayed here for the weekend just gone based on just the reviews this hotel has received. Service is extremely important for myself and this hotel definitely excels in this area. Take note of the reviews that mention the excellent service as they are not wrong! This hotel was so clean, relaxing and cosy that I will most likely return if I stay in Kensington again. The gym was fully equipped and open 24 hours. Room service was incredibly prompt and laid out immaculately. The bathroom is lovely, spacious and again very cosy. (Also noticed top of the range Grohe fittings on the shower and bath although the shower is one that sprays water in all directions, not particularly great but nothing serious enough to put me off).",5,2015,03,16
133,perfect location,"beautiful hotel, great location for shopping, Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens and Royal Albert Hall. Staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough to help we were upgraded to Royal Suite it was fantastic would definitely stay again.",5,2015,03,15
133,A Brief but Very Enjoyable Stay,We stayed overnight after seeing a Show.We upgraded to a room looking over Kensington Gardens which proved worthwhile as it was in a quieter location.The room was very clean as was the bathroom.We also took advantage of a reduction on breakfast which was offered on booking.Full English was excellent and cooked to order.The staff were very professional and helpful and the booking process went smoothly.Our trips to London are infrequent but we would not hesitate to stay at this Hotel again.,5,2015,03,15
133,It is an excellent hotel with excellent staff and service,"I have stayed in several hotels in England before but have never seen such a high class hotel with excellent cleanness, well-furnished n cheerful helpful staff especially Mr Aaron Street. The position is wonderful, central to all needs, restaurants, shopping n entertainment. The rates are wonderful ",5,2015,03,14
133,Afternoon Tea in a relaxing atmosphere,"We had a wonderful afternoon tea in the Royal Garden Hotel. It had a relaxing atmosphere with the piano being played in the background. One of the waiters came to our table with 10 different loose teas in jars. The waiter explained the 10 tea and asked us to select. I requested Darjilng and my partner went for the Tai green tea which came with a tea ceremony. The waiter returned and went through the tea ceremony of the Tai green tea which was rather impressive, and poured the tea into a glass teapot ready for use. Then he returned with my pot of Darjiling tea. I looked for the tea strainer, but then noticed it was tea bags! It made a mockery of the tea ceremony of different loose teas. Apart from that, the sandwiches followed by the cakes and scones was scrumptious. We felt we would return to stay over and maybe another afternoon tea.",5,2015,03,14
133,Super service,"We have just spent a night at the Royal Garden hotel on Kensington High Street, London. What a pleasure it was. All the staff were very warm and welcoming and very helpful. This hotel is within easy walking distance of the Royal Albert Hall, which was the reason for our visit.
Our room was clean and comfortable with a good sized bathroom. The free flapjacks with our tea and coffee were delicious. We felt very valued as guests of this efficiently run hotel and to finish it all off on a high, the breakfast was very good quality with a choice of cold continental or a hot buffet. We would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a quality stay in the hub of London.",5,2015,03,14
133,Excellent location,I like this hotel very much. Excellent location. U can take bus or taxi anywhere at good rates. Chinese restaurant Minjiang is top-notch with splendid view of Kensington Gardens and London. Can be a little noisy but this is what to be expected from such a convenient location.,5,2015,03,14
133,"Unbeatable location, great facilities and excellent business/family hotel stay","I have stayed at this hotel several times, both on business and on boarding school exeat weekends with my daughter.  I think it is a well kept secret amongst the frequently travelling cognoscenti, and as is perhaps evidenced by the fact that it is often fully booked when one tries to make last minute bookings. Online reservations are often seamless- tip is to book through their site to ensure that you get free Wi-Fi during your stay (it can cost as much as ¬£20 a night when you book through sites like booking.com). Attention has always been given to room preferences - non smoking, hypoallergenic bedding etc indicated during bookings so do avail yourself of these. The rooms are very well maintained and you will often get a knock from housekeeping calling to check that everything is to your satisfaction. I love the room service menu even though it is not generally cheap, but there is enough variety even in the late menus to make up for this, plus several lovely restaurants near the hotel if you fancy a change. My one gripe has been that notwithstanding recording my  frequent flyer number with each booking the promised air miles have not to my recollection ever appeared on my airline records! and when I checked with Virgin it appeared that this was not an airline issue.  On about two occasions I also found one of the young ladies attending at reception (perhaps early trainees?) not particularly helpful or knowledgeable with extending bookings for late checkout (which I indicated that I was willing to pay for), whereas within a couple of hours the gentleman who took over for her shift sorted things out very efficiently. It may however, be that the hotel was genuinely fully booked. Other than these minor whinges the Royal Garden is a top tier, excellent hotel and usually worth every penny (and the deals that they offer at up to 33% off for early bookings are incredibly good value for the area). The proximity to the park, location on the High Street, the incomparable cuisine served at the awesome Min Jiang restaurant at the top floor of the hotel and excellent 24-hour business centre make this,for me and my family, one of the very best all round places to stay in London when we are looking for a short stay business/family hotel.",4,2015,03,06
133,Old fashion Hotel,"The bar loudness goes all the way up to my room.
They allow smoking in some rooms so they stink.
The breakfast i over priced
To get some positive into this review.
The staff i good
Good location 
I like the old fachion style.",2,2015,03,06
133,Lovely stay.,"A Little late with my review, but having had such a good experience here as a family I wanted to share why....

We stayed here in December for easy access to the Royal Albert Hall and to be close to the shops.
The location is ideal. 
Overlooking Kensington palace and so close to many restaurants & bars this was an ideal choice.

We had stayed here as a couple before, but this time with our young son too.

From the moment of arrival we were greeted warmly and our son was given a gift of a rucksack with handy snacks and gift.
Our room was not ready, but our luggage stored and a promise of a call as soon as the room became available.
We were called a few times to advise that the room was ready, I was very impressed with this in particular.

As expected, the room was large with a separate seating area, where the sofa converted to a bed.
The standard of cleanliness was excellent. 
All in all the room was large, but welcoming with a beautiful bathroom, a view of Kensington high street and in truth better than I last remembered.

We did have breakfast the next day, and were both pleased with the good selection and quality.
The restaurant has a lovely setting overlooking the park. Staff were very helpful and friendly.

I would whole heartedly recommend the Hotel.
The level of service was excellent, the rooms spacious and clean.
I felt they catered for a broad range of travellers and worked hard to deliver.

",5,2015,03,05
133,You guys are awesome,"Checked in here after 15hrs of flying.
Got to the counter feeling tired and worried about what we were going to do till check in.
WOW what a surprise not only was our room ready but we were upgraded to a executive suite.
The room is fantastic and Diana at front counter was gorgeous.
Fully recommend this hotel it's very central and staff are great
",5,2015,03,05
133,Great Stay in London,"Perfect location, easy access to the underground and good restaurants up and down the high street. 
The room was big and comfortable with plenty of storage space, very quiet even though the room overlooked the busy high street. The staff where very friendly and the breakfast was a feast I would have rated it five stars but was a little disappointed that the Wi-Fi had a cost so its 4.9 for me.",4,2015,03,03
133,"Lovely hotel, great location","I stayed here for 3 nights late February and it really lived up to its 5* rating. The room was quite big for London with really comfortable beds and the bathroom was lovely! The room was so clean also and everything seemed brand new. The hotel backs onto Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and although we didn't have a Garden view room and were facing the High Street, we didn't hear any noise from the street below. The hotel is very quiet with no noise from the corridors/adjacent rooms and check-in was very easy even though we had arrived an hour early they accomodated us and got us a room immediately. The concierge were very helpful, we visited the bar one evening and received good service here too. The rooms are fully modernised with USB chargers, music in the bathrooms and ipod docks. A few things could have been improved such as coat hooks in the room and complimentary bottles of water were only provided in the evening turn-down service which seemed a little odd but other than that I couldn't fault this hotel. Taxis were readily available and the tube was only a 5 minute walk away. There are plenty of restaurants nearby and bars although getting into the centre of the city is so easy by tube so you're not tied to the area. A 5* experience all round!",5,2015,03,02
133,Can't get better than the Royal Garden!,"Have stayed here on many an occasion. It is perfect for work, family trip or romantic weekend. The staff are amazing and very friendly. This is a 5-star hotel with 5-star service but without the pomp of some 5-star hotels in London, which helps you to have a really comfortable stay.
The rooms are well designed and look out over Kensington High Street or the fabulous Kensington Gardens, which is wonderful for a morning run or stroll after breakfast.

The food is wonderful. Breakfast has a large choice of hot and cold items. The Chinese restaurant on the 10th floor - Ming Jiang is very good and perfect for that special evening.

You really cannot beat the location of this hotel, surrounded by shops, restaurants and right across from a juice bar if you want to stay healthy, the tube is a short walk and taxi's plentiful from outside reception.

On the last stay I read that they are providing scooters for kids to scoot through the park. A great detail for families. Oh and it's walking distance to the Royal Albert Hall. 

What more do you need for a great London break?",5,2015,02,28
133,Great Stay,"Stayed with my husband end of february and enjoyed our stay.The hotel is right on Hyde park with Kensington palace as neighbours.Quiet and great location with easy access to the airport and downtown with shopping areas museums and restaurants.The room was pretty comfy and a good size cleaned to a high standard by the housekeeping team.The hotel staff are always happy to help  with a big thanks to Majid at the front door who was always eager to help us with giving directions,helping with our shopping bags,calling taxis,very efficient.Thanks Royal Garden and see you in Summer.",4,2015,02,28
133,Second stay with the Royal Gardens ,"Best hotel in London. Very friendly staff. Great rooms. Free wifi. Fantastic cleaning our cleaner was Christina T. She was fabulous. 

Nothing was a problem. Doesn't matter how much money you have. They all treat you with the same standard.  

No hidden costs at all. Lovely shower and bath soaps. 

Will always stay here when we are in London ",5,2015,02,25
133,Fantastic family weekend break,Stayed at the weekend with the family and we all had an amazing stay. The staff were all very friendly and made us feel all feel welcome. The quality of the rooms and service received was great. The highlight of stay for the children was using the hotel's scooters and exploring Kensington Gardens next door. The perfect place for a quality family friendly stay.,5,2015,02,24
133,Renewed my faith in service,"we checked into the RGH because our house had been burnt down that morning.  When the hotel found out what had happened to us they gave us a lovely suite overlooking the park and really took care of us.  Everyone from the chambermaid to porters went out of their way to make us as comfortable as possible.  The staff there were a really bright spot in an otherwise awful time for our family.  My 14 year old who lost everything in the fire, really enjoyed staying the hotel and it really cheered her up to be there.  When we left, reluctantly, all the staff lined up to say goodbye
Obviously my circumstances were expceptional but it seems to me that a hotel that goes out its way to help a family like ours, is a good thing.  I can't recommend it highly enough.",5,2015,02,24
133,Amazing Hotel! Amazing 1st Anniversary!,"We managed to get an incredible deal on this hotel in cental London and I can honestly say it's beautiful. 
Situated right in the heart of Kensington we had a room overlooking Kensington Palace and the private street where all the foreign royalty live and of course, Kensington Gardens.  
The staff on check in were polite and very helpful. The room was well equipped and we were upgraded to a garden view room on account of it being our anniversary. The staff had placed some VERY tasty chocolates on the desk for us to enjoy. Room was very modern and had everything you could need. The bathroom was contemporary with a lovely deep bath and complimentary toiletries which were handy. 
We didn't eat in the hotel but did go for a sneaky look at the very fabulous looking restaurants, the food looked incredible and I'd be sure you were in for a treat if you did choose to eat there. We popped next door for dinner to Wagamammas and then went on to see the beautiful night time lights of the big city. On our return we were delighted to discover the hotel has a turndown service! The room was gently lit and soft music was playing soothingly throughout the room (and bathroom!) The corners of the duvet were folded back ready for us to slip in to. 
Slept quite well considering it was a diffrent bed however as it was a double I did find myself giving my husband a sly dig in the ribs a few times as he was invading my space. The wind howled at the window which I found relaxing but could imagine could be annoying to some although no draft came through. 
In the morning we went out for breakfast as I couldn't rationalise spending ¬£50 for two breakfasts (but that is normal for a posh London hotel.....I'm just tight) we checked out at 12 (nice having a 12pm checkout as standard instead of 10am!) And the concierge happily took our bags whilst we went out for the day. Eventually we returned around 6pm to collect our things and we bid farewell to this amazing Hotel that I doubt we will ever be able to afford to stay in a again, it was a real life experiance for us to remember.
Thank you to all the staff for making our very 1st anniversary one to remember.
Mrs Barnett ",5,2015,02,23
133,Amazing,"We've just come back from a 3 night stay at this incredible hotel.  I've tried to find faults but couldn't find a one.  The service was amazing, nothing was too much trouble for any of them. They were attentive without being over the top. Like all brilliantly trained and professional staff they seemed to know what we wanted before we did ourselves. The room was large and well appointed and the bed was very comfortable. I appreciated the endless supply of complementary bottled water.  All in all if you want to treat yourself to a London break - you can't go wrong staying at this hotel.  We will certainly  be returning.",5,2015,02,23
133,Fantastic trip to London,"My family and I just returned from an awesome trip to London. We went to visit one of my sons who was studying abroad. We were recommended to stay at the Royal Garden Hotel and it worked out perfectly. The hotel was a five minute walk from my sons London dorm room which was an added bonus.  We arrived at the Hotel early on a Saturday morning , we had just flown in from New York. My expectation was to drop my Bags at the Hotel and begin my exploration of London, I figured my rooms would not be ready at 8:30 am. To my surprise the Hotel gave us an interim room to : change , wash up, store our stuff. When we returned in the evening our bags were all transferred seamlessly ,  to our permanent rooms. All staff members were extremely helpful and courteous. The Concierges were the best, they helped us plan activities , secure tickets , etc... I can't compliment them enough. The daily breakfast was fantastic and all of the staff in the restaurant were very friendly and helpful. My wife has family in the UK. We decided to host a family get together in the hotel restaurant. They staff did an awesome job of setting up a great table and a great event. I can not say enough about what a great time my family had at The Royal Gardens Hotel. Additionally great restaurants within waking distance , museums , etc.",5,2015,02,23
133,I love this hotel,"I always want to stay here not only for their lovely staff and comfortable rooms but also for the amazing Chinese restaurant they have on the roof! It is now a ritual for me to check in and immediately order some clay pot sanpei, garlic pak choi and some jasmine tea from room service...",5,2015,02,23
133,"Luxury Hotel, Great Chinese Restaurant","Stayed here at the end of January with my wife on a Company event - this is a wonderful hotel, with excellent staff and the best ever Chinese meal in the Hotel Restaurant - you must try it.
Could not fault the facilities, room service for breakfast was on time, excellent selection and of a high quality.
Beware the underground car park has quite a narrow spiral entrance but plenty of secure parking once you get there !!
Recommended for a Romantic, luxury treat",5,2015,02,22
133,"Good old fashioned service, faultless","In my opinion the most important element of any hotel is the quality of the beds. At the Royal Garden Hotel I experienced the best nights sleep on the comfiest bed I have found anywhere in the world.
Add to that the superb food, where my only disappointment was that I was too full to eat as much of the delicious food as I wished, with plain good old fashioned service and you have the perfect recipe for a first class hotel.
The icing on the cake was the parking facility adjacent to the hotel.
To summarise: Perfect location; Perfect service; Perfect food and a Perfect nights sleep.",5,2015,02,18
133,Lovely hotel... Shame about the beds!,"It really is a lovely hotel, but the bed was horrendous! The pillows shrunk to nothing under pressure, there was next to no bedding of any substance and housekeeping didn't really seem to care. Stayed in a 4 star the night before which was much nicer.",3,2015,02,18
133,Impeccable,"We enjoyed a four-night stay at this well-located hotel just steps from the Kensington Gardens. Our room was beautifully appointed, with a very comfortable bed. Lighting was excellent. Our window overlooked the Kensington High Street--always interesting. The bathroom included a deep tub and separate shower. Did not try the bath, but it looked great. Service was excellent. Fitness center was surprisingly large and well equipped. Internet worked well. We were completely happy with our stay. Highly recommended. ",5,2015,02,16
133,Wonderful Stay!,"My husband, daughter and I stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel for 10 nights while vacationing in London.  With such a long stay, we had the opportunity to meet many members of the hotel staff: concierges, restaurant staff, housekeeping...everyone was so genuinely friendly and helpful!  It is a lovely, upscale hotel, however it does not have a pretentious or stuffy atmosphere.  We were extremely happy with our stay and would return in a heartbeat!

To my knowledge The Royal Garden is the only hotel which is connected to Kensington Gardens or Hyde Park.  All others are across very busy streets.  We loved the tranquil view of Kensington Palace and Garden.  

We found the best price booking directly through the hotel.  We also got free wifi which is not always the case when booking outside of the hotel.

Our favorite restaurants near the hotel were:
Strada (Italian)
Il Portico - authenic family run Italian (several blocks away)
The Giraffe - inexpensive, good for breakfast
Aubaine - Excellent breakfast, we DID NOT ENJOY OUR DINNER
Park Terrace (hotel restaurant)- Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, good food.  The ""casual side"" is priced well for the nice atmosphere.

Good authentic British Pubs:  
The Greyhound 
Elephant and Castle",5,2015,02,15
133,Outstanding service,"My wife and I came up for pre-Valentines night in London and have stayed in many four and five star hotels .

We had a king size bed which was slightly firmer than I would have liked ( the Marriot hotels always seem to have the most comfortable beds , that I judge others by ) . Would have criticised the lack of tea making facilities, but apparently they were in the room ( 214 ) , but needed to be Sherlock Holmes to find them !  Quality bathroom , large shower , but if you are like me and built like a prop forward the inward opening shower door is a challenge to get out of  and you could get a burnt butt by having to breathe in ( I did !) . They should have outward opening doors , but other than that the bathroom was superb. Great choice of TV channels movies especially the naughty ones !  

What made it for us was the service - OUTSTANDING !  We had a light meal and evening meal in the bar and restaurant . Excellent food and cocktails , but I must compliment the Hungarian waiters and the Italian bar waiter on superb service . I have not had this standard of service in London before . I lived in Dubai/Abu Dhabi and Oman where excellent service is normal  The concierge was very helpful as my four wheel drive was too high to get in car park underneath the hotel . 

The hotel is in Kensington so not close Oxford Street , but the beautiful park is right next to the hotel .",5,2015,02,15
133,Birthday surprise!,"Planned a trip in London for my partners birthday and the hotel made the trip complete. 

It was grand, beautiful and much better than the Hilton we'd stayed previously.The location was a walk away to the station, also our bedroom was huge and luxurious and finally it was close to the park, it really was lovely.",5,2015,02,15
133,Great for parking too,"We had tea and cocktails in the bar before heading out for dinner. Fantastic service and made to feel very special. NCP car park under the hotel is an excellent place to park, especially if you are going to the Royal Albert Hall.",5,2015,02,15
133,Return to our Most Favourite Hotel to Celebrate a Very Special Occasion,"To celebrate my wife's 70th.Birthday (on the 21st December, 2014) I invited her to dinner at our favourite Restaurant, the Min Jiang, at our most favourite Hotel, the Royal Garden, in our favourite city of London. We have stayed at this hotel on four previous occasions,the last being for 3 weeks over Christmas / New Year (2012/13). Carol accepted with great joy the prospect  of travelling to London (from Brisbane, Australia) to once again enjoy the magic of a London Christmas while staying in the comfort and warm hospitality of the Royal Garden Hotel. I informed Hotel Management of our plans to celebrate Carol's 70th. during the reservation process.

The warm welcome we received on our return to the Royal Garden was just a taste of wonderful times and surprises to come. Management had reserved our favourite room for our stay - room 937 has a splendid view of the London Skyline and Kensington Gardens - the changing scenes of this view through morning, afternoon or night - in sunshine, rain or fog were so enchanting and beautiful. The Room Service Team kept our room in immaculate condition - so it was always a delight to return to a warm, welcoming room  and relax with a wonderful view after our busy London sight seeing activities. Comfortable beds and a quiet room made for restful nights.

Hotel Public areas are all first class. Dining facilities are excellent and cosy ""Berties Bar""  provides an intimate atmosphere for that late evening drink. Breakfast in the Park Terrace Restaurant is the perfect way to start the day. A pleasant greeting welcomes you to the restaurant while being shown to your table of choice. Choices of Breakfast food are varied and delicious -  complimented by exceptional service from the Park Terrace Team - we enjoyed the option of having a Full English Breakfast when we were really feeling hungry (such tasty food). We also enjoyed evening dinners in the Park Terrace restaurant - food was excellent and featured signature Asian dishes which are from the menu of their sister hotels in Asia -service was outstanding.as usual.

Peking Duck at the Min Jiang is truly a signature dining experience - we enjoyed an Arrival Dinner, Carol's 70th. Birthday Dinner and a Farwell Dinner at this Top Class Restaurant - all magnificent and most enjoyable dinning experiences - food so different and delicious - accompanied by excellent service by the Min Jiang team + a stunning view of London at night. Surprise!  Surprise! - a beautiful Birthday Cake for Carol and a rousing rendition of Happy Birthday from Min Jiang Team Members - a most enjoyable 70th Birthday Celebration.

Another special event organised through the Hotel was a combined visit to Kensington Palace followed by High Tea at the Royal Garden. Kensington Palace proved to be a fascinating visit, as was the relaxed and enjoyable stroll through Kensington Gardens to and from the Palace. High Tea back at Royal Gardens was delicious - exotic tea recommendations + tasty High Tea food all made for another enjoyable experience & Surprise! Surprise! the pianist played Happy Birthday for Carol while we were enjoying this fabulous experience. Another unexpected surprise was the Champagne Breakfast that management had arranged for Carol on the morning of her Birthday. We certainly felt like royalty as far as the way we were being treated during our stay at the Royal Garden Hotel.

As highlighted in our previous reviews we so enjoy staying at this hotel for the ease of access to all London attractions and the wonderful personal service we receive from the Royal Gardens Team. Numerous Buses stop right outside the Hotel and take you to different parts of London + it is only a short walk to the High Street Kensington Tube Station (which is on the Circle Line) and this facilitates easy and speedy access to wherever you wish to go. The Concierge Team are always so helpful with bookings and reservations + directions of how to get there - nothing is too much trouble for them.  Always a warm and friendly welcome back upon our return from our London sight seeing activities.+ ""How did it go to-day?"" and 'What's on the agenda for tomorrow?""

In conclusion we so enjoy the wonderful ambience at the Royal Garden Hotel - the excellent service from all Hotel Departments clearly focussed on truly Outstanding Customer Service + warm friendly greetings & immediate assistance from all Team Members who displayed a genuine interest in us - these were the hallmarks of our most enjoyable stay at the Royal Garden. Finally the Team were absolutely wonderful in the way they looked after Carol and kept on surprising her with thoughtful and special 70th Birthday Celebrations and in so doing made her 70th Birthday such a memorable occasion. We look forward to our next stay at our most Favourite Hotel!

133,Fit for a king - and your little prince/princess too,"You cant get any closer to Kensington Palace and Hyde Park.  The views over the park are spectacular and you get a cool fold-out panoramic guide of the landmarks.  We had a suite (highly recommend it, esp if you've got kids and can afford to treat yourselves) - and the whole experience made us feel like royalty.  The kids loved it too.  They get a cool rucksack packed with all sorts of useful and fun stuff - and at every twist and turn, various fun packs are handed out by the lovely staff.
A pleasant stroll to the Natural History Museum and Science Museum, Notting Hill and Portobello Rd.  And for hanging out in Hyde Park, reception will lend you a micro-scooter and helmet, football, rugby ball and skipping rope.  If you just want to hang out in the hotel, to keep the kids entertained, they'll lend you all kinds of old-school games. The food is absolutely fantastic.  The chinese restaurant is the best we've ever had (and the views from the 10th floor are knock out).  The menu 'for our young guests' is impressive, (veggie cottage pie and lentil casserole, pan seared sole fille and then usual stuff like spag bol, pizza).
I'm sure we'll be back.  I'd rather save up and have one or two nights here than have more nights at a cheaper hotel.  We got a great deal with a family offer booked direct with the hotel, so keep a look out for when they come around.",5,2015,02,12
133,"Great Hotel, Good Location","Just returned after a 3 night stay, as other reviewers the location is very good, bus station right outside and the tube is about 5 mins away, Had room overlooking Hyde Park so very quiet, housekeeping staff was excellent with all the detail required, turn down, complimentary water, and other excellent amenities, room was clean and comfortable. We were offered free wifi for the entire stay, nice touch. Would definitely stay at the Royal Garden hotel on my next visit to London.",5,2015,02,12
133,Great place to stay in the city,"My Husband and I have just enjoyed a night at the Royal Garden hotel. We stayed in a suite on the 7th floor which looked down Kensington high street which gave a great view. The room was great, with a lovely bathroom. We had the continental breakfast, which was fine. The cooked breakfast was a little step at ¬£25 but we were in Kensington. Probably the beat part of the stay was I left my phone charger behind. Once I got home I telephoned them and they sent it to me recorded delivery. I offered to pay but was not charged. I do not think you can beat that service. Hope to stay again.",5,2015,02,11
133,Royal Garden Hotel. Perfect accommodations/service,"Centrally located (the bus stops right in front of the front door; a 4 minute walk to the Underground). Near boutique and department store shopping, local pubs/take-out a few steps away; excellent concierge services (never got lost). Contemporary - designed rooms encourages a comfortable and relaxing visit.",5,2015,02,09
133,Excellent Location,"This hotel is nestled on the edge of Hyde Park in London. It located steps away from all sorts of interesting things to see and do. Harrod's is just down the street and a little farther will take you into Soho, which is ripe with restaurants and shops.
The staff was quite good, and the room was incredibly comfortable. I had a great view of the park which was a joy to look at every morning when I woke up. Of course it is pretty expensive, so it is not for the individual(s) looking for a cheap getaway. But if you want to feel a little pampered, and you want to be a short taxi drive from some interesting places, this is a great place to stay.",5,2015,02,08
133,Great!,"Loved this hotel! Great room, great view of Hyde Park, amazing food at the restaurant, impecable service, absolutely nothing to complain. Would definitely recommend and go again. We had an amazing experience there last september. The area is also great for anyone who wants to be close(ish) to Harrods (it's across Hyde Park, whici is behind this hotel).",5,2015,02,07
133,Wonderful Stay at the Royal Garden,"I stayed at the Royal Garden from the 28th of January to the 31st of January, 
It is my opinion that this is a great hotel and you feel at home from the moment you arrive till the moment you checkout, The staff at the reception was very helpful, and even though we arrived before the normal check-in time the front desk took the extra effort to have us checked in and we could proceed to our meeting feeling fresh.
The room was relatively big in size, and the bathroom is spacious.The bed was comfortable, 
The breakfast was good though I felt that the quantity was a little in excess for One persons need. Failed to provide complimentary water and had to use the water from the Tap in the bathroom which was disappointing.
The hotel is at short distance from all the sight seeing spots
Overall the stay was pleasant and will have no problem recommending the Hotel to anyone who is interested in peace and quite and comfort.",4,2015,02,06
133,Another great stay at the Royal Garden Hotel.,"I stayed at the Royal Garden last year, and was lucky enough to be able to visit again recently.
In my opinion, this is a great hotel, the welcome from the moment you arrive, to the moment you leave is wonderful. The reception staff were very helpful, we arrived before 2 pm, so the front desk, took our cases so that we could go to explore Kensington, and have lunch.
Our room was a great size, and the bathroom is a reasonable size, with a fabulous shower, and fluffy bath gowns.
The bed was comfortable, but it did get chilly in the night in the room. But it was an extremely cold night!
The breakfast was disappointing again, some of the fruit was rock hard, or looked appealing but had no flavour. The tea was cold, literally the water could've just come out of the cold tap.
However, this is a great, helpful and friendly hotel with good facilities in a lovely location, (loved the view of the Palace again) Would recommend a stay at the Royal Garden and hope to stay here again!",5,2015,02,05
133,Ten out of ten!,"The best service of any hotel that I've ever stayed in as a guest. Lovely, friendly, helpful staff thoughout the hotel. I had a problem with both my iPad and iPhone whilst I was there and the staff at the Business Center were wonderful in sorting it out. Particular thanks in that regard to Yinka for his courtesy and help. Difficult to single anyone out, but Lucy at reception created a great impression when we checked in, Mick the concierge was a gem, and the restaurant staff were superb in every respect. Good food, served with courtesy and attention to detail.

Three of us had separate rooms on the 8th floor for a three night stay.  The rooms were quiet and comfortable with excellent attention to detail. Good air conditioning and great beds. And a nice touch - a bedside radio where I could listen to Radio Three ! 

Although I lived in London for over 40 years before moving to Norfolk, this was my first stay in a London hotel. I was hosting two well travelled visitors to the city, one from Germany and one from Madrid /Canaries. We were all very impressed indeed - and having Kensington Palace Gardens on our doorstep was an extra bonus. I will certainly stay there again",5,2015,02,03
133,1 night bed after flight from maldives,"This hotel is a nice hotel , the only problem was the breakfast price ,, but I was in a hotel in Kensington high street so it was expected to be fair .... with the tip ¬£30 ... 
very clean and a perfect place to sleep after a long flight so I have no bad words to say about this place ....",5,2015,02,02
133,Is this a 5* experience?,"To be honest, I was just looking for a bed for the night. As one other reviewer commented, the bedrooms are on the small side and not very impressive. The gym, I believe, is offsite. I didn't try the restaurants so cannot comment. I felt charging ¬£20 for wifi in this day and age is ridiculous. I was expecting a lot better.",3,2015,02,01
133,Great hotel. Great location,"Really great hotel. Rooms a bit small, but made up for by first class service. They really seem to care about looking after you. Location is ideal right on Kensington high street. I would definitely stay here again. ",4,2015,01,28
133,Good hotel,"A frequent traveller to London, this was my first stay at the hotel.
I found the amenties to be of a good standard.
However, I must highlight the excellent and helpful service I received from the gentleman at check in, to the waiter at Berties and most especially the lovely lady hotel operator who also runs the Business Centre. 5 stars to each of them.",4,2015,01,28
133,One of the best hotels in London,Fantastic hotel which is in a perfect location to visit London. We were visiting the Royal Albert Hall to see a show and used this hotel as our base. The hotel staff were amazing and Mick the concierge was so helpful even when we asked for an after show restaurant.  Would definitely recommend this hotel as we have visited several in London recently and this one stands out over and above all the others from the quality of the room right down to the help and assistance from all the staff. Will definitely use this hotel again in the future when visiting London.,5,2015,01,27
133,Fantastic,"Fantastic hotel which is in a perfect location to visit London.

We were visiting the Royal Albert Hall and used this hotel as our base.

The hotel staff were amazing and even remembered our room number hours after checking in!

Would definitely recommend.",5,2015,01,25
133,Lovely London Stay,"Wonderful hotel next to Hyde Park, great food (especially the Terrace Restaurant) in the hotel, the service and staff were excellent.  Go to the oriental restaurant on the top floor for a beautiful view of the park and the area.  We will be back! !",5,2015,01,25
133,What a 5 Star Hotel Should Be,"Spent a night in their garden view room, which was of a good size (for London). Functional set up within the room and very clean. View of the park on a cold English winter day is not spectacular but pleasant nonetheless. Dined at Min Jiang the following day for their trademark duck, meal was nice albeit pricey (as expected) yet service was excellent. 

In fact guest service provision is what makes Royal Garden a true five star hotel in my book: you see too many plushy establishments in London these days with less-than-satisfactory customer service and the dedication to details. 

A minor point that I hope the management could address in the near future:

Upon check in, the receptionist who was very professional and warm handed us the room key with the comment 'the room number is very easy to remember'. Indeed as we were allocated to room 444. Yet being chinese we had a right giggle as 4 sounds the same as 'death' in our native language.  Imagine if we were of the older generations: the sight of the number 4 and the fact that it was presented to us by the hotel (which has a oriental root) as a 'plus point' would cause some upset. You would think they would be aware of such cultural implications as a long established venue in the heart of a capital city... 

Other than that, I would recommend the hotel to anyone visiting London for various purposes.",5,2015,01,23
133,Fantastic,"We stayed here as a guest of a company we work with and all i can say is wow. Fabulous room with a lovely park view and in a great location close to all of the major attractions that London has to offer. 

The food was excellent- both breakfast (great variety of choice and quality) and evening dinner. The view from the room (as mentioned earlier) was fantastic and the attention to detail in the room is brilliant- very comfortable and very quiet. 

Staff were friendly and professional- all in all an excellent stay!",5,2015,01,19
133,Expected alot from this hotel and it delivered!,"First of all a big thank you to Margaret at reception for welcoming my girlfriend and  I on arrival. She was very swift and polite here as well as when we wanted to leave some bags at reception after checking out which was no problem at all.

We were given an executive suite which I believe was an upgrade.The room was immaculate with the very small exception of the television remote control being grubby and some staining on a chair fabric chair but that really didn't bother me. The bed was quite firm but actually got a very good nights sleep on it. I was given a code at check in for the wifi which was complimentary to my surprise as other reviewers had stated it is an extra fee.

There really is nothing to fault here at all and being my first stay in a 5 * hotel I can see what all the fuss is about and hope to stay again in the future.

The only downside was it was only for one night! 

Thank you :D",5,2015,01,18
133,Excellent hotel,"Stayed for just one night at this hotel which has a great location on Kensington High Street next to Kensington gardens, with a bus stop right outside giving easy access to other parts of London.

On arrival was pleased to have a free upgrade to a King size room, which was a good size with a nice view overlooking the High Street.  It was spacious and comfortable with excellent facilities.

The check in process was very smooth and all the staff that we dealt with were excellent, all being very friendly, courteous and helpful, helping to make the whole experience very pleasant.  I hope that I'm able to stay at this hotel again some time!",5,2015,01,16
133,The Meaning of Service,"What I appreciate is SERVICE and this hotel has it! 
My flight was cancelled and hence I was delayed an entire day. Tyrone, hotel front desk, not only knew my name when I checked in, but he also worked tirelessly to make sure I received a credit for the night paid and missed.
That is a lot more than I can say for Travelocity's incompetent reply to the issue when posed to them since they were the booking agent.
My hat also goes off to another agent whose name I neglected to take. Upon ,my questioning of the lack of WiFi she quickly arranged for complimentary access despite that being conveniently excluded by the inept Travelocity.
My only qualm  with this otherwise lovely hotel is the outrageous ¬£20  for continental breakfast (¬£25 full English). Other than that it was a perfect stay and one I would consider not only repeating but recommending. However please do yourself a favour and book direct at www.royalgardenhotel.co.uk and forget the Tavelocitys of the world!",5,2015,01,12
133,Fantastic,"I have always had an affection for this hotel as I worked here for a short while over 40 years age when it was one of the newest model iconic hotels of the time.
And needing a central London hotel for a romantic weekend seemed the obvious choice.
I was not disappointed, the staff were friendly and welcoming, the rooms wonderful and very well presented. Roual in Bertie's bar was especially helpful!.
Probably not the cheapest hotel in London, but you get what you pay for.
A great experience, will definitely use again when coming to the UK.
Thank you all for a great weekend.",5,2015,01,12
133,Great Location - Terrible Bed!,"We stayed 2 nights here this weekend and Loved the hotel,the room, the location and the staff.  But they need to throw out the mattress from our room. It was hard as a rock and had a huge crater in the middle of it. The worst 2 sleeps of my life!",4,2015,01,11
133,Fantastic Hotel!!,"We have stayed in London on numerous occasions but this hotel is definitely the best yet!  From the moment we arrived, all the staff were professional and friendly.  We were given a room with picture windows overlooking Kensington High Street, amazing!

We had room service on three occasions, due to late nights and early mornings.  Absolutely faultless, food and service first class.

I have to say it wasn't a bad price for a five star hotel and it is definitely five star.

If you fancy treating yourself to a bit of luxury for a few days, go here, you won't be disappointed!",5,2015,01,10
133,Always A 5 Star Experience BUT...,"We are repeat guests here and it is the corporate choice of hotel for my VIP clientele who are international sportsmen (including my partner who i was travelling with on this occasion). Check-in is friendly and efficient, the surroundings are plush in an understated manner which i like as it doesn't scream out, look at me etc. The clientele and guests at the hotel speak for itself. It really is a hidden gem of a hotel amongst the 5 star powerhouses scattered around London and is located in a fantastic part of London WITH an underground carpark which is a rarity for Central London and the surrounds. Rooms are small but spotless in general, however, we have always experienced one or two teething problems each time, which shouldn't really happen at a hotel of this calibre and priced at the higher-end. 

We are staying at the hotel tonight for example and even though the Receptionist graciously looked for a ""nice"" room to give us on the 7th Floor, we found the bathrobes dirty (and i mean with brown dirt marks around the neck, happily hanging next to the shower) and the bath mat with brown spots on it, much to our displeasure. The first time i stayed here the toilet got clogged and the television would not work - i was moved to a different room on that occasion.

The worst part of today's stay was that, while i was undressing, i heard the lady doing the Turndown Service opening our door and about to walk straight in without knocking! I called and complained to the Duty Manager who provided a half-hearted apology which was surprising given how good service at this hotel generally is. The very same thing happened to us at the Gatwick Sofitel and the Head of Housekeeping personally rang to apologise and then personally turned up with a bottle of wine so the Royal Garden could continue to learn about exceeding luxury brand expectations especially when walking in on clients in their underwear. 

The best part about this hotel is its staff. So friendly and so service-orientated and it is the type of hotel where service is old-school and traditional. The Park Terrace Restaurant is just amazing, the food is wonderful and the service is simply outstanding - one of the best restaurants in London. 

But do beware, Royal Garden charge for absolutely everything including internet access, parking and a ridiculous ¬£2 in 15 minute increments, to use the business centre (REALLY?! In this day and age?!)",4,2015,01,09
133,Rip off,"After paying nearly $400 per night, they demanded $40 per day extra for wifi. Everywhere else, wifi is included.
Also, charged for everything in mini bar even though nothing taken.
Lastly, kept significant amount on credit card well after full payment.",1,2015,01,08
133,Superb hotel,"I have staid in this hotel with my family five nights including new year's eve. It was the second time we have stayed here. 
We booked an executive room however we received a free upgrade to a park suite. The park suite consists in a room, a living room and two bathrooms. The suite overlooks Hyde Park and Kensington Palace.
The suite was very clean and well refurbished every day. In the evening the beds are prepared and you received a free bottle of water.
The breakfast is superb both continental and English. There are a large variety of brioches, fruit and cheese.
I strongly suggest this hotel",5,2015,01,08
133,Beautiful Hotel in Beautiful Location,"I stayed here with my Mother for one night on the 28 December and couldn't have been happier with the stay.

The hotel is in a fantastic location, right next to Kensington Palace Gardens, home to some of the most expensive properties in the world. It's close enough to Sloane Square and Oxford Street to make shopping stupidly easy! The tube station is about 5 mins walk away and a bus stop is conveniently located right outside.

The staff on the Check In Desk allowed us to check in early (12pm rather than 2pm) and were also nice enough to upgrade our room to a Garden View room (lovely raised seating area and view of the Gardens). They couldn't have been more helpful. 

The room was delightful and was much larger than most I have stayed in whilst in London. The bed was a large King size and the room was immaculately tidy. The bathroom was also roomy with a separate shower and bath. The mini bar was fully stocked with everything you might need and tea and coffee facilities were also available. Toiletries were by Penholigan's and smelt beyond gorgeous! We also got complimentary wifi.

We also received a turn down service with free bottles of water which was a nice touch.

The next day, as we had some time from check out to leaving London, we were allowed to store our luggage at the hotel and collect it later which is a great facility.

Only two downsides for me but neither a big deal. The lifts can be heard depending on how close your room is to them but didn't cause too many issues. Secondly, we did request more teabags and milk from the concierge but these failed to turn up. 

Overall, I think I fell in love with this hotel and will definitely be making a return trip.",5,2015,01,07
133,"EXCELLENT FEATURES, UNFORTUNATELY OVERSHADOWED BY ""GREED""","We just returned home after a 4 day stay at the Royal Garden.

The hotel is located fantastically in the Kensington High Street area, with excellent transport connections (it's London, after all), many restaurants, all sorts of stores in a unique and very vibrant atmosphere.

Our rate was also not bad for the time of year.

Our room, however, was not what we expected. While fairly comfortable and well appointed, it directly overlooked Kensington High Street. Not a bad view, except for the fact that the window insulation was not installed correctly and there was an excruciating traffic noise most of the time, essentially making a good night's sleep impossible.

If at all possible, insist on getting a room facing the other side (Kensington Park).

Additionally, there is the issue of WIFI.  In this day and age when you can connect for free almost everywhere (we went to the Marks & Spencer store 2 blocks away), the hotel charges an OUTRAGEOUS fee of 20 GBPounds for 24 hours access.

I believe thet this is pure greed which demerits the whole experience of staying at the Royal Garden.

Admittedly, they let you connect for a short time at the Business Center's PC's to check mail or print boarding passes, but for a hotel of this category free WIFI should be the norm.

As if this was not enough, we had to make a 20-minute local telephone call, and got billed almost 40 GBP. This is ROBBERY in my book.

Conclusion, a sweet-sour experience.",2,2015,01,06
133,5 Star Luxury,"Fantastic hotel, with real 5 star luxury. We stayed over Christmas, the hotel is in a great location, approx. 5 mins walk to High Street Kensington. The hotel aesthetically is wonderful, the staff are very accommodating and the room service was great. The rooms were spacious and luxurious, with everything you could ask for. The only downside would be if you were looking for a boutique hotel as this hotel is rather business like. But would 100% stay again!",5,2015,01,06
133,Exceptional ...,"Very nice and comfortable stay, had a few days there by new year and decided to stay upon reading the reviews here, they are totally accurate, the hire staff are amazing, the rooms are spacious, and they take good care of the guests. The area is also nice and enjoyable as the bus stop is in from my if the hotel, with many food stores and restaurants.
Will definitely recommend.",5,2015,01,05
133,"Best hotel in London! (great for business, leisure or children)","I stay in London on a weekly basis for business & struggle to find somewhere I am really happy with. The Royal Garden hotel was recommended to me by a friend and I am very thankful as we stayed this weekend & it was BRILLIANT. 

Superb rooms - lots of space and beautiful views of Kensington Park. 

Superb staff - this trip was personal & I traveled with a two year old. The hotel staff organised treats for children, they are very accommodating and we felt welcome. In some hotels I have felt awkward with my daughter but not here. 

Location - perfect for the museums, shopping, 2 mins walk to the tube. 

Food - was excellent in the hotel, the breakfast was especially good. There is also a number of restaurants opposite the hotel if you want more choice. 

We didn't want to leave and go home - so I suppose that says it all really!",5,2015,01,05
133,Excellent As Always A*****,"My stay at the Royal Garden Hotel in December last year was as always first class.
My thanks for the warm welcome I received when I arrived and for making sure I had a relaxing stay during my trip to London.
I had tickets to an event at the Royal Albert Hall, which is within easy distance to the hotel, and thoroughly enjoyed the evening as well as the complimentary bottle of water and turn down service I received upon my return.
I will always stay at the Royal Garden Hotel while in Kensington, as the hotel is ideally placed for events at the Albert Hall and shopping on Kensington High Street.
I look forward to returning in December 2015!",5,2015,01,03
133,Wonderful stay...,"Spent two nights here whilst visiting the Horse Show at Olympia just before Christmas. Had a Superior Executive room which overlooked Alexandra Palace... beautiful room (lots of space and wardrobe/drawer space)  with a sofa which was converted each evening by the staff into a comfortable bed for my daughter. Have to comment on the bathroom which was huge and very luxurious. I would recommend booking direct as when I booked the hotel website was having trouble and I went through the booking process several times and when clicking to book it just jumped back to the start of the process so I booked through Expedia... NOT recommended as it was no cheaper and didn't include breakfast (which was ¬£25 pp or WiFi ..¬£20 per night extra making it an even more expensive stay. We therefore took breakfast across the road from the hotel at a caf√© named The Giraffe.... fab breakfast and very warm and friendly staff there too. Hotel had a calm, relaxed and luxurious feel without feel pretentious. Would defo recommend.",5,2015,01,02
133,"Superb staff, great location... but lacks character","Royal Garden Hotel has been a sort of landmark in my mind for a very long time. In the Sixties, my favourite uncle used it on business trips to London, finding it efficient and excellent. My aunt loved it's closeness to the Park and Harrods - in those far off days, Harrods was a 'must go' store. Not now.

My wife and I stayed in the Royal Garden in November and, frankly, were disappointed. 

Why? The service was impeccable. Our room was spacious and comfortable, with a view of Kensington Palace Gardens. But the hotel's public spaces are cold and entirely without atmosphere or character. This may suit those on a brief business trip, or tourists with little discernment. But for us, visiting London has always been about going to the greatest city on the planet. Period. London is a very special place, full of endless possibilities and interesting people. One's hotel must reflect those qualities. Sadly, Royal Garden does not. The place could be anywhere. Just another costly chain hotel. Sigh.",4,2015,01,01
133,Classy,"There are probably around 1100-1200 licensed hotels in London (just a guess) and picking a good one is a hit and miss affair ‚Äì hardly a rational process. As experienced travellers who spend far too much time in hotels two things strike us about London ‚Äì hotels are very expensive for what they are, and standards are often fairly low (especially if you are used to regions like the Far East). So it is easy to get it wrong‚Ä¶.
But if you pick the Royal Gardens Hotel you would get it right. Not a budget hotel, but not expensive by London standards, it offers a superb location, exceptional rooms and wonderful staff with an old-fashioned service ethic. We really enjoyed our time there ‚Äì and recommend booking a park-side room (you won‚Äôt get a view like it at any other hotel) via the hotel‚Äôs own web site ‚Äì which tends to have some interesting deals.",5,2015,01,01
133,Great Stay,"Spent 6 nights here in the run-up to Christmas.  Overall, it was an extremely comfortable stay.    The folks at the Front Desk and the Concierge were attentive and obliging - small technical issues with my room were rectified promptly.   In particular, I wish to thank Ms Diane of the Front Desk for her warmth, kindness and effort in making this weary traveller feel welcome  when she trundled through the hotel entrance at 730 am that Tuesday morning. 

Breakfast was included in the price of my room as was the wi-fi.  It is good to book direct!

The only fly in the ointment was the hotel switchboard lady who flummoxed my family and friends who called for me when she told them that 1. there was no one with my name registered at the hotel and 2. the room I was in was not occupied.    I raised this issue with the Front Desk and trust it has been sorted out.

Yes, I would stay again.",4,2014,12,29
133,How to have a great family Xmas in London,"We ,2 adults and 2 children arrived dec 23 after a 24 hour flight from Sydney  for a 5 night stay .
The hotel was welcoming and checked us in at 7.30 am to 2 adjoining great rooms overlooking Kensington Palace.
The room amenities and presentation are worthy of 5 stars as are the public areas and the impeccable service from concierge and reception to house keeping and room service.
The location is also well served for restaurants,transport and big brand shopping plus a great whole foods store .
All in all a fine choice that we will repeat on future London visits.

133,Get a garden view room,"I could have looked out of the window all day :) what a view, great location,  housekeeping is excellent , we didn't use the restaurants , but room service was good :) 
Make sure you walk up the street at the back of the hotel too, the most expensive addresses in England on the left, and Kensington Palace on the right, WOW",4,2014,12,24
133,You couldn't ask for anything more,"With some friends, I had arranged to attend a Carol service at the Royal Albert Hall so decided to stay at the Royal Garden. I had not been there for about 15 years. It had changed. For the better.
From the moment you arrive at the hotel you are made to feel welcome, from the Doorman, Reception staff, Concierge and all of the staff.
The bedroom was compact (I only stayed overnight so did not need a larger room) but was spotlessly clean with a full range of everything one might need. There is a turn down service in the evening.
The room service breakfast arrived bang on time with everything I had ordered and at a very reasonable price. 
The location is perfect for Central London - specially for Kensington.
I hope it will not be another 15 years before I have a reason to return.",4,2014,12,23
133,Love it!!!!,"I love this hotel! The staff are amazing and attentive. The location is absolutely perfect, with a lovely view of Hyde park. The room service is extensive and high quality. My favourite hotel in London! ",5,2014,12,23
133,Wonderful Winter Ball break,"We stayed one night at the Royal Garden Hotel mid November for a corporate Winter Ball which was being held in the hotel's palace suite. 

We found the hotel to be exactly as we would expect for a high quality London hotel.  Check in was a little slow but the staff were very friendly and thorough not to mention helpful with local information etc.  

The room was a little smaller than I expected but this did not detract from the quality of the furnishings or comfort of the room.  Every need was catered for e.g. extra plugs and USB sockets and speakers in the bathroom, multiple lighting options, desk with build in mirror and plugs.  The room was compact but ""bijou"" :)

Bathroom was well appointed with a space saving sliding door.  Lovely toiletries and a deep bath plus shower overhead.  

We enjoyed a fabulous weekend in Kensington which was made possible by the hotel allowing us an early check into our room.  Once checked in we left for a walk around Hyde Park and on to lunch then a browse of the Oxford Street shops.  The hotel is ideally situated.

The Winter Ball went very well.  Food and drinks all included were excellent quality.  The waiting staff very attentive and friendly.  When the evening finished we had a night cap in the hotel lobby bar before retiring.

Next morning a wonderful continential breakfast arrived to our room and we were spoilt with a selection of pastries, cereal and fruits.  Too much for us to eat it all. 

Thank you Royal Garden Hotel for playing hosts to our weekend.  It was certainly one to remember.",5,2014,12,23
133,Wonderful relaxing hotel a haven from the hustle & bustle,"Wonderful stay
Rooms spacious,lovely bathroom 
I took my Mum & two Aunts & it really made our trip to London feel extra special 
Staff on reception & concierge friendly & professional
Wish I could stay longer!",4,2014,12,22
133,Good Size Bedrooms,"I stayed at this hotel at an awards ceremony at the start of November.

The most memorable and pleasing thing about our entire stay was that the bedroom wasn't the size of a shoebox! Almost every hotel in London seems to charge a fortune for tiny rooms with no view but this hotel was excellent value for money with a room size that would've cost 2 or 3 times as much in other hotels. Maybe we just got lucky but I don't think that was the case.
The hotel has good transport links nearby and, if you're attending a conference at this hotel, the conference room is right at the bottom of the hotel and, therefore, not disturbing residents.

I'd definitely stay again.",5,2014,12,22
133,Perfection!,"This hotel is perfect in every way; fabulous location with views of Kensington gardens, luxurious accommodation and charming staff who all work hard to please. The bar is great, the Chinese restaurant superb and breakfast in your room with complimentary paper a real treat! My husband and I have stayed for the last weekend in December for the last three years and they have never failed to disappoint us. It's a perfect way to Christmas shop in Knightsbridge and enjoy a festive night in the city. It's not cheap but then neither does it feel extortionate, in fact it's worth every penny.",5,2014,12,21
133,winter holiday,"The hotel is in a great location, very close to different shops, restaurants and supermarket, in addition the hotel very close to the underground and other transportation, which enables you to access all of London easily. The room overlooked the beautiful Kensington Gardens, and was fabulous! Beds very comfy and clean , but the room is too small and with big bathroom. The whole stay was a delight!",4,2014,12,19
133,very nice hotel,"Recently stayed with the kids 
Great view of the park ,excellent breakfast and very central
Parking available under the hotel
Used the cocktail bar in the evening great service and staff very attentive",5,2014,12,18
133,Afternoon tea treat,"Weekend in London and wanted a break from the Christmas shoppers so decided to see if we could have afternoon tea. Even though fully booked for the tables next to the large windows the friendly staff seated us at a table for two just next to frosted windows. This did not detract from the tea, cakes and sandwiches. Not being a great tea drinker I opted for snow tea - I would highly recommend this variety, it's light and delicate. Even though you do not have piles of sandwiches and cakes we both left feeling full and decided it would be very easy to become used to the lifestyle we had experienced. Would recommend it to anyone who wants to chill out and relax. Staff are friendly and not over bearing.",4,2014,12,18
133,Pre theatre menu,"Dear Sir
I have to applaud the quality, presentation and value of your pre theatre menu my friends and I enjoyed in the Park Terrace on Monday 15 December 2014. The attention afforded us by your staff was excellent and whilst were not staying at your hotel our next visit to London will certainly involve an accommodation booking. With the Albert Hall being our destination that night your hotel proved the ideal location in addition a high street of shops to suit every need.
Again many thanks for a memorable meal.

Lindylou",5,2014,12,18
133,Beautiful hotel,"We paid a little extra and had a room that overlooked the gardens.  The room was very spacious and well furnished.  Very, very pleasant and a good location.

I did have a problem.  We were going to Southhampton to take a cruise.  Our plan was to take a taxi from the hotel.  When the consierge overheard us, he said we couldn't take a taxi because the cruise port was much to far away and we had too much luggage.  Well, we took a taxi from the airport to the hotel without a problem so I didn't quite understand why we had too much now.  They said we needed to hire a car.  So, we did, but they charged us $500 USD.  I feel we were way overcharged.  We should have stopped a taxi and ask what the cost would be, but we trusted the hotel and feel like we were ripped off.  They also sold us HopOn-HopOff tickets but didn't tell us that it quit running at 5 PM.  Again, we would not have purchased the tickets had we known that.  I highly recommend to not trust the consierge unless you have investigated things on your own first.",4,2014,12,14
133,Wonderful stay,"I was lucky enough to bag a fantastic black friday deal through last minute.com

133,"Amazing location, tea!","If you are staying in London and want to be near to the tube, Topshop, and across the street from whole foods market, then you simply must choose the royal garden. The Kensington high street is the perfect location if you'd like to be right in the action, yet away from Oxford Circus/Piccadilly.  The rooms are decorated with modern accomodations, and Americans visiting can look forward to US outlets in the walls and well as USB ports and various other power outlets. The afternoon tea service is just incredible as well. You are brought the menu followed shortly by a tray of the tea flowers in jars. The waiter will describe the teas to you, and recommend what you should try smelling before you order. The process is very Asian influenced and gives you a unique option. The pastries and cakes are so nice, but the highlight was the delicious sandwiches. They do such a large variety, even vegetarians will be delighted by the choices. The service and food is incredible, but the best reason to have tea here and stay in this hotel is the gorgeous view of the park! The view is simply breathtaking whether you are on the bottom floor or the top. An all around classy and friendly hotel!",5,2014,12,08
133,Lovely. Faultless.,"Stayed on a late room deal (can't afford their usual rates) but was not discriminated against in any way for being there on a cheapie. Lovely staff, very welcoming; really fast lifts (I'm sure that makes me sound like I was in my first building with more than two storeys, haha - not the case!) and an excellent continental breakfast. Really good - polite staff, huge choice of cereals, pastries, cheeses, meats and other stuff, from marmite to boursoin to babybel. Good enough that we didn't bother going for the cooked breakfast! Room was lovely, if a bit small (that's London) and absolutely bloody spotless - we played the ""Four in a bed"" game and found nothing whatsoever. Not a speck of dust. Bathroom also lovely. Just can't fault the place.

The only thing I could moan about is the parking charges - we didn't come by car because they're extortionate. Having said that, it's a five-star central hotel... that's kind of to be expected. 

Note - must've been a rumour of some personage much-loved by the prepubescents as an exceptionally persistent group of young teenagers hanging around gawking at people getting out of taxis and squeaking loudly - almost 24/7. Really - in shifts of about 10 hours! I'm not surprised staff have asked other young female reviewers whether they're guests - those kids are hardcore. It was about 2 degrees and they stood there all day and night!",5,2014,12,07
133,Royal garden hotel - your definitely royal if you stay there.,"The royal garden is the best hotel in the world. You walk in and there is a massive concierge and a gleaming marble floor and people greeting you at the door. When you enter your room there is a massive tv and a bottle of champagne and chocolates sat on the table. The bedrooms are split and you have your wardrobe and mince pies it's amazing. The mini bar is full of coke, water very drink you can want. The beds are comfy and glorious showers and a bath. When you enter the restaurant for breakfast there is muffins, pastries, toast, eggs, pancakes anything you can dream of. When I stayed there the Liverpool squad were there so it was amazing. Thanks royal garden best hotel in the world.",5,2014,12,03
133,Kensington,"For a couple of days of my visit to London, I wanted to be geographically convenient to friends renting a home in Notting Hill, so chose this property in Kensington for convenience.  It is a lovely property and much like any typical business hotel, modern with related business resources.  While it is missing any of the history or charm of the more traditional, historic London properties, it is comfortable and the most outstanding quality is the staff.  A very warm welcome from the front desk on arrival and regular outreach for assistance through my two-day stay.  I booked the property through a great travel agent, Denise Brandenburg, who followed up with the Sales Manager, Paul Hirons, when my internet access turned out not to be complimentary as originally booked.  Paul immediately corrected the situation and was kind enough to come down to the lobby when I checked out to be sure that my stay had been pleasant.  Now that is good customer service.",4,2014,12,03
133,It may be in Kensington......,It may be in Kensington but in my opinion it should be rated as a four star not five star. Room was okay but I've stayed in nicer.  Breakfast was good but expensive for what you got.  Didn't try the evening meal as a couple I met told me it was not the best.  Reception seemed disorganized even though it wasn't busy when we checked in and out. Good location for shopping and the west end though.,3,2014,12,03
133,Great location with view,"The location is great . The garden view rooms are spacious and the view is great. 
The only default is that breakfast is expensive. However there are tea and coffee facilities and M&S just across the street so you can organise a beautiful breakfast in your room ",5,2014,12,03
133,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location and excellent service","We love this hotel and visit it frequently. The location is perfect being next to hyde park in Kensington and if you love walking it is ideal as you can easily walk through the park to Knightbridge, Bayswater and Oxford Street.

133,We would give this special hotel more than 5 stars - super!,"Many thanks to all of the management and staff of this very special privately-owned 'oasis of calm' for the gentle care and attention so willingly provided to us for all of our visits throughout the year; whether from the general manager or the chambermaid.  Super - we would give this special hotel more than 5 stars

Why would we ever want to stay anywhere else?",5,2014,12,01
133,Pleasantly surprised.,"This hotel was ranked as 160th out of 1,064 hotels in London, having stayed here now I think it definitely deserves to be moved up the rank. The room turned out to be exactly the same as the one shown on the picture on the hotel website which is reassuring. Immaculate bathroom, and modern bedroom! The room is just the right size for single occupancy, bedroom furniture modern and cleverly arranged. Most impressed with sockets that can accept international connection (110v, 230v). The only criticism is that the duvet is a bit thin, but that's just me as I dislike air condition (noise of which keeps me up at night).
Ordered room service for breakfast, unlike most other 5* hotels in London, there is no extra service charge.Only stayed overnight, but a very pleasant stay indeed. Will definitely return in the future.",4,2014,11,30
133,Up there with the best,"Only stayed one night whilst attending an awards ceremony, Staff we're exceptional, Rooms although small in size are typical of London venues but well presented, it has a nice view if you lucky to stay in the Kessington Gardens side of the hotel and public transport is almost on the doorstep, A lovely hotel ",5,2014,11,30
133,Who is Rick Wakeman?!,"Stayed in this hotel when in London for a concert at the Royal Albert Hall and rediscovering old haunts; the laugh was on the young receptionist who hadn't heard of Rick Wakeman - proof of how welcoming and friendly the staff can be.

We had a roadside room, slightly small and an unexpected alarm call at around 7am from horse-hooves on Kensignton High Street! Although the room was slightly noisy, we expected this being in the city centre and enjoyed people watching. The bathroom is well laid-out and one of the best we have encountered, down to the heated mirror and separate shower and bath.

Didn't experience breakfast at the hotel as we discovered there are several restaurants just down the road offering very good food at a reasonable price.

Left on the day of a tube strike, hotel staff and concierge were extremely helpful.",4,2014,11,30
133,"Great stay , will go back","Our second stay here, rooms have been updated and new Chinese restaurant added. Right beside Kensington Palace -Will and Kate's home. 
We checked in about 10 am after overnight flight and were delighted to be offered a "" day room"" until ours was ready. Put our heads down for two hours and felt super. Very much appreciated ! 
Love the location, buses outside the door, and ""tube "" ( subway) a few blocks away, and lots of shops all around ! Restaurants too. Great area. 
Try for a room on the palace gardens /park side, quieter and nice view. 
Nice to have full English breakfast included.

133,One night in London,"In London for a Saturday evening show and we had a very pleasant night at this hotel. The room was on the 9th floor which was very clean and well presented, and available for us as we arrived a little early. The room had wonderful views across the park and the city skyline. The service we received throughout our stay was excellent especially in Bertie's bar for a night cap.   We paid a little bit more than we usually do for a London hotel, but it was worth it on this occasion. We will use this venue again when next in town.",5,2014,11,24
133,Incredibly Surprised!!,"I have to say that I was actually surprised with the overall service of this hotel. 
Very friendly staff at the reception and restaurant. Great location, loads of shops near by and next door to Kensington Gardens. 5 minutes walking to High Kensington Street tube station which takes about 10 minutes to Central London and Westminster. 
The only thing I would say is that the Queen Room is quite small but nicely tighten. If the room was a bit bigger, I would've given it 5 starts.
Highly recommended.",4,2014,11,21
133,Lovely Hotel - Excellent Bedroom,"Excellent position next door to Kensington Palace and Gardens. We stayed for 3 nights in a large park view double room. The room itself looked as though it had recently been refurbished as it was in imaculate condition with not a scratch or mark anywhere. A large king size bed with very good pillows ensured we both had a very good nights sleep.

A good size bathroom with a seperate rain style shower, very modern and again spotless.

We cannot comment on the restaurant as we only had breakfast however that was very good and all the staff we had contact with were friendly and helpfull.

Having used many different hotels in London over the years, we will now use this every time",5,2014,11,21
133,5 star service,"This is a great hotel with excellent service, only slght issue is that the breakfast is a bit pricey for what is provided. The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel is ideally situated. Will definitely stay there again.",5,2014,11,19
133,Dinner,"I took my mum for dinner into the Park view restaurant. We started by having a drink at the bar, And had an amazing meal, the food was out of this world. The staff were lovely and the service was 5 star. I can't wait to go back.
              ",5,2014,11,18
133,Perfect location,"I stayed here for 6 nights in a Garden view room. As the name suggests, there was a glorious view through very large windows over Kensington Gardens and palace. For London, the rooms were a generous size and had a raised seating area that looked out the window. The rooms were luxurious and the bathroom very clean and modern.
The location is ideal - you can turn left from the entrance and be directly in Kensington Gardens or right and be in the thick of Kensington High St. The nearest tube is a few minutes walk away.
The staff were friendly and helpful and I would recommend this hotel highly.

133,My favourite home away from home in London,"I love this hotel. I used to stay here years ago but like a cow looking for greener grass I tried other hotels in different areas of London. I came back and was very glad I did. The staff and service are wonderful -friendly, efficient and out to please. Despite straying, I wasn't forgotten as a previous customer and was upgraded to a premium room. My modernised room looked over the street on the 8th floor and was tastefully decorated with a big comfortable bed. The bathroom was clean and I was looking forward to a bubble bath later using the fine toiletries supplied. There is a mini bar stocked with all sorts of goodies,drink and even a bottle of perfume to purchase. There were slippers and dressing gowns - to slip on after that relaxing bubble bath , a flat screen TV and an iPod docker alarm clock. 
What I love about the Royal Garden Hotel is the location, right in the heart of Kensington which doesn't seem to have the hustle and bustle of central London, I prefer the village atmosphere it has. It is right next to Kensington Gardens,many restaurants and shops and still very close to Knightsbridge, only a 5 minute taxi drive on a good traffic day.
When I returned to the hotel after my evening out I opened the door to music playing and I was really touched that my bedroom had been prepared for me to relax in with the bed covers drawn down and the easy listening radio playing gently and a lamp softly lit - it was very inviting. 
Breakfast the next morning was delicious with a good choice buffet as well as a chef freshly rustling up your choice of egg style or omelette. Despite it being a buffet breakfast the waiting staff were very attentive which I was very impressed with considering the New Zealand Rugby team were staying at the hotel after their win at Twickenham that day - another plus to my stay that weekend! 
I will be back very soon, never straying :-) Thank you for a wonderful weekend!",5,2014,11,15
133,Consistently v good,"I have had a few stays at this property over the last couple of years. Excellent location, beside Kensington Gardens, and immediate access to the shops and restaurants of Kensington High street and Knightsbridge.
What the hotel lacks in architectural history or beauty, it makes up for in excellent and consistent service across their multiple departments. Whether it's breakfast, housekeeping or the concierge, all requests are met with a smile and efficient execution. This is also an excellent base for a family vacation in London and the hotel guarantees connecting rooms and other family related requests. 
Highly recommended.",5,2014,11,14
133,The staff & location,"I have to commend  Laura at the  front desk, very friendly, cheerful & welcoming. We were offered & given tea because our room was not ready. 
That was so refreshing . We also commend the staff at the breakfast room. They were all very friendly& efficient, one we remember well is Gabor. The service were excellent all around.",5,2014,11,13
133,"Excellent location, great staff...","Located very conveniently close to the underground station and the park, so you can decide whether to take a nice stroll through the gardens to Bayswater and Queensway or enter the underground at High Street Kensington. The hotel itself is fairly newly refurbished, spotlessly clean and the staff is very polite and helpful. Ask for a room facing the gardens as the side of the building facing the busy street gets quite noisy, even during the night. The breakfast is served downstairs in the restaurant, is quite expensive, but I'd say worth the price.",5,2014,11,12
133,Good again,"We went back here again for a special occasion. We were greeted well and booked in easily although it did seem to take a long time for the girl to find us a room. When we got to the room it wasn't nearly as nice as the one we had the previous year. We had asked for the same room. Special chocolates had been put in the room for us. 

I went to reception and said I wasn't pleased with the room and the receptionist explained that the room we had asked for, which we thought we had secured, wasn't available so she looked for another room and seemed happy to show me two other rooms but they were both the same as the one we had been given. Unfortunately we had no option but to stick with the one we had been given, I was really really disappointed. The room had twin beds which we set to and moved together, we redesigned the whole room which still had beautiful views of the park. But it had horrid dark wood wall which didn't seem to do anything and the desk was across sectioning the sleeping area from the sitting area. Because of the upset we were given a free chilled bottle of white wine which helped me feel a bit les upset. 

We eat in the restaurant before going out and the food and service was both very good. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as there is a great place just outside. Go out of the hotel turn right and along the road is a good place and cheaper to eat. 

Hotel is great location rooms good if they are ones looking over the garden. Good mini bar.",5,2014,11,11
133,Perfect,"I recently stayed here and could not fault it. Right from the start when Margaret (reception manager)checked me in I knew I was in for a treat.
Chun was also a lovely helpful member of staff.
The room was fantastic and there was absolutely every think I needed.......and more.
Thanks also go to Rebekka for making it possible to get a late check out. I know this was difficult as the hotel was very busy.
Also, thanks to  Ailin and Tyrone who were on reception in the evening for contributing to making my stay amazing.
One last thank you go to the wonderful All Blacks who chose to stay in the same hotel.........the icing on the cake!
Thank you everyone.",5,2014,11,11
133,Excellent hotel,"Stayed on a Saturday night on a b&b rate.
Excellent  service, concierge gave brilliant directions. Within walking distance of harrods/Harvey  nicks and with view over Kensington gardens.
The room itself was very clean with a HUGE bed.  Bath wouldn't be any good for older people though as very deep. 
The continental breakfast was delicious too.",5,2014,11,10
133,the views just make your day,"Was very pleased to get a room facing Kensington Garden.  The room was tiny, but the view just made my day. When I say tiny, I mean there isn't enough room to open a decent sized suitcase without moving the armchair out of the way and blocking the corridor. The staff are friendly and very helpful. Check in is fast. The rooms are clean. Book directly through the hotel website and you should get free wifi.  Otherwise it gets charged! There's a massive cooked and cold breakfast buffet if you're lucky enough to get it included in the room rate in a promotion. Kensington High Street tube station is about 5 minutes walk (annoying if it rains). Paddington Express is easily reached by tube or a 15 minute taxi ride.",5,2014,11,09
133,Excellent !!!!,"I simply love this hotel ! Unbeatable location just in front of the metro and with plenty of shops next door, 
first class service and if you get a room with the view over the park you will never forget your stay in London !!",5,2014,11,07
133,Luxurious Hotel,"We stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel over the October half term with husband, parents and two young children. The staff went above and beyond to ensure we were all happy and I must note that not only is it a stunning, luxurious hotel but one that is completely child-friendly too. 

Located adjacent to Kensington Gardens and close to museums, the kids had a wonderful time exploring all that London has to offer. The food there is also exceptional and we adored afternoon tea in their restaurant (well done to the pianist too). An utterly wonderful hotel for all the family.",5,2014,11,07
133,Perfect!,"Everything about this hotel is great - starting from the location and the panoramic park view (amazing huge windows), through very comfortable bed and pillows, elegant bathroom and finishing with a delicious breakfast with fresh pastry. I will come back for sure!",5,2014,11,06
133,Pricey but worth it,"Great service, great location, nice hotel. Very tasty but pricey breakfast. Close to the tube stop, and the kensington gardens is a great place to take a walk or run. Also very close to Albert Hall & tasty restaurants.",5,2014,11,05
133,Very good hotel with a great location,"We stayed 3 nights in this hotel. I made reservation via Booking.com however I was in touch with the hotel reservation department as well and all my request were answered properly and fast.
The hotel is located next to Kensington garden and palace and when you arrive to Heathrow apt. you can reach the hotel by taxi within 20-30minutes depending on a traffic. 
I can¬¥t say that the exterior of the building is nice (iron and glass) expecially when you preffer older Victorian style but everybody can check it in photogalery in advance. On the other hand interior is very nice and everything works in side of the building.
We came a little bit earlier and our room wasn¬¥t ready yet. I booked room with king size bed and were asked at reception whether we prefer city or mews view. We choosed city view, it was on 3rd floor, which I regreted a little bit the first night because regardless soundproof windows the street traffic could be heard. But my friend was fine so I might have been more sensitive.
For breakfast you have 3 options: continental or English breakfast or you can order ala carte. We had continenal and were very satisfied with this choise. In some hotels (even 5star) they offer filtred coffee for breakfast not in Royal Garden...they offered real espresso and cappucino.
The room itself was very well equiped with a larger bathroom with tube as well as shower and large basin. The king bed had very comfortable mattress and pillows. The blanket could be a little bit thicker so I asked for one more.
The hotel location is very good. The underground station Kensington higt street is 3minut from the hotel, stop of city bus and Big bus tours is in front of the hotel. 
For the end I would like to thank to all staff at concierge as well as restaurant staff. All of them were helpful and cheerful.
In fact I have one reservation regarding WI-FI. I guess that wi-fi should be availabile free of charge in room for all guests not only for them who made the booking via hotel website or their partners. 
However I can only recommend this hotel.",4,2014,11,03
133,5 Star All the Way,"The Royal Garden hotel is the ideal base from which to explore London as it's located next to great transport links and after a day on your feet, it's the perfect haven to return to with big comfy beds and slick surroundings.   The Royal Garden has all the luxury of a 5 star hotel without any of the stuffiness. All the staff we encountered throughout our stay were friendly and approachable and we enjoyed dinner and cocktails on our first night in Min Jiang which was a real treat, made even better with the stunning skyline views. Breakfast was delicious with plenty of options to choose from.  Great value for money.  I highly recommend.",5,2014,11,03
133,pricey and no complimentary wifi!,"The Royal Garden hotel does have a very good location. The bus stops right outside the door and it is handy to parks, Royal Albert Hall, and shops. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed. The staff are very helpful. However for the price of the hotel (not cheap), we would have expected wifi to be free! This is now pretty much standard throughout hotels in Europe, we even had wifi on a bus in Romania. Very disappointing for a hotel of this calibre. ",3,2014,11,03
133,Overnight and great location for up West,"Stayed here for a Royal Albert Hall concert. Great location . Excellent for walk/visits for Kensington Palace gardens and house plus shopping in Kensington. Registration at hotel smooth courteous and efficient . We had booked a standard double and it was very comfortable clean and modern espec bathroom which had clearly been updated. We had breakfast so that was the only test for the hotel catering. It was excellent ,most of choices were buffet other than hot cooked selection which is a disappointment for ¬£25 per head when the hot brekky isn't buffet style. Nevertheless it was all quite splendid. Good table overlooking park. 
We shall return to this hotel when staying in this area of London.
It was made memorable by the fact the President of Singapore was staying here at the same time and we witnessed his security. He had dinner with Will and Kate at the Palace.
The hotel is Far Eastern owned and attracts visitors from that area of the world which is nice.",5,2014,11,02
133,Always a great place to stay,"We've just finished a family overnighter in London and could not have been happier with the Royal Garden. They make the kids (10 & 12) feel very welcome and took an individual approach, talking to them in a friendly, warm and 'adult' way. Leaving bags in the hotel early on the day of check in is no problem and they are taken to the room when the room is ready for occupation. Drinks are pretty standard price for London even though you are in a 5*. Great location for museums and shopping plus easy access to the circle and district line so travelling around doesn't have to cost the earth. The walk in to and around Kensington Gardens and on to Hyde Park are worth the vist alone. Breakfast is excellent and Whilst ¬£25 might see a lot for an adult (¬£12.50 for the kids) the access to the cold buffet means you won't have to eat until the following day!! All great quality. The staff team are very helpful, the rooms incredibly clean and the facilities second to none. executive rooms are lovely and used as family rooms with huge double, 1 sofa bed and another single. All incredibly comfortable and lovely bathroom with separate shower and bath. Will be back again.",5,2014,10,31
133,Excellent Hotel,"Impossible to pick the best member of staff at this Hotel.....they were all excellent, efficient and friendly , 5 star treatment for everyone.hotel spotlessly clean ,we were lucky to have a garden view room ...a higher floor would give the best views. Dinner and Breakfast were faultless, all foods beautifully cooked. We had the continental Breakfast..expensive but we thought of it as a treat ....no fighting with toasters and coffee machines!! The Royal Garden is a 5* hotel with no stuffy atmosphere, really enjoyed our stay.",5,2014,10,31
133,Another enjoyable stay,We regularly stay in London and the Royal Garden is one of our favourites and will return again without question. The staff were very attentive and we particularly enjoyed our bar snacks in Min Jiang. The beds are really comfortable which is important and the rooms were spotless.,5,2014,10,30
133,Have breakfast across the road!,"Had booked 2 rooms here, 1 for 4 nights and the other for one. The first was for a guest and it was very embarrassing that having made it clear I was booking for someone else, and having given all my card details, (which would have been debited for a no show), that the hotel insisted on taking cash for the four nights from my guest. I did get it sorted the next morning and cash returned but it was not hassle free even then!
Aside from this, the location was great for us as we were at a party at Kensington Roof Gardens a 5 minute walk away or a very cheap taxi ride.
The rooms were great with a view of the gardens and therefore no traffic noise. We were able to arrange late check out which was great as we had a very late night.
The bed was very comfortable and the hotel were very accommodating about providing an extra duvet and pillow when we found ourselves needing to find a sleeping place for one of the teenagers who had nowhere to stay, having told us they had!!
I did not book breakfast at ¬£25 a head and can thoroughly recommend Giraffe which is right across the road and does a decent choice of breakfast for ¬£5 a head inc coffee!
If I am in London again for The Royal Albert Hall would definitely stay here as it is near. Maybe it would be a bit more romantic next time!",4,2014,10,28
133,"Perfect hotel, perfect area.","We have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and it has always impressed us with the friendliness of staff, quality of care and attention to detail. Two members of staff that always go that one step further to ensure our stay is perfect are Nimfa and Izabel. We would highly recommend this hotel, it definitely gets the big thumbs up!",5,2014,10,28
133,Nice business hotel in a great area,"The Royal Garden hotel was nice, clean, and very comfortable. The bathroom was spacious, with a great shower, and the beds were comfortable. My daughter slept on the sofa bed and remarked several times on how comfortable it was! The service was very helpful. The location was excellent-- there were plenty of cafes and restaurants within walking distance, the hotel was right next to Kensington Palace and Gardens, and the tube stop was a very short walk away.",3,2014,10,27
133,Neither here nor there,"So this was my first proper trip to London and I just couldn't decide on a place.  I ended up doing the thing on Expedia where you know the area and # of stars but not the name at a very discounted price.  It ended up being the Royal Garden.  I was fine with it in that aspect...not sure it was something I would have purposely booked.
Check in was easy and the staff was courteous....I even got free wifi because ""I booked directly through them..."" uhh nope but I'll take the $20/day savings!
Rooms were comfortable and standard.
The location was nice depending on the purpose of your visit.  I liked that it was right on the park and could walk around there, weather was nice, Whole Foods is close and not far from Harrod's.  However, the back and forths that I had to do to SoHo every time I went and met someone for a drink got annoying.  I am going back to London in April and I think I'll book something on the South East corner of the park this time.
Airport access was pretty easy with the Heathrow Express to Paddington and from there you can take the tube to Kensington High Street in a few minutes.  I left the hotel at about 6am to go back to LHR and took a taxi which wasn't too expensive.",3,2014,10,27
133,Excellent in almost every way,"I will begin by saying that I consider the Royal Garden Hotel to be on par with the finest of hotels.  We stayed for four nights and had a very stylish room with a comfortable bed and outstanding housekeeping.  Everyone that we had contact with was pleasant and professional.  The concierge desk was staffed with very helpful young men.  Breakfast is excellent.  The Chinese restaurant, Min Jiang is very good and has a wonderful view from its 10th floor location.

The location is outstanding with easy access to the tube and buses.  Very nice neighborhood to explore and a mere 3 minute walk to Kensington Palace.

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is no fault of the hotel, rather the previous guest who must have chain smoked in what we told was a non-smoking room.  We were told the hotel was full, so there were no acceptable relocation rooms.  Management did a good job responding and making amends.",4,2014,10,27
133,great,"I stayed at the Royal Garden with my family for 5 days, I have been there before on business, great location. The hotel is modern, clean, comfortable and the food is the best in town. I've stayed in many hotels in London and can say that the breakfast is fantastic. The staff are great always helpful especially Nimfa, she  treated us like family and with such kindness, the kids loved her. There is also a great Chinese restaurant on the top floor overlooking the park, great food.",5,2014,10,25
133,Noisy small and no storage space,"Disappointing, booked an executive room over looking park at high level. 

Got. A 2nd floor room over looking the A/C

Never again. Don't do it. We are booked for three days. Web have just arrived and are off tomorrow.",3,2014,10,24
133,Fabulous,We were lucky enough to have an east facing room on the 8th floor so woke up to the sun rise over the whole of London. Bed great and room very clean - staff great and close to Whole Foods! We arrived very late at night and the hotel staff were amazingly patient and helpful.,5,2014,10,24
133,Good business hotel,"I stayed here on business for 5-6 days during November 2012 (The app doesn't allow me to choose that time period)

Ideally located, on Kensington High Street, this place is close to almost everyplace if you can take the tube and walk a bit.

I love walking to explore a place and you cannot find a better location than this hotel for that - right next to the Kensington Gardens. After work, I've walked for hours here, taking in the swans in the pond, the cool & crisp fresh air of November, the slightly damp dancing grass that seems to run endlessly as far as the eyes can see.

I digress - The Hotel boasts of a heritage and seems to be proud of it. While I stayed here, so did the mighty All Blacks - The New Zealand Rugby Team.

The staff uniforms hint a sense of royal style living up to the hotel name.

The rooms are small but on business, you rarely stay in a room. They are comfortable for their size.

The breakfast is busy and good. The staff put in a good professional show.

The room service is moody - sometimes fantastic and at other times, lackadaisical.

They have a very famous East Asian restaurant on the rooftop. I went there once and I must say the menu, the food and the service are superlative. No wonder it's renown.

All in all a good hotel to make your base around the Kensington area.
",4,2014,10,18
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"An ideally located hotel next to the city, the parks and easy transport links.  The service overall is efficient, if a little impersonal.  The exception to this is Nimfa, who works in the Park Terrace restaurant.  Every morning, she greets you with a smile, remembers your name and provides you with excellent service......",4,2014,10,17
133,Friendly and good service,"I visit Royal Garen 2 to 3 times a year, to my surprise, the service is always improving. There was this lady at the hotel restaurant could even recognize me. Nimfa remembered what I normally drink and eat; really a personal service she provided. A good hotel that caters for tourist needs, which I highly recommended.",4,2014,10,16
133,Wonderful,This is the greatest hotel from the view of Kensingston Gardens and Palace to the orchid in the bathroom the fruit tray and the 5 star staff I can not say enough about this wonderful place. There were no down sides to this experience. Great sheets lots of pillows beautiful big room. Loved it!,5,2014,10,14
133,Birthday Trip,"I stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel in late September and found it delightful!  I had a Queen bed room overlooking Kensington High St. on the 6th floor.  It was absolutely fine...perhaps a bit small for 2 people but as I was traveling solo..it was perfect.  I arrived to find a plate of delicious chocolate truffles wishing me Happy Birthday which was an unexpected surprise.  I have stayed at the Royal Garden a couple of times in the past...what I found remarkable this time was the welcoming, helpful and friendly staff throughout the hotel!  Always ready to help with a smile.  Five Star hotels can be stuffy sometimes...absolutely not so at the Royal Garden Hotel.  Thank you so much for such a lovely birthday trip!",5,2014,10,14
133,Birthday tea.,"I went with my husband for afternoon tea for my 60th Birthday as a present from my son.

The sandwiches were fresh, with a good selection of fillings and scones were just lovely.

We also had a great selection of little cakes which went very well with our tea.

The service was excellent, the table lovely and the china very pretty and we were made to feel very special and they even brought out a cake with a candle for my Birthday whilst the pianist quietly played Happy Birthday!",5,2014,10,12
133,lovely stay,"We stayed for my daughters birthday, lovely hotel, lovely rooms and great service. The Bertie's bar has a good choice of cocktail and spirits, open till late. Nice walk in the royal gardens if you want a bit of exercise.",5,2014,10,12
133,It's okay,"Expensive & busy. Staff very helpful but drinks & food very expensive. You pay for being in Kensington. I don't like big hotels but thought this one would be okay based on reviews.  The area is without doubt very expensive as is all of London but felt disappointed by the hotel. Bars were closed at different times. Staff always very helpful. Don't expect more than what you pay for.  And you do pay for it..
No free wifi!!!!!!  After Eastern Europe & SE Asia, this was a shock!",3,2014,10,12
133,"Perfectly located, well run hotel","The Royal Garden Hotel is brilliantly situated. It is in a safe, picturesque area of London, a 5 minute walk from High St Ken tube station, right next to Kensington Gardens, 10 minutes from Notting Hill Gate, 2 minutes from Wholefoods.  Because of that it connects easily to the District, Circle and Central lines - which is not to be sniffed at!  You can also walk out in the Park and it is genuinely an uplifting area to be in.

In terms of the hotel itself, it is clean and well appointed and the rooms were quiet.  What could it do to get an excellent rating from me?  Well...the gym was under renovation (which was disappointing as the renovation was due to have been completed several weeks earlier), the room was a bit small with insufficient cupboard/shelf space, WIFI is GBP 20 a day and breakfast is GBP 25 for a full English.  This is steep and is of course dependent on what package you got.  But it does drive the price up if not inclusive.  I will say that the Hotel showed some flexibility when politely challenged on some of these items (and I was staying for a significant amount of time so others may not be so lucky).  In terms of breakfast, you are spoilt for options around there, so there is no need to spend that amount.   The breakfast that I did have, was good.  So I think you are paying for convenience and at least the quality is there if you do elect to take it.

They are very efficient and for a 5 star hotel, you also do not feel remotely intimidated. It is down to earth and accommodates all sorts.  For me, this is a real plus.  I would stay there again but I would see if booking direct on the hotel website is cheaper than some of the package sites...",4,2014,10,06
133,Superb location,"Location is key! But the room could have been a bit better for the price... My windows were facing a utility roof of an adjacent building... Other than that, it surely a great property if your are visiting London for either business or pleasure. I just would really recommend eating there - there are plenty great option just steps away.",4,2014,10,05
133,Great value for money,"How London hotels have altered their prices in recent years !

Our favourite hotels seem to have moved from ¬£250 to ¬£300 a night Upto ¬£600 to ¬£700 a night in recent times 

We tried to get into Jumeirah Carlton Tower and they were quoting top prices and even The Goring wasn't going to budge on their room rate at ¬£450 ""special discount"" for last minute 

So, we went back twenty years ago to The Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington in the corner of the Park 

The hotel has been refurbished in recent years and our greeting on arrival was friendly and professional . At ¬£230 a night for last minute we think this place is great value for money

Even more reassuring was the request for an extra bed on the first night  for our visiting son was not a problem and not an extra charge ! Great decision 

I don't understand if you've bought a room for the evening and you decide to have a relative stay over why hotels would charge you extra or question the age of the relative so this approach by our hotel was very welcome

The tenth floor is the best for views and adjacent to a lovely looking chinese restaurant which we regret not getting the time to visit with superb views over the Park adjacent

The rooms are well presented with good linen and flat screen TVs as well as lovely bathrooms well tiled and presented

I spent the two days whilst we were here thinking what I could do with the ¬£500 I had saved by being in this lovely hotel

Well done The Royal Garden",4,2014,10,05
133,Price not justified,"A disappointing stay at the Royal Garden Hotel. While the location is excellant, the hotel itself was disappointing overall. The three main issues I had were the size of the room, which was tiny. The room was nicely furnished and quite modern, but I felt the carpet seemed old, gloomy and dusty. Second, the food was very up and down. Some things were excellant, but others not so much. for example, we ordered cheese toast - the food was either reheated from a previous day or the bread very old. We had a few situations like that. But what really, really wound me up was the receptionist on the last day. In the morning, I asked about a late checkout. The gentlemen looked something up in the computer and stated 'Oh, no problem at all. How long should we extend by?"" to which I responded 'as long as possible please'. After two minutes of typing and looking into the screen, he advised that 1 hour was all he could do without having to charge me. One hour!!! That is the normal tolerance level of each hotel anyway, and considering our company was spending a huge sum of money at that hotel in the past three days, that is all he was prepared to do, even after asking again. Funny enough, another colleague who asked two hours later got three hours - and I would have been happy with that.
On the bright side, most of the staff was friendly, and as I mentioned before, the rooms are modern and the location great. But I wouldn't go again and cannot recommend it due to the inconsistency in service and food quality.",2,2014,10,03
133,Great London Base,"Recently stayed in this hotel as I have a friend who lives in Kensington and it was a two minute walk to her house.  Couldn't have been a better location and the hotel was comfortable, clean and great customer service.
Right across the street from a fresh juice bar that is right next door to Starbucks!  Whole foods a block away as well.  Lots of retail around and a bank.
Beds were comfortable, bathroom small but efficient.
Didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment on that
Doorman always there and would get us taxi's easily.
Would definitely stay there again!",4,2014,10,01
133,Excellent stay,"Just got back from a week at the Royal Garden Hotel and was delightfully impressed by the quality of the hotel and the service. Yes, the room was a little cramped for two people on an extended stay- but this IS central London and the view over Kensington Gardens and the quality of the bed - one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in, more than compensated.
But what really made the stay so enjoyable was the staff. Everyone was so polite, friendly and competent. Yes, the breakfast was pricey, but no more so than other comparable London 5star hotels. We ate dinner in the restaurant twice, and it was both delicious and fairly priced.
Add to all of that a truly great location, and you have a winning combination. This was our second stay here - and we will definitely be back.",5,2014,09,30
133,A fab hotel,"We stayed here at the weekend. Twin room on the 9th floor. Greeted really well and checked in by friendly and efficient receptionist. Room really good. Not a Kensington Garden view but still very pleasant. Clean, well furnished and comfy bed. Bertie's bar lacked atmosphere but that was ok as loads of places to go in the area. Would definitely recommend - staff also great. All of them - which is quite unusual!!",5,2014,09,30
133,ok for business,"Hotel is situated in Kensington, near Hyde Park. Tube is 5 minutes walking.
The level of service is very good, in line with most important international hotels. If possible ask rooms (from 6th to 10th floor) on park side: the view is fantastic.",4,2014,09,29
133,Park Terrace Restaurant - Simply Excellent,"My friend and I came for dinner last night and were blown away with the level of service and attentiveness of staff, all of them from the barmen to the wonderful waitress Nora were simply superb and made our evening so much more enjoyable. The food was delicious too!",5,2014,09,26
133,Have stayed twice and would stay again,"I like this hotel. I have stayed twice so far this year and I will very probably choose it next time I'm in London. 

The hotel is located in a safe and attractive part of London. It overlooks Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace. There is a tube station and decent shopping nearby. I can easily walk to the museums that I like to visit. 

The hotel building is a great big 1960s lump of architecture, but it has one advantage over many prettier London hotel buildings - big windows with very nice views over Kensington Gardens and bright airy rooms. It is also quiet, with no traffic noise, which in London is wonderful. 

Reception and check-in was efficient and friendly on both my visits. I have been very specific in which room I require and very gratifyingly I have been allocated my choice. I recommend choosing a room over looking Kensington Gardens. The front of the hotel faces a busy high street. 

The two rooms I've stayed in were identical. They were smart, but in a simple way. The decor is immaculate. Indeed the whole hotel appears immaculate. They are very, very well designed in that everything is very well thought out and works properly - no designer gimmicks - just a sleek, ergonomic layout. The mattress is so good I asked who the manufacturer was. For London the rooms are a generous size. The bathroom is lovely. There is a large bath and separate shower. All very sleek. 

I always select the bed and breakfast rate. The stand-alone price of breakfast is frightening, but as part of a package, well worthwhile. The breakfast is good quality and varied. The service is efficient and friendly. The breakfast room has a lovely view over Kensington Gardens and the room is sunny. Breakfast is the high light of the stay. 

The hotel is definitely 5 star, but it is quite a simple version of 5 star. It's smart, efficient and streamlined. I choose it for the views, the quiet and breakfast.",4,2014,09,23
133,Fantastic event at the Royal Garden Hotel,"I attended the MAD blog awards which were held in one of the suites at the hotel. I was very impressed with the level of service we received - definitely 5*. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and we all received the star treatment.

I was highly impressed with the standard of food that was served to 100+ diners. Our beef was perfectly pink which I am sure is not easy when cooking en-mass. Our dessert really stood out - vanilla cheesecake with a lemon and coriander sauce. Delicious and unusual! Service throughout was flawless.

I cannot comment on the rest of the hotel as we did not stay over however the foyer and suite's were very elegant. This was my first visit to Kensington and I was impressed with the area. The hotel was only a 5 minute walk from the tube station (straight up the high street - impossible to get lost). I would certainly recommend this hotel for future events.",5,2014,09,23
133,3 maybe 4 star hotel at best,"To be honest, I just needed a hotel last minute. I stay in hotels pretty much every week and usually research more than I did on this hotel.  The Royal Garden is the perfect example of a hotel doing the bare minimum to hit a five star rating.  First, my rooms was a closet. It looked nothing like the photo and was half the square footage they indicated in the description.  The room was basic and the bed was definitely not a full size they indicated.  The bathroom was super basic and nothing to note.  The only good thing is the hotel was clean, but felt like a commuter hotel.

I tried the breakfast and frankly it is extraordinarily underwhelming.  Don't waste $30-40 on a sub scale brunch in a tired room.  Thankfully I didn't spend too much, but next time I will stay somewhere else near Hyde Park...",2,2014,09,22
133,"Comfy, friendly hotel, great location, we'll be back!","Not cheap but you get what you pay for.
Friendly, helpful staff.
Lovely big room and en suite. Comfy (huge) bed.
Great location, whether you want to go for a walk in Kensington Gardens, a trip to the Albert Hall or jump on the tube at South Kensington (Piccadilly line).
We will be back..... Soon!",5,2014,09,21
133,"First time here  would definitely stay again , it's great !","Fantastic location , nice safe area , close to all major attractions , quality rooms with contemporary furnishing and all requisite international travellers requirements ..tidy, clean , good shower, large bath ..everything you need ..will definitely stay here again next time we're in Central London",4,2014,09,20
133,Just about OK.....,"I stayed one night in this hotel with my wife. Overall, the experience was just about OK with a balance of pros and cons.

Pro

1.  The location is excellent - right next to Kensington Park. Turn the corner and you're at Kensington Palace.
2.  The price is reasonable - at the lower range for a 5 star hotel
3.  The rooms and public spaces are clean and quite well maintained
4.  Most of the staff are polite and efficient - especially Diana at reception
5.  Acceded to my request for a later check-out at 1 pm instead of 12 noon.
6   Didn't charge me for parking my rental car for about half an hour before the rental company collected it.

Cons

1.  The room design is a little dated though everything works
2.  Not much ""oomph"" factor when you first see the hotel
3.  Only got my room at 4.30pm despite arriving well before 3 pm
4.  One very sarcastic staff member - tried to give me a free English lesson in the difference between ""at 2pm"" and ""from 2 pm"".

I think the experience at the Royal Garden Hotel is acceptable but I'm not sure if I would return.",3,2014,09,16
133,Poor service at Sunday tea,"We just returned from tea for three of us and don't have much regard for either the food or service. I asked for filtered coffee instead of tea and was brought a cup of nescafe tasting coffee. Usually you get pressed coffee in a pot and can see the grounds. No one asked to refill my cup. My wife and our friend got no hot water refill for their tea. At teas at other London hotels they ask if you would like more sandwiches, such as the Cadogan and The Chesterfield abut when I asked the head waiter, he said they don't and there would be an extra charge. Twice I asked for tap water and finally got 3 tiny glasses with no ice. Overall, neither the food or service was anything admirable. We were also reminded that we couldn't stay longer than two hours. Very uncomfortable, pretentious, and unsatisfying experience.",1,2014,09,14
133,Very good...,"This property is far better after its refurbishment a few years ago.  Staff were welcoming, however i had some issued with visa cards as from a foreign country.  Was resolved after 24-Hours, however make sure if your not from the United Kingdom that the right card swipe is used otherwise you may get a double charge on your credit card.

Rooms are reasonably spacious, stayed in a queen room, clean, beds are comfortable, bathrooms large with decent washing facilities.  Would recommend that you book direct and not via booking.com etc as internet is charged separate.  

Location is decent to get to any location around London, by foot, by taxi, bus or tube.  Plenty of shops and cafes within a 2-minute walk from the hotel, and Harrods is about 15-minutes walk and Oxford Street a good 25-minute stroll.

Would stay again for sure.",4,2014,09,12
133,NO NEED TO CHARGE FOR WIFI....,"Nice hotel, great rooms, good location if you want to walk or run in the parks. I did not eat at the hotel so cannot comment on the food.

Management - YOU NEED TO ACTION THIS. When I pay ¬£260 for a room without breakfast, charging ¬£20 for WIFI is a DISGRACE.",4,2014,09,12
133,nice and comfortable,"This was my second stay. At first I had upgraded to a garden queen which is spacious and overlooking the beautiful Kensignton gardens, but then I saw my friends standard queen for 80 pounds less and it was quite lovely with a city view and certainly large enough for one so I moved. Staff very helpful,  friendly and accommodating. I find the area convenient but busy and not as charming or quaint as other area's of London. Hotel is comfortable and dependable but not exceptional.",4,2014,09,12
133,My home in London,"I always feel like home in this place , perfect location , good restaurants and great view . Book the Kensington palace view as it is extremely photo perfect view also try the Chinese restaurant it's one of the best in town ",5,2014,09,08
133,Excellent place to stay,"Stayed here 2 nights for work in April, can be described as an excellent hotel. Rooms are spacious, clean and the beds are as soft as anyone can wish after a hard's day work. The Chinese restaurant on top of the hotel serves classic Chinese Beijing duck which tastes amazing. Together with a nice glass of wine and a spectacular view of London this made my day.
Breakfast is diverse, a lot of choice and really tasteful. Can recommend this hotel for everyone, long stay or short stay.",5,2014,09,07
133,FIVE STAR STAY,"My husband and I, our daughter and granddaughter, spent five nights at Royal Garden in early July and all loved the hotel.  The rooms were quite large and the bathrooms were great, with a large tub and a rain shower, as well as a lighted, magnified make-up mirror.  The concierge staff was always very accommodating and helpful with instructions on the best way to get to the various points of interest.  The location was wonderful, across from Kensington Gardens and the High Street Kensington tube station a short walk, as well as buses right outside the hotel.  Would definitely stay there again and recommend this hotel to friends and family.",5,2014,09,06
133,Excellent! Loved it!,"Beautiful hotel with very modern, spacious rooms. Decor was simple yet stylish with great wardrobe space, good sized comfy bed, a lovely big desk (with a little hidden makeup/toiletries compartment and a mirror) with a couple of nice lounge chairs.

Bathroom was fab! Spotlessly clean with a nice deep bath and an amazing walk in shower! Beautiful! Complimentary toiletries were lovely and replenished daily!

Every evening we returned to the room, bottles of water were left for us and nice, chilled out music was playing - a really lovely touch. The music also plays in the bathroom which is nice for relaxing in a hot bath after a busy day! 

Room service was excellent too. Friendly waitresses who were happy to set up the little table for us, arranging the cutlery and  plates nicely. The food was delicious too! And the breakfast in the morning was super - mostly eggs and bacon but still a nice choice of cereals/bread/pastries. Really tasty!

We never used anything from the mini bar but it was fully stocked when we arrived.

Location of the hotel is great. Right on the bottom left corner of Kensington Gardens, it's not too far from a tube station into the city - but it's nice to have the option of walking through the park in the mornings!

Had a really great stay and hope to visit again some day!",5,2014,09,05
133,Wonderful Stay !!!!!!!,"Royal Garden Hotel is wonderful.  We stayed for 5 nights. The rooms are lovely and the bathroom is huge.  In the attached pictures, the one thing I didn't capture was the closet.  It had very wide sliding doors completely mirrored floor to ceiling.  We ate in the Park Terrace Restaurant several times and enjoyed the bar, not only for drinks but also light meals.  There was another bar upstairs - a very quiet spot.  Royal Garden Hotel has a great location next to Kensington Palace and Kensington Gardens.",5,2014,09,05
133,Great location overlooking the park,"Stayed here a few years ago, i now wok in London right opposite this hotel. The hotel itself is very modern and clean, with great views over Kensington Gardens. If you want to look our of your room and see a royal palace in front of you, this is the hotel for you. The deluxe rooms have a sitting area which is great to people watch.
You are located on a busy London street, bus stop outside the hotel to take you to the other tourist attractions. Take a walk through the gardens as they lead to Hyde park which is lovely 30 minute walk to Oxford Street.",4,2014,09,05
133,A Little Bit of Luxury...,"We took advantage of their all too infrequent voucher offers to book a 3 course dinner with cocktail and never was money better spent.

This is a beautiful hotel, extremely professionally run with staff of the highest calibre - before anything else, try to get Nora as your waitress - she is absolutely first class.  Made suggestions, described the dishes eloquently and remembered that a friend had a mushroom allergy - plus she is a damn nice girl too.

We arrived a little early and were shown to a table in the bar area to order the cocktails, peruse the menu and enjoy some complementary olives and nuts.  Having been seated in the restaurant, a quiet corner the orders were taken and breads delivered - they were delicious so we ordered a second helping.

At this point I must say that I was expecting 3 courses, smartly delivered and thank you and good night (we were there on a Saturday and not paying full price)...but none of it.  it turned out to be 5 courses, we were never rushed and were treated as though we were any other paying guest - Nora again, I did say try to get her as your waitress. 

Starters were delicious - I can recommend the terrine or the scallops, both went down well with our party; especially the scallops which were cooked to perfection.  Next the steak - (I'm getting tired of using the P word) cooked to perfection and just as I like it, with thick chips and salad...but we all had a similar experience with our main courses.

Next was dessert - not rushed, but delivered in our time by Nora (did i say she was good...) the chocolate tart with raspberry swirl ice cream was divine and was then followed up with a selection of brandy snap biscuits (I know I said it was 3 courses...) to be follwoed by cheese and biscuits.

Normally, I leave restaurants like this wishing I had eaten before I came out...not so here; all of us were fed up (in the nicest sense) and waiting eagerly for the next voucher offer.

If you've never been before, this restaurant is to die for...just remember to get Nora as your waitress.",5,2014,09,04
133,Excellent personal service plus,"Travelling from Australia and arriving via Paris,my second stay at the Royal Garden did not disappoint. From the taxi to the Lobby to our room all happened seamlessly.Most rooms are identical as far as our experience has shown and are spacious with lovely ensuites. We chose to dine in the more relaxed atmosphere of the downstairs lounge area on most occasions and found the food to be excellent and the service even better.After six days we were on pleasantly comfortable terms with our waiting staff. They had the knack of remembering our favourite things which is not always so in a large Hotel. Breakfast was similarly pleasant. But the clincher came when we returned after a fortnight's touring around England to spend our last two nights at the Royal Garden.I had made a booking for the main dining room for my birthday with my wife and sister in law. I found that we had been upgraded to an executive suite at no extra cost of their own volition apparently in recognition of my birthday.Add to this a dish of chocolates placed on our coffee table with a ""Happy Birthday sign on it. This appeared after we had returned from a day out in London..We then enjoyed the excellent restaurant meal which was followed with another dish of chocolates with a similar sign ,to finish the evening out. Really nice subtle touches that omce again you do not quite expect in a Large hotel.To say we were happy is an understatement and we will be returning to the Royal Garden on future trips to the UK.",5,2014,09,01
133,thank you from San Diego,"I arrive to the Royal Garden on July 24this is my first time to stay at that place and I have to tell you I was very impressed from the moment I arrived from the bellboy to the staff to the room commodationit took about 5 minutes from the time I arrived to have my room key and all my luggage brought up everything set up. they have a fantastic concierge they set up everything for me all my trip was organized on timeI just want to take ,take a moment and thanks everybody at the Royal Garden for giving me a really fantastic experience and I had a I had the pleasure to eat at the 10th floor one of the most magnificent Chinese restaurant in London and I'll definitely be back.thank you again",5,2014,08,27
133,Birthday Celebration,"The Royal Garden Hotel is one of my favourite hotels in London and never disappoints. I took my family their to celebrate my daughter's birthday for the weekend and the staff were very attentive and helpful. The highlight of our stay was a special Birthday Cake which was delivered to our room from the hotel to my daughters great surprise.
We had a lovely stay and will definitely return very soon.
VH Bucks",5,2014,08,27
133,Excellent restaurant experience,"This was a Travelzoo voucher (which are usually very good) but this restaurant was better than I expected.
Went on a sunday evening with my partner, and on arrival with ""impromptu"" shopping bags, we were greeted by a friendly face who offered to keep our bags safe during the meal. We were shown to our table immediately (we were early and hungry so a nice bonus), and invited to choose a cocktail and order our meal.
Throughout, every member of staff was excellent - friendly, informative, efficient and polite. We were attended well, just the right amount of time, rather than hassled or waiting too long for courses/drinks.
We had lovely warm bread on the table, our 4 course meal (inc cheese course), and had petit fours with our tea/coffee. The food was excellent, tasty, well cooked and not too little (I like to eat‚Ä¶). 
The hotel was easy to get to, and the eating area was spacious and well lit, with a relaxed ambience (although still a bit hotel-y). We drove and parked locally easily, but public transport would have been a convenient. This was great value with the voucher and I certain would recommend and plan to return!",5,2014,08,22
133,London,This was a very nice hotel.  Great location close to many London attractions right near Kensington Palace.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The restaurant was very good too.  veralp was quite nice.,5,2014,08,20
133,Excellent Evening yet again!!!!!!,"This is our third visit to the Restaurant for an evening. It was my husbands birthday and we dined in the restaurant which was buzzing with contented customers. The staff are so lovely and friendly too. The food was beautifully presented and tasted as good as it looked. They even  presented my husband with a lovely chocolate Happy Birthday plate  and candle after our meal which finished the evening off beautifully.
Excellent value. We shall return!!!!!!",5,2014,08,20
133,"good, but not great!","This was one of the many hotels which could only offer a walk in shower, ie one not over the bath, only  if I paid significantly extra, I declined to pay and took my chances.  The bath was 2/3 the height of my walking stick, quite narrow and difficult to access.  Not a good outcome for me.  However the bed was superb and the room comfortable, sound insulation excellent.  My one in room meal was  good.  Hotel is well located for shopping and I found a Laundromat and the ‚Äúbest breakfast in Britain‚Äù nearby.  Wifi was excellent

Given a choice I would probably choose the Millennium over the Royal Garden because of the bathrooms, personal safety and staff.",5,2014,08,18
133,afternoon tea,"Booked afternoon tea here for my friend's 65th birthday, excellent from start to finish, welcoming staff and waiters, great selection of teas, champagne, sandwiches and cakes plus a pianist  playing gently throughout.  Although a modern hotel it lacked nothing in atmosphere, would definitely book again. For ¬£36 in London good value.",5,2014,08,17
133,Brilliant Hotel!,"This is by far the best hotel we have stayed in in London.  We have been travelling here almost every year for the past 15.  We usually stuck to the same hotel in South Kensington for budget and location reasons and just felt it was run down and ""by its best"" and decided to go a bit more up market.  It can be expensive but checking through websites you can find some good deals!

From the moment you arrive at the door outside, the concierge is very nice and helpful, at reception you are greeted immediately and sincerely, the staff are so nice and genuine.  No waiting around in queues or behind someone taking forever and a day to check in/out.  

The rooms are spacious and very comfortable, sound proof and the bathroom is out of the world!  A bath and shower with 2 different  and very clean and equipped.   The beds are really comfortable, aircon/heating available.  The towels are changed twice in the day if required.  The breakfast area is very good, and we had the continental breakfast included in our booking and it was delicious, plenty of variety of fresh breads, fruits, tea, coffee etc..
Bertie's Bar is gorgeous and the staff are again very professional and really look after you...pity it is closed on a Sunday though..

The location is spot on, very central and next to Kensingtons Gardens if you want to escape the city for a few hours.  On the doorstep of shops, pubs and restaurants, nice little pub across the road that has lovely staff in it too, good pub grub and comfortable seating..

Free wifi too!  The only downside to this our stay was that we had to leave!",5,2014,08,12
133,Don't deserve 1 Star,"Nothing positive to say. Due to following reasons:
1- unrespected reception staff for the particulat critical situations since we are here for long period they always insisted in changing the rooms every week without any concerns of our request. 
2- They can put the new guest with the same room category in which we are in currently in the dame other room BUT they found it unfeasible because I didn't make the reservation directly with them as I prefer to use expedia which I found more cheaper than their prices. 
3- NO FREE WIFI IT COST ¬£100/week
4- It is not recommended to be in this hotel since you will be shocked and your stay will be miserable.",1,2014,08,12
133,Perfect place to stay in London,"This hotel is in a great location. The rooms are large and comfortable. Many rooms overlook Kensington Gardens. Only a 5 minute walk to the High Street Kensington Tube Station for access to all of London and surrounding areas through the Tube system. There are many shops, restaurants and pubs nearby. The bus stop for Bus Route 9 is right in front of the hotel it's a very easy way to get to Hyde Park, Royal Albert Hall, and Harrods.",5,2014,08,12
133,Wonderful Stay,"No waiting for 1400hrs check in, friendly greeting from staff and straight to our room looking over Kensington Palace.
Fruit platter, bottle of champagne, daily bottled water, continental breakfast just some of the treats that were part of the experience.
Large room, massive bathroom, beautiful views from our room, close to High street shopping and fabulous dining, fabulous walks in Kensington Gardens and Palace what more could we have asked for.
Loved the in house Chinese restaurant, I suggest you book as was extremely popular with guests and locals.
Highly recommend to anyone visiting London.",4,2014,08,10
133,2nd time of staying and even better than the last!,"We cannot fault this hotel, room = perfect, dinner=perfect, breakfast =perfect. We were treated so well from the moment we arrived until we checked out. Had a room overlooking kensington gardens, well worth it. The biggest rooms we have had stayed in when in London.Great Location. Loved the cocktails!",5,2014,08,10
133,Wonderful,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Royal Garden Hotel this past June and will definitely be back.

Rooms:
At my request, my room overlooked Kensington Palace, which I loved. The room was not large but perfect size for my sister and I. The room was spotless, the bed was comfortable, and water pressure in the shower was perfect. They also provided me with an adapter for all of my American hair tools which really helped! Complimentary water bottles in the room was a nice amenity. Wifi worked well. 

Staff:
Staff was beyond pleasant and accommodating. I got to the hotel before my due check in time and after an overnight flight, I was exhausted. They did everything they could to get me into my room early and I truly appreciated it. The wait staff at the bar and restaurant is very friendly, the concierge was very helpful with directions and suggestions.

Location:
I LOVED the location of this hotel, right next to Hyde Park (we biked through the park to Buckingham Palace) and close to the tube and bus (bus stop right out front). I rarely had to take a taxi. There is a little market across the street on the corner, good for water, yogurt, or any toiletries forgotten.",5,2014,08,08
133,"Excellent Location, Great Staff","I stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington for a 5 night business trip, and truly enjoyed my stay.  The location was perfect: as other reviewers have noted, there's good shopping nearby, some great restaurants (we ate at Babylon at the Roof Gardens and One Kensington which were both excellent).  I loved the fact that Hyde Park was just next door and took advantage of the close proximity to run through the park in the morning and evening between meetings.

The rooms were very well appointed: my 4th floor room had a street view overlooking Kensington Road.  There was some street noise (a large group of teenagers would often sit near the taxi pick up area at night, and I could hear them from my room), but I fall asleep easily so was not bothered by this.  Lighter sleepers should request rooms away from Kensington Road.  I really appreciated the number of outlets to plug in electrical devices and in logical locations like the beside table - so many hotels these days seem to not have enough, and not in enough convenient locations.

Continental breakfast was included in our stay.  I was satisfied with the range of options and quality of the food.

I would like to say that the staff as a whole was excellent, personable and professional.

I would definitely stay here again on business, and would strongly consider the hotel for leisure stays as well.",4,2014,08,07
133,One of the Best,The Royal Garden is a great place to stay - good area & particularly convenient for the Royal Albert Hall and the Proms.   Rooms are really spacious and WIF is complimentary and bottled water is provided too - so often not the case with high-end hotels.   Breakfast was really good and the staff are all very polite and helpful.  All in all we couldn't fault it and at a very reasonable price.,5,2014,08,07
133,Exceeded All Expections,"This five star property exceeded our expectations.  First of all the room was large and well equipped. Second, the location was outstanding, right on the park, metro station, and shopping. Third, the Park Terrace Restaurant was excellent.  However, the real test of a good hotel is when you have a problem and management goes out of their way to resolve it.  In this case the General Manager personally looked into all details and worked with us.  Next time I have a business meeting in London, I will choose Royal Garden because of the attention to detail demonstrated.",5,2014,08,05
133,Great Once Again,"Second vist to the hotel and pleased to say no need to look for an alternative in London. Rooms are very spacious, great location in London. Staff once again very helpful and no issues faced what so ever. Stayed in the recently refurbished executive rooms, two adults and one child with plenty of room.
Situated right next to Kensington palace and Kensington High Street this is a perfect location.  We only ate breakfast in the hotel very reasonably priced and excellent quality.

Perfect hotel in London",5,2014,08,05
133,So nearly very good,"The location is very good, right on one of London's main shopping thoroughfares, and is convenient for the cluster of South Kensington's museums, the Royal Albert Hall and so much more. Our 8th-floor room faced Kensington Gardens and gave a terrific view not just of the park but also London's 21st century skyline and it was very well laid out and still had a fairly new feeling. However, that newness perhaps contributed to the reasons we could only award the hotel three stars, namely what appeared to be paper-thin walls between bedrooms. We had also assumed that the hotel, like most other top London hotels, had a no-smoking policy, but we were not informed that our room was next door to one in which smoking is allowed. Add to that off-hand service at the second-rate breakfast and we found ourselves wanting to give a better rating but unable to do so.",3,2014,08,04
133,A very happy repeat visitor,"I joined TripAdvisor just to leave this review. 

I stayed at The Royal Garden Hotel for 8 days in July 2013 and had such a wonderful time I came back in July 2014 for ten days (it is my birthday present to myself). 

A really wonderful hotel. By request I had the same room both times (509) which faces the gardens and is very very quiet. The air conditioning is brilliant during the hot muggy London summer, the bed is fantastic (the pillows are sublime). I love the fact that there is a bath as well as a shower, the towels are wonderful as are the bath products. 

There are always two free bottles of water in the minibar and the coffee and tea making facilities are great. I received a gorgeous chocolate treat for my birthday and a wonderful plate of delicious muffins the day before I left with a lovely note to say thank you for my patronage. 

What I really like is the fact that the area is safe and the hotel is quiet. There were several demonstrations nearby when I was staying there but the hotel kept us fully informed and went out of their way to make things less disruptive. 

The only thing I would change is the cost of the internet. If you book directly with the hotel you get free internet but I go via my airline which allows me to use miles, and then the internet is quite expensive. But most shops in the street have wifi so this was no great problem, particularly as I was on holiday and didn't want to be bothered by emails anyway. 

There were some small glitches during my stay - the phone didn't work and a couple of days they forgot bath products and a flannel in the bathroom but these were fixed instantly and with a smile. I am only mentioning it to show that sometimes a problem so quickly and happily fixed is better than having no problem at all! I am totally confident that no matter what I wanted would have been fixed with the same ease and cheery dispositions. 

Every member of staff I encountered was friendly and helpful. 

Hoping to be going back in July 2015. Thank you for making my holiday so memorable for the second year in a row.",5,2014,07,30
133,Who needs a Palace when you are treated like Royalty?,"I have wanted to stay here for ages but never had the money to splash out, However, the flash sale made this possible.
I was worried it wouldn't live up to expectation as often things you look forward to don't but, like Venice, this exceeds expectation in every way.
Staff are helpful, with a quiet assurance and attention to detail. Nothing is too much trouble.
Room was amazing. 
If you are looking for a special stay in true 5 star luxury, look no further! 
I loved every minute of my stay and one day hope to return.",5,2014,07,30
133,Fantastic hotel!,"I am a solo female traveller and felt totally safe staying in this gorgeous hotel. It had every luxury you could think of, particularly in your room. The weather was very humid when I stayed at the hotel but the air con was fabulous. The bed was very comfortable and my room was quiet despite being in the middle of a very busy London Street. The location was fine as there was every shop you could wish for on the doorstep with the park right next door. Hotel staff were very friendly and efficient with check in and check out done in minutes. The hotel was also spotlessly clean.  The price was also an absolute bargain! I hope to return!",5,2014,07,29
133,"Enjoyable, relaxed stay","Clean modern and most importantly spacious rooms (compared to other 5 star hotels in london), amazing views (whether of the park or high street), with friendly and helpful staff.

 If there's only one thing i would change i would say it's the location but that's personal preference. I would rather live closer to the park lane area as it is within walking distance of all the places we would usually visit.",5,2014,07,26
133,FANTASTIC HOTEL!!!,I stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel after a theatre visit I stayed in a Garden Room the room was very plush with a larger than average king size bed and a well stocked mini bar where there was certain items you could have as part of the room charge (which I might add was very reasonable) When the t.v was turned on there was a personal named welcome to the hotel which I thought was a very nice detail. All n all I would recommend this hotel if you are staying in London you will not regret it!,5,2014,07,26
133,Excellent stay in a high quality establishment,"We stayed 2 nights this week at the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington. This was as part of an amazing trip we won through a Visit London competition. Couldn't believe our luck when we won, as it also included full breakfast, champagne on arrival, garden (Kensington Palace and Hyde Park) view room on  the 9th floor, wifi etc. In addition got one dinner and a Thames lunch cruise as part of the prize too. As frequent London visitors this was manna from heaven for us. Thanks to Debra at the hotel for organising the details.
From the beginning we were made to feel very welcome and valued. Reception dealt with everything very efficiently and showed us to our room (Marlies and Aliin), Concierge (Luton) dealt with our tourist queries very well, the bellboys were very helpful and friendly. The room was great, a high floor view onto the royal park and all over London in fact. Marlies explained all the room's features extensively to us.
The champagne was well chilled and very tasty too. Enjoying it from the slightly elevated sitting part of the room where the sofa was seemed very decadent indeed. 
The breakfast was excellent, with great service from Nikoletta and colleagues. The continental buffet was a high quality one including very fresh fruits and great fresh pastries. The made to order hot dishes were also fabulous with high quality ingredients.
We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London, this was one of our best experiences in the city.",5,2014,07,26
133,Beautiful hotel to stay in London,"I recently stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel on July 20th with my family and I cannot say enough positive comments about my experience.  From the moment we arrived we were made to feel most welcome and the overall service of all the staff we encountered could not have been of a higher standard.

I stayed in a King Bedded Executive Room - Room 734 with a connecting twin bedroom which was ideal for my family including my 2 teenage children.  The room was most comfortable and of a very generous size and certainly passed all of our expectations including a heated bathroom floor and a heated towel rack.

I would certainly recommend this hotel for families as well as for business travellers because of its central location in London and the overall ambience of the hotel and the excellent service I received throughout my stay.",5,2014,07,25
133,The views from the Garden rooms must be the best in London,"We recently used The Royal Garden Hotel for 11 days of Management meetings in the Balmoral and Westminster Suites. The staff at this hotel are all very well trained with great service levels where nothing is too much trouble. The meetings all went very smoothly and the event team were very organised and helpful. Our varied Buffet lunches were all tasty and some special gluten free and dairy free dietary requirements were catered for with no problems. Our AV and sound requirements were well looked after with a staff member even arriving at 7am to check all was working ready for the meeting.  We all stayed in either the Queen rooms or Garden rooms and everyone was happy with these modern comfortable rooms. Those that stayed in The Garden rooms with the raised seating area were very impressed with the amazing panoramic views over Kensington Gardens and said it must be the best views in London. I can vouch that it certainly has the wow factor.
The Managers dined in the Min Jiang restaurant on the 10th floor on 4 evenings and they all said the food and service was excellent. The Beijing duck which needs to be pre-ordered is highly recommended. They would have been happy to eat there every night.
The hotel is in a good location with easy parking next door, not far from all transport links and High Street Kensington tube station only 4 minutes walk away.
Lots of well known shops within easy walking distance.
I would highly recommend this hotel for business or leisure.",5,2014,07,24
133,Very nice!,"Very clean, nice hotel in the Kensington area.  There are great restaurants and bars in the hotel, and walking distance to lots of shopping and nice pubs.  Rooms are nice size, beds are comfortable.  Very nice bathroom.",4,2014,07,22
133,Obnoxious wifi charging policy,"We were seduced into trying the Royal Garden as some Singaporean friends regularly use it when visiting London.  It was booked through a hotel booking web site at a special pre-paid rate, but was still over GBP1,300 for four nights in a Standard Room Garden Area (pleasant view over Kensington Gardens).  I felt the rather cramped room was somewhat overpriced at this rate.  

The room was very standard five-star layout and decor.  Nothing that made it stand out from the crowd.  And while I hardly used the hotel facilities or restaurants, and interacted little with the staff other than check in/out, no lasting impression was made.  It all seemed...just okay.  

The Min Jiang restaurant has a justifiably fine reputation, however, and I have eaten very well there in the past.

What REALLY irritated me, however, was the egregious charge of GBP20 a night for in-room wifi.  It made me feel like they were taking the piss out of me.  That's GBP600 a month!  My monthly personal, in-home, non-business rate wifi contract is less than their daily charge.  Even budget hotels around the world are now including wi-fi at no extra cost.  It's expected, just like air to breathe.

When will these five-star hotel managers realize just how much being gouged like this makes their customers really angry?  It's the same as the excessive charges 20 years ago for making phone calls....that all went away with the advent of mobile phones.  So they dreamt up another way to rip off their customers and make them incredibly mad?  

I shall never stay again as long as the Royal Garden maintains this obnoxious wifi charging policy",3,2014,07,22
133,Average....,"Been staying at this property for three decades now and all I can say the location remains wow and the breathtaking views remain the same yet unfortunately while the rooms are refurbished and there is some improvement the service levels and overall standards have dropped drastically. 

All in All I don't recommend this property at the prices it is definitely not a value add though the location is pristine...",3,2014,07,22
133,Third visit,This was our third overnight stay at the hotel. It is consistently excellent and the staff are always friendly and helpful.  The garden rooms offer a superb view towards London centre and this is one you cannot tire of. We recommend the hotel for a weekend trip to London.,5,2014,07,20
133,Relaxed Afternoon Tea,"Lovely London teatime. We'd booked ahead for our party of 12 work colleagues. The table was well laid and we had a comfortable light bright space close to the piano. I was impressed that although I was at the end of the long table in a long room I felt the staff made the effort to check that I didn't want for anything. A large pot of tea was set for the ones sitting together, but when my neighbours had alternative choices with out asking I was brought an individual teapot, and again without asking the waitress noticed the tea was strong and brought extra hot water, offering a fresh pot if preferred.",4,2014,07,13
133,Very nice hotel in a lovely London location,"I have stayed here several times over a number of years for work. It has had a refurb recently so is a lot more airy and modern looking inside - possibly losing a bit of the older feel comfort/character maybe, but bringing it in line with a more business hotel feel.

Compared to other similar price band/star rated hotels in London, the staff are a lot more switched on to guest needs, and level service is more as you would expect. 
The location is lovely - right next to the park .....although of course not all rooms can have a park view, our latest one did and was absolutely lovely in the morning. 
The shower is amazing......and bathroom spacious. Bed very comfortable. Room climate control very reactive. Complimentary mineral water a godsend in the middle of the night after a few drinks!
The bar is somewhat pricey - but then look at the location you are in.....it comes with the territory I guess. If you are not happy with that, there are plenty of pubs/bars/restaurants in the area that are less pricey, and tube station a short walk away, so you can always go out and eat for less.

The breakfast is good with a wide range of eggs/sausages on the buffet, plus a reasonable variety a la carte menu you can order from.   The fresh orange juice is superb......you won't be able to resist a top up!

I would recommend this hotel for it's star rating - be it for business or leisure.",5,2014,07,08
133,Five star hotel with simplicity and comfort,"The Royal Garden Hotel's location is close to the tube, shopping, Kensington Palace and parks. We found the hotel to be simple elegance and very comfortable, the service was wonderful. During the evenings it's quiet seeing the surronding stores close. I would reccommend this hotel for business and adults.",5,2014,07,07
133,Mixed Feelings,"Having seen the various good and bad reviews we thought we would have a change from our usual choice of London hotel.
We checked in (not particularly a very friendly reception) and were given a room on the third floor 303, but we were not happy with the view, considering we were there for 3 days, the view of the ugly roof of the adjacent building, the air conditioning units and the park in the distance was not exactly what we imagined.  We asked to be moved, but were curtly told that they were fully booked and everybody had already checked in - at 3.00pm in the afternoon!! and there was nothing they could do.  Not happy with this we thought we would check out and on saying this, a friendlier person called us and told us we could move the next day to a 9th floor room, which we did.  Although this room had a better view it still is not what we would have thought a five star room should be, dirty stains on the carpet, poor tea and coffee supplies, no biscuits, no sugar ?? just poor room checking.  Also the air conditioning is extremely noisy.

We were shocked at the price of breakfast and therefore ate out in several local coffee shops so cannot comment on the restaurant.  I think the price of just over ¬£250 per night justifies having breakfast thrown in, even if just Continental.  However we did have room service 2 nights and this was very good and served in the room by very friendly staff and we thought that this was good value, so it is difficult to see why they charge such a high price for breakfast.

Staff generally were very good, particularly the Concierge staff, and the room service staff.

Mixed feelings really about this hotel, don't think we would stay here again as think it warrants a 4 star rating but charging 5 star prices.",4,2014,07,07
133,Beautiful!,"We stayed here for one night and fell in love. Absolutely gorgeous room with a beautiful view of Kensington Gardens. All the lovely were friendly, polite and helpful - no complaints. We decided to have lunch at Min Jiang, the Chinese restaurant at the top of the hotel, and it was truly one of the meals I've ever had. Great location, would definitely recommend.",5,2014,07,07
133,All round excellent 5* hotel,"The Royal Garden is in a great location right on the Kensington High Street.   Its a no nonsense top drawer 5* hotel and it does it well.    Since my last visit it has been refurb and is perhaps less old world comfy and more professional and business.   Either way works.

Rooms are good in most cases, the ones at the front are noisy and the view is poor but most are good.  Our room had a lovely view of Hyde Park with a seating area on a raised floor to give the best view.    Room was good all round, great shower too which is a big review point for me.   

Bar was great but pricey but then look where you are!!   Breakfast excellent.  Service great.

All in all - well recommended...",5,2014,07,06
133,"Great hotel, room and fantastic view","Many of you know London hotels are so over rated with poor staff, service and ambiance but not this one. Right from check-in to departure, truly now this will be my hotel of choice in this area of London. D√©cor and service 1st class, views over the park, quiet and attention to detail in all they do.",5,2014,07,05
133,5 five star service only for some,"I have visited yesterday the hotel for a business meeting with my new business partner. He was staying at the hotel and i was arriving with some lugagge from my week abroad.
 
I have arrived to the hotel at 16h20 and i went to the reception. 
I have explained that i was coming for a business meeting with an hotel guest and i have requested to store my luggage.

I was directed in a very polite way to the concierge and he took my luggage into the restaurant area. Left it on the floor and went to back concierge.

At the entrance of the restaurant, the staff working there immediatly refuse to store my luggage.
- communicartion Failure between the hotel staff

I have further insisted in a solution and then they requested that I would call my business partner and identify his room number which I did and they still refuse to store the luggage.

I took my luggage into the restaurant, next to a table and i requested to write a complaint. She immediately became very concerned and offered to store a small backpack that I had with me.
I was no interested anymore.

Shortly after,  the concierge manager approaches me and asks for information. I have explained my disapointment with the service. The explanation provided included: proximity to embassies, security rules and hotel manager direct policies.

I have answered that if this is case then the manager will not have a problem in reading what i will have to write.
The concierge manager left.
After my meeting with my colleague, I approached the same restaurant team member and asked for the complain book. She mentioned that there wasn't any book or any sort of platform to write my complain and that I have already expressed my concerns previously with the concierge.
For that reason, I have expressed my experience through this platform.

Regards,

Miguel",1,2014,07,05
133,Great location,"The traffic is really bad in London so I love staying here. I can walk to shopping and dining easily. I love the 3 story Whole Foods down the street, it's awesome! Anyway, I have been staying at this hotel since the early 1980's. It has undergone renovation while the neighborhood has changed somewhat and lost a little bit of the charm it had but still very good service and nice rooms. If you get on the park side the view is wonderful! It's a little pricey but that's London for you.",5,2014,07,02
133,Ideal for discovering London,My family and I just stayed 4 nights at the Royal Garden and we all were very pleased with the excellent service from a highly trained staff. The rooms were very comfortable and the breakfast buffet was indeed delicious. I had to use the business center to check in for our next flights and the staff was very helpful and the service free of charge. We had many strolls in Kensignton Gardens and Hyde Park and there are plenty of restaurants in close vicinity.The only downside of the Royal Garden is to have to pay an outrageous 20 pounds for internet....,4,2014,07,01
133,Excellent Hotel,"Been here many times, one of the few 5 star hotels in London at reasonable price. Very well located and rooms nicely decorated, unlikely many 5 stars in London in urgent need of redecoration. Will  definitely come back",5,2014,07,01
133,"Classy, but pricey","We enjoyed a 4-night stay in April and were very happy with the staff as well as the quality of our room. The beds were very comfortable, the room was technologically very well equipped, the shower was spacious and enjoyable. Everything about the room was great!

The location of the hotel is also very convenient as both cultural events and shopping can be found nearby.

As travellers we're used to having both Wi-fi and breakfast included in the price. We were sorry to see that these amenities were quite overpriced. For a hotel this prestiguous and pricey, these things should not be considered ""extra"". 

This is a great hotel, but the price is so high, that we didn't feel that it was good value for our money.",4,2014,07,01
133,It ticks the boxes...,"It's on Kensington High street and the corner of Hyde Park, so you know it's a seriously well placed hotel and it's room rate reflects this. The concierge was not interested in a couple turning up with backpacks, but inside, the reception staff were very organised, efficient and welcoming, felt like they were there to be at your service. The room was large and well set out with everything you would need, it was very clean and up to date. The bed was large and comfortable. 
 London Underground station is under five minutes walk, bus stops all at hand and the sights are at your door. Hyde Park is fifty paces off from the lobby door, the Royal Albert Hall is across the road and five minutes walk. The big museums are just past this, as is Harrods, so you have no problems with choice of activity. We did not try the restaurant but would assume it lived up to the standard of the rest of the hotel. 
 The rooms are quiet, staff helpful and it has a good feel to it, if you want a place to stay that is worth looking at, for a 5* hotel that is close to the Kensington highlights, I recommend it.",5,2014,06,30
133,Great view of Kensington Park,"We had a great stay at this hotel. Upon arrival we were a little concerned about its location as it was very busy outside with lots of tourists. I suppose we expected it to be in a little quieter neighborhood. All concerns were put to rest once we got inside. The modern hotel was very clean and seemed like a nice refuge from the busy outdoors. Our room overlooked the park and we found it most enjoyable to sit and take in the view. Furniture, decorations, and facilities in the bathroom were nice and accommodating. No issues to report on. Breakfast was great and the ambiance was upbeat for a perfect start to your day.",4,2014,06,29
133,Royal Garden Hotel - Venue- Review,"The staff at the hotel pretty much had everything under control. I did very little! 
5* star service, 5* rating! I cannot convey how much this hotel excels! Book you conferences/events here and you will not be disappointed!",5,2014,06,27
133,Amazing property!,This hotel is pure elegance and class. The staff is amazing and the views are spectacular! The location is directly in front of Kensington Palace which is great for sightseeing. Most rooms face the palace gardens and some actually have views of the palace. There are lots of shops and restaurants directly across from the hotel and within walking distance. The tube is a 3 minute walk. The concierge is extremely helpful! They showed me how to get around using public transportation and were very detailed when giving directions. They can also recommend some nice restaurants. I definitely recommend this hotel! It is worth every penny! I can't wait to go back. ,5,2014,06,25
133,Fantastic!,"A beautiful hotel in a perfect spot in London. Walking distance to lots of fabulous attractions and right next door to the gorgeous Kensington Palace & gardens and a visit to Princess Diana's memorial fountain (more like a waterfall)
Excellent service throughout. 
Cocktails in the Chinese restaurant on the 10th floor with views across London - spotted most major landmarks.
Lunch on the ground floor restaurant - beautiful. Extremely comfortable rooms and most importantly the king Size bed - heaven.
Love this place!!",5,2014,06,23
133,"When something's this good, do it again!","A few months ago we came into town to see Swan Lake at the Royal Albert Hall. We wanted a nice hotel close by so chose the Royal Garden at the end of Kensington High Street, which is only 5 minutes walk from the venue. We loved the whole experience so much we did it again this weekend. The show this time was Romeo & Juliet and, once again, we had a high floor at the Royal Garden, which has a beautiful outlook over Hyde Park. Again the staff were friendly and welcoming and the service was great. Now this isn't a cheap hotel (it's Kensington, guys!) but it's certainly still value for money. Incidentally, we also repeated the experience of having pre theatre dinner at the classy Chinese restaurant on the 10th Floor. Highly recommended. We might even do it all a third time!",4,2014,06,22
133,"Great room, lovely view, good location.","No fancy-schmancy designer has put their name on the interior, and that's just fine. I like it just the way it is. Affordable luxury with a great Chinese restaurant on the top floor. Quiet bar next door and the view over Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park is outstanding. Make sure you reserve a room on the top floors to enjoy it. 
We stayed in a spacious twin bed room with a seating area. Multiple electricity sockets (European, UK and US), great bathroom and great beds. I really enjoyed staying here.",4,2014,06,22
133,Lovely hotel expensive but very nice!,"Top service beautiful entrance next to Kensington gardens, expensive rooms and food but all very good.

Rooms lovely size and top quality bathrooms and bedrooms rooms over the park have wonderful views over Kensington gardens and London, the higher you go the better.

Easy walk to Kensington, royal Albert hall and Kensington gardens and Hyde park etc, handy pub restaurants and shops right opposite hotel if you can't afford their prices",4,2014,06,19
133,good hotel,"Stayed here on company business, for an event at the nearby Royal College of Art.

It is a very good hotel, without the over the top ostentation of some 5 star london hotels.
Great location, some rooms with views over the park.
Friendly staff, Clean comfortable spacious room. Good food.

Highly recommended.",5,2014,06,18
133,Made Me Fussy,"This hotel made me a bit fussy.  The location was great, right on Hyde Park with a Tube station close-by.  However, It didn't quite feel worth the money to me.  We weren't given complimentary Wi-Fi because we booked through a travel agent, and the Wi-Fi costs something ridiculous like 20/30 pounds for 24 hours.  Our shower wouldn't get hot, but I did like the little sitting tub they had.  Breakfast was quite good though probably not worth it if not included already in your price.",3,2014,06,16
133,"Great Service, Excellent Location & Views","My wife and I have stayed here before. When we returned in Feb 2014, we were pleased to see the improvements after the renovation. Service as before was excellent; check in was quick; room service very prompt. The hotel's restaurants are among our favorites when we visit London. The Park Terrace off the lobby and overlooking Hyde Park has one of the best English afternoon tea in London. To cater to the cosmopolitan and international clientele, it also offers among the best Asian (Singapore/Malaysian) dishes in London. Our top floor room with its very large full-width windows overlooked the Park and we could see the London skyline -- what a sight to behold on a beautiful morning --- nothing like it in London. On the same floor is what we consider to be the best Chinese restaurant in London, with a spectacular park & skyline view to wow your dining experience--- its Peking Duck is divine, carved at your table! We have tried most of the dishes and I can attest to their authenticity and fine preparation. The wait staff has always accommodated our dietary preferences. We have entertained many friends here (even the Londoners were not aware of the excellent food here and its views). Great for Sunday brunch as well. The neighborhood is terrific for strolls in the huge Hyde Park or the residential areas across the street. Whole Foods and Marks & Spencers are just a few minutes walk away. Terrific location. Very good value.",5,2014,06,16
133,Why no bell hops?,"No great complaints for what is a standard 5-star hotel in a major European metropolis.
One gripe, though.
We ordered some takeaway food from a sushi restaurant that has a delivery service. We've eaten in that sushi restaurant previously. I'd arranged to pay cash. Tipping is a weird American custom, but I like it.   
Yes, I know ordering food from outside may be seen as slightly naughty, as the hotel restaurants are good.
The food arrived promptly. So promptly that I'd just gotten out of the shower when the front desk called to say it had arrived. 
Could the food be brought up to our 6th floor room?
No. 
The delivery guy wasn't allowed up. 
I can sort of understand this in a city where there are subway announcements every few minutes warning of unattended baggage and advising people to report anything suspicious to a police officer. London does seem a mite edgy when it comes to security.
However, the notion that no member of staff was available to deliver the food to our room was hard to get my head around. The hotel doesn't employ bell hops as such. I suppose you only notice the likes of bell hops and bus boys when they're needed.
Bell hops would presumably work minimum wage. In London, that would be around $300 per week. That the $400 per night the Royal Garden charges doesn't stretch to employing bell hops is somewhat staggering.
Pressing the matter, I was told the delivery guy could be allowed access through the kitchens. What difference it makes to security whether he enters via the kitchens or the foyer is difficult to see. 
Ten minutes later I got a call from the delivery guy. He was back at the front door. He said he'd driven round to the back entrance & tried getting in via the kitchens. He'd received puzzled looks and been denied access. That's scarcely surprising.
By this time I was dressed, so I went down to collect the food.
I gave the delivery guy a ¬£10 tip. Some of that would have gone to a bell hop, had there been one.
It's always seemed to me that bell hops are standard in London, as they are elsewhere. 
Earlier in the week, I'd met a business colleague at The Wellesley, at the other end of the park. He ordered takeaway food & paid cash. A bell hop brought it up from the front desk.
Nice enough stay at the hotel, but the lack of a service allowing things brought up to your room is not good enough.",4,2014,06,15
133,Tip: open shampoo before you get in the shower,"My key tip for this hotel: the finicky little shampoo bottle is impossible to open if your fingers are wet so make sure you open them before you get in. 

My only complaint: why do they use such cheap, thing, tracing-paper-ish toilet paper? And what is the weird talcum powder stuff doing on it?

This is a nice hotel, a popular business stop and a great location with everything you might possibly need just outside your door from Ken High Street itself, to the Tube, to Hyde Park. Before OneFineStay launched in London this was where I always stayed and I had another very pleasant stay this time. 

I can also strongly recommend the physio's downstairs, in case you're in need.",4,2014,06,14
133,"Expected more of the hotel. You pay for location, which is superb.","That's it, you pay mostly for the location, which is Superb!!!
You are not paying for the hotel, which I expected more for the price I payed -King room facing Hyde Park. A little disappointing that on the second floor the view is not that nice; so you ask for an upper floor.
The room is really fancy and nice, good space, tub, bed and great pillows etc... but then the shampoo and little perks are below 5 star hotel...
So kind of contrasting, which I didn't expect for the price. But once you get out and start walking by Kensington Road and Hyde Park, you will forget how much you paid =))))",4,2014,06,12
133,Superb,"Booked this hotel for a belated wedding anniversary celebration. We were upgraded from a King room to a King room with garden view room for free.  Great location, great service.  Absolutely nothing to complain about!",5,2014,06,10
133,Exceptional accommodations,"It's a huge hotel, always very crowed, but with excellent service, a wonderful cost/benefit relationship and a very friendly staff, that is constantly at your service. One additional thing, however: THE ACCOMMODATIONS ARE SENSATIONAL in what concerts comfort, space, room amenities and VIEWS if you are turned to the Royal Garden.",4,2014,06,10
133,Bargain for a Quality London Hotel,"I find myself having to head up to London every 4 to 6 weeks.   I used to stay at the Mandarin Oriental or Intercontinental, but after a while you realize that the 200 pounds plus you often save per night staying at the Royal Garden can be quite useful in London.   

The Royal Garden is clean and comfortable, the staff are excellent as is the location.  The Chinese restaurant is first class.  Breakfast is similar to the Intercontinental - not even close to the Mandarin but at less than half the price you can't complain.

There is a Starbucks directly opposite if you don't want Breakfast.   

I haven't used the Gym in a while, but I seem to remember it wasn't impressive, but I am not working out in London I am eating and drinking.

Overall I would say the Royal Garden is a bargain in London.",4,2014,06,10
133,Great Location,"The location of this hotel is excellent. It's close access to Kensington/High St Tube station makes it easy to get to other districts.  Nothing to brag about  here but it is  clean and the service was quite good.  Biggest issue was the mattresses were hard as rocks and the pillows overly soft.   We were here for 10 nights and the room is so small that you can't relax in it comfortably.  Some of our friends had 2 twin beds pushed together and it was uncomfortable for them.  We had a King size bed and if the mattress wasn't like a brick it would have helped.

I would most likely check out other hotels in the same neighborhood to see how they compare price wise prior to booking here again just for the location.",4,2014,06,09
133,Not five star.,"We stayed here for a family wedding. Originally we booked a king room but  on arrival we were upgraded to a very large room on the tenth floor which was very comfortable and would have been more expensive.  Had we stayed in the room originally booked, some of our party were in similar rooms,  I would have felt it was poor value for money.
The hotel is very functional and lacks the character of a true 5* hotel. You could be in any city anywhere in the world. Breakfast, not included in the room rate, at ¬£25 is expensive, but on the upside there are some very good places to eat in the vicinity.
The staff were friendly and helpful. 
Would I stay there again? Probably not, it just didn't do it for me.",3,2014,06,09
133,Nothing Royal about the Royal Garden Hotel,"While the location is good, everything else about the Royal Garden Hotel is below average.  I stayed at this property for business reasons.  It is located about 5 minutes from the High Street Kennington Tube station, and it is close to the museums and parks.  Initially, I was excited about staying at this hotel.  I come to London several times per year, and I enjoyed the idea of staying at a new property.  Unfortunately, I ended up being very disappointed.

The initial clue about my stay occurred when I arrived, and no one came to help me with my luggage.  The staff all seemed to run to the Middle Eastern customers, and they ignore the other guests.  I had the same experience when I went to check in.  I stood at the front desk waiting to check in, but all of the staff walked away, went to help people who arrived after I did, or talked on their personal cell phones.  When the manager came over, he asked one of the staff to help me, and the employee said that she would help me after she finished her personal phone call.  I have never seen this occur before at a hotel.  

The room was clean but very small. Finally, I asked to check out at 12:30pm since I had a meeting that ended at noon, and I wanted to freshen up prior to departing.  The hotel would not accommodate my request, and would not allow even an extra 30 minutes.

For the price that the Royal Garden Hotel charges, I expect much better service.  While internet came with the room, the room rate of over $500 did not include breakfast.  There are lots of hotels in London, and I would highly recommend finding another property.  I will not stay at this property again.",2,2014,06,08
133,Superb,"It is easy to run out of superlatives for this hotel our one night stay which was exquisite. From the moment we entered everything was first class. We had pre theatre dinner and breakfast both of which were first class. Our room which overlooked the park was so comfortable and luxurious, the bed was big and so supportive but above all it had deep feather pillows which are so much better than the dreadful foam ones which we so often come across.",5,2014,06,08
133,Not so royal,"The hotel is ok for a night.  It's clean and basic.  We had a double room, but the bed is a SMALL DBL, so unless you love snuggling all night with your partner or are hobbits, it's not big enough for 2 adults.  The room was quite small and the water didn't get hot enough to have a nice soak in the bath.  
It's over priced (¬£230) and quite pretentious from the outside, but I definitely would not rate it as 5* or even a 4*
But the location is great.  5 mins walk from High St Kensington tube station, good shopping area. That's the only bonus.  
Don't think I'll be staying at this hotel again.",3,2014,06,07
133,Ideal location,"An ideal location.
Reservation (on-line) efficiently handled with prompt confirmation.  Reception was warm and courteous. The reserved room was not ready (we arrived early) and were accommodated in a similar room on a lower floor without the ""garden view"".
Spotlessly clean, well equipped, quiet and very comfortable. Faultless service.  Clearly, a well-managed property.  Highly recommended.",4,2014,06,07
133,Rip-off!,"Room very good with spectacular views over Kensington Gardens.  However, we are feeling very ripped-off!
We booked through a Trip Advisor offer because it clearly stated that breakfast was included, but the hotel refused to honour this, apparently because we booked more than 21 days beforehand. Breakfast is ¬£25 a head.
This is clear misrepresentation by either the hotel or Trip Advisor, and according to the staff on reception this is not the first time this has happened.
The ""reception manager"" was adamant that it was our fault and in the end we gave up arguing.  For the amount of cost to the hotel of providing breakfast it would have been good customer practice to apologise for any confusion and to honour the breakfast offer.  Instead, we were met with a very arrogant attitude. This is very poor customer relations indeed!
We will not book this hotel again and will treat Trip Advisor ""offers"" with extreme suspicion in the future.",1,2014,06,06
133,Centrally located hotel,"Great 5 star hotel centrally located near the high street, over looking the Kensington gardens and close to the Museum. Very helpful staff, rooms have been refurbished. A very comfortable stay. Very good for value.",5,2014,06,03
133,Our favourite London hotel,We have tried many of the five star hotels in London but still rate this at the top. The rooms have been refurbished and are really comfortable. The new walk in shower is the best we have experienced and beds are top quality. We have stayed in rooms overlooking the Kensington Gardens (lovely views) and also overlooking Kensington High Streety and recommend both. Not been disturbed by traffic noise. Breakfasts are excellent and would recommend afternoon tea. 24 hour flash deals are good value.,5,2014,06,02
133,"great location, great hotel, great service","I love the service at this hotel, all the staff are friendly, polite and professional: always first class customer service. It is a bit pricey but they do good deals where you can get free WiFi for your stay and free breakfast, this includes room service breakfast! The food is OK but to be honest there are so many restaurants and bars on your doorstep, your spoilt for choice! 
Holland Park is a 15min walk away, the palace gardens is like the back garden to the hotel and Harrods and Harvey Nichols is a few stops away by bus.
Mini bar is over priced but there's an off-licence shop across the road if you want a bottle of wine that won't cost you an arm and leg.
The rooms were clean with a work space, sofa and queen size bed and I had a great view of the High Street. I loooove the bathroom, though the bath could be a tad bigger but that's me being picky!
Overall this was a great weekend getaway hotel if you want to treat yourself, I will go again.",4,2014,05,28
133,Nicest hotel experience I've had in London.,"The hotel is very well placed for Hyde Park, Kensington Palace, The Museums, Kensington High St etc. it is right beside the park, and chances are you'll get a view of the gardens from your window. The room was very clean, comfortable and warm. Service was excellent in every department. Nothing to criticise...a good hotel!",5,2014,05,28
133,Another great stay,"Yet another fantastic stay and dinner in the park terrace restaurant. You simply can't beat this place, the service or the food. Fantastic!

The Park terrace restaurant has a great menu for dinner and is also great for breakfast. So many choices!",5,2014,05,28
133,Perfect,"We stayed 4 nights at the royal garden during April-May. Our room was on the 5th floor. The room was clean and tidy. The stuff was extremely friendly. We had our ""daily meeting"" with the concierge (Robert?), which was extremely helpful recommending restaurants in the area (We are both vegetarians), places to buy tickets, transportation etc.
We did not eat in the hotel.
Bottom line: Great hotel, great location, great stuff",5,2014,05,28
133,A bit like the England football team - 1966 was it's high point,"The England team celebrated its world cup win at the hotel and whilst it may be unkind to suggest that nothing much has changed, it's not took far from the truth. This is the second time I've stayed here, my boss is a creature of habit and has stayed here 4 times. Selecting a business hotel from Australia has it's perils and the main advantage of the hotel is it's location on High St Kensington on the fringes of Kensington Gardens.

You enter the hotel into a pretty soulless lobby area with a choice of 3 desks. The concierge seems to be the most heavily populated and engaged but check in is a purely transactional affair which, given the price of the rooms and the supposed 5 star status, is disappointing. The rooms are tiny and lack modern facilities such as USB charger ports - the clock radio is quaint. The bathroom is in perfect proportion to the room - positively Lilliputian.

There is nowhere to store any luggage but there is, in addition to the writing desk, a completely useless armchair and occasional table which would make navigation to the bathroom in the middle of the night a hazardous experience were in not for the strategically placed searchlights which are clearly designed to replicate a Norwegian summer evening. The wardrobe and minibar cupboard have an automatic lighting system that operates when the doors are opened. The catches on these cupboards are not the best and consequently the lights sometimes come on during the night. Happily the abundance of furniture in the room provides a fulsome source of objects to prop them shut.

The bar opening hours are bizarre and you are regularly shunted from one to another. Fortunately the nightclub next door is always open and the in-room light show allied to the regular outpouring of revellers is a constant reminder of this fact.

In keeping with many hotel of this ilk wifi charges are outrageous but these charges are in keeping with the breakfast charges - 50 dollars?

The gym - don't bother, run in Kensington Gardens instead - who wants to descend a crappy lift into a dungeon with the same proportions as the rooms. There is no sitting area, just a number of alcoves in the windows off the lobby.

The published cost is about 450 a night which is frankly taking the proverbial. Prepayment usually halves this. The staff costs of running this hotel must be horrendous - permanent housekeeping trolley presence on each floor, and don't try reading a newspaper at breakfast - you are interrupted all the time.

Finally a bit like hospitals, hotels are impossible to refurbish, especially 5 star ones. Detonate and rebuild.",2,2014,05,27
133,"Good hotel , great location , wish I had a garden facing room !","Made a trip to London after nearly a decade and the contrast from hotels in Asia was significant with smaller rooms !. 
I stayed for three nights on work and really enjoyed the stay. The location next to Kensington park is excellent and just invites you to step outdoors and enjoy nature. The weather was good and as a result I did go for a jog on two mornings. 
The Location next to good eateries and some stores also is a great advantage where you can enjoy the london pub culture even if you have only limited time. 
In fact I managed some shopping as well. The bus stop just outside the hotel and the courteous staff made the stay most enjoyable.",5,2014,05,26
133,Great location and rooms with views,"Lovely room on 9th floor. Amazing views. Was disappointed not to be able to get a drink at the hotel in one of the bars. The terrace bar did not have a space and the other bar opened at 5pm.
The cost of wifi at ¬£20 for 24 hours was quite a shock considering how many people use it everyday. Housecleaning knocked on our door at 8.50 on a Sunday morning! but that was probably our fault as we couldn't find the ""do not disturb sign"" but it was actually a switch by the door. Hotel staff very friendly. Didn't pay the ¬£25 for cooked breakfast. Location was faultless.",4,2014,05,26
133,Beware of the free wifi IF you do not book directly with the hotel.,"My wife and I and two friends stayed at the hotel for 5 nights and we were not entitled to the free wifi that they claim is available.  The reason:  we booked through a computer site.  You must book through them to get it or else, are you ready for this, they will charge you 20 pounds per day if you want the service.  There is a Starbucks across that street that is more accommodating than this rip-off.",4,2014,05,25
133,"Fabulous position , friendly excellence.","My husband and I stayed at The Royal Garden for four nights during late April 2014 and couldn't be happier with our stay. Its position on Kensington High street beside Kensington and Hyde Parks 
was great, very convenient. The staff were friendly and  professional, couldn't be faulted. Our room on the third floor was very comfortable , room service excellent. We'd definitely recommend this stay, a great base to explore London.",5,2014,05,23
133,"Again, its the small things","I stayed at the Royal Garden in end of April 2014 for four nights. Location is great as described, I could walk right through Hide Park during the tube strike, a good start of the day.

Size of the room and facilities all were as I expect at this price level. However, speaking of price, here are some points that really do not fit the (quite substantial) bill:

- wifi is not included if you do not book through the hotel website and would have been about GBP 20 per day extra
- mobile phone reception is so bad (breaking off about every minute) that I had to stop using it in the room
- while the hotel claims to have stunning views, my room on the first floor had partially blinded windows because of a very close neighboring building
- the mini bar was locked even though they had my credit card (and no, I don't think it is my task to ask for it to be unlocked, in a hotel that claims to have five star service it is their task to ask me whether I would like to have it unlocked or even unlock it without asking)

The worst point is that the room doors are so loud when they close that at 8 am sleep was no longer an option. That is the point in time when housekeeping starts and doors will be opened and closed so often that I would have needed ear plugs. And there we go, not getting the sleep for which I (or my company) have paid a lot will leave a bad impression.

So in my view this hotel is ok but not really a recommendation.",3,2014,05,19
133,Old bottle old wine,"Location- great, with Bus no. 9. & 10 right outside the hotel- take u to most of the attractions in town. The underground is a few meters away as well. High street Ken home to good mid range brands, convenient for shopping. 24/7  grocery right opposite the hotel.
Back to the hotel- old property, however the furnishing takes away the 5 star touch and the room service far from stars and the moon. Lack of consistency. Cleaning not upto the standards. I had an experience of a torn bed sheet and towel. Please bring in new towels-the crisp is missing. If the privacy light is on, plz don't ring up guests to find out what time they want the room cleaned.The tv has hardly any good channels. No swimming pool. Breakfast continental was included in the room rate and should u want to enjoy an egg or two, pay more. For Muslim visitors there is a halal Lebanese restaurant out to the right a few blocks away (laroush). If u r on business or by urself- can spend a night or two. If you are out to impress your partner, think again. ",2,2014,05,18
133,one amongst my best stays in London,"I stayed at this hotel this month for five nights. It is a very impressive building, very quiet and classy hall at the entrance, staff very friendly and helpful. My expectations about the room were confirmed: very very clean and spacious, no noise from the street even if it faced High Street Kensington, conveniently located a short walk from the tube station. Also enjoyed 24h free wi-fi... You pay the right price for the right stay!
",5,2014,05,17
133,Friendly hotel in great location,"My husband and I stayed here in March. We had a fantastic room overlooking Kensington Gardens which was well equipped with mod cons and a huge bathroom (with separate shower and bath).  The room was very clean.During our stay we had a fabulous meal at Min Jiang (Chinese restaurant on the top floor) and had breakfast both mornings. The cooked breakfast was good, although not a l carte on the weekend which was a shame as that feels more 5*. Nonetheless on weekdays they serve cooked breakfast a la carte. We went to use the sauna in the fitness centre but the saunas are in the changing rooms so single sex - and not so nice to sit in sauna alone. Would be great for the hotel to have a proper spa. 

Overall the staff was extremely professional and helpful.",4,2014,05,14
133,"This hotel is a classic. Ask for a garden view, our was 937","Have stayed in this hotel before a long time ago, before the renovations were made, and was not disappointed. I remember the downstairs cafe being a bit cosier, but it was fine. The room was a bit odd, in that there were a couple of steps in the room leading up to the desk, electricity outlets, chair and window, which was a bit awkward, especially for my grandmother who was traveling with me. Other than that the room was comfy, the staff were wonderfully helpful and courteous and the view was divine, especially given the bright and warm weather while we were there. I strongly recommend a garden view and this hotel. The hotel to me feels like a classic, somewhere where you know what you are going to get. Great stay!",5,2014,05,12
133,A lovely week-end,"Just returned home from spending a lovely week-end at this super hotel.  The main reason for our visit to London was to attend a concert at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday evening and this hotel was so convenient with underground car parking (a bit 'hairy' driving down the slope) .  Our room 230, facing Kensington High Street was modern and very clean and tidy. The bathroom was delightful with oodles of hot water in the fantastic shower.  Found the traffic and party goers a little noisy on Saturday evening but it didn't bother us unduly.  Staff were very friendly and helpful without being overbearing.  The food was delicious.  So - all in all I cannot find fault anywhere.  We will definitely be back.  Incidentally the concert was fantastic too !!",5,2014,05,11
133,Fantastic Service,From day one the concierge desk looked after us exceptionally well.  Service here 5 star in all areas housekeeping.  Reception the lot highly recommended hotel.  Would stay again.  Location great next to Kensington gardens and hyde park,5,2014,05,10
133,"""Queen"" room is AWFUL!!!!!",I have never stayed at any hotel with a supposed five star rating that I thought so bad. There is one drawer (basically a file drawer in the desk and no where to unpack your clothing that is not hung. I have one standard size suitcase and there was literally no place to put it in this tiny room other than the bench seat where it still occupied the area between the window and the bed. Thinking that I might upgrade I inquired from a very inflexible Manager to find that a room with a dresser was two grades higher and would be 80pounds more plus tax. Add this to the ridiculous policy that unless you book directly with them internet is an outrageous 20 pounds per 24 hrs (plus tax) and local telephone calls are 55p each and I would never stay there again.,2,2014,05,09
133,Nice place indeed!,"Great hotel with an ideal location.
The staff is polite and efficient, well done!
Food is ok : they are obviously trying hard, and the service is very professional, except for the basket of bread in which you have to put your hand to pick up your bread, whereas the waiter is wearing gloves...(for that purpose we presumed...)",4,2014,05,08
133,Beautiful hotel rooms with beautiful views.,We stayed in the Garden King room which had unbelievable view of the park and sky line of London. Rooms were spacious and well appointed apart from the 2 or 3 steps dividing the bedroom and lounge area (which both my partner and I stumbled off a couple of times). The service was fantastic (although there was an error in the room type booked - but that could have been Bookings.com's error?). The concierge was helpful in arranging our taxi to the airport early in the morning.  We really enjoyed staying at this hotel for the last few days of our vacation.,5,2014,05,08
133,Nice views and bed but old furniture ,"Old carpet and wood furniture that doesnt match with the nice floor lenght glass windows looking for the kendignton garden!
Also nice restaurant chinese on top floor!
I would stay there again sometoime. 
Its a value choice for london abd well located",3,2014,05,08
133,Nice 5 star hotel,"When I rate hotels or restaurants, I had to admit that it is always somewhat price/quality related rating. It wwa snot easy t decide weather to give 5 or 4 for this hotel 

Plus:

- When you stay in five star hotel you expect to have excellent service and that was definitely the case. Service was on the high end what I have ever received. Special thanks for that.
- I had a room from that had nice view towards Kensington High Street and room itself was large and really comfortable. 

Minus:

- There could have been more storage base and I really missed the possibility to iron in the room. 
- Breakfast was good but I was expecting a bit more. In my opinion scrambled eggs are good way to measure the quality of the kitchen and I'm a 100% snobb when it comes to my breakfast.. Though I ordered my English Breakfast and it was not buffet, scrambled eggs felt like thy have either been overcooked or spent their time in bain-marie longer they should have. Bacon however was excellent.",4,2014,05,08
133,Perfect Afternoon Tea,"After finding out at the last minute, that I would be able to see my daughter for her 18th birthday, I called the Royal Garden Hotel.  The Park Terrace restaurant telephone line, where the afternoon tea is served was busy, so the hotel arranged a call back.  After 5 minutes, I was called by Edyta Malz, who was very pleasant and helpful.  She said that she would arrange for a candle and also a Happy Birthday sign to come out with the cakes and also try and get us a window table over looking the park, but could not promise anything.  All details were then emailed to me for confirmation.

On arriving at this beautiful hotel yesterday, we were greeted immediately and seated on our window table overlooking Hyde Park.  Edyta also greeted us as if she already knew us, which was lovely and made my daughter feel special.

The service was fantastic, from smelling the samples of tea and listening to the explanation from the tea sommelier, to the finger sandwiches.  To be honest, we thought that we would still be a little hungry after we left (as we had read reviews about small servings for afternoon tea), but when we saw the selection of cakes and delicious scones, our tastebuds and tummies were definitely full.

Even my 10 year old son enjoyed the experience, as he doesn't drink tea, they brought him a lemonade and his own plate of sandwiches and he shared our array of cakes and scones.

The price for The Kensington Tea is ¬£26 per person and for The Royal Tea ¬£36 per person, which has the addition of strawberries with a balsamic drizzle and a glass of champagne.  Compared to other hotels offering afternoon tea, I would say the the price is very reasonable and I cannot see how we would have had better service etc paying ¬£57 per head at The Ritz.

Thank you to Edyta and the team in the Park Terrace restaurant, for a memorable afternoon. We would definitely recommend this hotel",5,2014,05,06
133,Was expecting more,"We stayed four nights here in April 2014 and expected more from a 5 star hotel.  The staff was knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful.  That is always a plus.  But the room was on the small size and there is very little closet space and drawer space.  We decided not to unpack because it wouldn't fit anyway.  We've stayed at 3 star hotels in the US which we bigger and had more space for clothing.  That is why I only gave the hotel 3 stars.  If you don't care about this, then you'll be fine because it's a good location and everyone was friendly.",3,2014,05,05
133,Relaxing in luxury!,"Stayed here for 2 nights (as an excuse to burn some of my Disney Vacation Club allowance) in a king room. We didn't want to leave! Our room on the 4th floor faced Kensington High Street so great for people watching and at night there was no noise from outside. The room itself was split level with the desk, coffee table and sofa on a raised part by the window. Bathroom was divine with Penhaligons toiletries. Our kettle died but was replaced immediately, super service from housekeeping. The breakfast was included in our booking and was fabulous, lots of choice and all very fresh. Only niggle were the pillows, they were so soft that one wasn't enough and two was too much. All in all, we can't wait to go back!",5,2014,05,04
133,Five star service in great location!,"My daughter and I stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel this past April for a week (along with my sister and her partner) and it was really, really quite wonderful.  We requested garden views but, for some reason, they had not reserved garden rooms when we checked in.  However, they promptly corrected the problem and were very apologetic.  We requested garden views because they're much quieter than rooms facing the street (very busy).  We stayed in a double with twin beds on the 5th floor which was very spacious.   The continental breakfast was lovely and all staff were friendly and extremely accommodating. The concierge staff were especially helpful, providing us with directions, maps -- you name it.  They were especially great at making excellent suggestions for local restaurants.  The hotel is right next door to Kensington Palace, with Marks & Spencer, Boots, the tube and even Portobello Road Market within walking distance.  I would definitely go back.",5,2014,05,03
133,Lovely hotel in excellent location,"Stayed in the Royal Garden Hotel for a week and it was a wonderful experience. The staff were all professional, helpful and friendly. The King room I occupied on the 10th floor was always clean and whenever I called for room service or reception, they knew my name and everything was delivered or collected in the shortest time. I love its location, next to Kensington Garden and Hyde Park, also walking distance to the Royal Albert Hall, museums and High Street Kensington that was a good place to shop and have meals. The close proximity to a tube station and a bus stop right in front of the hotel makes it easy for one to travel to other parts of London easily.",5,2014,05,03
133,Be aware of rooms with interconnecting doors!,"Stayed on the 30th April for one night, travelling for business. Booked a queen room but was given a twin. This was actually a bonus as iit was more spacious than a queen room with a sofa area and a fantastic view over Kensington high street (on the 9th floor). The only problem was that it had a door to the next room. The inhabitants of the next room were (I think) a family travelling with a young child/baby. 11pm, fair amount of noise from next door - doors slamming, loud talking and lots of what sounded like crockery being used as a drum kit. By 3am this was still continuing, along with the joyful sound of the person next door brushing their teeth and hacking up phlegm into their basin. Moor door slamming and crockery drumming. After a call to reception to complain the noise did stop. I would just be wary of staying in an interconnecting room in the future. I think the hotel should also be aware that the people in these rooms can hear each other and maybe, putting a business traveller in a room next to a young family is not always going to end happily. Overall the facilities and staff were excellent and the only downside is that I have NEVER experienced such a disturbed night's sleep. Not even in a travelodge...",4,2014,05,02
133,Lovely tea in lovely surroundings,"We took afternoon tea here on a busy Saturday in April. The afternoon tea itself was very good, comprising of finger sandwiches, 2 scones per person, 2 cakes and 2 fancies, although the fare just lacked a ""wow"" factor. In truth, the bread could have been a bit fresher for the sandwiches.

There was a fantastic selection of teas, brought out for you to savour prior to choosing. I spent an extra ¬£2.50 on a tea that was meant to ""explode"" a variety of flavours, but in all honesty, not a lot of exploding went on.

That aside, service was fantastic from a really professional set of staff, and the ambience was wonderful. With views over Kensington Gardens, and a delightful tinkling on the piano (from a truly gorgeous looking pianist...) in the background, it made for a special occasion, and I have no qualms in recommending it, apart from the caveats given above.",4,2014,04,29
133,Loved the staff,"Outstanding staff.  I was continuously amazed by how pleasant every encounter was, no matter the department.  Comfortable, spacious room with very good lighting.  Try the bar on the 10th floor.  They made a really good Bloody Mary.  I will definitely stay at the Royal Garden again.",5,2014,04,28
133,Royal Service,"I stayed at the RGH for 4 nights from April 12. It was a special trip to surprise my family for my mother‚Äôs 80th birthday. No-one in the family knew I was coming for the celebratory meal they had planned at the hotel. The staff at RGH helped me arrange my stay to pull off this surprise. Even though it was Easter and spring break and the hotel was full, the staff kept in touch with me in the US to finalize details. It was a huge success. My mother had a great time. I could not have done it without the wonderful staff at RGH, particularly, Sasha, Tyrone and Rebecka. They were consistently pleasant, resourceful and professional. In fact, every member of staff whom I encountered was helpful, friendly and courteous.
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. My room had a great view overlooking Kensington Palace and park. The toiletry items were exquisite, and I liked that the sound from the entertainment system could be piped into the bathroom. The iron and board I had requested were already in the room when I arrived. Room service for breakfast was quick, and the food was excellent and meticulously presented. This made up for the fact that breakfast in the Park Terrace lounge is expensive.
RGH is a beautiful hotel in a great location, but the most impressive feature of my stay was the service, truly royal. I definitely hope to return.",5,2014,04,28
133,"Not 5 star, no swimming pool, location good","Pros

Nice part of London
Room nicely designed and comfortable

Breakfast extortionately expensive",4,2014,04,28
133,First Class In My Book..,"I had the opportunity to stay at the Royal Garden Hotel during the week of April 14th. We arrived early UK time at around 11AM. When we got to the hotel we were greeted with smiling faces from the Front Desk team of Katie, Laura and Margaret, all willing to help get us into our rooms as quickly as possible at the time of check in.  Once we were situated in our rooms, the service never stopped, fresh fruit delivered on the first day to the time we left when the Hotel Manager sent cake to us thanking us for staying with them.
 
During our stay, we had the continental breakfast, where the hostess Martha greeted us with a smile each morning and always seated us promptly. In the evenings when we would go down to the Park Terrace Restaurant for a drink we were always greeted by the friendly host Michael and Daniel the waiter always provided us with impeccable service. The bartender Gaetano was friendly and helpful in recommending drinks (you have to try his Coffee Martini).

The rooms are very nice, bright and clean, which are maintained by a tip top housekeeping team who were always on their game by providing prompt service no matter what time of day it was.  The hotel is in a great location right next to Kensington Palace, which is a great place to walk and just enjoy the weather. A walk to Notting Hill is just a few blocks away as is the Royal Albert Hall.  The Tube is right down the block and there are ample restaurants and shops in the area. A great hotel run by an excellent team at all levels of the organization.",5,2014,04,27
133,Deluxe stay,"I was lucky enough to stay here in between doing tours ran by BackRoad tours. I was impressed with the friendly, courteous staff. Breakfast was divine with such a vast variety to select from, couldn't fault the staff here. The rooms were spacious, clean. Though my favourite would have to be the delicious,scrumptious,afternoon tea.
I am excited about the fact that I am returning for a longer stay in September,2015.",5,2014,04,27
133,Great hotel even though there was a few issues,"We arrived at the hotel by taxi and a concierge had taken our luggage up to reception before we had even got out of the taxi which was impressive.  Unfortunately our room was not ready (1.30pm) but the lady on reception said she would phone us as soon as it was so we went for a wonder, by 2.45pm still no call so we went back and were told it was ready and apologized for not ringing they told us our luggage had been taken to the room.  We went up and were impressed by the room but there was no luggage, we rang reception and they said it would up now, a porter did arrive after another 10 minutes but with the WRONG luggage we did eventually get our luggage but it did put our plans back at least an hour.  We could see the Chelsea football stadium from our room which was on the 10th floor with the Chinese restaurant and everytime we came up you could smell the fried rice (not in the room luckily).  We ate at the hotel restaurant on the first night and the food was very good especially the pudding I highly recommend the hot chocolate cup.  Downside wine was very expensive.

When we stayed Sunderland Football team were there and we chatted to one of the players in the lift.

GREAT LOCATION         LOVELY BIG ROOM          DRESSING GOWNS PROVIDED",4,2014,04,25
133,Started bad and got better.. not a true 5 star,"We were offered a stay here for easter weekend by my parents. Unfortunately this concept didnt penetrate the receptionists mind and we spent half an hour finding a solution until finally I had to borrow money from my girlfriend to offer her this trip. Alright. Rebeka or whatever her name is didnt even want to put me in touch with the manager on duty as ""he could not do anything""... In the end we had to rush to get ready quickly as we were expected. The next day we returned to speak to a manager (after writing an email), he managed to sort things out quickly by sending a pay link to my parents last minute and pay back my girlfriend as a deposit... 

That was the probably worst part of it.

Breakfast was good.

The hotel is nice but if you appreciate quality and style you would assume this to be a ****L hotel....

The room was falling apart.. bin was broken and bath tub wouldnt empty for a while. Cleaning was minimal. 

Would definitely not recommend and never stay there again. 

Do not stay in room 1004.

Maybe I am a bit harsh but if I judge against my concept of a 5* hotel I think my valuation is justified. Of course you can always compare with the worst but that isnt how you improve.",2,2014,04,24
133,"Great Location, lovely hotel","We stayed here for one night for a trip to The Royal Albert Hall which is only a 7 minute walk away.  It is close to Kensington Gardens where you can have a lovely walk, close to shops and restaurants.  The hotel couldn't be faulted in any way.  Staff were so pleasant and helpful, nothing too much trouble, rooms luxurious and spotlessly clean.  All in all a lovely stay and would certainly return again",5,2014,04,23
133,Very Nice,"Stayed here for an Audience with Mo Farah. Room was very nice and so were the amenities, with staff very attentive. I would like to see an iron in the room though 

Service was excellent but the food was the star of the show, I think I will come back with my girlfriend",4,2014,04,21
133,Excellent hotel,"We visited London for my son's spring break.  Our party was a total of 10 people as it was my family, my brother's, and our parents.  The hotel is very modern and clean and the staff was extremely friendly.  We had the English breakfast every day which had a very nice assortment of choices.  The hostess in the morning who seated us for all but two of our breakfasts (she was off) was very nice and remembered our room numbers making us feel even more welcomed at the hotel.  In the evenings, my brother and our children would go to Park Terrace for a night cap or two.  The evening host, Michael was extremely friendly as was Daniel (sp?), the bartender/server.  Daniel(Sp?) even remembered our drinks from the evening before.  The Guest Relations Officer, I think it was Simona Riccio was extremely pleasant and sincere.  One of our five rooms was not ready and when the room was ready, she brought the room keys to us.  On a final note, a couple of days prior to our departure, the hotel surprised us with complimentary chocolate cake which was delicious.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a hotel that offers world class service.",5,2014,04,21
133,Superb,Spent three nights at Royal Garden. We took our teenage grandson to London as a treat. Everything at Royal Garden was perfect: room luxurious; food sublime; staff exemplary; staff excellent. We had to wait for our room because some guests leave their luggage in their rooms delaying the checking out  process. Hotel provided us with delicious coffee and the hour we waited was soon gone. ,5,2014,04,20
133,Mediocre tea,"Booked this afternoon tea for a catch up with one of my friends in London. I have been to various hotels across London and in other hotels and I have to say, unfortunately, this afternoon tea didn't live up to my expectations and I was disappointed. 
We both chose the English Breakfast tea and it was rather weak in taste and in colour. Through my own taste I only ate roughly 3 of the offered sandwiches, which were tiny, half of a finger. 
The scones were lovely and warm, yet rather doughy on the inside and again on the small side. Lastly, the cakes were ok, good selection but didn't live up to much in taste. 

I must seem like I am slating the afternoon tea, but for a lovely hotel in London, it could have been better, it was more Hilton Radisson rather than The Goring.",2,2014,04,20
133,Excellent hotel!,"Just returned from a 7 night stay at the Royal Garden with my family.  Great location, beautiful comfortable rooms, lovely view, wonderful breakfast and very helpful staff.  I will definitely stay at this hotel on future visits to London.  The extra touches -- complimentary water every day, welcome fruit plate-- really made the stay very special.",5,2014,04,19
133,A great hotel with a great location,"The service was great and the people very helpful at this hotel.  They were attentive to our needs, and helpful with their information.  The breakfast was expensive, but we were able to get it included in our room rate and we very much enjoyed the choices available. The continental breakfast was great.  The room was large - for London Standards- and the location fantastic.  It was about a block away from the tube station, and the bus system was easy to figure out, with a bus stop directly in front of the  hotel. I would certainly return to this hotel in the future.",5,2014,04,19
133,Contemporary stylish place with staff to match,"Just stayed for two nights whilst attending a charity event. We stretched our visit to two nights to get a little time in London. I've stayed before and love this hotel, this was my husbands first stay and he declared it his favourite hotel in London - praise indeed given the amount of places we have stayed. As a runner he particularly like the fact it was on the edge of Kensington Palace Gardens for his training sessions.

We had a King room which was very spacious and just my style of furnishing - contemporary, quality soft furnishings, gorgeous white bed linen, different lighting options, comfy sofa next to a simple desk. Proper place to charge your phones etc effective blackout curtains, bath robes and a decent shower.

The staff are absolutely first rate here, all very friendly and everyone you meet acknowledges you. We had breakfast one morning in the hotel and they happily made me mushrooms on toast, which wasn't on the menu. My husband, who has to be the worlds biggest consumer of Eggs Benedict, declared it perfect. Service was excellent and they were happy to keep serving us tea and toast way after breakfast had officially finished.

i honestly can't say anything negative about this hotel, excellent in its category of 5 star London hotels, I've a feeling we'll be coming back!

The whole hotel is spacious and immaculate, a great contemporary stylish place with staff to match.",5,2014,04,18
133,Excellent service with Kensington Gardens in the backyard,"Staff is extremely helpful, rooms are nicely appointed but not large.  Ask for a room off the street with view of Garden.  Bathroom is fine though the tub is a bit tall.  Location is why prices are a premium.  Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park just steps away.  Plenty of restaurants and shopping near by with a Starbucks across the street.  5 min walk to tube station.",4,2014,04,18
133,Impressive in every way,"My mother stayed here for 3 nights for her 80th birthday and it was indeed a very special birthday treat!  The hotel location, interior and amenities are all wonderful - but what made her stay really special was the fantastic customer service that she received throughout her stay.  Every member of staff that we encountered was unfailingly welcoming, helpful and happy to go the extra mile.  We can't thank everyone enough for the amazing time that we had,  This was certainly a birthday to remember!  We will definitely be back.",5,2014,04,17
133,A good experience over all,"I stayed here for six nights with a family member.  The location is amazing, our room had a wonderful view of the park and we were close to the tube and plenty of restaurants, shops and attractions.  The Royal Albert Hall was within walking distance and buses stopped right outside of the hotel.

For the most part the room was very clean, it could have used some dusting but the bathroom was immaculate and very roomy.  Everything was in good condition and very comfortable.  The d√©cor was a bit drab and plain but the view made up for that.

I requested a room with twin beds and was surprised to find the beds joined together to make one bed.  Why bother calling it a room with two twin beds?  Fortunately my family member was OK sharing a bed with me.

The staff was excellent, particularly the concierge staff.  They were very helpful when it came to recommending the best means of transportation and provided good restaurant suggestions.  When our first choice for afternoon tea was booked, they thoughtfully made reservations at another venue and it turned out to be a highlight of our trip.  They were kind enough to follow up with us to make sure we were happy with the experience.  We asked for theatre tickets and the seats were great.  This was the best concierge service I've ever encountered.

There was an issue with the airport transportation.  We were arriving on different flights an hour apart.  I had suggested that they pick us up at the same time so that I wouldn't have to pay a ""wait fee"" but was told that this wasn't a good idea.  I should have been more insistent.  The driver picked me up (my flight arrived first) and then I sat around by myself for an hour waiting for the other person's flight to arrive.  The charge for this was very expensive.  I basically paid $100 to sit in the airport.

Overall this was a good experience and I would probably stay there again.",4,2014,04,16
133,Afternoon tea for two (and a half),"We were given afternoon tea as a Virgin Experience gift along with a visit to Kensington Palace. On arrival at reception we received a smiling welcome and were shown (not just directed) to the restaurant and handed over to the Maitre d'. Having been seated at a table overlooking the park, we were seen by a succession of charming, attentive but unobtrusive waiters and waitresses- the first instantly noticed that my wife was pregnant and checked that the sandwich fillings would be suitable, and a vegetarian diet was instantly catered for.  There was a glorious selection of cakes, sandwiches and of course speciality teas, all beautifully presented. The mood was completed by a fabulous cocktail pianist. 

Would definitely recommend this for anyone wanting the traditional British high tea experience.",5,2014,04,16
133,Not a 5 star!,"The hotel is well situated on Kensington High Street, and has recently been refurbished, but it's just not in the same league as other 5 star hotels in central London.

Rooms are small, pillows are too soft, The Park terrace restaurants food was average.
I hear the Chinese restaurant in the hotel is better...

Breakfast was nice food, but they got the order wrong and then the rest of it arrived too late...

It's a shame, but there are nicer hotels in the local area...",3,2014,04,16
133,Absolutely amazing!,"This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in!  I love it and cannot wait to return.  Thank you to Neilio and Sacha for such a warm, friendly and smiling welcome.  Thanks to Isabella and Csaba for their attentiveness and friendly, service at breakfast.  The housekeeping staff for the hard work they put in to keep the rooms so clean, tidy and replenished of the 'yummy' things!

If you eat here Park Terrace is the place to go.  Massimo - thank you for remembering us!  The food is just amazing, fantastic, superb, succulent... too many words, not enough space!  Just go and try it!  Thanks to Nora and Michael for looking after us.  Michael is an amazing person, who knows the menu inside out and will advise on any dietary requirements - he goes that extra mile to ensure your food is ordered to your liking and need.  He really is amazing!

This hotel is just the place to go.  WE WILL BE RETURNING and VERY SOON I HOPE!",5,2014,04,15
133,Very busy hotel,The hotel was quite good. It was a busy weekend for the hotel as the London marathon was on. Check in was very slow. Rooms were to be available from 2pm but I didn't get mine until 2.45pm and the bags weren't sent up for another 30 minutes. Some of the receptionists seemed a little inexperienced.,4,2014,04,14
133,Most comfy bed ever,"Had a really good night rest here nad my bed was made every morning (I'm not used to 5 star hotels). Room was quite chilly when I arrived, and rather small but very clean and tidy. Bathroom too. Interior is very classic, but didn't bother me in any way.",4,2014,04,14
133,Royal treatment,"Having stayed at the Royal Garden a couple of times there has to be a reason that I continue to return.  It's not part of a big hotel chain, and I think that's what I like.  The service and location, comfort levels and general hospitality are of a very high standard.  The Japanese restaurant is among the best in London and worth a visit alone.

Observation: The rooms are modern and contemporary but I think the exterior of the RG belies this and it reminds me of an 80s office block. Time for an upgrade outside!",4,2014,04,14
133,Lunch time views across a sunlit Kensington Gardens,"I went with a friend to the newly revamped The Terrace Restaurant in the hotel.  The sun was streaming through, lots of tables booked; well healed elderly gathering for an occasion; ladies who lunch; tourists and business folk.  We had the set menu - amazing value ¬£16/2 or ¬£20/3 courses.  OK you can get this in the nearby national chain eateries but you don't really expect such value from a hotel of this standing.  And it was delicious.  Would highly recommend the lamb and to follow the cheesecake which came with a lemon zest base.  This is a great place if you want to impress friends or clients without breaking the bank.  Good service, lovely light room and good food.",5,2014,04,10
133,"Brilliant hotel, service and location.","This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel when going to see Chelsea play. The location, service, staff and hotel is excellent. Will definitely be going back.  It is very luxurious, staff are more than helpful with whatever you may want or need. It is in a brilliant location within 2 minutes walk from the High St Kensington tube station.  There are also some lovely restaurants really close which if you have been out all day is lovely to be close to the hotel.",5,2014,04,07
133,Afternoon Tea,"The afternoon tea experience at Royal Garden Hotel was absolutely splendid! I took my mother and auntie for a quiet afternoon for mothers day. The experience was lovely , the staff were very attentive to our needs. The portion sizes and service was lovely and just right. I would definately recommend it.",5,2014,04,03
133,Afternoon Tea,"We went here for a Mothers Day Afternoon tea. The pictures on the website really don't do this place justice. It is beautifully decorated inside and the restaurant overlooks the park. The staff were very attentive and couldn't do enough for you. They bring out a tray of tea to smell and decide which ones you want. The only niggling suggestion was there was only two de-caff teas, I would have loved to try one of the Chinese teas as a tea ceremony but all contained caffeine. I had a gluten and dairy free afternoon tea and was not disappointed. They had a large plate of finger sandwiches followed by scones, cakes and mini deserts. Would definitely return as was a real treat.",5,2014,03,31
133,"Low ceilings, plenty to drink","Luxurious and pleasant London hotel ... not your usual British stuffy old room with mildewy carpet, but everything shiny and new and tasteful and practical. See photos. Tiny elevators and low ceilings still provide evidence one is in the UK. But at least plenty of hot water! Top notch location on Kensington high street, where all the restaurants have extortionate prices, and Kensington park, where a stroll is for free. Staff was friendly and efficient. 

The British propensity to alcoholism is properly supported here with full sized wine bottles in the minibar and the option to have a bar with a selection of open liquor bottles served in your room (at a price). Never seen this somewhere else before. 

Good meeting facilities in the basement also for larger groups, regrettably no windows there.",5,2014,03,29
133,March 2014 stay,"The Royal Garden Hotel isn't far from High Street Kensington tub station, on the corner of Kensington Park and very close to a number of lovely restaurants - so an all round great location.
The hotel itself is very clean and modern with efficient front desk staff making our check in (and out) very speedy indeed. Our room was superb, fantastic bathroom - personal spa style shower and lovely products to use in the bubble bath.
We stayed on a Bed and Breakfast basis so had breakfast on each of the 3 mornings we stayed at the hotel. Service was fantastic on the first morning, attentive but not overbearing. Plenty of hot coffee and beautifully prepared poached eggs, just as I like them. But on the second and third morning whilst the food was ok the service was mediocre and now what I was expecting (especially taking into account our first mornings experience).
We were staying as Disney Vacation Members so it is always the case that we compare Disney service to that of the hotels. No comparison in our view, this was simply because of the lack of consistency which Disney are able to achieve every time.
Shame, but have to say, we would still stay again - if only to take advantage of the location.
You will enjoy you stay here, but the service could improve...",4,2014,03,27
133,Little touches made it 5 stars for me,"I recently spent five nights at this hotel during a trip combining business with pleasure. Prior to my arrival I had sent an email requesting a room on a high floor overlooking the Gardens. The receptionist spent a very good fifteen minutes (apologising for the time it was taking as she did so) to find me a suitable room and I was delighted with the result - a spacious room on the 7th floor with a direct view over the Gardens and Kensington Palace. The location of this hotel is brilliant, with a wide variety of restaurants a couple of minutes away and lots of shops, not to mention the pleasure of a peaceful stroll in the Gardens. Easy access to anywhere is ensured by the several buses which stop immediately outside and the tube is a couple of minutes away. I cannot comment on the breakfast as I only had coffee on the days I was there.Two other personal touches also counted for me: the lady who cleaned my room who reminded me that I should drink the mineral water in the fridge which was complimentary and, best of all, following my departure when I sent a mail asking about the shampoo supplied in the bathroom which I had used and loved (Penhaligon's) not only did I get a very prompt and thorough reply about this relatively trivial matter, but samples arrived on my doorstep in France a few days later.",5,2014,03,26
133,Afternoon tea,"On a quick visit we wanted somewhere special for afternoon tea. This turned out to be a really good choice. The terrace overlooks the park, it is comfortable, not too grand to be intimidating but enough to be special. Tea excellent. A well judged selection of sandwiches, delightful cake, lovely delicacies and scones with jam and clotted cream. Carefully served by friendly courteous staff..it made a lovely afternoon.",5,2014,03,26
133,Good but not 5* and very noisy,"Pleased we didnt pay full price for this stay.
Hotel location excellent
We had a main road facing room on 2nd floor (217) and it was extremely noisy on Saturday night (Friday was OK)- it overlooked a bus stop which was noisy even at 3am but (as a previous reviewer stated) the main problem was the night club in the basement full of revellers smoking and shouting outside. It sounded like the window was open - it wasnt!!
Breakfast was OK but not 5* - cold baked beans, poor quality sausages and generally average food (we were late down (9.45am) so expect food had been standing a while). Continental breakfast much better although did temporarily run out of items on the saturday
Staff all good and helpful",3,2014,03,24
133,true five stars,"The Royal Garden is set at the end of Kensington High Street , and on the edge of the park, so there is plenty to do, around and about. The hotel is excellent . the rooms were spacious, even for a double room and the bathroom was huge by London hotel standards. We didn't upgrade to a full English breakfast because there was so much choice with the Continental buffet. All the food was good quality and plenty of it. The waiter on our first morning was really polite and offered fresh orange juice and toast without having to be asked , but on the second morning we had a woman, who just seemed to want to clear tables, (at a slow pace )and we had nearly finished breakfast and I had to asked for toast and then I had to ask for fresh orange. I must say there is plenty of juices to help yourself with, from Grapefruit to apple juice, The pillows were too soft for me, but the next day I asked for firmer ones and they sent some up to the room straight away. We got a very good deal on this Hotel through Debenhams Box office, it even had Theatre tickets in with the deal .",5,2014,03,21
133,Location Location Location,"What a conveniently situated hotel.  So central and being right next to Hyde Park was fabulous.  Will definitely be back.  Staff are efficient and professional, food was great, overall a good choice. Whether for business or pleasure, this hotel works....",4,2014,03,19
133,"Lovely rooms, Great service","My wife and I had a night away from our little one, and stayed here. We had a wonderful visit. We had booked a Garden view room, but were upgraded to a large suite which was fantastic. The views were superb, and the service was excellent. The breakfast was particularly good. It is such a good location, right next to the park, that we were able to explore a bit of London, as well as sit out in the sunshine in the park for a picnic. A perfect weekend. Thank you, we will return!",5,2014,03,18
133,"a wonderful stay, Thank you","a long weekend away with a friend at this wonderful 5* hotel, and it truly is 5*. The staff were very attentive friendly, the hotel location is perfect for all your needs and walking distance from Harrods and other large department stores. The food in the hotel was excellent an highly recommend the eggs Benedict for breakfast. i will defiantly be returning as soon as possible.",5,2014,03,18
133,Luxury and service do go hand in hand.,"Had the pleasure of staying in the Royal Garden for a special occasion recently. My only regret is that I didn't make more use of the hotels facilities and restaurants.
Our plan was to find a really nice hotel that was also very convenient. This fitted perfectly. 
 
What more could you ask for. 5 star luxury in such a great location. Step outside the door and if you need, step on a bus (stops right outside) or tube accross the road. The area has an abundance of restaurants in the immediate vicinity. We spent each day tripping in the centre of London so we didn,t spend enought time in the Hotel. What time we spent was a pleasure, in 5 star luxury. The staff were really helpful and extremely nice. The room was top class and really back)quiet, ( I think we were lucky with the room location in the back)

Made our special occasion really memorable and I would have no hesitation in recommending this Hotel.",5,2014,03,17
133,Kept awake by noisy night club,"The location of this hotel is perfect for exploring London; plenty restaurants on the high street and the view of the park from the top floor is just amazing.
My room overlooked a bus stop so it was noisy but the main problem was the night club in the basement full of revellers smoking and shouting outside. The noise of broken glasses kept me awake all night.  In the morning; I spoke to a Filipino lady at the breakfast room.  She was very apologetic but the reception team didn`t show any care when I reported this on check out.
Not sure if I would come back to the Royal Gardens; at least until they sort this club out.",2,2014,03,16
133,Excellent choice and location,"The second time I stayed in this hotel and again for a conference. The staff is very friendly and helpful althought they failed to call me when my room would be ready as they promised to do so.
Instead I had to inquire again myself at the reception an hour after I arrived (around 2 pm)
The English breakfast is an extra whopping 25 GBP (those London prices never cease to amaze me) but the continental breakfast (also extra 20 GBP) just includes a selection at the buffet (without eggs) which is sufficient but not overwhelming either. The room are excellent for London standards but tend to be a bit noisy (with sounds of alarmclocks, wak-up calls, slamming doors from the adjacent rooms). The location near Kensington Gardens is very convenient to travel around the rest of central London.",4,2014,03,15
133,"Lovely hotel, would recommend!","I stayed here for one night in February. I was impressed with the staff on Reception, they were very courteous and helpful.
My room was a pleasant surprise,it was large and had fantastic views overlooking Kensington Palace. I tend not to sleep very well in London Hotels as they can be quite noisy in my experience, but the Royal Garden was very quiet, the beds were comfortable, but I was a bit chilly in the night.
The bathroom was lovely, spotlessly clean and with fluffy gowns and a lovely deep bath.
The breakfast was ok, but nothing amazing. Croissants, toast, fruit etc. I was surprised to see that the toaster looked like it was a value toaster from a supermarket, that had seen better days!
The hotel is in a fantastic location, very easy to get around London from here.
Also, the concierge was a true gent, even when people were being rude to him, perhaps a queuing system might help when it is busy?
Overall though I would thoroughly recommend this hotel, and hope to stay there again!",4,2014,03,13
133,A room with a view!,"I love the Royal Garden Hotel. I always book a Garden King Room to ensure I get those wonderful views across Kensington Gardens and the London skyline in the distance. Fabulous restaurants, friendly staff and that little bit of luxury you want to just make your trip to London a pleasurable experience. I look forward to my next visit.",5,2014,03,13
133,"Good business hotel, but is it a five star? Hardly.","I stayed at Royal Garden last week, because I attended a conference taking place at that hotel. It is indeed a good hotel: friendly staff, clean overall, rooms good (except for air-conditioning), location perfect (Kensington, close to the subway station, near the park), etc. The breakfast at the roof was OK, but overpriced. But is it a five star? Hardly. Come on. It is a good 4 star business hotel.",4,2014,03,13
133,Definitely Recommended,"My husband booked us in for one nights stay as a Birthday surprise, we didn't actually eat in the Hotel so i cant comment on that, but i can highly recommend this Hotel for it's very helpful and friendly staff and clean large bedrooms. We were on the 4th floor with a huge room overlooking Kensington Palace and the surrounding gardens, with great big windows. The room had a sitting area with sofa, desk and fully stocked fridge, you can even open a bottle of champagne that's available in the Mini bar if you want to. The bathroom is lovely and spacious with separate shower cubicle and dressing gowns provided along with slippers.I was sent up a plate of lovely 'Happy Birthday' chocolates 10 minutes after check in which i thought was a lovely touch and much appreciated. 
We ate somewhere else which had already been pre booked but we had a drink in the hotel bar beforehand and when we arrived back later that night and the staff were great, very attentive and friendly, The beds were very comfortable but i do agree with some other reviewers which say they need thicker sheets/duvets as i did find i was a little chilly during the night. Overall it was a great stay and I'd definitely like to go back and recommend this Hotel to anyone staying in London.",4,2014,03,06
133,Great location,We stayed here for 3 nights in Feb. 2014. Staff is professional and courteous. It is a hotel next door to Kensington Garden and Palace. Breakfasts were served on the 10th floor due to remodeling of kitchen and the view was stunning. Location is close to Tube and all sorts of restaurants and attractions. We stayed here with our Disney Vacation Points.,5,2014,03,04
133,Pampered,"We have stayed in many hotels in London and this is our first time at the Royal Garden and not our last. On our arrival we were greeted by very friendly staff who were extremely efficient, nothing was too much trouble. Our room was comfortable and clean with everything that we should require.With a view over Kensington Palace gardens and a very comfortable bed, what more could you want from an hotel room. We thought there might be noise of a night which is usual in a lot of hotels but to our delight it was very quiet so a good nights sleep was had.
 Bertie's bar was superb like going back in time and with attentive waiters. 
Breakfast was of a high standard as you would expect of a 5* hotel again with very attentive waitresses. 
We look forward to our next stay in March.",5,2014,03,02
133,"Great location, helpful staff","Stayed at this hotel for a week for an art fair and it was perfect. Staff are extremely professional and helpful, location is perfect. What more can you ask for. If you wanted to save some money, you could eat breakfast out as there is plenty to choose from, but it was nice to have the option of lazy hotel breakfast or getting out and about.",4,2014,03,01
133,Great stay,"Great, friendly hotel. We stayed here for 3 nights in September. The view from our room wasn't great however it was a very clean and modern room. Huge bathroom! Great location for Hyde Park and easy to find from Kensington High Street tube. Overall a great stay.",4,2014,02,28
133,Five Star treatment at a Bargain Price,"While looking for a hotel in London I came across a 24 hour Flash Sale for this hotel. It offered accommodation including full English breakfast and Wi-fi for ¬£100 per night - cheaper than the equivalent in a central London Travelodge! Thinking it must be some kind of scam I did a bit of research before realising that this was indeed the deal. I booked and stayed four nights and was not disappointed. The room was very well appointed with lots of little extras (bathrobe and slippers, free newspaper etc). My room looked out on to the High Street which was quite interesting although the view over Kensington Gardens would have been better. I could enjoy this view at breakfast though which is taken on the 10th floor with the most stunning view of the Gardens and the London skyline. Breakfast was ample and varied and service was very good. All in all, this was an excellent stay and I would definitely go back (next time there's a sale on!)",5,2014,02,28
133,Not Bad,"Overall, Royal Garden Hotel is a pretty good hotel....for the price. The bathrooms are great and the rooms are spacious. However, the service wasn't what you'd expect from a 5-star hotel; the staff wasn't particularly helpful and were generally distracted; street noise is also noticeable.",3,2014,02,26
133,Can't fault it!,"I returned to this hotel in February, and had a wonderful stay.  Everything from walking in to the minute I left was perfect.  The staff are friendly and attentive without being intrusive; the room was large, modern, stylish and had a great view over Kensington Gardens and the London skyline; the evening meal was up to its usual standard and importantly, the breakfast was excellent and set me up for the day!  The location is perfect if you are visiting London for sightseeing.  ",5,2014,02,22
133,Love the comfort,"Luxurios and spacious with fantastic comfort in Kensington street.
Quiet and exclusive interior. Perfect service- Great breakfast -perfect window view to the green garden in spring time. Comfortable beds. Would have liked a longer stay.",5,2014,02,19
133,Right in the heart of London...,"... If there is such a thing.  But being bang on Kensington High Street must be up there with the best.  The hotel is what you'd expect from a 5 star hotel in Central London, with all the pros (great location and facilities) and cons (full restaurant, ""impressive"" bar prices, sirens through the night, small room size).  We stayed in the worst weather I've experience in London; the windows were whistling with the wind but don't think this is normal.  All the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, which isn't always my experience... ",4,2014,02,18
133,Well thought out...,"Stayed here to attend a formal dinner and pleasantly surprised by how well the room was appointed.  Socket for hair drier just around the corner from full length mirrored wardrobe door.  Well lit magnifying make-up mirror above hand basin in bathroom (height adjustable would have made it perfect).  All controls in bath on opposite end to shower head, which was angled, so possible to shower without wetting hair.  Small points but made a difference.  Wonderful view over Kensington Palace.  Only criticism was general temperature which was too warm, especially in dining room at breakfast.",4,2014,02,18
133,Old Faithfull,Our family has been staying at the Royal Garden Hotel for many years. We use it as a base when going into London from the country for shows or shopping trips. We find it the best hotel in Central London. They always go out of their way to be helpful and make sure that all our needs are attended to. The staff are always friendly and exceptionally helpful. The location is great as you literally have to walk out the door to find easy access to a myriad of things to do. I highly recommend this hotel.,5,2014,02,18
133,good stay,"Great location , was there on business in the 1st week of February . The rooms are spacious with a great view of the Park and the Palace . Mostly had my meetings at the restaurant  in the lobby  the staff is polite and helpful , we managed to get hold of a business suit for a meeting at a very short notice . Overall experience was good / however i feel that the breakfast spread needs to be rebooked at as it seems self limiting .",4,2014,02,18
133,Excellent Location and Staff,"Stayed on business for a night last week (Wed 12th Feb) to avoid tube strike hassle.  Upgraded to an executive room overlooking the park.  The room was spacious, quiet and comfortable with a great view over the West End.  Working desk area very good; the only slight hiccup was intermittent internet and the razor socket did not work.  The staff were the high point.  Everyone from reception and concierge to housekeeping could not have been more helpful.  A super hotel of business or pleasure.",5,2014,02,16
133,Loved my comfy clean room,"I'm really fussy about cleanliness especially bathrooms so I was delighted to check in and find a lovely size clean room and bathroom (king room). Stayed at Royal Garden for 5 nights and enjoyed my stay thoroughly. High street shops, restaurants and tube station at your door step. Very close to Oxford as well. I rely on hotel reviews when booking so I thought it's my duty to leave a review for other fellow first time bookers as well! Would def stay here again!",5,2014,02,15
133,Very enjoyable stay,"My wife and I had tickets for Cirque de Soleil at the Albert Hall for Thursday, 13th February 2014 so booked into this hotel for the night as it is a 15 minute walk away from the Albert Hall.

Hotel was first class with  helpful and efficient staff. The receptionist,who checked us in, was called Sasha (from Russia) and he was a delightful young man. He went out of his way to make our stay enjoyable. We asked him, if possible,could we have a room, on an high floor.overlooking the back not the front. He found us one on the 9th floor with a view over Kensington Palace and the Gardens. It was a fantastic outlook and made our stay having that view to look at when we woke up on Valentine's day!",5,2014,02,14
133,The perfect room,"My husband and I stayed at the Royal Garden over the weekend of his 60th birthday.  I upgraded the room to a garden view king which was so worthwhile.  The view over Kensington Gardens, Palace and the London Skyline was wonderful.  The welcome from the staff was so friendly, they seemed genuinely interested to hear what we had planned for our stay in London, and nothing was too much trouble. The room was absolutely perfect in every way, decorated and furnished in under-stated luxury with lots of extra touches.  It was light and airy and it was a real bonus to be able to open the window for fresh air.  The bathroom was spacious, well lit, and equipped with everything you could want.  Having mentioned my husband's birthday, a dish of hand made truffles were delivered to the room shortly after we arrived, which was completely unexpected.  The room was spotlessly clean and the bed comfortable.  Wi-Fi was complimentary as we had booked direct with the hotel which was another bonus.  All in all, it was a wonderful weekend, the hotel is so well situated and it will  be our first choice when visiting London in future.",5,2014,02,14
133,A near perfect stay,"I stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel in December it was a lovely hotel check in was a wait but I did arrive at check in time. The queen hotel rooms are small but that is all I really need  on a business trip as it was just somewhere to sleep and was adequate for me. The room was comfortable though as there designed for a single person there is only one large towel which for a woman does'nt quite work 2 would be preferable. I stayed on the second floor which had no view which was disappointing, even if it was the High Street it would have been better than the frosted window that I received. Most of the staff were extremely friendly, the door staff were hit and miss on 2 occasions I had to go onto the High street to hail a cab as there was no one there to get one for me not really what I expected from a 5* hotel. All in all a good stay, I am back again this month so hopefully my next review will be a 5.",4,2014,02,11
133,Terrible Sleep,"Its a real pity to have to give such a stunning place such a poor review, but when the main purpose of staying over was just for somewhere to sleep, this place did not measure up.
We were on the 9th floor, underneath their Chinese restaurant.  It was bad enough that the scraping and banging of tables directly above us continued late into the night, but to be woken by the same noise in the very early hours was not acceptable, and certainly not what we would expect from a 5 star hotel.

From all other aspects the hotel was great, very  friendly staff and good service, but I might as well have stayed at a Travelodge.",2,2014,02,11
133,Good for Conference Location,"3 day business conference attended.  The hotel has a separate lower ground arena that means leisure guests are not co-mingling with conference delegates.

Hotel catering was first class and all other amenities eg bar and 10th floor oriental restaurant were faultless",5,2014,02,10
133,NOT A FIVE STAR EXPERIENCE!,"Ive stayed here twice before and liked it but the hotel has now gone terribly downhill and provides a NO STAR experience under the guise of a five star label.
I booked a King room with Garden view, one of the more expensive rooms. However, it seems because I booked it during one of the their 'flash sales' they gave me one of the WORST ROOMS in the hotel, on the second floor over a noisy nightclub. Management  FAIL TO MENTION ANYWHERE ON THEIR SITE that there is a noisy nightclub on the ground floor at the side of the hotel. If you stay on that side below the fifth floor you will NOT SLEEP until 3am on the weekends. Your room will also be flooded with vile cigarette smoke from the revellers down below who stand in the street screaming, smashing glasses and puffing like chimneys.
When I informed the FRONT OFFICE desk of this problem, the first staff told me I was the only person since the birth of Jesus Christ to complain!!! And they call that five star guest service!!!
So, by implication I am either a liar or a very difficult customer. Yes, Royal Garden hotel I am difficult because I actually do expect to sleep in a GBP 250 per night hotel room and NOT be gassed by cigarette smoke. The next FRONT OFFICE staff I confronted over this issue, inittially tried to DENY that there was even a nightclub there! They did both apologise but as well all know apologies dont count for anything when what they did was intentional. Offering a different room after youre settled into a room for a couple of days is NOT an attraactive option I feel. Id rather NO ONE had to have the experience I suffered.
Speaking of the staff, the restaurant staff are wonderful while the front office staff have all
the charm of medieval gargoyles. The cleaning staff are TOTALLY INCOMPETENT. Every day the person who cleaned my room forgot something important (fresh towels! breakfast order card! etc). I should point out that the main restaurant was closed, the lifts often do not work,
the health club is an abomination, insufficient room heating, stained towels and dirty toilet seat.
So, what is good about this hotel you may ask - only the location, that's it.
If you want a truly FIVE STAR experience, try the BAGLIONI HOTEL a little further along the road. I know Im going to on my next trip.",1,2014,02,10
133,Outstanding Service at the Royal Garden Hotel,We spent 2 nights at the Royal Garden hotel where we celebrated my husbands 60th birthday.  Our family also joined us for breakfast on one of the mornings.  The service we received was exceptional.  This is undoubtably the best hotel we have stayed at in London.  We look forward to a return visit and would highly recommend it.,5,2014,02,07
133,Upgraded beyond belief,"I booked the Royal Garden hotel due to it's proximity to the Royal Albert Hall where we were to see Quidam for our wedding anniversary. We have stayed here twice before once in a garden room and once in an executive room - go for the garden room every time, the view is worth it. This time I'd booked a garden room with the celebration package - crazy not to when you add up the extras. On arrival we were advised that we'd been upgraded to a Master Suite. We thought ooh that's nice. On entering the suite we were blown away by the size of the room - we felt like we should have brought more people there was that much space. I don't know who usually books these rooms but they would be more than impressed. The staff were of the usual polite, courteous and efficient standard that we have come to appreciate each time we have stayed. Breakfast on the 10th floor was a treat - perhaps it should stay there when the kitchen refurbishments have been completed!",5,2014,02,03
133,Fantastic stay and amazing hotel,"Stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel fro 1 night on Saturday 1st Feb for my wife's birthday. The location is perfect, 5 minute walk to the Royal Albert Hall and a 5 minute walk from Kensington tube station. 

We booked a garden view room and had an amazing view of the park from the 5th floor. The rooms are large and very quiet, the bathrooms spotless and had a great nights sleep on a really comfy bed. 

The service was faultless, check in was quick, room service and concierge was were prompt and could not be faulted. 

Thank you for a great stay and wouldn't hesitate to book again if in London.",5,2014,02,03
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"I enjoyed staying in Royal Garden Hotel. It is in very quiet place  near Hyde Park and you can walk there. The rooms are good, it's  very clean, food is good, price is reasonble/
You also can book traditional; afternnoon english tea in the terrace.",5,2014,02,02
133,Great location,Great location. Good value as booked on travel zoo.  Restaurant was being refurbished so the very good breakfast was eaten with a great view over the park and Lake.   Bus stop right outside.  They gave us late check out for free also.  Recommended.   Definitely will visit again.,5,2014,02,01
133,Fantastic as ever,We stay here at least once a year after Christmas and every year the service and quality is brilliant. Concierge service is beyond doubt the best I have ever experienced. Room service was quick and well presented (we had some poor food quality food at breakfast however the kitchens are being renovated and we were told about this from the very first time we booked - and several reminder e mails throughout the time in between then and our arrival),5,2014,01,29
133,Great Location - Nice City Break,"Just had a great few days staying at this hotel.  Had a nice, clean and comfortable room on the 10th Floor overlooking Kensington and south London.  Views from the 10th Floor restaurant were even better ‚Äì looking out over Kensington Gardens towards central London.  This restaurant was serving as the hotel‚Äôs restaurant whilst the main kitchen was being renovated - you wouldn‚Äôt have known.

Front desk staff very friendly and restaurant staff very attentive.

Hotel really well located ‚Äì right outside you can get the Number 9 bus straight into the West End and a Number 49 to Loftus Road to watch QPR.  Tube a couple of minutes walk.  Also have shops and restaurant on your doors if you don‚Äôt want to travel.

Will certainly stay there again.",5,2014,01,25
133,good location and big rooms,easy access to convenient stores and shopping arcades are the key factors for me to choose this hotel...not forgetting its proximity to the Tube Station ( just 5 minutes walk to Kensington High Street Station ).What is more surprising for me is the larger than I had anticipated rooms ( I booked the King Room for the 3 of us ) the bathroom is spacious as well.Cleanliness of the room is also top notch...would consider staying in here again the next visit to London.,4,2014,01,25
133,Perfect location,We have stayed here several times and  yet again it was perfect. The location is great as there are a variety of shops nearby. Kensington Palace is within a five minute walk as is the underground station. Highly recommend the Chinese restaurant within the hotel. Service was of the highest quality within the hotel.,5,2014,01,24
133,A simply delightful London hotel...,"Stayed here for a week in a Garden Room and it was superb.  The room is very functional, with a decent work area and a stunning view across the gardens.  The hotel is in a great area, close to tube, short walk to numerous restaurants and shops.  Do hire a bike in the gardens at one of the automated stands near the hotel.  Although there are limits on the paths that bikes can be used on, you can still get a great sense of Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park fairly quickly.  Hotel service is impeccable. 

Gym is serviceable.  Oddly located, it requires you to walk out the front door of the hotel and down the driveway to access the lift.  On my first morning as I strode out the door I was a little alarmed to find myself in a small group of 6ft 5, chiselled figures in training gear who appeared to be doing the same thing, leaving me concerned about looking (only slightly of course) out of place.  To my relief it was part of the Wallabies squad heading for the minibus to training.  They were based there for their UK tour.

Wifi is expensive, which is really annoying these days.",5,2014,01,20
133,Regal accommodations in posh part of town!,"We did our sales kickoff here and it was fantastic. The hotel is in a great location across from Kensington Gardens, with lots of restaurants and things to see within walking distance. The hotel amenities are top notch, as is the service. My only beef is internet access is expensive and spotty, but that seems to be the norm in all British hotels I've visited lately. I enjoyed my stay here, and you probably will too. ",4,2014,01,19
133,Ideal for a London stay,"Our second stay at the hotel. Friendly attentive staff. Excellent room overlooking Kensington Palace. Quiet, well-appointed room,  but hard beds. Good for driving into London as able to pre-booked NCP carpark adjacent to hotel. (¬£66 for 3 days).
Main restaurant not functioning but continental breakfast via room service OK. Excellent celebratory meal at Min Jiang restaurant and good snacks at Bertie's bar.  Convenient bus service  into central London & tube station a short walk away.",5,2014,01,18
133,Kensingnton Park,"I arranged a family reunion at this hotel with the idea of taking my family to the theater, opera, and sightseeing. This hotel is centrally located and is the ideal location for touring London. The hotel concierge arranged all of the theater tickets and was extremely helpful in planning our sightseeing tours. My family had a great time. This was a great success.

One disappointment was that the hotel dining facilities were not available, as they are going through an extensive renovation. I would suggest, in light of this renovation, that the hotel consider opening the adjacent ""afternoon tea"" lounge for morning breakfast. I am sure that the patrons of the hotel would appreciate this.

Overall, the layout of the hotels rooms is well thought out. The rooms are small, but this is more then made up for by the fact that the room designers carefully laid out the rooms. This is particularly evident in the layout of the bathrooms.

Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London.",3,2014,01,17
133,Wonderful describes my stay,"Excellent location to stay for London Brighton Run. Rooms, Dining, Service - every aspect was top notch. Will stay again every time we go. Wait staff very courteous. Not over priced for the quality of everything.",5,2014,01,17
133,Genuine 5 star hotel,"My son and I booked a room for 3 as part of a surprise birthday event for my wife. She was absolutely delighted. Just a mention of the fact it was her birthday at check-in produced a tray of fresh chocolates, waiting in our room after we returned from the ballet, late afternoon. Fantastic location, very friendly staff and a wonderful room with breakfast included, all for what I would consider to be a bargain price. And what a breakfast! There was a sumptuous buffet but we were also able to order a la carte. I opted for smoked haddock topped with a couple of poached eggs which was freshly prepared and served at our table, truly delicious. The hotel exuded quality, from the high-end toiletries to the extra wide king size bed, super quiet, very efficient aircon and ultra fluffy dressing gowns. I could not recommend this hotel highly enough if you need a west-end treat.",5,2014,01,15
133,first stay,"i stayed for a few nights in january ,its a modern ,clean hotel with some extremely nice staff 
especially in reception,luggage staff  and some extremely unfriendly staff in breakfast room
rooms are small but very clean ,location .....its about 10 minutes by taxi to Knightsbridge 
Harrods etc",3,2014,01,15
133,"Lovely Hotel, Great Service, Great Location, Poor Spa Staff","We booked this hotel via a discount website so got a pretty good deal I think (we were happy with the price).  It also included a small discount off any spa treatment.  As it was my Mother's Birthday we booked her a spa treatment for the second day of their stay.

Upon arrival at the hotel, we were very impressed with the location, design and friendliness of staff.

The room was tidy and well designed, we had asked for a room as high as possible and this request was fulfilled.

Breakfast was a bit of squeeze, but think this was due to the kitchen being upgraded - but no noise was heard throughout our stay.

When my Mother went for her spa treatment, she was told to sit and the therapist would be with her shortly, after a 20 minute wait, she asked another member of staff who replied ""Oh I thought you were waiting for the doctor"", she then informed my Mother that the therapist was running late so couldn't tell how long the wait would be then offered her a glass of water.  No-one had mentioned the delay before to my Mother and as my Father was coming back to meet her at the scheduled time she was due to finish her treatment she decided that it would be too late as they had other plans for the rest of the day and cancelled the treatment.  Was it too much for the Spa Receptionist to notify my Mother of the delay when she first arrived - surely its common courtesy?

The only other point's that we raised with the hotel were our kettle leaked quite badly and by the looks of the kettle had been doing so for quite a while.  Also the last night of our stay we missed our room being ""turned down"", so as we went out for the evening we asked at Reception.  When we arrived back later that night, the room had been turned down but the member of staff had also removed all flannels from the bathroom....... this made washing that evening and the following morning quite a task.  We can only assume they did this to try and stop us using the bath/shower to prevent them from cleaning it again.  This was quick a shock and ended a lovely stay on a bit of bad point.

Overall a lovely hotel and we would go back again but NOT to the spa!",4,2014,01,15
133,Another Visit to this Hotel,"We stayed here a few days before Christmas as a treat to ourselves.  The first room offered was very nice but we preferred the ones overlooking Kensington High Street - love the life of London going by, even the sirens.  When we had stayed before we didn't particularly like going to the breakfast area because it was so busy and so opted for room service instead.  The food is just ok I'm afraid.  Nothing spectacular.  The room itself was nice but there was a slight stale odour. 

Room service had a few hiccups too - cold ""hot"" chocolate, nasty tasting food and little choice when you only want a snack, may be think about goats cheese and onion tarts or small pies/pasties, just a thought.

One negative was one of the concierge personnel was quite off - my husband was getting some complimentary mince pies from the desk and the concierge was just staring at him as if my husband was doing something criminally wrong!  Last time didn't think they were as friendly as they could be either.  

The staff definitely need training regarding fire safety.",4,2014,01,15
133,"Great location, ok service and room","I stayed for a few nights after Christmas, and loved the location.  However, checking-in took a bit of time (the staff seemed distracted by a large family), and my luggage (I had more than normal as I was bringing what felt like a ton of presents for friends and relatives) took two hours to be delivered to the room.  The standard room was small, but average for a major European city.",4,2014,01,14
133,Average hotel with a great location.,"My wife and I shared a romantic one night get away at the Royal Garden last weekend. We were very lucky getting a room on the 9th floor - thus enjoying some spectacular views over Kensington Palace and west London. The staff were courteous and friendly, the room was clean, the breakfast was good etc etc - but nothing about this hotel was particularly special (apart from the views obviously). It cost me a small fortune to stay here for the night and I feel slightly cheated. The outside of the hotel looks like an office block. The room was drab with 2 single beds pushed together. No iron / ironing board in the room. Not many TV channels. Not many pillows (had to phone and ask for more). All in all, I feel like I paid all that hard earned money just for the view and an average room.",3,2014,01,13
133,"Good Hotel, great location, BUT...","So the hotel is in a great spot, right on Kensington High St at the corner of Palace Gardens & Hyde Park.

Interior is smart, and staff are extremely helpful and courteous.

Rooms tidy, modern, well equipped (even have proper fridge as mini bar, not one of those annoying auto charge contraptions).

BUT - and this is a pretty major issue for somewhere you plan to ""lay your head"" - the beds are hard and I mean ROCK HARD. Add to that the use of 4.5tog duvets - in January! and you may be in for a less than fully rested night.

By comparison, for example, Sheraton ""sleeper"" beds are fantastic. Note to hotel management - you may wish to consider this....",3,2014,01,13
133,Loving London,"Just next door to Kensington Palace is the Royal Garden Hotel.  I've stayed there several times on business trips to London and it's truly a lovely hotel with a good price to value ratio.  While the rooms are a bit on the tiny side, they have a very comfortable lobby, a nice bar, and a small business center with a very attentive staff.  Try to book a room that overlooks the Palace, or Kensington High Street.  It's wonderful just to sit by the window and watch London go by.

However, I'd advise going elsewhere for the breakfast, which is on the pricey side for food that's far from spectacular.",4,2014,01,07
133,Excellent View and Great Accomodations/Staff,"This review is late, but better late than never.

The Staff was very courteous and friendly.  The room was very clean and cozy with a very comfortable mattress and roomy bathroom.  Our room had a superb view of Kensington Gardens.  The RGH is centrally located with easy access to any transportation service to/from any venue you desire.

We will return.",5,2014,01,07
133,The Best Place To Stay In Kensington,"This is our third stay at the Royal Garden Hotel and just like the previous stays we had a great time and were very satisfied with our hotel experience, I like the Royal Garden as it has an understated level of luxury and comfort and not only is the service first class but it is subtle and traditional. From the moment we checked it to the time we checked out we had nothing but courteous and friendly service including the fastest delivery of fresh milk to our room that I have ever known, the breakfast service was efficient and smooth and the buffet had plenty of choice of hot and cold items. My only moan was that the coffee was only barely warm but when I asked for fresh coffee an new piping hot cup of strong coffee promptly arrived.
Our Deluxe room was spacious and the King Size bed was comfortable and inviting, the bathroom was very impressive with modern fittings and luxury toiletries - again if I was being picky I though the room air con was old and a bit ineffective and took a long time to get to a comfy temperature. I would have no hesitation in recommending the Royal Garden Hotel and if you can get a good room deal of ¬£149 per night including 2 breakfasts then it has to rate as the best place to stay in Kensington.",4,2014,01,06
133,A real 5 star experience,"First of all...ignore anything less than a 4star review on this hotel.

Had a one night stay on Sunday 5th Jan 2014.

Location - excellent, barely a few minutes walk from the tube station and easily accessible by road

Staff - More often than not, 5star staff have zero personality. Not here! A warm and charming welcome, smiles all round, offered assistance without being ""in your face""

Room - Executive double on the 7th floor...amazing! Yes, a little small by typical 5star standards, but considerably cheaper than a typical 5star hotel! Heated bathroom floor, sound system throughout, comfortable work station and lounge area...plus a bed 3 pillows wide!

Drinks - expensive compared to Wetherspoons, cheap compared to The Ritz!

Food (room service) - I had to leave early but my lady said one of the best breakfasts she's had. Not huge, but very clean and piping hot.

In short, this is a fantastic hotel and is worthy of a 5star rating.",5,2014,01,06
133,An Awful Breakfast,"Hotel breakfasts maketh ye hotel. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE FULL ENGLISH AT ¬£25.  Just spent one night with my wife at the Royal Garden via a special offer including a full English breakfast.  Hotel location, the bedroom and staff were beyond reproach but the breakfast ??   Have never used Tripadvisor before but just had to comment.  The breakfast coffee was tepid so we asked for a hot coffee.  The second coffee was just as cold.  Finally, the third coffee was hot. Then we realised that the full English was a buffet style and therefore others who had paid for the cheaper continental could help themselves to it also.  We had to order the eggs quite separately so they arrived later.   Every item on the full English was stone cold.  Ordered brown toast and got white.  Complained and got apologies that the burners had all extinguished but no explanation for the multiple coffee failures.   The buffet continental looked unappetising so avoided that.  Overheard others complaining too.  Wrote to the hotel and got quick reply from Tim Fryer their Food Director with profuse apologies and offering a derisory free champagne next time we stay.  He seems not to know that some people do not drink alcohol.  The breakfast ruined it for us so that hotel is definitely one to avoid if you like your breakfast hot and by the look of the continental breakfast, avoid that too.   Have asked that the Food Director informs the General Manager about his failings.  But I doubt somehow that will happen.",2,2014,01,03
133,Good stay in a great location,"Booked two rooms a King and a Queen for my wife and I and a teenage son in December for 3 nights.

Found the place to be great, to be honest not excellent but very good, it ""could"" be excellent with a little bit of work.

The King Room and Queen room both were very clean really well appointed and both had great views over the park. Really the rooms were very good. I did hear some noise as my room was near the lift.

The location is fantastic - restaurants transport and of course the parks all close by. Runners take note the park is close and other runs esp on a Saturday or sunday morning include Buckingham palace, big ben and the river.

The reception staff were excellent and check in very smooth. Only real issue with the staff was perhaps a slight lack of a little bit of polish or finesse from the concierge- ie you could hear them grumbling from time to time, on one occasion in the lift a member of staff talking about it being ""chaos""...It didn't seem that way to me nor the other guests in the lift. This really is a small issue - anything you asked for you would receive quickly

We passed on breakfast at the hotel - appeared very expensive and there are great breakfast places a short walk away.

We secured a very good price via the companies affiliated with trip advisor, the value was excellent.

I would definitely recommend the hotel",4,2014,01,02
133,Just Ok...,This hotel is average by most standards. I must say it is the first 5 Star hotel that charges for Wi-Fi; and at 20 Pounds ($33 US) per day for internet it isn't cheap. I am told we have to pay since the trip was booked through American Airlines...,3,2013,12,31
133,Good hotel in good location,"The staff at RGH bend over backwards to help in any way they can.  In particular, Csaba was a very friendly, attentive and helpful waiter who made our stay very pleasant. 

The rooms are big, so are the bathrooms.  The location in London is fantastic, buses to Knightsbridge and the city run from the front door, the tube is a five minute walk away, and there are city cycles to hire from close by too.  

Management please note: none of your staff could get our heating to work.  They did offer electric heaters but night after night the normal aircon would go ice cold.  Our room windows would also not seal properly and resulted in whistling all night long.  (Room 917). Perhaps the aircon would not work due to thinking the windows were open?   One for you to look at since it did take the shine off our stay a little!",4,2013,12,31
133,Lovely,"A brief stay but one that was a simply perfect, The car park is ace - the rooms to the standard you would expect and the food (we ate dinner twice) was superb.

The location is the reason we chose the hotel and exceeded our expectations.",5,2013,12,31
133,Very Good Stay,We stayed with our young son for 2 nights and were very pleased with the hotel. We were upgraded on arrival and the staff were very friendly. The room service menu was amazing and the service staff friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend.,4,2013,12,30
133,Beds need upgrading ,My husband and I have just returned from staying at the Royal Garden hotel. He had booked it as part of a surprise trip to London. If I'm honest I don't think it fits the criteria for a 5 star hotel. The staff at check in and concierge desk were excellent and very friendly. Our room was on the 2nd floor overlooking Kensington high street. The bathroom was large and very clean. Robes were provided but were old and worn from washing and needed to be replaced. I requested an iron as there wasn't one in the room and the first one that arrived was held together with an elastic band and didn't work. We visited Min Jiang for a drink one evening but the waiter was engrossed with another table and ignored us so we didn't have a second drink. Noise was not an issue for our room but the bed was. We booked a King room but the bed was two twin beds pushed together. This resulted in a divide in the middle of the bed and made for an uncomfortable sleep...I woke many times during the night. We did talk to a staff member when checking out and he apologised. I have never encountered this issue in any other hotel and wouldn't stay here again because of this. ,3,2013,12,28
133,HAPPY NEW YEAR TO THIS VERY SPECIAL HOTEL,"We stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel again in December 2013 and are delighted to be able to confirm our pleasure in enjoying the gentle care attention we have always received from this very special privately owned hotel.

We wish a Happy New Year to the owners and all of the management  and staff, many of whom have been there for almost 20 years!!!!!!!!!

We look forward to our next visit.

 

.",5,2013,12,27
133,"Great place, same about the service and the food","Our visit for lunch at the royal garden hotel was memorable for all the wrong reasons. Not sure if I would go again.

The pigeon was over cooked, the tuna was over cooked and the dessert was a shocker! Short of having to take a hammer to crack the chocolate br√ªl√©e, the Caramel moose was had way too much gelatine and as for the baked carrot cheese cake. I have never tasted anything like it, the cheesecake it self was nice but it had small cubes of carrots running through and ginger sauce/ syrup with even more cubes of carrots it wasn't a pleasant texture oh and to add you have to pour you own wine as waiters ignore you if you try and complain quietly....no martre de in sight. Not a happy customers at all.",3,2013,12,27
133,Pleasant Stay,"Just got back from a 3 day stay in London at the Royal Garden Hotel.  The location was perfect!  Close to the Underground, restaurants, shops, museums, and right next to Kensington Park.  The rooms, while on the small side, were very nice.  The bed and pillows seemed new and were very comfortable.  The bathroom is updated and has all the conveniences needed.  The staff is the highlight of the hotel; they will go above and beyond to help you out.  The Concierge desk helped me get around town and even made some phone calls for me verifying some tours.  The hotel offers some very good restaurants and pretty good room service too.  Very good shopping and food options right outside the hotel, which makes it very convenient.  It is walking distance to good shopping and museums and a short cab ride from attractions like Parliament, Big Ben, London Eye, etc.  I would definitely come back!",5,2013,12,24
133,Family stay.,"Just returned from our second stay this year at this hotel, both times with my children and partner, the staff are very attentive, the concierge guys are really on the ball. I would recommend this place as family friendly hotel with real class. Join the mailing list and watch out for the flash sales.",5,2013,12,23
133,Amazing,"We got this hotel on an extremely good deal with a show in the west end on the evening.

On arrival we we're greeted by fabulous staff. We were instantly upgraded to a garden room which was perfect. The room was very clean and tidy and the bathroom was beautiful.

We had breakfast the following morning which was to die for. I would definitely reccomend this hotel to anyone however i would not have paid the full prices they charge through the actual hotel its self. I think we were just very lucky to get it on such a good deal.",5,2013,12,23
133,Really Good.,"We have always wanted to stay here and got a really good deal, we absolutely loved it, the staff were all great helpful and nice, The double garden view rooms were lovely huge bathroom, lovely comfy bed and pillows, then up a step to a nice seating area with sofa, coffee table, tea/coffee making facilities, and William and Kate as neighbours what more could you ask for, you can walk easy to Marble Arch and Oxford Street, high street Kensington is nice, and while you are there visit Bill Wymans Sticky Fingers restaurant. We will be going back to this hotel.",5,2013,12,22
133,Five Star Prices for four star quality,"Visited the Royal Garden for a one night stay in a standard twin room.  Room was in the third floor over looking Kensington High Street.  Room was clean, tidy and had coffee/tea making facilities and standard mini bar offerings.  Bedding was disappointing, looking tired and old with a thin lumpy quilt. Pillows where very soft to the point that they would have made little difference had they not been there.  Bathroom was lovely with a choice of a nice powerful standalone shower or bath.  Room location in the building was poor. If you do stay here see if you can avoid overlooking Kensington High Street as it was noisy, with people being heard shouting in the street, along with emergency services passing regularly with sirens blaring.  We did not eat at the hotel as breakfast was not included in our booking, but did go to Bertie's Bar. Standard prices expected for a London hotel, however bar looked tired, with the rug on the floor dirty and stained - over all needs a refurbishment.  Also was disappointed when a friend ordered a coke to be told, sorry it will be warm! Really surprised a five star hotel did not have sufficient bottles chilled for customers somewhere!  Over all for a five star experience I was disappointed and I will not be returning.",3,2013,12,22
133,Pleasantly surprised,"Had a very short stay of one night on a busy business trip.
The rooms are very small but very well made and plush.
Staff is ok and not much friendly but location is excellent and lobby very nice.
Its a good well maintained hotel with most essentials in place",4,2013,12,21
133,A very happy Christmas,"Once again what a delightful stay. Another great room over looking the park. Checked in and was welcomed as a returning guest, escorted to the lifts, nothing too much trouble. Luis looked after us personally in Bertie's bar where the house champagne is an excellent choice

All in all a fantastic visit. Just wish I could stay more often",5,2013,12,21
133,Excellent despite shower problem,"We booked this Hotel for a weekend trip to London to include a show and a concert. We had not stayed this far west previously but using London's public transport we were able to get everywhere we wanted very easily. Our room was probably one of the largest we have ever had in London where space is at a premium! It was very well equipped and the bathroom was a super size with both a shower and a bath. 

The shower was the only problem we had during our stay. It worked fine the first morning but not the second. The issue was reported to reception who immediately picked up the 'phone to report it to the appropriate department. When we returned that evening it was apparent that someone had looked at the shower as the head had been moved but it still wasn't working and didn't work after that.  I mentioned the problem when checking out and we were given a discount on our third night's stay.

When we returned home we received an e-mail asking us to complete a questionnaire. This issue was mentioned and we were asked whether we wanted a response. We asked for this and have now received such.

We had a meal in the Park Terrace restaurant on the first evening and both the food and the service were excellent. OK so for the price this should be the case and whilst not everywhere achieves this the Park Terrace/Royal Garden does.

We had full English breakfast every morning. This is expensive but this is a 5 star hotel in central London. There was a huge selection for both continental and English breakfast. Once again the food and the service were excellent.

We also used Bertie's bar one evening and here again we received excellent friendly service.

If the price is right we would definitely stay here again!",4,2013,12,20
133,Central location with a relaxing atmosphere,"This is my second stay in one of the garden rooms. The view across Hyde Park is beautiful. The rooms are designed to make the best of the view with the use of large mirrors. Accommodation is spotless, spacious, contemporary and very comfortable. Service is friendly and efficient. It has the feel of a much smaller, more intimate hotel. It is a peaceful oasis away from the city hub. Breakfast is fresh (lots of fresh fruit and pastries) and the cooked breakfast is excellent. My only regret is that we were unable to book a second night. ",5,2013,12,20
133,Superb hotel and staff,"Stayed here for 2 night at end of nov. From the minute I arrived at the door to the minute I left I could not have been made more welcome by the fantastic staff this hotel employs. The hotel lobby does look a bit corporate as others have mentioned but the treatment by staff soon gives this hotel a personnel touch. 
The room was fantastic and with a tv like an IMAX cinema screen it was a lovely base.room was immaculately clean and a bath the size of a small swimming pool certainly helped.  Had drinks in the park terrace and Bertie's bar. Bertie's bar is a great place to sit and relax after a days shopping in London, as I was a lone traveller, the staff in Bertie's ensured i was at ease as they chatted to myself every time they passed me which I thought was a great touch. The concierge were very helpful and friendly . I have stayed in many nice hotels around the world but this is certainly up there. My friends visited me one evening and they were staying in Hilton park lane which is double price as this hotel per night and they reckoned royal garden was a far nicer and friendlier hotel than the hilton. Two mins from tube station and right on door step of Hyde park. Defo be back soon.",5,2013,12,20
133,Excellent Hotel on the Corner of Hyde Park beside Kensington Palace,"Excellent location for this lovely Hotel, nice restaurant, excellent bed room & bathroom, great staff and its a 5 min walk to the tube. 20 min walk to Harrods and next door to Hyde park. Great location for shops , restaurants & bars. there is a good gym downstairs too.",5,2013,12,18
133,Very disappointing!,"I stayed at this hotel in November 2013 with my husband.  I found the reception staff to be cold and unfriendly.  The room was also cold, the thermostat was did not seem to work properly.  The room smelled as if people had been smoking in there.  We paid extra for a view across Kensington Palace which was very impressive, although we could not see Kensington Palace.  We found the bar staff in the evening to be helpful and friendly.  The worst part of the stay was the bed, I found out late at night that the duvet was more like a very thin summer duvet, there were not extra pillows or additional covers/duvets.  Because it was late at night and could not be bothered to call housekeeping I ended up sleeping in the bathrobe.  The room was still cold.  On check out the staff were still unfriendly but the concierge was very good, friendly and helpful.  For the price of staying in the hotel I think I would rather pay less and go to a Premier Inn.  Very disappointed!!!",2,2013,12,18
133,Good value with some caveats,"I booked the hotel for a business trip directly through the website, under their special 3-nights for the price of two deal.  The room and the service were very good, but I had a very unpleasant experience on check-in and I would caution other travelers about this.  The room rate was pre-agreed and stated in the booking, however, as I handed over my credit card on check-in, the clerk announced that she was going to add a ¬£50 per day charge for ""incidentals"", such as the restaurants and shops.  I know this is a trick used by cruise ships to get people to spend more money, if it's already on the card, you don't think about it any more.  I forbade this in no uncertain terms.  She claimed that she was asking my permission, but this was not posed as a question.  This practice is not disclosed on the hotel's website.  In addition, the check-in was understaffed and the very junior clerk who was acting solo did nothing to control guests who were queue jumping, the result being that I had to wait longer than I should have.  I complained, and I did notice that they had put on extra staff during the next few days.  

I would stay here again, but they need to rethink their practice of charging in advance for items guests have not bought. I found this underhanded.",4,2013,12,17
133,Superb in Every Way,"Location, atmosphere, views from the room and kindness of the personnel are the best features of this lovely hotel. We did not try much else since we stayed only one night but we suspect that should all be in keeping.",5,2013,12,17
133,great atmosphere,We were in London for a Xmas concert in the Royal Albert hall. The Royal Garden garden is within walking distance of the Hall. We were made to feel very special in the hotel. It was lovely to have tea and coffee facility in the room.,5,2013,12,16
133,Shoebox rooms and in need of an update,"The best part of the Royal Garden is its proximity to Hyde Park (on the west side of the park) and a decently trafficked high street.  I'd stayed at this hotel back in the 1990s and I was disappointed to find it hadn't done any positive updates since then.  The rooms are still very small.  The bar upstairs from the lobby is sterile and like a Holiday Inn, despite the fact that their liquor range should make it more warm and cozy rather than fluorescent-lit and antiseptic.  And the room decor could have used some updating.

I used to come here for the gym.  They seemed to have updated the facility but it didn't seem to use space efficiently.  I had better luck running in Hyde Park.

This hotel has the potential to be great but needs a shot in the arm.",3,2013,12,14
133,"Excellent service, location and restaurant a real authentic treat..","Spent a weekend at Royal Garden hotel for my wifes 40th, and we enjoyed great service and excellent restaurants. Out room was on the 9th floor and we have a great view over the city.

A real treat was the authentic Chinese restaurent on the top floor. Genuinely the best Chinese cuisine I have experienced outside CHina and I am a regular visitor to CHina. 

The location was also a great lauching pad for shopping and site seeing alike and we hope to return next year....",5,2013,12,12
133,A great establishment.,"I really wish we had had longer here. I would like to have sampled a cocktail in the bar and maybe tried out the restaurant. But regrets aside this place is fine.  Very friendly and helpful staff, a room with a lovely view over Kensington Gardens and beyond and a fabulous location on Kensington High street. Rooms are spacious, well equipped and immaculately clean. Will we go back; you bet!",5,2013,12,09
133,Out of This World!!,"Not only was the staff friendly and extremely accommodating we were checked in earlier than said time, which was fantastic. Our room was on the 9th floor, we walked in to see a huge window which had a fantastic view over the park and great view of the city skyline. Their are a number of decent restaurants across from the hotel, we decided to go into Bertie's Bar for a drink and was not disappointed. Extremely friendly bar tenders and the cocktails are to die for, their Pina Colada was the best I have ever had (and I have had a few). Had an amazing night sleep, pillows fluffy and couldn't hear a thing. The view in the morning was perfect, so I sat at the window people watching with a cup of tea. Late checkout which is a bonus, and there was a lovely girl on reception who checked us out, it really made our weekend how friendly everyone was.",5,2013,12,08
133,Amazing,"Had a really wonderful welcome here.  First time have stayed in this hotel.  It was a very pleasurable experience, great view.  Works do was amazing last night and really enjoyed ourselves.  Hotel staff catered to our every whim.  Will stay the night again like a shot.  Thank you for our stay. ",5,2013,12,08
133,Great Location; Great Hotel,"I stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel for five nights in mid November and was very pleased with my stay. I had a double room with a great view of Kensington Palace/Park. The room itself was small, but it was what I expected in London. I booked directly with the hotel, so I received free wifi, which was great. This is a very nice hotel in a great area with lots to do and see. Also, the tube station is a couple blocks down the road. I felt very safe - day and night, which I really appreciated. I would stay at this hotel again without hesitation.",5,2013,12,05
133,Somewhat disappointing,"I looked up this hotel via their website and thought we would have a luxurious weekend. Image can be deceiving. Unfortunately due to fixed travel plans we used a travel agency. Should not have :(. Apparently the lowest service package. No wi-fi, no view to the park (NO information anywhere on hotel website about small very basic rooms looking at busy street with horrible noise coming through window - take earplugs with you!), extra charge with breakfasts as well. One would expect to have a proper hot English breakfast in ""5""-star hotel but not in this case. Made us very embarrased and slightly uncomfortable as well even it was not our fault. We simply assumed things to be same as in other London 4-5 star hotels we have stayed.

Hotel itself was well located, easy access to central via tube or a walk throught that lovely park which we could not enjoy from our room (Ugly roof top of entrance instead...). We did not complain at the scene, maybe we should have and maybe we would have had been transferred to a better room (or at least quieter). 

Hotel staff was very nice, the service at breakfast was particularly excellent.",2,2013,12,04
133,"Very nice, refurbished, perfectly located hotel in London","I have stayed in the Royal Garden Hotel a few times in the last years. The hotel is perfectly located in High Street Kensington just by Hyde Park, very close to transport (tube or bus) and walking distance from Notting Hill, South Kensinton, Royal Albert Hall. High Street Kensington has many shops and ammenities as well.

Rooms are large (especially for London standards) and they have been refurbished recently with nice style. Bathrooms are large with separate bath-tub and high pressure shower. Standard rooms are nice with large beds, large desk and small sitting area. Garden looking rooms are gorgeous with views on Hyde Park and skyline of Londonand they have a greater sitting area. Suites have sofa beds.

Service is very helpful and smiley, rooms are done in the morning and in the evening. Prices for being a 5 star recently refurbished hotel in a nice neighbourhood in London are extremely competitive. So quality-price is excellent.",5,2013,12,03
133,always a royal experience,"we have used the royal garden for quite a few years,and it just gets better and better each time,the staff are all very friendly and very helpful.the location is very good,the garden view rooms are great,we were upgraded to a wonderfull suite overlooking the park,the breakfasts are top class,we will return!",5,2013,12,02
133,Excellent Location & Service,"Early Booking highly recommended to secure excellent value at the hotel with excellent location and very friendly service. Will come back for my next visit to London.  Ask for a room facing the parc to enjoy a lovely view when wake up in the morning, and be inspired by the runners.",4,2013,12,02
133,There is only one Royal Garden Hotel,"Well this is the big one the one I have been waiting for. It is difficult to know where to start and supreme excellence is both difficult to define and explain but as for my wife and I this is the benchmark that all hotels both in the UK and the Continent should apply or fall by the wayside, we have been visitors here since 1970 and usually stay 3 to 4 times a year though sadly due to business and illness this year we have not been since January but will try to make up for that as we are booked in over the New Year period so will update this then. Over the years we have seen a lot of Managers and indeed Owners come and go but must congratulate all concerned on always maintaining that 5 star status.",5,2013,12,01
133,Top Quality,"I normally try to avoid five star hotels as often the experience does not live-up to expectations. I found The Royal Garden to be exceptional in that the service was superb, the room was faultless and the food top class.
With regard to the room my initial impression was that it was not only well appointed but also spotlessly clean. I therefore made it my mission to find fault with it - I failed as everthing was spotlessly clean and pristine.",5,2013,11,27
133,Great Place To Stay!,"Great hotel location, view over the Royal Mews from our King room.  Breakfast excellent - great choice.  Refurbised rooms - very clean.  Staff very helpful.
10 minute walk to the Royal Albert Hall.  Complimentary WIFI with voucher.",5,2013,11,25
133,Awesome breakfast!,"Best things: BREAKFAST. 

There is a buffet serving for cold cuts, cereals, breads, yoghurt, fruit etc.
Guests have a choice between a traditional English or Asian hot breakfast

Rooms are small though. And size does vary slightly

The gym entrance is outside the hotel - rather strange. 
Gym has basic facilities. 

The Kensington Park is right next door for running enthusiasts! 

Located near a tube station, but not the main ones (will need to transfer to get to the Picadilly/blue line for the main tourist spots)

There's a wholefoods, boots pharmacy near by. Walking distance to good restaurants.",5,2013,11,24
133,Little disapointed,"The title may be a little misleading as The Royal Garden is a great hotel with friendly and helpful staff. The bed rooms are first class, bathrooms great in room entertainment first class. So why the disappointment, I miss the Terrace bar, which is now part of the Terrace restaurant and if you want a drink before Berties bar opens at 5.30 you have to sit at a table in the restaurant. The bar used to be very chilling with comfortable seating good for relaxing and inviting customers for meeting. I wont let this put me off staying there but will leave the hotel if we fancy a drink during the day",4,2013,11,20
133,"Great.....,but!!","Great hotel in great location with very friendly and efficient staff. I would recommend this place to anybody who is wanting a nice place, not by any way cheapest. The BUT!! is the cost of Wifi. Twenty pound per day is over the top in 2013!!! Especially when their tariff is on the high side. Can't believe that in this day and age that you pay huge money for a night or two accommodation and they want to charge for internet but you can walk across the road and buy a cheap coffee and get free wifi????  This constantly amazes me. It's nice to see that most hotels are starting to GET IT!! This one hasn't.  But I would stay again. ",4,2013,11,18
133,City Break,"Returned to our favourite London hotel. Over looking Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. Great location for exploring Knightsbridge and West London. We always have a Garden (Park) view room. Great service and friendly staff. Loads of local restaurants within walking distance or a short cab ride. NCP car park under hotel so no hassle parking/retrieving car. A very relaxing enjoyable break, booked again for December shopping.",5,2013,11,13
133,Garden Park Suite are excellent and very spacious,"We had a wonderful time here, our room was fabulous, the staff are wonderful and the food is excellent.
We found the location was perfect for us as the tube just a short distance away.
I do strongly suggest that you book a parking space if required at the hotel before arrival.",5,2013,11,13
133,Awards Event,"Came here for a Local Government Conference and Awards event, first class amenities & beautiful room. Good central location and food to die for, beautifully presented. Right next to Kensington Gardens.",5,2013,11,12
133,"Helpful polite staff, beautiful location fantastic stay!!!","Myself and my Husband have just returned from a two night stay in the immaculate Royal Garden Hotel. Couldn't fault the cleanliness or facilities. Very impressed with the staff. We had breakfast both mornings, I am 8 months pregnant and the staff were attentive to this making sure that I was offered de caffeinated tea. We had the same staff member for both our breakfast's and he remembered both our drinks orders. Rooms lovely and bright beautiful view of the Kensington Palace and gardens and a brilliant central location. We both with out doubt will recommend the hotel to colleagues and family 
 ",5,2013,11,11
133,Excellent Hotel for Family,"modernized hotel.

spacious rooms. luxury bathroom.

very friendly and professional staff.

excellent location: many restaurants and cafes and bakeries. also near to the hyde park and Royal Albert Hall. 

easy to catch bus and the kensington station just cross street.

i'am strongly advice to visti the Whole Foods Market. in the opposite side of the kensington high street.

one of the disadvantage is the lobby is small and basic.",5,2013,11,11
133,Have they done a Brian-jet job on the hotel?,"We have over many years used the Royal Garden Hotel when in London due to its very central location. It has always been a very comfortable and pleasant experience. Likewise this last trip.
Staff is well trained, polite and helpful. Breakfast is an absolute joy in relaxing surroundings. They seem to have changed things around a bit, - possibly to get room for more customers. For me, it seems that the rooms after updates are smaller than they used to be. Bathrooms are excellent, up to the minute and functional. Beds big and most comfortable. But, are the rooms smaller, did they get in, let us say 20, instead of 15 in the same space as before??? Has the same philosophy spread to the hotel industry as in the airlines like Bryanjet and Sleazyair!?!? However, it is still one of my preferred hotels to rest ones tired limbs when in the capitol.",4,2013,11,06
133,Park Terrace Restaurant,"This has to be one of the best places in London to lunch be it with a friend, family or for business. I have a bi-annual reunion of ex-executives of the company I used to work for - they all love it and they come from far and wide (Dubai, Zurich Bangkok). We take the private dining facility at the far end of the restaurant so that we have total privacy. Their three or two course luncheon menu is excellent and it is such good value for money. 
I have used this hotel for business and for personal use since it first opened and cannot fail it. If you want personal service then this is the place to stay. Overlooking Kensington Palace and the park with excellent shopping facilities along Kensington High Street - stay here, dine here and you won't be disappointed.",5,2013,11,05
133,Fantastic Weekend,"Stayed here as part of my 50th birthday celebration, and took in the NFL at Wembley on the same weekend.

Very handy for the tube (Kensington High Street) approx 5-10 minutes walk away, and v close to the shops of the High Street. We had a Garden View room on the 8th floor which had fantastic views of Hyde Park and the London skyline.

On arrival early in the morning we were advised that the room was still occupied but that they would look after the bags and text us once the room was ready. Great service and a friendly smile at reception.

When we did return from the West End everything was ready and there were even chocolates wishing me a happy birthday - a lovely touch. 

The room was big by London Standards with a raised seating area with two sofas and a table looking out the window. there was a fully stocked mini-bar, lots of towels and robes. Everything that you would need.

The bed was so comfortable I could have stayed there all day and night!! The only thing missing was a headboard which meant that the pillows kept getting stuck down the edge.

Breakfast on the Sunday was a leisurely affair, with lots to choose from and a chef on the buffet station who was there to cook your eggs whatever way you would like. It is pricey at ¬£25 pp for breakfast but we had already booked it through a deal including breakfast so it was very reasonable and we made full use of what was on offer. The Monday breakfast was similar without the chef and buffet station but you could still get anything you wanted on the breakfast menu in Eggs Benedict. These did come along cold and the eggs hard so were sent back. The staff were very polite, attentive and efficient.

Check out was at 12 noon so a lazy morning was had, especially as there were no trains out of London due to the weather that day, and we needed time to search out alternatives.

Would I go back - most certainly at the right deal!!",5,2013,11,05
133,Good Location/Nice Staff/ Shame about the breakfast!!,"This is the second time that I have stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel, the hotel reception were very pleasant and helpful on checkin/out and also the rooms were very clean and smart and the beds and pillows are without doubt some of the most comfortable that I have ever slept in.
Apart from Bertie's Bar which I have used a couple of times and both times the staff were very pleasant I did not use the other facility that I would have normally used that is to say the breakfast bar. I didn't use this simply because the hotel were charging ¬£20 per head for an English Breakfast and as there were three of us in our group that would have mean't at least ¬£60 per day extra for a simple fry up.
The answer was very simple though you simply go across Kensington High Street almost opposite the hotel you will find just a few yards down a side road the ""Cote Bistro"" who provide a waitress service for their various hot/cold breakfast's which includes a full English for ¬£7 or a lovely sausage or bacon baguette for ¬£4, the choices at the bistro are excellent and the prices very reasonable. Therefore my party of three people were able to have breakfast including coffee/tea for just over ¬£20 per day (or ¬£7 per head!). The bistro serve breakfast weekdays from 8am to noon and at weekends from 9am to 1pm.
I am sorry but I don't see how the hotel can charge these over inflated prices for a simple fry up and the only benefit of using the hotel for breakfast would be if you needed to be up and out early.  
I would certainly stay at this hotel again and I would also recommend it to others, but I wouldn't recommend the breakfast, for that I strongly suggest that you pop along to the ""Cote Bistro"" for an excellent choice and very reasonably priced breakfast.",4,2013,11,05
133,A very good hotel,"Queen room for single occupancy was exceptionally clean, quiet and comfortable. Room service was consistently very good - prompt and good value and delivered by very well trained, good humoured people. I stayed for five consecutive nights and because of this I had a good deal, plus 24 hour free wifi, which is most unusual in the UK  in a five star hotel. Unfortunately, I prebooked my car parking in the NCP carpark beneath the hotel, assuming that I could come and go on business during the day - but this was not the case, even though I was assured that there would be no problem. Do check for the cheapest method, as NCP has very firm views on people paying ¬£35 a day, and wanting (gasp) to leave and come back! Anyway, the hotel was nice:  I felt quite well attended to, and it's a pleasant and convenient part of town.",5,2013,11,04
133,Perfect hotel even in the cheapest Queen room,"I am staying here now in the least expensive room, described as a queen room for single occupancy only. 

I chose the hotel because the location was ideal for my needs and I been to the hotel before to eat several times at the fabulous Min Jiang restaurant at the hotel.

I was worried by some if the comments about how small and noisy the queen rooms were and a few of the other negative comments, but I am delighted with the room! 

It is on the sixth floor, it is quiet, compact, and spotlessly clean. I have a view over Kensington Palace Gardens, the bed is very comfortable, and the service is excellent.

It is quite expensive, and the daily rates move around a bit, but the location is excellent right on Kensington High St near good shopping and restaurants, and you would have to be very fussy not to like the stylish, modern, very clean rooms.

Will stay here again and will recommend to family and friends.",5,2013,11,04
133,"Very nice, very friendly","For my first overseas trip to London, my family and I booked through a travel agent who is familiar with our taste. My wife, daughter and I can not be more pleased with the cleanliness, friendliness and class of this hotel and it's staff. After an overnight flight from JFK, we arrived in London at 7am and were allowed to check in early, I don't know what we would have done otherwise as we were completely exhausted. The consierge was extremely helpfully and kind. 
The only downfall I can state is that for a five star hotel, WiFi should be included. It cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 per 24 hours. If the Giraffe restaurant and the whole foods grocery across the street can give away high speed Internet, so should a $300+ per night hotel!
We did have the buffet one day of our four day stay, not to our American tastes with super runny eggs and three varieties of sausages, none with flavor. There was a huge selection of pastries, fruits, etc and we filled up on that. 
We return to London next year for the next jaguars game, hopefully the team shows up this time as it is difficult to travel all that way for a beating like we took from the 49ers this year. We will definitely stay at this hotel again, hopefully they will have the WiFi included by then.
**Note to manager, where can a USA citizen find room specials for your hotel? Next year we will require 6 rooms for our 10 day stay.",5,2013,11,03
133,Great service and very comfortable,"My second stay at the Royal Garden Hotel and it lived up to my first experience. It's understatedly   on the mark - great service, clean, comfortable and quiet rooms with quality food in an excellent location.",5,2013,11,03
133,birthday treat,"Wwe stayed here as part of a birthday treat for my wife combining a stay with a posh lunch and a trip to the theatre and a bit of (expensive!!!) shopping.  Booked the hotel via Late Rooms and got a really good deal; excellent room for much less the advertised price.   However our room overlooked Kensington High St and the Hotel forecourt so the view not so good, albeit the room was great; fab bed, nice sitting area, excellent bathroom.  We only stayed one night but we both thought the bar on the mezzanine level was very good and the breakfast was excellent. Staff were very friendly and professional, so overall service was good as well.  Go for a garden room if you get the chance tho'",4,2013,10,31
133,"Beautiful hotel, fantastic stay!","This hotel is gorgeous! The staff are so attentive, the cocktail bar is fantastic and the room was just lovely.  We stayed for two nights for a concert at the Royal Albert Hall, which is just a short stroll away.  The hotel is situated right next door to Kensington Palace Gardens and so it's ideally situated for a stroll.  Kensington High Street shops are on your doorstep, as is the nearest tube.  The Hotel has parking through an NCP carpark right next door.  

It was just lovely and well worth the money.  Try the cocktail bar!",5,2013,10,31
133,Tiny rooms,"I stayed here on a business trip recently and was really surprised by the rating having stayed in hotel after hotel for work. The rooms are really small, so small I had nowhere to put my suitcase apart from in front of the wardrobe on the ground. I ordered room service one night, no complaints on that. The health club is in a different entrance so you need to go outside the front door to get there, I don't mind that so much but there was no information re: the health club in my room. There isn't much personality about the hotel, amenities are not obvious until you search for them. I did have a brownie waiting for me on arrival into the room which was a nice touch. A colleague had fruit which I would have appreciated probably more than the brownie. The tv channels could be improved, not a great selection and I really enjoy UK tv when I can get it so slightly disappointed. There should be an extra blanket in the wardrobe. The overall off putting thing for me was the small room. Staff were friendly and courteous but I didn't have much interaction. Good location but star rating is overrated given what you get which is pretty average",3,2013,10,30
133,Great Hotel !!!,"We stayed again in Royal Garden Hotel last weekend. It is my second review about this Hotel as we really love staying there. A real 5 stars Hotel. The staff is welcoming, efficient and professional. 
The room was large with a small living room (very helpful when you are 2 people). We had a wonderful view on the Gardens. Bathroom perfectly clean with shower and bath separate. 
Great continental breakfast with good products.
The location is perfect, on High Street Kensington. You can enjoy shopping and also go for a walk in the Park.",5,2013,10,30
133,will go again,"I stayed here for one night, it is my second stay. I love the location as it is close to Royal Albert Hall, Kensington High Street and Kensington Park. We had a garden room and it was wonderful. Great views across the park. The floors really creak on the sitting level but the room overall was large, for London, and the bathroom had a great separate shower rather than the shower over the bath. 

We had Kensington tea in the room to the side, can't remember the name. The tea was ok but we won't have it next time as it wasn't that good and they didn't offer to refill the tea pot and we just didn't think it measured up. The staff were good and helpful and the front desk staff very happy and helpful. Will most certainly stay next time we are in the city.",4,2013,10,28
133,Great Hotel,"My second short stay this year and everything was as 5* as before . The booking in/out is quick and painless and the service at all stages is first class and professional. Only had breakfast this time but the choice is exceptional and wife's complaint that her Eggs Benedict was overcooked was speedily resolved.  Unlike so many hotels the there are always enough staff on hand to deal with any queries/problems.
The staff in  Berties bar  were very helpful and attentive and more than happy to explain drinks and cocktails to a number of foreign guests.
I don't always stay in this Hotel when I visit London because I like to explore different parts and be located centrally to those parts but for Knightsbridge I am more than happy to return. I also discovered the bus stop right outside the entrance where the no9 bus takes you along Piccadilly/Green Park into Trafalgar Square --Very useful!
As I have said in a previous rating rooms overlooking the High St are not the best insulated against noise and if you are a light sleeper I would recommend ear plugs for a good nights sleep.
Notwithstanding this I love it here--The location with shops and restaurants nearby make it a great location for a London stay.",5,2013,10,28
133,"Great hotel, great location","Really enjoyed my stay at this wonderful hotel. Great location right on hyde park but also kensington high st, good for shops (whole food market especially) restaurants etc. Stayed in a Queen Room with view of Kensington mews, fine for one but if two staying would be better with king room at least.  The staff were tremendous throughout stay, from doormen to room attendants to restaurant staff. The food in park terrace restaurant is excellent and not too expensive for the quality, however breakfast seems pricey at ¬£20 continental, ¬£25 with full english added - no matter how good it is. Bar is relaxed and friendly.  Have stayed here more than once and will gladly return.",5,2013,10,26
133,"Beautiful, friendly, London prices","Stayed for  8 nights, booked 15 days in advance, so got 15% discount for advance and 20% on top for long stay. GBP 218/night.

Well appointed junior suite. Sofa, desk, coffee table. USB 5v in wall, otherwise UK standard 220. Hotel has adaptors, which we didn't know ahead so brought our own. Spectacular view over Kensington Gardens of palace. Staff very friendly. Concierge very helpful with restaurants. Park Terrace or Min Jiang restaurants and Berties Bar o n property. 24 hour room service.
Biggest disappointment was bed pillows. Very thin. Got extras, but seems odd.

Would stay again!",5,2013,10,22
133,Good place to stay,"The wife and I stayed here recently and had. Great experience , rooms are kitted out nicely and the staff were very helpful especially Luton / Concierge awesome guy , will be staying here again, good view over Hyde park, breakfast a bit pricey for us but found a great little cafe opposite.",5,2013,10,22
133,Great location,"This is a great location, on the edge of Hyde Park and next door to Kensington High Street's shopping.  The Chinese restaurant is very good and the conference facilities also.  Bedrooms are a touch 'travel lodge' in decor, but adequate.  Your paying for location here.",4,2013,10,22
133,Great Stay with impeccable hospitality,"We stayed on Saturday evening at the hotel (19th Oct) and can honestly say from the moment we walked in to the moment we left after breakfast, the staff were helpful courteous and professional. wth a lovely manner.  
We had a beautiful garden room on the 3rd floor overlooking the park and the room was a great size, with a very well equipped bathroom and shower, comfy sofa & bed..  Fully stocked tea and coffee were an added welcome for the morning. 

We had a drink in Berties Bar early evening and although it was quiet the staff were attentive and the drinks very reasonalbly price with no huge service charge added.

All in all a great hotel and if you are in Kensignton you should stay!

Tracey & Barry UPTON October 2014",5,2013,10,21
133,Great conference hotel,"Stayed here for a conference and I must say it's an excellent venue for business events. All of the staff are very friendly and will go to any lengths to ensure that everything goes smoothly. I managed to get a garden room on this stay which was much better than the streets that overlook the High Street as these can be very noisy.

The room was quite small but well equiped and everything worked OK apart from the shaver point in the bathroom.

The quality of the food that was served during our 2 day event was excellent and our dinner was excellent. Too often food served at events is rubbery chicken but this menu was inventive and the food and the wine pairings were first class.

It's not a cheap place to stay but it is very conveniently situated and hotels in London are not cheap.",4,2013,10,18
133,Disappointed,"We have stayed and referred others here before. This was the beginning of a 25th anniversary trip and we were disappointed by the high price, the small room and the overall poor quality of the service. There was no doorman to greet us upon arrival and help with the bags. We sent a pair of trousers for regular laundry service and had to chase it down with several phone calls and notes at the front desk. Finally, we requested a 4:30am wake up call which never came. Thankfully our car service had the presence of mind to inquire at the front desk or else we would have missed our flight. Management was quick to send us a survey link after our stay, in which we asked to be contacted and were not. Overall a disappointing experience",3,2013,10,17
133,Good location,I stayed in this hotel in July for five night and really enjoyed my stay.  My room was at the back of the hotel with a lovely view of the palace and gardens.  It was very quiet and I got a good nights sleep.  The staff were friendly and polite and the rooms very comfortable and clean.  There is plenty of public transport with a bus stop at the front door and Kensington High Street tube station up the street.  As I like to walk it was a lovely walk through the park into Oxford Street.  Highly recommended and will definitely stay there again.,5,2013,10,14
133,Third time around and still great,"We love this place, have reviewed it before. The staff is awesome - it had been a year and a half since our last visit (we always stay for 8-10 days) but many of them recognized us straight away and welcomed us back. Also they tend to promote from within, so it's nice to see members of the staff move up the line to higher positions. Employees seem to stay there for a long time, which is a good reflection on the management.
Once you know the ropes, it just takes patience and persistence to get the room and view you want. We asked to move rooms (one-half of our view through the picture window was of a stone wall) and had to wait a day to move  as they were fully booked, but they made it right.
One complaint: we always use a travel agent because it is the only way that we can see to get a breakfast plan for the full stay at the hotel (we love the full English breakfast.) Apparently the hotel would rather you book direct, so they have started withholding free wi-fi unless you do. For a luxury hotel to try to charge GBP 20 a day for wi-fi is outrageous and ill-advised. When I finally found someone at the front desk with the authority to do it and said ""you really want me to go across the street to a seedy Starbucks and use their wi-fi when I'm a loyal long-term guest?"" they gave me the password. Just make it easy, guys! Offer a breakfast plan and free wi-fi if you book direct and we'll do it.
Other than those bumps which were eventually worked out, our stay was wonderful. Great room, great concierge staff, great housekeeper, great room service and restaurants. And the location just can't be beat. 
Will we return - of course! I do hope that manager Graham pays attention to the suggestions, though.",5,2013,10,14
133,"Small, but can be excellent","The Royal Garden is conveniently located, but take care to get the right room or you might feel like you're trying to sleep in the middle of High Street.

The hotel is conveniently located in what seems to be a cut out corner of Kensington Gardens a short distance from Kensington Palace. From the exterior, there's little to recommend it, but the interior lobby and ground floor restaurant and bar areas offer an immediate break from the high noise crush of Kensington High Street.

After a pleasant tree-lined, GBP10 taxi ride from Paddington Station (and the Heathrow Express train stop) I politely asked for a quiet room and the desk clerk worked for several minutes to find a way to make room for me in the fully booked hotel. I was moved from a second floor street-side to a seventh floor, tree-top-level room on the palace side of the hotel.

The room was small, but thoughtfully designed with plenty of space to relax, work, and sleep. The room was impeccably clean and had a responsive and quiet heating/cooling system. The room service, restaurant, and cleaning staff were all friendly and helpful.

I was a last minute booking and amazingly, despite being otherwise fully booked, they offered me the long-closed discount conference rate for my room when an unrelated cancelation came in and allowed me to jump off the waiting list.

The area is notably expensive, but I was pleased to find an excellent Whole Foods and a huge range of restaurant options within 5-10 minutes walk from the front door of the hotel. The High Street Tube station was also just a short walk down the block.

Of course Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park (as well as the Palace, the Serpentine, Albert Hall, and many other landmarks) are close and readily accessible for exploring.",5,2013,10,11
133,The Staff makes this place,"Great location - conveniently next to shops, Whole foods, a tube station and the Kensington park. They even made a small map of the park with routes for your run. 
Cleaning staff is the best. I think they have a system were every person is assigned to the same rooms for that week, which makes you bump into the same lady everyday. Making her recognize you and creating a personal touch to the hotel that puts a smile on your face. 
Lots of different options at breakfast. 
Yoga classes provided are worth attending. Shame the ""spa"" and sauna area are so poorly designed, old and smelly.",4,2013,10,11
133,Great service and experience,"On business travel for 4 nights - what a great experience.  The staff is very friendly and service oriented - trying to find different ways to 'go out of their way' to provide excellent customer service.
5 days and each filled with excellent service.  Room service always delivered promptly.  I liked the food in all three on-site places, especially on the 10th floor with a great view.",5,2013,10,10
133,A Little Bit Royal,"I stayed in the Royal Garden Hotel for 10 days.  I had a King size Suite Room with views over Kensington Park.  It was fabulous.  If I leant forward at the far end of my windows and looked back across the Park could see Kensington Palace.  It was lovely to be in London and have Royalty as my neighbours!  It is a very conveniently located hotel with about a 7 minute walk each to either The Royal Albert Hall or the Kensington Hight Street Tube Station (but in different directions).  The staff at this hotel were really helpful, polite, courteous and friendly.  The gym is oddly located and doesn't have much in the way of weight equipment, but it has a number of cardio machines and plenty of mats, rollers, kettle bells, free weights etc for a great workout.  Shame it only opens at 9 am on a Sunday though!  I only ate at the ground floor restaurant once - for breakfast, and it was lovely (grilled Kippers - which for some reason I only seem to eat in the UK), and I had room service one other morning - and it was HUGE!  I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and I will definitely be staying there again.",4,2013,10,10
133,I doubt its really 5 star!,"Very average - small room, noisy on lower floors at the front.
Bar guys were good, efficient - same with room service breakfast which was delivered promptly and by a very chirpy gentleman!
Its a handy location if you need to be in Kensington but it is indeed very average.",3,2013,10,09
133,Pre theatre meal in the restaurant at The Royal Garden Hotel,"My friend and I went for a 2 course meal before attending The Classical Brit Award Ceremony
at the Royal Albert Hall last week, and we couldn't commend it highly enough.  The food
was beautifully presented and served. I had steak and my friend has Sea Bass, both were
really lovely the price included a lovely selection of freshly made bread and a glass of wine-
fantastic.  The staff were delightful.  If you are in Kensington, do go and try it its well
worth a visit, I just wished we had more time to relax and have coffee the meal with the
beautiful petit fours",5,2013,10,06
133,5 Star,"I have stayed in this in over 4 times now. It has become my favourite London hotel. Its a 5 star hotel with excellent location. Just next to the Kensington Palace gardens &  park. Staff are always willing to help and above all it is always well priced for a 5 star hotel, its excellent value compared to all other 5 Star hotels. Located on High Street kensington , all major shops are walking distance. I recommend their afternoon tea.",5,2013,10,04
133,Beautiful hotel!!,"My boyfriend surprise me to this hotel last November! It's a massive and beautiful hotel. We never used the restaurant but we had room service (breakfast), there was a great selection to choose from and the staff were excellent! Room was beautiful,big and tidy. I would love to go back to this hotel.",5,2013,10,02
133,"Great location, but not great value","The Royal Gardens Hotel is a good hotel but I question the value for money. The location is excellent being right at the start of High Street Kensington, a hop and skip from the park and walking distance to a tube station, the museums and the Albert Hall. The staff are friendly and the hotel is in good condition. For these reasons alone I would not put anyone off staying (particularly if work is paying) and frankly the hotel has little local competition. However, with prices starting at around GBP 300 per night it does not offer much value for money. Neither breakfast (which is excellent) nor wifi was included in the price and the room sizes are small by international standards (probably average for London though). Our room was advertised as 27 square meters but it certainly felt a whole lot smaller. The bathroom was recently updated and had a separate shower which is a bonus but on the downside the floors in most of the rooms are carpeted which makes the rooms dusty (and probably dirty). We had a room facing the busy high street but despite this we were not disturbed by noise thanks to excellent soundproofing. Overall, our stay was good. This hotel deserves an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù rating but because the staff were friendly and the restaurant service was excellent it just tips the rating over the bar to ‚Äúvery good‚Äù.",4,2013,10,02
133,Nice location next to Kensington Garden,In London for a quick business trip.  This hotel was convenient to the Tube to get to Hammersmith.  Very quiet room.  Plenty of space.  Nice dining room for breakfast.  Good location for dining options outside the hotel. Friendly and attentive staff.,5,2013,10,01
133,Lovely Spacious Rooms,"Stayed here on a busy Saturday night. Room was spotless, very comfortable and elegant with seperate seating area. Having stayed at a number of hotels in the area and been very disappointed with how small rooms can be it was a lovely surprise as to the space we had here. The bathroom was excellent with a fantastic shower and separate bath. The bar area was lovely in the evening and we were looked after by very efficient staff. Breakfast was also very good in a lovely bright restaurant, not one of those basement ones so many hotels have. Location was perfect as we were in London to leave a son at Imperial college just a walk away and the museums etc are very close.",5,2013,10,01
133,"Wonderful Hotel, Friendly Staff","Every time we go to London we stay in The Royal Garden Hotel and each time really enjoy it.  The hotel is spotlessly clean and the rooms are comfortable and have all the expected ameneties of a 5 star hotel.  The bathrooms have a separate walk in shower and lovely toiletries.  The Chinese restaurant Min Jiang on the 10th floor is a must, as is Berties Bar on the mezzanine level above the reception.  All the staff are friendly and helpful.  The location is excellent being next to Kensington Palace and Kensington Gardens and there are some good shops, restaurants and bars nearby.  The hotel is on good bus routes especially to Covent Garden and Oxford Street.  All in all we wouldn't stay anywhere else in London.",5,2013,09,30
133,Another wonderful few days,"My Husband & I met at the Royal Gardens many years ago & so the hotel holds a special place in our hearts!!  We have returned many times over the yeas & have never been disappointed.
We always feel very well looked after by the attentive staff.  Rooms are spotlessly clean & dining in Ming Jiang, with its excellent food, service & views is a wonderful experience.
Thank you to everyone.  We look forward to our next visit!",5,2013,09,30
133,"Good location, comfortable stay","Usually stay in Covent Garden when we go to London, but fancied a change so tried Knightsbridge. Hotel was generally very good, on bus routes and great local amenities. Silly little things stopped me giving it 5 stars - and I mean silly! Usually Toiletries are provided sufficient for the room occupancy - i.e. A set per person, but we had to share one set, likewise one packet of biscuits and scarce supply of coffee (only one cup each and not replenished). The room and the bathroom were very nice though, and the Chinese restaurant was well worth a visit. Will definitely return - but will take my own provisions next time!",4,2013,09,29
133,"Glorious bathroom, ideal location","Very well appointed hotel and stunning views over the park. Comfortable rooms and the Chinese restaurant is wonderful. 

However, there are a number of issues which could do easily be resolved. 
Wi fi - they wanted a ludicrous ¬£20 per night ( unless you paid a higher rate through their own website). Fortunately O2 have stepped into the breach to offer free wifi, although it isn't speedy. 

We were offered a complimentary Times but it was not forthcoming. 

The toiletries are wonderful but they were not replenished after the first day. We weren't greedy but one shower gel for two for two days is mean. The complimentary biscuits are one pack to share although they did replace these, unlike the sachets of coffee. Penny-pinching and unworthy. 

One of the lifts stopped working after day one, resulting in delays in getting to the ground floor or worrying overcrowding. I was very surprised. 

Will I go back?  I'd like to and I hope the management respond to these points as there were no feedback forms in evidence, even when I asked. This could be super but more attention to detail and supervision or training is needed.",4,2013,09,29
133,Our two night stay,"We stayed at this hotel one night before our tour and one night after our tour It is a very modern hotel The staff was pleasant Breakfast offered a variety of fruits but you had to pay 5 pound more if you wanted eggs and sausage  One thing I find unacceptable is that a hotel which is a five star property catering to business charges you 20 pound for Internet .Wifi today is a must in all hotels and must be complimentary That is the negative point I have regarding the Royal garden Hotel 
The Hotel  is next to Kensington Palace and a bus stop will take you anywhere you want Also close to the underground to restaurants and stores",4,2013,09,26
133,I love this place!,"My husband and I have stayed at the Royal Garden on several occasions, and are yet to be disappointed.  Lovely, clean, comfortable rooms; friendly and courteous staff; wonderful food.  We can really recommend the Afternoon Tea (particularly the speciality teas), Ming Jiang (the duck is to die for) and the Royal Garden Burger.  Proximity to the Albert Hall (about a 5 - 10 minute walk) and seeing the sun rise over Kensington Gardens just the cherry on the cake.  Every stay is special.",5,2013,09,24
133,Delay at check in,"1. I had the problem at check in. I arrived after 2:00PM, but it was found that the room is not ready, and there was the delay with it. So, i had to left my luggage and go to the city and enter to the room later. This is not in line with my expectations of a service of a ***** hotel.
2. It was stated in the booking confirmed, that the room has ""London views"". My room was on the 2nd floor. The views were brilliant, front view: a high dirty brick wall at about 5 yards from the window, below the window there was a set of various radiator units mounted. The problem is not in the view, them can be different, the problem is in the incorrect information given before. 
3. What is the advanced state-of-the-art modern super computer techology 
with charges of 20GBP per day or 5GBP per two hours? It is WiFi in the hotel.",3,2013,09,24
133,Best choice in Kensington,"My second stay here. This hotel's greatest asset is its staff - they are all very friendly, courteous,
efficient and professional. The location is great, near the tube, shops, good restaurants. The rooms are adequate though not luxurious and food and service in the restaurants very good.
The Health Club leaves a lot to be desired and desperately needs remodelling. This is not a cheap hotel by any means, but worth the expense if you want a great location and comfortable
environment.",4,2013,09,24
133,Nice hotel and kensington is real nice too,"a very nice, clean hotel, i can really recommend staying in kensington too. been to london a couple of times but always stayed closer to oxford street/covent garden. 
hotel had very friendly and helpful staff, they let me use the internet-room for no charge even tho it was supposed to cost.",5,2013,09,22
133,"Fantastic stay. Staff very helpful, food superb","Just returned from a conference event at the hotel and was delighted with the whole experience. Food was excellent and all staff I dealt with were extremely helpful. The room was a great size with separate seating area. Bathroom with heated flooring and large walk in shower area, great attention to detail all around. Will definitely return to this venue soon.",5,2013,09,20
133,Wedding at this excellent hotel,"We had our wedding at this excellent hotel. Every member of staff we interacted with, from the initial enquiry to checkout, was extremely courteous and professional. Furthermore, their events team were all extremely pleasant and were sincere in their congratulations and efforts on our behalf.

During all of our various meeting and discussions, we were met with nothing but courtesy, patience and understanding, even when our requirements bordered on the unreasonable!  Their flexibility as regards our ever changing requests was extremely appreciated. Their advice regarding the various aspects of the arrangements, whether it was to do with layout or managing costs, was all well received and extremely helpful.

Thanks a bunch Martin! 

The food on the night was a hit, and enjoyed by all including my wife and I, with the little we managed to eat in between all the dancing!

The room we stayed in afterwards had was spacious, clean, excellently furnished and  with beautiful views of the park.

I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,09,19
133,Best Conference Hotel Ever Used,"We just held a 4 day confererence for 240 people at the Royal Garden Hotel and I cannot recommend it highly enough. The staff were outstanding, nothing was too much trouble, requests were actioned quickly, everyone was super friendly, professional and efficient, food was fantastic, location, meeting rooms and bedrooms were ideal. I would definitely be advising other clients to use this hotel as they strive for top service and excellence all the time and achieve it. Well done everyone that helped us out during the past few days and I look forward to coming back to you again in the near future :)",5,2013,09,19
133,A great hotel,"I stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel while travelling alone in London. The hotel is clean and modern, the staff friendly and the location's great. For the price I paid, incredible value. The only odd thing is that there is a lack of electrical outlets where you would expect them (bathroom). 

The bus stop is right in front of the hotel and the tube's about a 10 minute walk (feels longer with a suitcase!). I treated myself to a cab to airport, and that was about a 55GBP ride.

 I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Thank you for making my stay feel safe and comfortable.",5,2013,09,18
133,Misleading advertising and a little disappointing for a 5 star hotel,"The biggest disappointment was on arrival being told that I had to pay 20 pounds a day for WiFi even though I was positive that it had been included. I was told this is only the case if the booking was done directly through the hotel. However upon my return home I have found a printout I made of the ""new fantastic benefits that you can receive by booking online or via a preferred partner"" which included ""Free internet (WiFi) to all guests"". That statement seems pretty clear to me! I was also disappointed to find errors on my account amounting to 98 pounds. The final gripe was returning to my hotel room at 4 pm one day after having left early in the morning to find the room had not been serviced. I was told that I should have put the green light on. Again for a 5 star hotel I would have expected the room to have been serviced regardless. One last point is that the hotel is exceptionally busy so I was unable to stay later than the normal check out time of 12 pm.",3,2013,09,18
133,¬£20 a day for wifi because I used a travel agent? You must be kidding me!,"Amazing how 1 thing can move a hotel rating from 5 to 1. In this day and age for a hotel to charge customers for wifi if they have not booked directly with the hotel is an abomination. It is akin to trying to turn on the lights & having reception say ""oh sorry we'll charge you ¬£20 for that because you used a travel agent""!!!!! This is an exceptional hotel in a great location - the 4 staff who did not have the ""authority"" to resolve my issue were professional & empathetic, the breakfast was excellent as were the staff, the concierge great. Wake up management of this hotel - to discriminate against busy professionals who use travel agents is beyond the pale - if 3 star b&b's in the Isles can live in the 21st century so can you. My trip to London was extremely inconvenienced because I chose to stay with you - had to go to the local coffee shop to remain in contact with my work & family for the price of a cup of coffee - not my $300 a night room
- that should tell you something. ",1,2013,09,18
133,Home Away From Home,"I've lived close to the Royal Hotel for a few years when I worked in London, and when I had a chance to visit London earlier this year I decided to stay there, I went back twice since April, and it always felt like I was at home, the staff are extremely helpful, from the moment you step out the Taxi to the moment you enter your room, the rooms were refurbished a couple of years ago so they're in an immaculate state, all in all it's a genuine 5 star hotel in Central London minus the commercial fuss of other 5* hotels, with the feel of a 5 star private building. 

It was a great bonus to get a knock on the door with a dish of Chocolate cake on Sunday afternoon courtesy of the management,Thanks again Alex! Of course the free Wifi when booking through the hotel website is the cherry on the cake.

I'll be back in a couple of months :)",5,2013,09,17
133,Pre Theatre Dinner Park Terrace,"Ate a very good quick dinner at the Park Terrace restaurant before going ti=o see 'Wicked' (brilliant!). This was a very good value deal, 2 courses and a very nice glass of wine for ¬£23.90 in elegant surroundings with excellent service. Most impressed.",5,2013,09,13
133,Great room/views,Great location over looking Parklands and a 'hop on hop off' bus stop just opposite front doir. Breakfasts were amazing and service great. Room was spacious and bathroom had a seperate shower! Wifi was not free which was disappointing but plenty of shops nearby that offer free Wifi! ,4,2013,09,08
133,Great Hotel.  Convient Location,Nice boutique hotel.  Very clean.  Very friendly staff especially the concierge desk.  Very helpful!  Nice neighborhood.  Lots of shops and restaurants.  Close to tour bus stops and tube.  I would definitely stay there again.,5,2013,09,06
133,Great Place to stay!!!,Stayed at this hotel in August and it was great. It is very close to the tube and the rooms were really clean. The staff was friendly and helpful with any question that I had. I would definitely stay there again! Thanks.,5,2013,09,05
133,Great Location,"The hotel is in a great location, convenient for attractions & bus & tube transport just outside the door. Its 5 star so don't expect a 'cheap' room for the night, well worth the price as the rooms are a good size. The rooms overlooking Kensington Gardens have a great view however these will cost you more for the experience.",4,2013,09,03
133,Overlooking Kensington Park,"We spent three wonderful days in London in a king size room overlooking Kensington Park.  Our room was modern, clean, spacious and quiet. It faced east and had a great view of the park at sunrise.  It was conveniently located, with the subway (tube) less than three blocks away and buses directly in front of the hotel.  There was a Whole Foods Market two blocks away and many restaurants within one to two blocks from the hotel.  The service was excellent and although we did not eat at any of their restaurants or utilize their facilities like the gym, we asked plenty of questions to the concierge, Mr. Garcia.  He helped us with finding the right transportation and was very knowledgeable with sightseeing options.  All of the staff were friendly and helpful, and although I can only remember Mr. Garcia's name, they should all be commended for their great service.  I would definitely stay at the Royal Garden again.",5,2013,08,25
133,"Great Location, Wonderful Hotel, with a few flaws","We spent a wonderful three days, two nights in the Royal Garden and it was a wonderful hotel, in a great location in London England.  We had a King sized bedroom overlooking London (Not the Garden view) on the ninth floor and it was great!  The street noise did NOT disturb at all, nor was there any noise or disturbance from the Restaurant on the 10th floor, which I had read a complaint about here on trip advisor from a previous guest.

We had no problem checking in early, and the hotel people were very professional and helpful. A map with directions was given immediately, a free newspaper, and when our hair dryer was malfunctioning, it was quickly replaced.

We did not get the breakfast (It is expensive) nor did we eat in the hotel, for we had other plans and tastes, but with so many options it was not a problem.

However, guests do need to realize several things:

One: the spa area, although nice was not what would be a four star spa in my ideal.  It had a steam room and a sauna, which the floor boards were loose and hard to walk on (Separate for men and women)with three treatment rooms (Which were expensive and we did NOT get).  The gym was well equipped, although without a TV as would be expected.  and the oddest point was you must exit the hotel and go in a separate entrance right out in public.  Not hard, but not the most convenient.

Two:  We had to catch the Oxford Tube on Sunday morning very early.  And although we could easily check out the night before, and did so, we had a taxi called for us so we could get to Victoria Station on time, but the taxi driver literally had no clue, and we ended up at the Oxford circle station with it being locked and we needed to be ON time!

I feel that the personnel at the desk (We did explain why we needed to be leaving so early), should have told us that one, the Undergrounds would be closed on that morning so early...and that it would have been nice to also have known a major bicycle race would affect traffic.....  BADLY....  Nothing was said either way....

There is also no pool here, but that was no big deal....

We would however stay here again....  It was comfortable, the service was great and helpful and the location could not be beat.

It was well worth staying here!",4,2013,08,22
133,Knightsbridge Hotel Convenience,"Stayed here for two nights and it was excellent. We wanted to go shopping in London and this hotel's position is perfect. Afternoon tea was verynice but dinner was pricey. On the whole, after checking other accommodation in the area, this was the best value.",4,2013,08,21
133,Amazing views,"Hi my partner and I stayed here for one night in August 2013 ...we had a garden room which does not have a garden but amazing views over gardens 

The room was spacious with a separate seating area so in effect a mini suite, we were on the ninth floor which gave us views of the palace and the park but the best view from the window seat was over the rest of the city including the London eye,Houses of Parliament,the shard the gherkin and canary wharf absolutely beautiful both by day and night .

In addition to the room Bertie's bar is very relaxing with great cocktails and min portions of good food to snack on .

The staff were friendly And welcoming the only fault we had in this stay was dinner at Ming Jiang the chinese restaurant on the ninth floor but I am not sure this is actually part of the hotel .....",5,2013,08,20
133,Wonderful location,"We (my husband, myself and two kids) spent a week at the Royal Garden Hotel. The hotel is situated perfectly for young families - right next to Hyde Park. The hotel staff were very polite and had very good recommendations for restaurants. We stayed in one of the suites which was very comfortable for the four of us. We will definitely return to the Royal Garden Hotel.",4,2013,08,20
133,Disappointing,"- room wasn't ready at check in time
- had to move rooms because the first room absolutely stunk of cigarette smoke, no one apologised for inconvenience however they did find us a new room. 
- the second room hadnt even had the rubbish cleared from it, I dont expect to have full bins of personal rubbish from the previous guests in a supposed five star hotel! Disgusting!   

This hotel is so far from a five star. The reception staff are rude but I must add that the porters and room service staff were completely charming and helpful. 
Many other options in the area for a similar price so id recommend you do your research! ",2,2013,08,19
133,Nice location & beautiful hotel,"Great hotel in High Street Kensington, and high street ken station is a very short walk across the street. 

It's a little far from central, but you're right next to hyde park. If you want to take the Central line tube, walk across the park, and you'll get to queensway station.

The reason I gave this 4 stars is that there was some noise at night, you can hear everyone in the hallway. 

I would book here again.",4,2013,08,17
133,Clean and comfortable,"I have stayed in some hotels in London but this is the best so far. Now before you go saying there are better hotels - there are and I am sure that I will struggle to find them. For value, for cleanliness, for hospitality and location then I will be going back here. 
The hotel is on the corner of Hyde Park and behind Kensington Palace. I like to run and i have always stayed close to the park but this is right there. There is also a good mix of shops, bars and restaurants around the hotel. 
The rooms are small but hey that's London. The breakfast buffet is very good and the bar upstairs also has a good seleciton of drinks for a late night drink.",4,2013,08,16
133,A little bit of quiet luxury,"We stayed for three nights in early August on a sightseeing trip that took in 3 Royal residences and the Houses of Parliament. So the schedule was fairly hectic. The Royal garden was a great retreat.

The things that stand-out are

 - The location which is great if you're running round the West side of London. Pretty close to the tube and on the number 9 bus route (which is a good route for tourist attractions). Also right next to Kensington Palace (excellent place to visit) and the gardens. It's worth paying more for a room with a view over the gardens.

- The service which was both efficient and friendly without being fake over-friendly.

The restaurants are both excellent although a little pricey (with outrageous prices for wine). I'd certainly recommend the Park terrace for a pot of tea to calm down after a day's sightseeing.",5,2013,08,15
133,Great Stay,"Really nice hotel.  Large room with small sitting area that boasted big windows affording a view of Kensington High Street.  Staff was extremely helpful with dinner reservations, directions, and overall tourist questions.  Stayed three nights and could have stayed another three.  Nice location, within walking distance to the park and the subway; taxis are readily available as well.  Would stay there again.",4,2013,08,13
133,First Visit,"First visit to the Hotel, as an experieince very good hotel in an excellent location. If you are a famaily of 3 the executive rooms overlooking the garden / park are great.

The Hotel is on the corner of Hyde Park Kenisngton side, no better location for quick access to the park.

We did not try any F&B facilities as we have family very close by, rooms are spacious very clean and access to and from the hotel is ideal. Only one negative comment i would have expected a better in room entertainment on the TV, true when in London you visit the sites, but when it rains would have been nice to have a better selection on the TV.  

No hesitation will choose the same hotel again in the future.",4,2013,08,13
133,The love affair is over.,"Staying at the Royal Garden Hotel finally in the early 1980's could not have meant more to me,
as an office junior in a Chartered Accountants office, in 1972 it was one of my duties to handle the travel arrangements to London, on the Master Cutler train from Sheffield to London and then make  the hotel accomadation and meal bookings  for the senior partners of the company, thats when The Royal Garden Hotel came onto my radar, 
Telephoning and arranging the booking was always a thrill for me, the reservation staff were courteous and charming and I could not believe that I was speaking to someone in London, (I was only 17 at the time) I asked could they possibly mail me a copy of the Hotel details, I had to see this place for myself, and so they did from then I was smitten and vowed one day I would stay at this fabulous HoteI.I did on many occasions.
Fast forward to 2013 and after several wonderful stays here over the years , the bubble has burst,After an absence of five years we returned for a three night break and  were met at reception on check in by total indifference, not the usual RGH experience we had known previously, and on the internet deal criteria we were entitled to, only wifi was made known to us, and rather as an afterthought, no daily newspaper materialised, and no supplementary meal vouchers offering us a discount for lunch or dinner were given to us, not good enough.Our room was adequate, but there was no wow factor, it seemed narrow.and on our last night a funtion held in the restaurant on the 10th floor emitted smells that filtered down to our room, not pleasant.
Changes have been made to the bar area adjoining Park terrace turning  it into a rather uncomfortable cafe, where are the fabulous comfy sofa's where we enjoyed drinks until late, and delicious club sandwiches and tasty light meals, Beries bar is still there, but it is not a place to linger.There is no lounge to relax in.
Our experience was not a happy one, and one we will not repeat, after illness over the past couple of years prevented me from travelling too great a distance, when I was able we thought that trip to London would be in order, sadly we chose the wrong Hotel to spend it.",2,2013,08,10
133,Great meal!,"We 'ended up' at the Park Terrace restaurant on a voucher deal, as the hotel we were staying in had shut it's kitchen for August! ( the supposed 5* Cadogen ) it turned out lucky for us ! The 4 of us enjoyed a fabulous meal - cocktail, 3 exceptional courses, cheese, coffee and petit fours. Terrific value (¬£60 for 2) excellent service from Michael, who made us feel most welcome. (We never once felt we were 'on a deal') Will definitely return to stay, next time we visit London.",5,2013,08,09
133,Nice to be back.,"I used to stay at the Royal Garden often but that was back in the 90's.  Now some years later it was great to come back and to a property that is these days hard to fault. 

As everyone will agree, the location is great, next to Hyde Park. There is a bike rental station just a little way into the park. The bus stop outside the hotel hosts a number of routes and the top deck on a London bus is a great way to sightsee Park Lane and Oxford Street (No 10 bus) or Piccadilly, Trafalgar Street and the Strand (No 9). Get a Oyster card and the buses and trains are easy. The High Street Kensington tube station is a short walk down the street to the right and if you take the tube to Heathrow with luggage then changing District line trains at Earls Court and again at Barons Court is a breeze to get onto the Piccadilly line for  Heathrow. 

To the hotel and we couldn't fault it. The staff were friendly, professional and efficient. We went for a park view king room and ended up with a great view from the 5th floor. The room for London was spacious and well looked after. The complimentary waters on the bedside table after the evening turn down service were a nice touch. We booked direct via the hotels website and got what we thought was a great three night weekend rate (for a five star hotel in summer in London).  Booking online gave us the inclusion of complimentary internet but you have to remember to ask for the access card when you check in. 

We didn't use any of the bar's or restaurants but the top floor Chinese restaurant and bar offered great views of the park, perfect for lunch or an early summer dinner or drink.

We had a great experience here and I hope it won't be another 20 years before I'm back again. 

Well done, Royal Garden, still great after all these years.",5,2013,08,08
133,Family vacation to London,"We had a very pleasant time at The Royal Gardens Hotel.  I reserved a king garden room and twin garden room for my family.  Both rooms were very nice and while the hotel could not work it to have the rooms adjoining, they were a couple rooms apart.   Beds were clean and comfortable.  Bathroom was nice and clean.  A couple stains on the carpet were the only blemishes to the room.  Even though we stayed in early August the hotel was not fully booked and the rooms were very quiet for sleeping (Once Ramadan is over, the hotel gets a lot busier with guests from the Middle East I was told).  Air conditioning worked well as we had a hot spell in London when we arrived.

I have to mention that the gentleman working the concierge desk were very helpful during our entire stay.  We booked car service to/from hotel, dinner and tea reservations, London Eye, etc during our stay and they handled it very efficiently.  John White, the assistant head concierge, even surprised us with truffles and drinks in our room as we were there celebrating my daughter's birthday.  A nice gesture.

The rest of the staff from reception to the doormen, were very friendly and helpful.

Great location right next to Kensington Gardens.   Convenient to High Street Kensington tube stop.  

We will stay there again on our next visit.   The only downside I would say was the breakfast.  Very expensive for what you get (typical for a big hotel)  and the quality of the food was not great (below 5 star rating IMO) although the staff were very attentive.  We ended up eating at a little cafe down the road on our last day and wished we had made that decision earlier in the week as we would have saved a few hundred dollars. 

Overall a great trip and hotel with very helpful staff.",5,2013,08,07
133,"Helpful Staff, Great Location","My husband and I stayed for a week in mid July.  After 21 hours of flight from Australia and the shock of the hot weather in London, we were so pleased that we had selected the right hotel.

Followed the direction posted on the hotel website, we took the Heathrow Express train to the Paddington Station.  From there, we took a taxi to the hotel which was about 15-20 minutes ride.  Thank you to the taxi driver who knew how to meander through the heavy traffic.  

We first greeted by the Concierge staff at the driveway who promptly helped us with the luggage.  At the Reception, we were greeted by the courteous staff who have efficiently checked us in.  We were allocated a room on the third floor, with the window partly facing High Street.  It was noisy when the housekeeping lady opened the window to air the room one day.  The days have been really hot and we had the airconditioning on; so, with the windows closed, one would not notice the hotel is actually situated on a busy street.  In fact, I quite enjoyed looking out to the bustling High Street during the day and its calmness in the early morning.

The location of the hotel is what we appreciated most.  There is a choice of public transport to choose from:  five minute walk to Kensington High Street underground station, a bus stop in front of the hotel with various bus routes to Knightsbridge and Buckingham Palace, etc. and taxi.  Kensington Garden, Hyde Park and Royal Albert Hall are just within the walking distance.  There are lots of eateries nearby if one opts to have eat outside the hotel.  There are some lovely restaurants and cafes on Kensington Church Street.  Thank you to the Concierge staff who have recommended us some good ones.  

The hotel room has a contemporary look with a comfortable king size bed.  We particularly liked the raised platform as the sitting area.  The room itself is quite spacious for a couple.  The bathroom is clean and of good size, with bathtub and a separate shower.  I understood that the hotel had gone through some refurbishment a while ago; this was one of the reasons why we picked this hotel.

Thank you for the thoughtful service by the management.  On a couple of blazing hot days, we were delivered some chilled sparkling water on our return to the hotel in the afternoon.

There are two con factors: there is no free wifi and the occasional smell of cooking in the lift lobby which faces the restaurant.  We registered to pay for the use of wifi; but, it didn't work after five minutes on the first day.  We reported it to the lady at the Business Centre.  She was apologetic and gave us one day of complimentary use.  However, the speed was quite slow, considering if we had paid for it, it would not be a satisfactory service. 

All in all, this is a five star hotel even though it does not have the grand decor and space of others in the same catergory.  The staff at the Reception and Concierge were always readily to provide us with assistance.  They are courteous and professional - an applause for a job well done.  We also thank the housekeeping team for keeping our room clean and tidy.  This is what one needs after a busy day out.

Royal Garden Hotel will definitely be our choice should we travel to London again.  Keep up the good work.",5,2013,08,06
133,First class hotel and situated well,"Hotel was clean and well run.  Lovely surroundings.
Staff very helpful and service good.
Situated close to small great restaurants, and shops and tube.
Highly recommended and look forward to staying there again.",5,2013,08,06
133,HEAVEN!!!,"We arrived at the hotel for a weekend in the capital 3-4 August 2013.  I did not expect the room to be ready as it was just after mid-day but the man on reception could not have been more helpful.  He took our bags and personally took us to our room, where we had been upgraded free of charge to a deluxe suite.In the restaurant, the staff were attentive and the food and service brilliant.  Everything was spotless and clean.  We ate out in the evening as this had been arranged but breakfast was just as good and we had a complimentary sunday newspaper.  Check out was easy - they stored our bags for us until it was time to leave.  I could not fault the hotel or its staff and would happily go there again.  HEAVEN!!!",5,2013,08,05
133,Jewel in Kensington,"I stayed at the Hotel for only one night now I wish it had been a week or more. The style, the D√©cor, location etc. contribute to this hotel being 5 star, but what truly makes it 5 star is its staff. The Staff at the Royal Garden are truly fantastic, very attentive and very professional, I not only give this hotel 5 stars but it's staff too.
I will most definitely stay at this hotel again and next time it will be for much longer.",5,2013,08,05
133,"Comfortable, quiet, and great location","I stayed for 6 nights with my two teenage boys. Executive room was spacious and quiet and comfortable. Good location next to Kensington gardens and close to underground. Short walk to good restaurants. One drawback is that there isn't much ambience- no real common areas, and restaurants not particularly appealing. And in room wifi was crazy expensive. But I still recommend it. ",5,2013,08,04
133,Good location for us.,"Check in was very quick. Room was nice, bathroom even better. No iron or board which I think is strange for a 5 star. Instant Nescaf√© coffee in the room did not suffice for me . Being such a nice hotel there should have been better choices. Maybe even a single cup Keurig in the room would be a nice idea. Bertie's bar was lovely and service impeccable. The restaurant however was lacking. We went twice and felt ""forgotten"" both times after we got our food. Even had to chase someone down to get our check. The coleslaw I received with my sandwich one day looked and tasted old. Not what I would expect for a 5 star hotel. The location however was terrific. Close to shops,restaurants and Kensington Gardens.",4,2013,08,04
133,"Good Hotel, Great Location.","Check in was quick and the staff are extremely pleasant. 
Our room was very nice, it was a bit small, however it had a raised floor section with a small office set up and two armchairs. The bed was on the lower section. It gave the feeling that you had 2 small rooms. Usual things in the room, Flat Screen TV, Wi-Fi, Fridge, Hairdryer, Toilettres, Mini Bar, Snacks(not free), tea & coffee, full length mirror. One thing missing was an ironing board & iron. I've notice that the more we pay for hotel rooms, the less chance of finding one. It would be nice when you unpack all your wrinkled clothes that you can give them a quick iron instead of having to pay someone to do it. 
The room came with a view of Kensington High street which was a bit disappointing, I would have prefered looking over the park but I expect that's a lot more expensive. If you have a lower floor at the front of the hotel you will here some street noise, and there is a fire station just around the corner so expect to be disturbed at some point if your staying for a long time.
The hotel does have its own restaurants but we were only staying bed & breakfast so didn't try them. Why in London would you want to eat in a hotel anyway? 
Breakfast is buffet style. Continental breakfast was very nice. Good selection of cereals, fruit, yoghurt and meats. Toast and coffee you order from the table. We did have one small problem with it, it didn't seem very well thought out. Two tier round table set in the middle of the dining area. Little children not being able to reach the second tier and making a mess while trying to grab things. Hot breakfast looked nice, usual things, eggs, sausage, bacon, beans and an omelette bar. 
Hotel is in a fantastic location for shops and restaurants and has great transportation links close by including buses and tubes. Car park under hotel if needed. Everything is within walking distance.",5,2013,08,01
133,Location location,"Best location in London. Just off Kensington gardens, palace and high street. Lovely hotel, very comfortable, food was amazing, service brilliant. What more can you ask for? The parking if you are lucky and there is space you can pay the porter and park outside the hotel.",5,2013,07,31
133,Unpretentious but quality,"If you HAVE to stay within ten yards of Marble Arch, don't stay here.   For any other London stay it is perfect. Great shops very near, tube, park, car park underneath with nice discount for guests, quiet and quality rooms, great beds, shower etc. not big rooms ( at least mine wasn't ) but 2/3 price of the big names and just as good.will come back",5,2013,07,31
133,lovely,"always good, lovely staff & breakfast is the best usually need a lie down afterwards, the upgrade to garden room was v nice.
20 min walk from Olympia or bus stop right outside.  We always go for the Christmas horse show.",5,2013,07,31
133,good location,Hotel is in a very good location. The room is a good size and comfortable. It is disappointing that on top of the room rates( which is not cheap) they want to charge you for WiFi. Stayed in six hotels this trip and none charge you for WiFi access. We were told that since you book through a travel agent you have to pay. This coming from a upmarket hotel?,4,2013,07,30
133,Very helpful staff and great hotel.,"We spent 4 days here while in London and enjoyed our time there. We had 4 rooms booked and everyone in our party commented on how nice it was and how helpful the staff was. It's a great location and very safe which can be important when you're traveling with family. Close to shopping, 5 minute cab ride to Harrod's and plenty of great restaurants within walking distance.",5,2013,07,29
133,Nice Hote,"Very nice hotel, well placed on Kensington High St for shops, buses, the tube etc.  Lovely room with a split level sitting room area. Large modern bathroom.  Staff on the whole friendly but Youssra Ahmidi was especially good and was very professional and helpful.

One downside, the breakfast area is close to the lifts/reception and the smell of cooking fat is overwhelming, even on the top floors.  The area where the eggs are cooked fresh has no ventilation and so the fatty smell permeates throughout - made me feel quite sickly.",4,2013,07,28
133,"Excellent hotel, great location, good service - all you expect!","I recently stayed here for a business trip and conference. The hotel met all of my expectations!

Upon checking in from an international flight, we had the opportunity for early check-in, which was awesome. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Upon entering the room, I was pleasantly surprised that even though the room was a bit small, the accommodations were upscale, clean and comfortable. The water pressure in the bathroom was very good with plenty of hot water. I could also see Kensington Palace from my window.

The hotel conference facilities are excellent, with comfortable large and small rooms available. The only complaint I had was that the hotel was not really able to handle our large group that well. The areas where we tried to eat and drink was very cramped and the staff had a bit of an issue with logistics and keeping up with our needs.

The area around the hotel is a typical High Street with plenty of shopping available of all types. Additionally, you are right next to Kensington Gardens, with great walking/running areas available for all.

Unfortunately, I did not use the restaurant facilities themselves, but the food was very good.",5,2013,07,28
133,Great concierge,"Great Concierge and Housekeeping but first you have to get past the Check In desk.  We booked two rooms at the same time last year and found our allocated rooms were on the same floor but not near each other!  It took a while for them to come up with an alternative and only one room was ready...could we wait (we have 2 nights and only one full day in London??) So we walk with our elderly mother to Kensington Palace Cafe, lunch, walk back and the second room is still not available!  Waited another short while in the lobby and yea it is ready. The checkin desk didn't direct us to the lift or the floor, I had to ask?!  Thankfully beyond the checkin desk every aspect of this hotel was excellent.  On entering the room we found them well sized, modern and with lovely and meticulously clean bathrooms.  The beds were very comfortable and the rooms well appointed.  Windows opened for fresh air onto Kensington High Street. Beyond the room... The gym was accessed through the lobby, out the front door and down a lift but it was large and well appointed.  For pilates and yoga travellers there was a studio with equipment mats, balls etc available for your own workout and there are also timetabled sessions available for a fee. Also a sauna and steam room. Breakfast included was a continental breakfast which had sufficient and satisfying variety. Both the Concierge and Housekeeping are to be commended for their very high standard of service. The Concierge was extremely good, helping obtain same day theatre tickets, arrange parcel post and airport transport. Housekeeping are extremely thorough and helpful.",4,2013,07,28
133,Best Vacation Ever,"Nothing is lacking at this hotel. It is by far one of the best places on earth. The employees are top notch and can not do enough for you. Giving us a temporary room to use because our plane landed at 6:00am and our room was not ready to helping us on a daily basis with tours, directions and great restaurants. Our room was fabulous and cleaned daily to perfection. This is the fourth time we stayed there and we will never stay anywhere else when we come to visit. The location is beautiful and safe. This makes our trip wonderful.",5,2013,07,27
133,Really Good Place to Stay,"Not much to say really, which is a good thing. Everything was as expected, polite staff, clean and quiet room, cosy bar and excellent Chinese restaurant - the Beijing duck really is amongst the best I have had anywhere.

My only criticisms would be 1) the parking arrangements (rip off NCP under the hotel with no concession for hotel guests and if you leave the car there for 24 hours and  1 minute you get charged 2 days and when you come back the clock starts from zero again); and 2) the gymnasium which you have to go out of the front of the hotel to reach and it is a little bit dingy once inside.

Apart from that our short stay was everything we needed and we would return if in the area again.",4,2013,07,26
133,Brilliant Break,"Just returned from three nights at The Royal garden, could not have wished for a more pleasant stay.
Everything was great including the room, food and helpful staff. Really great location and view of Kensington Palace from our window.
Cannot wait until our next stay.",4,2013,07,24
133,The only place to stay,"By far the best hotel in London.  The hotel is clean, modern, great location.  However the thing that separates the Royal Garden from others is the outstanding service from all staff I have encountered on my numerous visits.  From the check in to check out you are made to feel welcome, it really is a nice place to stay.",5,2013,07,22
133,My favourite hotel in the world!!,"This hotel is simply brilliant. Location, cleanliness and all of the titles above to be honest you want to give more than 5/5. I use it for business and pleasure. Just had a week there and it feels like a home from home. The best thing for me is the staff. When everyone remembers your name it does make you feel special. A lot of sports stars and show biz celebs use the Royal Garden but the staff make you feel as special as them. Can't wait to go back. Thanks again RGH!",5,2013,07,22
133,fabulous hotel,"My first choice for a hotel in central London every time. The location is perfect for me sat on the corner of the park, with lovelly suites overlooking the park and Kensington Palace. Good sized rooms and friendly staff. Very good catering, being a lazy git, room service spot on.",5,2013,07,21
133,Great City Break location.  A thoroughly enjoyable visit!,"I took my wife here for a surprise weekend treat for her birthday.  I chose the hotel as it was close to the Royal Albert Hall, which is where I had planned to go for the evening.  And I was really glad that I did.  The room was lovely with a beautiful view over Hyde Park.  The staff were extremely attentive and helpful.  We had an excellent 3 course lunch at the Park Terrace restaurant for just ¬£20 per head (although our bar bill did make it slightly more expensive!)  The staff at Bertie's Bar were excellent and really friendly.  Breakfast was amazing, we had it included in the price of our room, and we both ended up having 5 courses!  There was every kind of food you could imaging - it was very well presented.  We thought it rude not to try it all!  Bed was really comfy and the cleaning staff were also very attentive, coming home after our night out to find the mood lighting and radio on softly and water by our bed, were a really nice touch.

I think the hotel was really good value for money (especially as it is in a more luxurious part of town), and is ideal as a special weekend away treat for couples.  But it also seemed a very family friendly hotel too, so would no doubt make a good holiday base as well.",5,2013,07,21
133,Excellence,"We arrived at the hotel  too early for the room to be ready. So they will store your luggage and bring it up when the room is ready.  The hotel personal was very helpful in giving direction for trips on the train and subway.  The staff also helped us to check in for our flight home.  There was a large meeting taking place at the hotel, but they still took time to help us.  The location is near a group of embassies and close to Kensington park and palace.  Close to Hyde park also. I am afraid that the room service and maids spoiled us. So it will be hard to go home..  I was surprised at how quite it was at night since we were on Kensington street.  Also there are many small restaurants near by for breakfast and supper if you want a change from the hotel  Also the tube and various bakeries are near to the hotel.",5,2013,07,19
133,"Great location, lovely rooms","Highly recommend this property; the location is terrific.  Not within walking distance to the tourist sites such as Westminster, Buckingham Palace, etc. but it is a great neighborhood and the Kensington High Street tube stop is a quick ride to Westminster without a line change.  I just stayed here for the third time and will hopefully return on my next London trip.",5,2013,07,17
133,This place is great!,"This place is great. The location is a bit off the beaten path. Buckingham, Big Ben, Parliament, Westminster Abbey, and the London Eye are not really within walking distance. You will have to take the bus. But the bus stops right out front of the hotel.  it's about a 10 minute ride and it is a great way to see the city.  The service and cleanliness could not be better. The breakfast is overpriced but it was included in the price of the room so it was a good way to get our day started. The tube is very close and their is a Whole Foods very close which was nice since we were traveling with children and we could stop there on the way out every morning for snacks.  The WiFi is not always included. If you did not book on the hotel's website WiFi is ¬£20 per day.  Kensignton Palace is right outside your door. And there are excellent restaurants across the street.  We were 2 adults and 2 children and were very comfortable. We would definitely recommend the Royal Garden and stay their again.",5,2013,07,15
133,"Lovely hotel, excellent location","This is not a budget hotel, obviously. We booked a garden facing room (that's facing Kensington Gardens, a big park). Beautiful room, great view. Front desk service excellent, can't comment on restaurant as we did not use them. If I had the money, I would stay there again. Great location.

Only gripe - paying for Internet access, but that is common in the majority of UK hotels.",5,2013,07,15
133,Excellent,"Just stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel, London. Lovely hotel and would highly recommend. Exceptional service, particularly Massimo who worked during the breakfast. I don't have a bad word to say about this hotel, luxury throughout and the highlight being the extras in the room. defiantly will be returning to this hotel ",5,2013,07,14
133,Would go back in a second!!,"This is a fabulous hotel with wonderful amenities and friendly, helpful staff.  The one thing that drives me crazy about hotels in general is that most of them have terrible, dim lighting.  The rooms at the Royal Garden have great lighting, huge windows and are bright and comfortable.  The bathrooms are large, with Grohe faucets (only plumbers would know these are top of the line!!), heated towel racks, great towels, comfortable beds, large rooms.  Can't say enough...would definitely return.  Great location as well.",5,2013,07,12
133,OK but nothing spectacular,"I have stayed at this hotel before and it is a nice location - next to Kensington Palace and Gardens and the High Street.

The property is very well maintained and extremely clean and probably fine for a short stay - However as a very regular traveller I still find the service can be a bit off at times - I called one week before to request a room at the rear of the hotel as it is normally quieter - I spent ten minutes with the booking staff and they confirmed all would be arranged - I then arrive late one evening after a long journey to book in and am kept waiting for about ten minutes as they tell me I have been put in a room on the other side of the building??!!! So what is the point of the guest wasting their time trying to book ahead when it is clearly ignored or not actioned.

But this is the problem with the Royal Garden sometimes the service is excellent and sometimes it can be average - On evening I was partially stuck in the lift and managed to free the doors to get out and when I reported the incident all I got was a simple - ""Oh sorry Sir I will report it to our maintenance people"" Not a ""Oh dear are you OK Sir what happened - can I take some details etc?"" 

One morning I gave up waiting for a pot of tea to be delivered at breakfast and sometimes even getting simple toast delivered seems to take a very long time. In my view this would not be a problem if it were a 3 star property but it professes not to be.

I also find it very annoying that a hotel like this expects some guests to spend ¬£20 per day on the internet??!! The hotel has been saying for 2 years that it is reviewing its internet policy but still it persists with the policy- equally it offers no free biscuits in the bedroom - you are expected to buy a box. Even a good old 3 star will provide a free packet of biscuits.

Some bedrooms are also very small if you are there for an extended stay - i would advise that you check the type of room you are getting before hand. 

So my conclusion is that this is hotel where you get what you pay for and I suspect the hotel gets so much business it can shrug off complaints like the above - apart from the small apology from the receptionist no one else called to apologise for the fact that they wasted my time in trying to book my room in advance. 

They really need to up their drive on service quality and execution and be far more consistent.",3,2013,07,10
133,Excellent Visit,"Our family of three booked a ""classic"" room through Disney Vacation Club for the middle of June. We had a very nice room with two twin beds and a rollaway, having an excellent view of the south end of Kensington Gardens.  The hotel was very elegant and the staff were uniformly considerate and helpful. Room wasn't large, but was big enough for three and had all the upscale hotel amenities. Our experience in the restaurants and the main bar was also excellent, and late-night room service was outstanding. The concierge was very helpful with directions and tickets to shows. The hotel location is outstanding, in a great neighborhood with an easy walk to shops, restaurants, Kensington Palace/Gardens, and the tube. The only downside was the expense: hotel food was expensive (but very good), and WiFi and parking are breathtaking. The neighborhood has good dining alternatives. You can get complimentary WiFi depending on how you book (but not through Disney), or a rented mobile hotspot might be an option. And neighborhood parking is even more expensive than the hotel...skip the car altogether if you can.

All things considered, we thoroughly enjoyed our four days, and felt very at-home. Oh yes...Wills and Harry drove by right outside the dining room while we had buffet breakfast.",5,2013,07,09
133,Smashing Hotel,"Everything was near perfect, great staff, good room very comfortable with an excellent bed. Bar provided some smart cocktails. Breakfast brilliant as was the location. Top Dollar though ¬£25 for breakfast, ¬£300 for the room.",5,2013,07,09
133,Central for shopping and Kensington Gardens,"We stayed a week and you do need to have a room which  over  looks Kensington Gardens.  The Concierge desk were all very helpful regarding booking restaurants and directions. A central hotel for walks in the park and Kensington High Street Shopping.   The breakfasts were just about OK, definitely not free range eggs and my husbands haddock smelt very strong and fishy and was definitely not fresh.    There was no large screen for several of us who wanted to watch Wimbledon and have lunch.   The main gripe was that they have very few irons and ironing boards and when you have been travelling other wives like me want to press they husbands shirts and it appears that if someone has borrowed one then they keep in their room and there just were not enough to share around,.   They have so many staff from overseas who sadly do not have enough experience or charm for their customers.",3,2013,07,09
133,Worst staff in London ?,"Went to the big restaurant / coffee area on the weekend. It's hard to fathom how a service industry can have such poor staff, impolite & unwelcoming, totally uncoordinated and just leave you feeling you are totally unwelcome. I feel really bad for the GM and the other good front of house staff, especially the great doorman, that the restaurant staff are so consistently appalling, badly trained and have NO idea how to address customers. 

Staff training needed urgently here or time to let people move on and find something they are better suited to.",1,2013,07,04
133,Excellent location,"Have been staying at this hotel for the past few years whenever I go to London for short trips. 
Excellent and central location - there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel so I just hop on to go to Knightsbridge, Oxford Street etc. The Kensington High St tube is also a stone's throw away.  I love that it's right next to Kensington Park as I'm an avid jogger so it's great to be able to just jump out the door and go jogging in 3 minutes. 

While I was given complimentary Wi-fi, it kept going on and off and you had to log in again and if you go too near the door of the hotel, it will go off easily. There is a Chinese restaurant Min Jiang which is a branch of a Singapore Chinese restaurant that is overrated (said to be one of the best Chinese restaurants in London0 but stil decent. 

The flush system of the toilet didn't work so well this time and I had to call room service for assistance , but it did not happen before. Rooms are decent sized and if it's facing the park, you will have a lovely view. 

The major good point of this hotel is it's great location, easy for visitors to meet up with you.",4,2013,07,02
133,"Tiny rooms, not worth the money we paid.","We stayed here for one night while Wimbledon was on, not sure if we paid over the odds but given its not near Wimbledon I would hope not. The room was so small I felt claustrophobic in it, and to have to pay ¬£20 for Wi Fi is a joke. This hotel is certainly nothing special, it's pleasant but nothing more. I certainly will not stay here again. ",3,2013,07,01
133,Enjoyable stay for first time in London,"I stayed here with my mom for four nights at the end of May 2013. We had a contemporary twin room on a higher floor that overlooked Kensington High Street (unfortunately not the park, but still very nice). We very much enjoyed our stay.  The location is great and just a few blocks from the Kensington High Street tube station which we easily took to Westminster, Tower of London, etc. The hotel is also located on the no. 9 bus route which also brings you to/from the touristy areas in London.  The room itself was spacious and had a nice couch area and table so we had a place to relax after a long day walking around the city.  The bathroom was large and had a soaking tub with separate shower.  The concierge had great recommendations for dinner nearby.  If you stay here, make sure to take a walk around Kensington gardens and down embassy row right by the hotel as it was beautiful.  The only negative comment I have is that the wifi was a pain.  The hotel gives you a card with a code for free wifi for 24 hours.  But since we were there for four days it was sort of inconvenient to have to get a new passcode every day.  Other than that, everything was wonderful and I highly recommend!",5,2013,06,25
133,Two great stays at the start and end of our UK tour.,"Were collected from the airport by hotel limo. Whisked to the hotel and checked in quickly and shown to a small but adequate room. Loved the beautiful breakfasts. Close to good shopping, transport, gardens and many tourist spots. Loved our first stay there. Am thankful and impressed by the help given to forward on an article that was left behind. It was waiting at our hotel in Canterbury after our return from Paris. Our second stay was in a larger room on the 9th floor overlooking High Street. A lovely way to spend our last three nights before returning to Australia. Overall six lovely nights in a well run, beautiful, comfortable, well located hotel. Thank you to all who made our stay so enjoyable.",5,2013,06,25
133,Night out in London,"We had tickets to see Swan Lake at the Royal Albert Hall and wanted a hotel nearby to stop over in town for the night. The Royal Garden was ideally situated 15 minutes walk away from the venue (5 minutes in a taxi) at the end of Kensington High Street. Although expensive, the hotel was offering a KIng Room at a 40% discount so we booked. Right from the start, we knoew it was going to be a good experience. The lady on reception smiled broadly, welcomed us and was clearly interested in us. The room on the 6th floor was lovely, with a nice view over to the park, and with all modern amenities. We opted for dinner at the Min Jiang on the 10th floor with its spectacular views across Hyde Park to the London City skyline. Again pretty expensive, but great food and service. Swan Lake was fantastic and then it was back to the Royal Garden for a night cap before bed. Check out the next morning was not until 12 noon and so we were able to relax. Again the (different) lady at reception smiled and asked about our evening as we checked out. We can't fault this great experience and will certainly repeat it soon.",4,2013,06,24
133,One of the best places to go for afternoon tea,"Was taken for afternoon tea here by a friend. Have been to lots of the London hotels  for tea, but this was one of the best.  Park Terrace overlooks Kensington Gardens. Modern elegance with wonderful vases of orchids. Waiting staff were so friendly. Brought us over a whole tray of teas to try - and pick the one to choose with our tea. Even got a sample of one of the exotic ones (Colourful butterfly tea) to try, alongside one of the more traditional teas I picked. 

Chose the Champagne afternoon tea that came with plate of fresh strawberries in balsamic vinegar. Lovely. Sandwiches had some interesting fillings as well as traditional ones and tasted so fresh.  Jams were all homemade. Scones and cakes were yummy. 

Looking forward to next trip there!",5,2013,06,22
133,A top choice in London,"Excellent location, easy access to many restaurants and tube station.  Extremely comfortable bed, great shower, helpful staff, quiet rooms.  Even the elevators are quick and efficient.  You can be in your room within a minute of entering the hotel.  I've stayed twice and would love to stay again.",5,2013,06,20
133,Pity about the wifi,"I have stayed at this hotel on several occasions because of the great location next to Hyde Park and the ambience of the rooms and general level of service.  The Concierge desk is excellent for advice.
I have however been annoyed at being asked to pay GBP20 per day for wifi.  I believe that wifi in a Hotel of this standard should be free.  I booked through booking.com and was informed at registration that if I had booked through their own website the wifi would have been free. I checked the fine print and it was there so mea culpa but really shouldn't wifi be free under all circumstances in a hotel of this calibre?",4,2013,06,19
133,"Good Hotel, Great Location","Considering the cost of the hotel and the fact that it has a five star rating, we were expecting a bit more in the customer service department. Wireless was not included (twenty pounds a day) which was a deal breaker for us - We probably wouldn't return to this hotel for this sole reason. We stayed 6 nights and ended up using the free wifi at the Starbucks across the street or at the Whole Foods a block away. Besides this inconvenience and the fact that the hotel staff wouldn't budge at all, the hotel was clean and in a great location.",4,2013,06,17
133,Top of the line,"Location, service, facilities, restaurant, cleanliness - no matter which angle you choose to look at this hotel, it earns top marks. Yes, it is expensive. And yes, the driveway is a bit cramped. But then again, given that a square inch of London real estate in this neighborhood costs a fortune, this hotel choose the right priorities.
Stayed there for three nights during a recent business trip to The City, and couldn't have chosen a better place to stay. Service is very attentive and proactive. To an American, the personnel may not always appear the most friendly; but there is European reservedness at play here: they are extremely polite, do everything they can to help you, and stay out of your way otherwise. this is the way it's supposed to be. 

Rooms were modern and hyper-clean. And for a city-center hotel even relatively spacious. 

The only two small gripes I ever encountered: the wireless internet service was inconsistent (signal strength too weak at some times of the day, public Internet bandwidth insufficient at others); and the amenity material in the bathrooms (shower gel) were really hard to open with wet hands. Other than that, this place is perfect!

I also checked out the top-floor restaurant (top notch!), but will cover that in a separate review.",5,2013,06,13
133,Simply Great,"My wife and I enjoyed 7 nights in May at the Royal Garden Hotel.   It was a return visit based on a great experience during our first visit.  The location, as others have noted, is great with proximity to many attractions.  The distinguishing trait of this hotel is the staff.  Everyone with whom we interacted was friendly and helpful.  In particular, Alex, Luton and Gabor set the bar very high for customer service.  Do enjoy dim sum on a sunday afternoon overlooking Hyde Park from their 10th floor restaurant, Min Jiang  The Royal Garden Hotel has been our best hotel experience in quite some time.  ",5,2013,06,12
133,Always the best in town,"My wife and I always try and stay at the Royal Garden Hotel when visiting the amazing Min Jiang Restaurant on the 10 floor of he hotel.( See my separate review on this amazing traditional Chinese reasturant where the views of London and Kensington gardens are a perfect setting for the without a doubt the best Chinese food in London & the world!)
Nothing  is better than dining on the 10th floor of this hotel after a day out in the city and then slip back to the fabulous rooms in the Royal garden hotel.
Everything here is perfect from the moment one arrives to check out faultless in everyway.
The room service garden terrace reasturant for lunch accompanied by a pianist.
Cocktails in the bar. 
If your in town make sure you check in.
See you at the bar or in the Hotel's 10th-floor dining room for Beijing duck Yummy!",5,2013,06,10
133,"Position, Position, Position + the Human Factor","Christmas and New Year in London! What a fantastic place to celebrate the Festive Season - and where better to stay than at the Royal Garden Hotel on Kensington High Street. We recently spent three weeks (2012 / 2013) at the Royal Garden Hotel thoroughly enjoying all the ""Buzz and Excitement"" of the activities that London has to offer at this time of the year. This was our third time at the Royal Garden Hotel having previously spent a week here in 2011and 2010 at the conclusion of our vacation from Australia cruising the Mediterranean with Silverseas Cruise Line.

The warm welcome we received on arrival was just a taste of wonderful times to come. Throughout our stay all the staff were most helpful, very polite and could not do enough to ensure that we had a most enjoyable time at their hotel :-special mentions to Business Centre Staff who assisted my wife in keeping in contact (via Email) with family back home over Christmas / New Year - House Keeping Staff who  kept our room in immaculate condition during our stay - Marketing Staff who kept surprising us with delightful Christmas / New Year treats - Food and Beverage Staff for providing such excellent service and tasty food in the superb dining facilities - Concierge Team (Luton, Gregg & John) who always went the extra mile in organising tours, theatre tickets, transportation and information on ""what to do"" and ""how to do it"" (a special vote o fthanks). The ""Human Factor"" plays a critical role in providing outstanding service to hotel guests and in our opinion Royal Gartden's staff truly exceeds customer expectations ( which is why we keep coming back to stay at the Royal Garden Hotel).

Our Garden View Room was comfortable with modern facilities - both warm, welcoming and relaxing to return to after busy sightseeing activities. Comfortable beds and a quiet room made for restful nights. Hotel public areas are all first rate- dining facilities are excellent - we thoroughly enjoyed our English Christmas Dinner and the New Year's celebrations in fine dining (Asian style) Min Jiang restaurant + a great view of London's New Year fireworks. We also enjoyed their High Tea on a number of accasions - in addition Berties Bar is a great drinking venue.  

Location of the Hotel is so convenient - numerous Buses stop right outside the Hotel and take you to all key London locations. A short walk from the Hotel has you at Kensington High Street Tube Station and this excellent rail service transports you speedily anywhere you mey wish to go in London. Central Kensington with its shops,department srores, Palace,restaurants,and pubs surround the Hotel and not far away is Harrods - no doubt about it Royal Garden Hotel has it all as far as Position, Position, Position!

So after our third stay, Royal Garden Hotel and Staff continue to not only exceed our expectations but truly delights us as customers. 
           .",5,2013,06,08
133,property right on the park,"Stayed here three nights in a King room not a garden view but a high floor view down Kensigton High Street- hotel public areas are all first rate, perfectly mantained and service is superior to most.  

Big king bed domintae dteh room with silky linens and a mattrees that coddled us.  The room is divided by a small step that elevates the desk and sofa area from the bedded area.  Flat panel tv built into the wall and closet with sliding door next to the bed plus lots of mirrors made the room seem modern, elegant and even larger than it was.  Windows opened to let in fresh air and a ton of noise from the busy High Street below.

Bath has a huge soaking tub and small  individual shower with rain head / hand held shower wand that was polished and easy to operate.  Big fluffy 5 star towels were kept warm by the heat rack.

Did not use the gym as the weather this week was incredible so we took runs in the park each day.   Convienent to the tube to get to West End and attractions, area full with great restaurants and shops.  Concierge team was very helpful.  Restaurant on the first floor was perfect for lunch and breakfast, did not have time to visit the signature Chinese restaurant on the top floor.  

Service was highlighted by returning two shirts and a suit pressed perfectly in less than an hour, they even replaced a button!",5,2013,06,07
133,Anniversary Bliss,"We recently spent seven nights at The Royal Garden to celebrate our 29th wedding anniversary. Alex, the Guest Relations Manager handled our check in and made our welcome so special.  From the champagne and beautiful fruit to the perfect room on the 9th floor, we felt like royalty.  The English Breakfast that was included with our room was a very nice surprise.  Our favorite waiter, Gabor, made us feel so special.  We quickly learned to ask for one of Gabor's tables.  It was a delight to start our day on such a positive note.  The room and bathroom were very comfortable and modern.  Our room looked onto Kensington High Street with a very nice view.  The Concierge team, especially Luton Anderson, who booked our airport pick-up and Joseph, who was always friendly and helpful were wonderful.  They assisted us on using the bus and tube systems and recommended a great Italian restaurant, Il Portico in Kensington.   We will look forward to staying there again in the Spring of 2014.",5,2013,06,06
133,THIS AWARD WINNING LUXURY HOTEL HAS A BIG HEART,"This is why the Royal Garden Hotel deserves our loyalty -

Besides the location and quality of service, this award winning luxury hotel has a BIG HEART, displayed recently by 3 examples - special kindnesses to both staff and guests in particular need and a well deserved and very distinguished award to the general manager that marks his keen interest in the local community.

As with any business, such success starts at the top - with the long-term private owners treating their staff as a family, many of whom are very, very long-serving, from the general manager, his deputy and the head chef, to restaurant waitresses.

How wonderful it is to be met with so many cheerful welcomes and we know they are genuine when even a room maid goes out of her way to say it is lovely to see you back again.",5,2013,06,04
133,Royal treat,"I recently spent the weekend at The Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington. This was my first visit and it was an absolute delight. Ideally situated in the heart of Kensington it is an ideal location if you are visiting London. Kensington High Street and Gloucester Road tube stations are within easy walking distances and the restaurants close by are in abundance, particularly in Gloucester Road. The room was very modern and comfortable and I was very impressed with the entire hotel. The staff were outstanding and the concierge staff were the best I have experienced in a long time. If you are into shopping it is a 5 min cab ride to the best shopping mall in the world, Westfields. Kensington Gardens is right next door and a run in the park every morning made this trip even more special.
If you are going to be in London this is the hotel.",5,2013,05,31
133,Fantastic Hotel,"Recently stayed here for a 1 night stay at the beginning of May. The room was excellent (Queen Room) with a terrific view over Kensington. 

Check in was easy and the bar was really nice and friendly helpful staff on hand to help your every need.

The location is terrific for Nottinghill which is a short walk away. I will be coming back to London in July and I am ready to make this hotel my destination once again.",5,2013,05,28
133,Excellent stay!,"We stayed only one night but it was fabulous, staff patient and sweet, even when we descended very late for breakfast they were fautlessely careful to make sure we had everything we needed. Great room and super bathroom, we slept like two snoring logs!",5,2013,05,28
133,Very good quality hotel,Stayed here for three nights on a great Travelzoo deal. The hotel room was spacious with a good bathroom. Staff were very attentive and helpful. Bus stop is directly outside and train station just a short walk. After a big day shopping it was nice just to sit and enjoy Kensington Gardens which is right alongside.,4,2013,05,27
133,"Great Hotel, Great Staff",We chose to spend our Ruby Wedding Anniversary weekend at this hotel and we were not disappointed. We were allocated a beautiful room on the 10th floor with views over the London skyline. The room was terrific and Alex and his staff really pulled all the stops out to make our special weekend special. The concierge even lent me his cufflinks for our restaurant as I had left mine at home.  Great location and next to Kensington gardens for a pleasant walk and the Bus stops right outside taking you into the West End. Will definately stay there again.,5,2013,05,27
133,Superb Hotel,"Stayed here for just two nights but enjoyed every minute of our time at the Royal Garden.  Our room (1016) was situated on the tenth floor and offered fantastic views towards Battersea. The room itself was well appointed and spacious with a lovely bathroom which incorporated a walk-in shower which was just what the doctor ordered after a day's sightseeing.
We had continental breakfast which was extremely good and the staff coped well despite being very busy and they were friendly and always helpful.",5,2013,05,26
133,Could be very good!,"All in all the rooms were very good but the service was very inconsistent!

1. One of our rooms was not even ready at 4 PM when they should be ready at 2 PM.
2. One of our rooms were not cleaned properly, toe nails on the floor!!! We got a new room.
3. The corridors on first and second floor smells of food in a very bad way.
4. A lot of smell of cigarette smoke goes through the ventilation making it not very comfortable for my wife having asthma. (this was on the 9th floor)
5. Both of our rooms were not cleaned the same way once, a couple of times we had to tell the cleaning staff to clean the room again.
6. Yawning staff at the reception is not a good thing, not ever. Not very nice to be greeted with a yawn.",3,2013,05,26
133,"Great spot, tiny rooms",Well located on high st and adjacent to Kensington Gardens and easy to navigate London with an underground station metres away. The room I was given looked over the gardens at the rear of the building but was about as small as you come across anywhere. The conference facilities downstairs were nice and the food was good. The hotel breakfast was basic but did the job. 20 GBP for wifi and extraordinary minibar prices were ridiculous. Wouldn't stay again.,3,2013,05,26
133,"Great location, room and deal","We booked rooms for a number of nights on a business trip. The hotel was running a promotion, so the room was an excellent deal.  The hotel is centrally located and right on the Park.  The king room was very large and modern with a spacious bathroom. I stayed on the third floor and did not notice any noise whatsoever, from other guests or the street. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2013,05,21
133,Could do better,"Quite an experience, but disappointed with the room which overlooked Kensington High Street and although on the 6th floor found the traffic noises and police sirens in the early hours caused a couple of restless nights.
Good value for money at half the normal nightly rate, and was surprised that a hotel of this quality did not provide (half milk) as standard, but did supply it on request.
must applaud the staff who were most helpful in all respects.",3,2013,05,17
133,posh neighbourhood for a posh price,"Beautiful located in a posh neighbourhood for a posh price. Was there for a conference. Great beds and a perfect shower. Be careful with eating from the minibar. 6,95 pounds for 20 cashew nuts? And the egs during breakfast were not included in the room rate either which I found odd",3,2013,05,17
133,Dont choose the 9th floor,"I was so disappointed as my room was exactly underneath the restaurant that has a cleaning service taking place overnight, keeping me up ofcourse with all their noise, and the hotel staff couldnt do anything about it. the rooms are decent, but in 2013, i expect much more from a 5 star hotel. I didnt get the rest i needed from staying at this hotel. The location on the other hand is great, and the view overlooking hyde park is nice.",1,2013,05,17

133,Great hotel with Great Staff,"Our family had the pleasure of staying one night at the Royal Garden.  We loved this hotel.  Rooms were amazing, clean and well appointed.  Loved the radiant heat on the bathroom floor!  All of the staff were top notch.  The location is wonderful and we loved walking into Notting Hill.  If in London, don't hesitate to stay here.  Our only regret is that our stay was too short.  We'll be back.",5,2013,05,14
133,Beware Expedia customers,"This hotel was highly recommended on Expedia, and although it was extremely expensive (about $350 CDN per night!!!), we decided the ""stay the third night free"" would be worth it. The rooms were quite small, with skinny twin beds. Our view, as Expedia customers, was of the building across the street. The other three views were of Kensington Gardens, Kensington Palace or the beautiful cathedral, so we were given the worst side. The bathroom was nice, except there was only one towel per person in the bathroom, and the shampoos, etc. were not replaced the second day, they were just removed from the shower and put back on the tray by the sink. Non of this was a big deal, until it came time to send and email to my cousin that we had arrived safely and found there was no wireless. The lady at the front desk said that it is because we booked through Expedia - their own clients get free wireless but we had to pay. It was 20 pounds per 24 hours, which would have been $100 CND for our stay. There was no shuttle to and from the train station or airport. I felt that we had made a big mistake by staying there, and would never recommend it. Maybe my expectations were too high, but hotel along the way, where we paid 1/3 of the price, were superior in every way.",2,2013,05,13
133,Excellent Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for one night. The staff were very helpful. polite & courteous. The only negative was that my booking stated the check in time was 2pm. On arrival the staff informed me it was from 2pm & my room was not ready however they stored our luggage & promised to ring me when the room was ready.  A call was received later as promised.

Great views over the park from our 6th floor room. The decor was very nice, room was very clean.
Great location for shopping, tube & local restaurants. The bar staff in Berties bar were very jolly & certainly made us laugh. Breakfast the next morning was huge.",5,2013,05,13
133,Best hotel I have stayed in,"Booked hotel for one night midweek for graduation.  Was easy to find on Kensington High Street, with car park situated below hotel.  Spiralling ramp access to car park was tricky but location was convenient...¬£22 for 24hours parking was a good price.

On arrival we were upgraded...the room was amazing. Very clean, spacious and fresh, amazing view over Kensington Palace Gardens, would recommend room 815. We received a complimentary fruit platter and bottled water.

The bathroom was bright and clean with complimentary slippers, bathrobes and toiletries. Safe, fridge, tea/coffee, kettle, TV and minibar also provided plus plenty of wardrobe space.

All staff were polite and friendly. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone wanting a relaxing and enjoyable stay in central London. Kensington High Street shops and underground station on your doorstep plus Kensington Palace Gardens and Hyde Park.",5,2013,05,12
133,Very nice hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for just one night en route from Cambridge to US in order to catch an early flight from Heathrew. I booked it by accident, but turned out to be a surprise. It is located in a very nice area, with plenty of shops, bars and restaurants. It is right next to the Kensington Park. It is 5 minutes walk to the subway station to go anywhere in the city. The staff iss friendly and helpful. The room is nice and comfortable, with a large flat screen TV. There is a charge to use the internet (I would say GBP12, but I don't remember exactly. It was not cheap though). Overall, it is a great hotel, and I will come back again.",5,2013,05,10
133,Great location and great staff,"Stayed over the Bank Holiday weekend on a Travelzoo deal--and great value it was too for a 5* hotel in the heart of Kensington. So let me get the gripe over with. We were a couple of hours early in arriving which was not a problem for the reception staff but the first room we were offered was a smoking room- not for us. I thought these rooms had vanished for ever! The next room was room 130 which was fine in all internal respects although the immediate view of the arrival canopy was probably not the best in the hotel! The problem arose on both nights at 3:30 am with the emptying of the adjacent nightclub by screaming revellers which on the second night brought the ambulance and police sirens. I emphasise this is not a fault with the hotel management-just a warning to avoid lower rooms overlooking the high st.
Well now that the whinge is over everything else about the hotel was excellent. The service of all the staff, without exception, was exemplary in terms of professionalism and friendliness. The food in the Park restaurant was excellent at breakfast, lunch and dinner whilst the view from the top floor chinese restaurant Min Jiang is one of the best in London--overlooking the park with long views to the London Eye, Shard etc. You don't have to eat in the restaurant to enjoy the view-just pop into the adjacent bar for a cocktail or two!.-At ¬£9-¬£12 a drink they are certainly not the priciest cocktails in London.
The location is great-Tube station is only a couple of hundred yards away and there are dozens of local pubs and restaurants within 5 mins walk.
Would return to the hotel in a shot but as a non corporate account holder I'll probably have to keep an eye on the offers.!!",5,2013,05,08
133,"Great hotel, great location","A very nice hotel, 5* indeed, our room was  a good size with great views over Kensington Gardens. Staff as you would expect were very helpful, breakfast was very good, almost too much. Situated on Kensington High Street, a great location, handy for shopping and getting around, bus, tube, taxi, and of course bikes, yes I used them all. All in all a very good hotel and a very good location.",5,2013,05,07
133,Great Hotel and Location in London,"We stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington over the Christmas weekend.  We had two rooms to accommodate our family of two adults and two children, ages 10 and 8.  The hotel was modern and beautiful.  The breakfast was excellent; it included a variety of sausages, freshly scrambled eggs, a made to order omelette station and pancake station.  The hotel restaurant was a nice option is you chose to stay in and they had a great chinese restaurant at the top of the hotel.  The concierge service was excellent and they provided valuable information regarding show times and made dinner recommendations and reservations for us to make our theater time.  Their mince pies are definitely worth the stay alone.  The hotel's prime location adjacent to Kensington Gardens and within walking distance to the Natural History Museum and other great attractions makes this a worthwhile reservation.",5,2013,05,07
133,Fantastic service....,"I have visited this hotel twice now in the last 4 mths and on both occasions its been fantastic, from the reservation team all the way through. The hotel is very clean. The concierge team are fantastic. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,05,07
133,Something for Everyone,"We often stay  in London, Mainly in central London around the theatre area. So having booked a concert at the Albert Hall, it was nice to explore a different part of the City. This hotel is placed in a unique situation facing Kensington Gardens and all that goes with that. and direct access to Kensington High St. with its wonderfull array of shops & resturants. The Hotel offers a very high standard of service & cleanliness. We were offered an upgrade to a garden view for an extra ¬£60.00 but declined as it was a short stay for us, but we were given a fabulous room on the top floor with an outlook of the London skyline. Rooms & Bathrooms were modern with really comfortable beds & beautifull crisp bed linen. + a well stocked mini bar. I would have liked a coffee making facility in the room and maybe if we had asked it might have been available. Breakfast was included in our room rate. something that sadly is now lacking in most London Hotels. It could not be faulted as everything one might want to eat was provided  (In abundance) We would not hesitate to use again or recommend this hotel.
Looking forward to the next time.",5,2013,05,07
133,"Amazing Property, even more Amazing Location!","A group of us (travel agents) were hosted at this hotel for a couple of nights in April.
Wow.  What a fabulous property it is.  Great for business travellers and leisure travellers alike.  Rooms, hallways, common areas all kept immaculately clean, updated and modern.  Bathrooms in rooms were gorgeous -- plenty of space, and lovely, long soaker tub.  Our room had separate shower cubicle, which was a nice touch.  Rooms either face over Hyde Park, (and if you're lucky, Kensington Palace) or Kensington High Street.  Either view is appealing, in it's own respective right.  The breakfast room, over looking the park, was bright, airy, and very attractive. The food (both a la carte and buffet) was top notch.  Service - from all levels of staff - was also very discerning.   The property itself has a kind of laid back corporate feel.  Although reasonably ""high end"", it didn't feel stuffy or snooty in anyway.
I'd highly recommend this hotel -- and I know the staff will do their utmost to accommodate you in any way possible.
In short: Stay Here!",5,2013,05,06
133,Would Go Back Again,"Great hotel and great location. The staff was respectful and courteous, and we would go back again. Comfortable rooms, great neighborhood for walking and shopping. Adjacent to Kensington Palace and Gardens and Hyde Park. The palace and park views are recommended.
It's Britain, so getting a good cup of coffee is another matter, but afternoon tea is a treat. Get on the mailing list, and you will enjoy man specials.",5,2013,05,05
133,Pricey but good,"Nice hotel that is centrally located. Easy to get around on buses or the tube. It is right next to the Kensington gardens which extends into Hyde Park. Rooms are a little on the small side, but large by London standards. Staff were courteous and efficient. There are a lot of shops and reasonably good and priced restaurants around. Overall a good hotel, though a little on the expensive side, as in keeping to all other London hotels. I would dig deep and stay there again.",4,2013,05,03
133,Not recommended for regular visits,"I have stayed several times in this hotel, great location, nice and clean room and bathroom. Negative - there is no ""personal touch "", the hotel management does not pay attention on the clients who choose this hotel to stay in London. It's good to stay once, if you are coming regulary to London - take another hotel.",4,2013,05,03
133,"Great location, good service","This hotel is located almost perfectly: the nearest underground station is less than 5 minutes walk, and the central London landmarks, should you chose to explore the city by foot, are within 30 minutes walk. 
The rooms are rather small (I was in queen room), but they almost always are in any big city in Europe. I personally never find the room size too important since I never stay too long in the room and I usually travel with one medium size suitcase. However, the room is equipped with everything that one might need during the stay (bathrobe and slippers included). The room and bathroom were well maintained and the towels were changed daily. The bed was spacious!
Despite being on a very busy street, there is no noise in the rooms even if your room faces the street. What I really liked about this hotel is that you actually could (partially) open your windows and let some fresh air in and not breathe the air conditioned air during the entire stay.
There were two minor issues that I found rather unsuitable for a hotel of this rank. The first one is that there was some space left between the room doors and the frame, so you could clearly see the light outlining the door during the night. This is not a problem by itself since the position of the bed in the room is such that extra light from the hall would not disturb your sleep. Noises, however, either made by other guests returning in the evening, or the room service in the morning, might. I was waken up a few times. I have checked with my friend that occupied another room down the corridor and his doors were OK, so there might be something about individual rooms. 
The second issue is the difference in approach by two different concierges to the same issue. I have forgotten my Nokia charger and, since my battery was almost empty the day I have arrived, I asked the concierge whether they had a charger for my cell. The concierge that was on duty at that moment bought it to my room within minutes. I have returned the charger a few hours later, as soon as I was done. A few days later, I asked for the charger again in the evening and I was told that I cannot have one, but that my cell can be charged at their desk overnight. I declined since I do not wish to leave my cell and all its contents in the hands of the complete strangers so I had to buy a charger at the airport the following morning and charge it in one of the airport cafeterias before my flight.",4,2013,05,03
133,"Great location, Great deal with TravelZoo","Stayed at this hotel on a TravelZoo deal for a steal at ¬£150 including Full Breakfast for 2 persons (breakfast alone is normally ¬£25 per person!). The location of the hotel is excellent for shopping and Knightsbridge is just a 10 minute number 10 bus journey from the hotel front door. The hotel is directly next to Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace, we had a walk through the park on Sunday morning and we spotted HRH Duke of Kent casually walking his dogs through the Park, quite surreal to see.. At the hotel we were allocated a fantastic King Bedded room on the 5th floor (#540) overlooking the Park, Park view rooms are highly recommended. We also had a fantastic meal in the Park Terrace restaurant, the service and quality of food was excellent. If we can get a similar deal again we will definitely return to this hotel on our next trip to London.",5,2013,05,01
133,Nice hotel at affordable price,"We were attracted to this hotel by a deal on travelzoo for ¬£150 B&B, which represents great value.  As non smokers it was initially disappointing to be allocated a smoking room (I didn't realise these still existed).  The corridor in particular had a very pungent smoke smell and the room too, although to a lesser degree.  After a long tiring day we didn't feel motivated enough to ask for a room change. The saving grace was the lovely view overlooking Kensington Park and at least the window opened to let in some fresh air. Room was adequately sized with separate seating area and nicely furnished.  Bathroom and shower cubicle in particular was impressive.  We had pre dinner cocktails in Berties Bar. Tad expensive but not unexpectedly so (¬£17.70 for a Bloody Mary and a Cosmopolitan). It's fair to say we'd enjoyed better cocktails at Ball's Brothers earlier in the day.   Dinner in the Park Terrace Restaurant was very nice.  Food was good and delightfully presented.  2 courses plus wine left change out of ¬£100 so, in our view, reasonably priced. I should say the staff at this hotel clearly pride themselves on service.  Everyone we encountered was polite, friendly and efficient.  We'll definitely check out rates for this hotel next time we're in London.",4,2013,04,30
133,outstanding service,"Outstanding service and very well located just next to Hyde park. Perfect for joggers ;) Also well located fo shopping and a vast choice of restaurants close to it. No too far from Notting Hill (15min foot). Overall the service was perfect: reception, room service, restaurant, concierge... just flawless. Amazing breakfast where I did not miss one thing. (maybe a little expensive for continental breakfast). I must though remove one point out of five as I expect such high class hotels to include some essential things in  their price i.e. water and Internet access, for which I had to pay extra. In much cheaper hotels those are for free. I take this point out as  a principle. May stay was very good and I recommend this place.",4,2013,04,29
133,Value for your money,"We stayed several times in  this hotel over the past year. It is very well located. The rooms are  not so big, but they are clean.  Rooms on the street side are too noisy. Ask for room overlooking the garden or mews. Reception is helpful when you need information.  We always got a good price, not more than GBP 300.00, and that is exactly what it is worth!",3,2013,04,26
133,Welcoming,"We had a package delivered to the hotel before our arrival and when we arrived, the package was delivered to our room along with our luggage.  Great service!
This is a wonderful hotel, our room overlooks Hyde Park and we can open the windows and get fresh air into the room.
The room is large with an adjoining office/living room, so plenty of space to make ourselves at home.",5,2013,04,25
133,bad quality for such high price,"For a price of 310¬£
 - The romms are very small
- The air conditioning make noise
- you have to wait to long at 11 pm to have you room

You do not have the value for the money
A reasaonble proce for Londo for such Hotel should be in teh range of 150¬£",2,2013,04,24
133,Royal Garden Hotel - conference visit,"It isn't pretty from the outside, but this is a lovely hotel with excellent conference facilities, delicious food and extremely friendly and helpful staff.It's in an excellent location right next to Kensington Gardens.",5,2013,04,23
133,Excellent base for a city break,"A very good standard of 5 star hotel.  We travelled as a couple with an elderly parent.  Hotel location is excellent, right next to Hyde Park and a 2 minute walk from the nearest underground.  Staff were all very helpful and attentive, especially in the upstairs bar, where they served delicious cocktails and snacks. Rooms were very clean and modern, with slippers and bath robes in all.  Our Contemporary King room was spacious with a separate seating area and the bathroom luxurious with large bath and separate shower.  Toiletries were not replaced daily, however.  The single occupancy Queen room, although clean and of a similar high standard, was quite small and could really only have accommodated a single person.  Complimentary newspapers are delivered every day.  Although our room wasn't near the lifts, we could still hear them during the night.  The only downside to this hotel was breakfast, which we only had on the first of our four day stay.  At ¬£20 (continental) or ¬£25 (cooked), it was most definitely not worth the money.  A poor continental buffet unworthy of a 5 star hotel and the only poor service we received during our stay. There are plently of lovely bistros nearby serving great breakfasts at a fraction of the price.  I would definitely stay at the Royal Garden again, without breakfast!",4,2013,04,22
133,"Lovely hotel, but wish our room was really ""smoke-free""!","We booked at the Royal Garden because our tour company (Back Roads Tours) picked us up in front of the hotel. We were very pleased with the room we were given on our first one- night stay prior to our tour, but the second time(post tour), our room, although lovely, and booked as smoke -free, was next to a room that obviously allowed smoking. It might not have been so bad if the room was not adjoining(with a door between), but as it was ,we smelled cigarettes all  night, and it was difficult to sleep. We would have asked for another room, but by the time the smoking started, we were already in bed, and moving was not practical. I think if you'll be next to a smoking room, management should inform you, especially if there is a door between rooms. Personally, I  don't think smoking rooms should be on the same floor as non-smoking rooms.",3,2013,04,22
133,Nice,"Good location and friendly staff specialy the concierge with great recommendation of restaurants and attractions ,  rooms are very spacious and breakfast was delightful with great helpful staff, would definitely recommend this hotel again.",3,2013,04,21
133,A warm welcome,"We arrived back from London today after a visit for business and leisure and feel we must share the experience of our excellent stay at this hotel. Our park suite was faultless for cleanliness, room service, housekeeping and comfort. The High street shops are endless with a very convenient supermarket for extras you may need. The bus stops are right outside the front exit for travel all over London and the tube a five minute walk. We found the staff were very quick to acknowledge you wherever you happened to be in the hotel. It is extremely quiet in the upstairs accommodation and heavy drapes keep out the sun in the mornings. (Yes, we did get a couple of sunny days). Our view over Kensington gardens was beautiful.
Finally our big thanks to Gregg at concierge for all his fantastic guidance,enthusiasm and professionalism to us. Thanks Gregg. A wonderful few days in London and would thoroughly recommend this hotel. We will definitely return.",4,2013,04,19
133,"Fantastic, very child friendly, superb!","We stayed for 5 nights in a king room with our 18 month old son. Obviously we were nervous regarding what exactly the hotel would be like, but I can honestly say it is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.

1. Location. Easy access to exhibition road, and obviously Hyde park! Especially with kids, you will have no epic walks to get to interesting places. 
Also there is parking under the hotel, so just pull up and hand over your keys.

2. Staff. From the minute we arrived nothing was too much trouble. Staff were friendly, welcoming, not a touch of arrogance, and service in the restaurants was again complete quality

3. Food. We ate at both restaurants and had room service. I simply cannot fault it. Perfectly cooked food. The park terrace was especially good with kids. A good child menu, high chairs and attentive staff.

4. Room. We had a king room with a mews aspect on a high floor. It was clean, spacious and quiet. A travel cot was provided which was in great condition.

5. Value. It's a 5* hotel so you pay for that, but the quality is also 5*, so personally I had no issue with value. I don't think you will find a much cheaper 5* hotel in the same vicinity and the food is actually perfectly reasonable for the quality you get.

I could go on, but you probably get it! We only wish we could have stayed longer, and intend to return later this year if possible. I probably wouldn't even look at another hotel in this area. When googling 'best hotels in London with kids' this one didn't come up - it should!!!! 

As if it needed any more, on our last night Jimmy Page, was outside chatting with someone (apparently its used by music execs a lot).

From us it was 100%",5,2013,04,18
133,Perfect location and well maintained property,"I have stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel for business and found this property perfectly located on Kensington high street. You will find many shopping options around and very good restaurants nearby. The room I had was very well maintained, facing the street, with a small living room area. Breakfast service is good, with nice offer of fresh fruits. Kensington park is just in the corner which is a plus if you love to go jogging like I do before or after a long working day. Maybe the reception can be a little more client oriented by paying more attention to the clients while in the lobby, especially during the afternoon and night shift, but the all staff in general was very kind and helpful.",4,2013,04,17
133,Kensington Friendly,"Very nice hotel right next to Kensington Palace with views of the Park from the excellent Chinese restaurant on the 10th Floor
A Singaporean Hotel so has many guests from Asia and Arabia
Rooms, as you would expect are comfortable and the location is ideal for Ken High St or Harrods a bus ride away. The Park is lovely to walk in and a visit to Kensington Palace and the Albert Hall and memorial is a must.",4,2013,04,15
133,One flaw...,"Stayed in a lovely suite overlooking Kensington Gardens and the skyline of London. Excellent room with every convenience.  Decor minimalist but high quality.  Service exemplary.

One flaw though...the mattress in our room was awful.  I was told the hotel had been totally refurbished very recently so why our mattress was dipping and provided no support was a mystery. So I looked at the label on the mattress and found it advertised on the internet - it costs ¬£300 for a super-king size.  Why a hotel would put a cheap and nasty mattress into a room costing ¬£500 a night is disturbing.",4,2013,04,14
133,Great Place for a meal,"We ate a pre theatre meal before going to the Royal Albert Hall for a show.The staff were very friendly and attentive and the 2 course dinner was excellent.
We would certainly return next time we are going to a show.
The food was excellent and the breads were lovely and a nice glass of wine was included in the price,we felt the meal was good value for money,and had some lovely handmade cookies with our coffees.",5,2013,04,14
133,Great location!,We traveled to London for a quick three day stop.  The hotel is in a fantastic location with buses and subway very close.  Take the number 10 bus to and from Regent and Oxford Street for great shopping.  Easy to find hotel from subway as well.  Our double room was quite small but comfortable.  The only negative aspect of our stay was the price of internet .... 20¬£ per day ... what's up with that?  There is a Starbucks located across the street where wifi is no charge.  Great restaurants not far from hotel as well.  Overall good stay because of location!  Enjoy!,3,2013,04,14
133,"Great stay, definitely get the breakfast!","I booked this hotel for my boyfriends birthday, through his work we get to stay in nice hotels quite regularly, so this needed to be special. I had done my research and booked through a deal. 
On approach to the hotel, I was slightly underwhelmed by the building, but once inside, you forget about this.
We had the luxury Kingsize room which was lovely. Quite underwhelming again, it was a fairly standard room. But all of the special features worked (surround sound all throughout, the tv, the audio player). 
The staff were very helpful and it was a very comfy bed. 
The highlight of the trip was most certainly the food. We had gone to the comedy store which meant that we didn‚Äôt get in until 2.30am, as we had had a jam packed day, this was the earliest opportunity to have dinner, even at this time, the room service order was absolutely delightful. 
The breakfast was incredibly luxurious, it was abundance was key, having a full range of choice from fruit, cooked, baked and anything you could possibly imagine. 

The hotel was in a great location, we made use of the central links and the local museums. A taxi from harrods was very reasonable.

I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2013,04,11
133,Excellent hotel,"The Royal Garden Hotel is fantastic, situated next to Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park. We stayed because we found a great deal on Travelzoo but would go back and pay full price. Bed was extremely comfortable and breakfast was excellent - lots of choice and great quality. Great place to spend a night after a busy day in the City.",5,2013,04,11
133,A real let-down,"My wife and I have stayed here a couple of times, and always been happy, but I realise now that this is a hotel that deals with the average. If you want anything slightly more than that, they aren't geared up for it. This time we had booked to come with our  2 year old. On booking, I'd payed extra for an executive room, with a specific partition in the room so that we could have a cot out of sight of our bed. We had also booked a 'proper' cot, not a travel cot.
On arrival, the room had no partition. When I complained they said there was nothing they could do. The manageress tried to say it wasn't their problem, that it was still an executive room. She was brusque and kept saying 'I'm off in 10 minutes, can you deal with the next duty manager?' Eventually after much aggro, I asked and got 20% off, plus late check out and some beer?! She then turned rudely away and stormed off. 
Next thing....it was a travel cot, not a proper one, with a massive lump in the middle, and one side flapping down. It took an hour to get another one (by this time 8.30pm...bit late for my baby now, who was exhausted and wanted to sleep). When  housekeeping did come to deal with it, they were very nice, and admitted that this was 'the broken one'!!! It took more time to get another travel cot that was new, and suitable. Got my baby to sleep after nine, very irate (both of us). 
So, rude unhelpful manager. Messed up booking. Broken cot.
Still cost ¬£270 for the night
Not a recommendation",2,2013,04,11
133,Smart hotel with great attention to detail,"Just returned from one night at this smart Kensington hotel. We chose the hotel for its location (we were attending a show at the Albert Hall, which is less than a 10 minute walk away) and because we found a great deal on Travelzoo (¬£150 including breakfast). 

I would recommend this hotel for the following reasons:

Lovely rooms (we had a king overlooking Kensington Palace and the park), spotlessly clean and plenty of high tech gadgets.
The bathroom was large and luxury feeling, with a big deep bath.
Breakfast was excellent, freshly cooked hot food and a good continental selection (ours was included in the deal, otherwise ¬£25 so quite pricey)
Service was excellent and very friendly from all staff. Details are lovely (including the 'unique' turn down, I won't spoil it). Slightly long wait for check out, but the staff were efficient when they got to us (and I think busy due to conference in the hotel).
Location is great for Kensington / Hyde Park. Everything in South Kensington (lovely shops, V&A museum etc) is in easy walking distance and very pleasant walk through the park which the hotel borders.

When we've visited London previously we've always chosen west end, central hotels, however I would definitely consider staying here again (if could find a good deal) even if not visiting the Albert Hall, as Kensington has a lot to offer and provides a slightly quieter london experience to the hub of the west end. The architecture is beautiful in the surrounding streets and there are so many quirky cafes and bars to choose from, it's worth considering as a base when visiting our vibrant capital! 

Last note, we took a cab from Euston to the hotel (as 4 of us travelling) which was only ¬£14, but Kensington High St  tube station is v.close!",5,2013,04,10
133,Fabulous afternoon tea!,"We took our children for afternoon tea on our son's 5th birthday following a day at the museums. 
Firstly, this hotel is a lovely half hour walk from the main museums, most of which will take you through Kensington Gardens. 
The Park Terrace is calm and spacious and the staff extremely welcoming. There was a pianist playing in one corner who delighted our son with a rendition of Happy Birthday. 
The tea itself was delicious. About average in price for London hotels I would say, but interesting sandwiches and wonderful light scones with homemade jam. 
This made the perfect end to our day. ",4,2013,04,10
133,GREAT HOTEL!!  GREAT LOCATION!,"This hotel is located on Kensington High Street in an extremely fashionable area of London.
There is a tube station a few blocks away.
Our room overlooked Kensington Palace and Gardens.  The staff was excellent!  The rooms were very luxurious!  
Our only problem experienced was the room was not ready at check-in time.  The manager made it up to us by offering us a cocktail at the bar!
I would definitely go back!!!",5,2013,04,10
133,Excellent,"We were upgraded to a business-class room...didn't have breakfast (very expensive extra), however...can report that this is an excellent hotel (not cheap) in a fabulous location with very helpful staff. The room and its facilities were of a very high standard - you get what you pay for here !",5,2013,04,10
133,Highly recommended!,"Great service,check in fast. Convenient location. Also ,  good breakfast buffet spread. 

If you carved for Chinese food, you can easily hop over to Min jiang restaurant. 

All in all, truly enjoyed my stay there. Highly recommended!",5,2013,04,08
133,Nice hotel shame about the Chinese,"We stayed here over the Easter bank holiday and have stayed several times before. The valet parking and porters have always been exceptional nothing is ever to much trouble.

Check in wasn't so smooth but to be fair we were served by a trainee, rooms were of a high standard and although wifi is included I wouldn't expect the hotel to limit it to 2 devices per room.

We had dinner in the Chinese restaurant in the hotel and I have never felt so unwelcomed all the staff were rude and tended to the regulars even if we asked for a drink it was as if we were bothering them, one waiter even walked off half way through us asking about some of the dishes, needless to say we ate and got out as soon as we could.

The next morning there was confusion over how many breakfast we had paid for although there was 4 of us and 2 rooms they thought we only paid for 2 which was later cleared up however upon checkout we found they had tried to charge us a further 4 breakfasts (8 in total ¬£200) and the breakfast wasn't even of good standard, came out Luke warm, scrambled egg was watery and the baked beans had a skin on it.

I will say that all the staff were expectional friendly and polite throughout our staff ( this is excluding the Chinese restaurant)",4,2013,04,08
133,Excellent 5 Star Hotel,"Service is excellent in this hotel, I have stayed on 6 occasions and I have never had a complaint, I want to make a comment on the Chinese restaurant, it is amazing with some of the most efficient staff I have seen, they are like a well oiled machine, though consistently busy the service is calm and friendly. A special mention for Kenny and the excellent cocktail making barman (sorry can't remember his name, only his sensational cocktails)",5,2013,04,08
133,Another great stay,Stayed again for the 2nd April in a row; this time with our 8 year old daughter in tow.  First room we were allocated on 10th floor was too small to fit a 3rd bed in really; and as the wind was blowing a hoolie through the window and making high pitched whistling sounds we requested a room change.  This was no problem at all; the next room was on 4th floor and this one had a sofa bed.  Much better for space!  As usual the rooms were spotless and the staff excellent.  We had the full english breakfast on one of the mornings and there was so much food; beautifully presented on a trolley for room service.  Love the Royal Garden Hotel and will probably be back again next April!  Thanks for another great stay.,5,2013,04,07
133,"5* Hotel, 3* Service.","We stayed for 2 nights at the Royal Garden for a special treat, we were upgraded to a garden room on the 8th floor, room 845, which we were very pleased about, the views were fantastic. The room was spacious & comfortable, the bathroom had everything you would expect from a 5* hotel - fabulous. Unfortunately there was a loud draft blowing constantly through our window, as we'd already been upgraded we didnt want to make a fuss & change rooms, so we tried to ignore it. The tv was a little complicated to work out & some channels were absent, there was also no dvd player (as stated on some travel sites), we asked at reception for a dvd player on the 1st night & were told one would be brought to the room, 30mins later nothing had come & no one had called our room. After another phone call to reception we were eventually called back to say there wasnt one available. The 2nd night we did get one brought to the room. On the 2nd night we got back to our room late & were very hungry so we ordered room service, we were told they were very busy & the wait would be 45mins, we hadnt eaten so we decided to wait the 45mins, 1.5hrs later no food had come, no one had called our room to say what was happening so I rang room service & had to wait 5mins before eventually reception answered, they transferred me back to room service & after another wait on the phone the man who answered seemed surprised we had not had our food, he was not at all apologetic & just repeated that they were busy. We were so tired by this time that we had to sleep without eating, this was not the service I would expect from a 5* hotel of this standing. Apart from these points we enjoyed our stay but I would think twice in future about staying at the Royal Garden, especially when paying 5* prices.",3,2013,04,05
133,A nice hotel with helpful staff.,"I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights while attending a conference. The hotel is nice. The rooms are on the small side. There is a lack of storage or drawer space in the standard room. Not a problem if your here for a day or two but since I was in town for a week it was a challenge. The breakfast was very good with no need to upgrade. My room had a view looking out at Kensington Palace. Within walking distance of some great food, pubs and shopping. You can also hop on the city tour bus across the street at The Goat tavern. This was my third trip to London and I enjoyed staying in this part of town. Much quieter than in the downtown area. Any questions that I had were answered by the staff. I would return to the Royal Garden if I travel back to London.",4,2013,04,04
133,Great Hotel,"I have stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel for the first time and was very impressed. The location is one of the best with great shops, restaurants and bars nearby. The next Underground station is only 5 min walking away.
The rooms are large and nice decorated with the eye for details.
Staff is very friendly and no matter if you are in London for business or pleasure, I would always recommend this hotel without any hesitation.",5,2013,04,03
133,A very good hotel.,"We treated ourselves to a two night stay at this hotel whilst visiting London for a Christening.  We were not disappointed.  The service was for the most part friendly and efficient.  The room was comfortable with very good views over the gardens at the back of the hotel and the cocktails were some of the best I have tried anywhere.

Two small moans though nothing really spoilt our stay.  I had to ask twice for an iron and ironing board to be sent to our room.  Service was slow when we decided to eat in the bar.  Having enjoyed our cocktails we decided to have a light supper and were moved to a different table and then neglected.  Service was good when we did attract the attention of the waiter however.

I would love to stay here again.",4,2013,04,03
133,Rooms are cold,"Stayed over the bank holiday, very expensive the rooms were very cold as the heating did not work properly. We had a meal in the Chinese resturant on floor 10, had not seen a menu like that before and could not believe the price it was so expensive and they tried to add on a service charge aswell. The staff in the hotel were friendly enough apart from the resturant staff who tend to look down at you unless you were wearing a Armani suit. We have been to hotel resturants all round Europe and have never been treated like that, service was so slow because they did not like the look of us I think. Would not stay there again untill they trained their staff better in good manners ",2,2013,04,02
133,Great Service when no Fire Alarm!,"In order not to be biased against the hotel, I recently wrote a scathing review about how the hotel handled a late night / early morning Fire Alarm. Well, I went back to the hotel last week for a three night stay with my wife and daughters, and I am happy to say that there was no fire alam, but more importantly, the hotel standards were very high, and what you would expect from a 5* Hotel in London.",4,2013,04,02
133,Fabulous Again,"My wife and I stayed at Easter for the third time at this hotel. Reception staff are wonderful, they really couldn't be more helpful and friendly.
We stayed in a Garden room. The room was not huge but very comfortable with everything you could want, including that fabulous view over Kensington Gardens and the Palace.
This hotel is perfect for breakfast in your room, something we don't normally do, but who could miss those views whilst sitting in the raised area eating breakfast ( and an excellent selection to)

We use this hotel to indulge when we visit Royal Albert Hall for a concert. There is nothing better than a stroll back down Kensington after a concert with no time pressure and then into Berties for a refreshing drink and superb club sandwich.
If we had a criticism it was the very slow service for food in the bar but as we were relaxing it didn't really spoil things for us.",5,2013,04,02
133,Faultless,"This 5 star hotel on the edge of Kensington gardens can't be faulted.  5 star without being pretentious.  Friendly staff and good size rooms.  Some overlooking the park.  Two good restaurants, one serving Singaporian/Asian on the top floor with views over the park (remember to order the duck in advance of your visit).  Breakfast is excellent, served in the ground floor restaurant.  Look out for deals on the Internet.  Bedrooms now have free wifi.",5,2013,04,02
133,"Good hotel, not quite five stars.","Stayed here for three nights over the Easter weekend. The rooms are comforting and the staff friendly, but the service isn't quite five-star standard. 

Twice I had housekeeping wake me up with a phone call asking whether I would like my room cleaned - despite having the 'Do Not Disturb' sign lit outside my room. After the first time I asked them not to call again, but they seemed to forget for the next day. After I requested they clean my room, I was told they would do it 'immediately' - yet two hours later after I returned from lunch the room hadn't been cleaned and I had to call them again.

The room service and restaurant food was very good and the waiters very friendly and charismatic. However, when calling for food the operator sounded dazed and it took a while for him to recompose before he took my order.

All in all, the rooms, location and facilities are great. The service is lacking though.",4,2013,04,01
133,Great Hotel and Location!,"Stayed for business, however could definitely see this being perfect for leisure as well.  Convenient location.  Professional and friendly staff.  Food and service exceeds expectations.  Overall - a great experience.",5,2013,03,29
133,perfect,"one night stay, for the purpose of celebrating by partners 50th birthday. we had tickets for the Royal Albert Hall to see Paul Weller and were delighted that we were only a 10 minute walk. The hotel was lovely, we had a glorious view of Hyde Park and were thoroughly looked after. The breakfast was plentiful, delicious and well presented. The staff were very attentive and friendly. All in all a top time.",5,2013,03,28
133,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights.  Staff were wonderful, nothing was too much trouble.  Hotel was certainly 5 star, rooms were spacious clean and well equipped.  Free wifi.  Breakfast was fabulous Great location in the centre of London, surrounded by great shoppng, cafes and restaurants. Will certainly be staying here again.",5,2013,03,27
133,Fantastically 5 star,"I treated my Mum to an overnight stay and dinner at The Royal Garden Hotel, London for Mother's Day.  It was a girls day/night out!!  Once we had checked in, we retired to The Park Terrace for some yummy afternoon cocktails - and to watch the world go by.  That evening, we had dinner in Min Jiang - fantastic Chinese Restaurant.  Overall, lovely hotel, great staff and great location",5,2013,03,25
133,Perfect location and lovely staff.,"Staying here for one night. Have found the service to be excellent and the staff all friendly and very helpful. Will return and stay here again. 
Tea and coffee available in the rooms and immediately adjacent to high st Kensington shops. ",5,2013,03,23
133,Fantastic Hotel In Central London.,"Travelled to the hotel with my wife for a shopping break and a bit of sight-seeing. We drove to London as I couldn't arrange the flights at a suitable price for the dates.

We found the hotel no problem at all thanks to my trusty Sat-Nav although I must admit, it was really easy to find.
 
There is car parking at the hotel which actually was the reason I booked the hotel. The one problem was the car park is under the hotel. I drove down from Scotland in the better halves Monster Mercedes Jeep and I ""just"" managed to scrape under the roof barriers in the car park. To be honest it was quite an unnerving drive into the bowels of the earth heading down into the car-park. Once we there and reached our level, everything was fine and dandy.
 
I however will not tell you the cost to park my car as absolutely nobody believes me, until, I show them the ticket. It is funny now, but at the time, I thought, "" what the **** "" 

Entering the hotel was a great experience, and, fantastic feeling of calm and relaxation. There is that perfect balance between making you feel welcome and being a truly up-market establishment and the reception staff have totally mastered it. They were so welcoming but just gave you that feeling that they knew exactly what they were doing, who they were, but treated you as if you had stayed at the hotel every other week. Excellent service. Very friendly without over stepping the mark. An absolutely beautiful upmarket and modern hotel experience.

The room was absolutely fantastic. That simple.
The room viewed the street but was very quiet considering it was in the middle of Kensington. 
A simply great room with a very comfortable bed and simply outstanding bathroom. It is simply a perfect hotel in the centre of London. Also, a huge HD television in the room with perfect picture and sound. No Hotel-Mode television settings with volume levels so low you cannot hear.
The room was simply perfect. Very big and very modern and very very clean. 

The bar in the hotel was great. Really good cocktails and very knowledgeable staff who just liked to spend time getting to know you. Honestly, just really nice people in the hotel who enjoyed there jobs in a big flash cocktail bar in a five star hotel. They were just really nice. 
There is also a very swish gymnasium at the hotel with lots of beautiful people and also the not so beautiful people trying to lose a few pounds. A good mix actually. 

The food in the hotel was excellent. I really enjoyed the Malaysian food prepared in the hotel. 
I was very very surprised at the prices. It was much cheaper eating in the hotel than in restaurants outside. Honestly, for a five star hotel it was very very good. Very good food. 
I ate at a Sicilian restaurant opposite the hotel, spent almost ¬£200, then returned to the hotel for some nice food as I was still hungry. I cannot remember the name of the place.

The hotel is in the middle of Kensington with the Tube just minutes away. You can however walk everywhere and anywhere from your hotel location. The hotel staff are always willing to advise you where to go and what to see. I don't know where they were when I ate at that Sicilian restaurant. The hotel bar staff will tell you the hot spots. Lots of bars and restaurant nearby.

A perfect hotel in the middle of London which caters for absolutely every need and is spotlessly clean. It has excellent food and drink with staff that like to spoil you.
If you like people watching and spotting some stars, then this hotel will not let you down.
 A fantastic hotel that I will definitely return to on my wife's next shopping visit to London. 

However, as I book all the holidays, It is with absolute certainty, that I  state, that I will once again visit the beautiful hot hot hot beaches in Tenerife before I once again visit the cold cold cold banks of the River Thames. 

Enjoy Your Holidays

133,"It was OK, but I didn't get value for money","Interesting hotel. Check in was quick. Room service was delicious. The room was clean and functional (loved the ipod docking station) but it lacked personality. I was just a number (room 214, for your information). And the air conditioning was really loud and ineffective. And the meal I had at the function I went to (at the hotel) was AWFUL. The bed was quite comfy but nothing special. I looked out over Kensington High Street... All in all, was it worth the ¬£260 I paid for one night? I'm going to say no. Not special. Just OK.",3,2013,03,23
133,Perfect,"I spent a Saturday night here with my sister. From the moment we approached the entrance, to when we left everything was just perfect.The staff cannot do enough for you.The room we had overlooked Kensington gardens & palace which was wonderfull.The breakfast was amazing, beautiful ingredients & all hot & fresh, in a room overlooking Kensington Gardens.We had the added bonus of seeing Prince William & Kate leave the palace & be driven away accompanied by police outriders!
The hotel is perfectly situated & only a few minutes walk from Kensington High St tube station in one direction, & The Royal Albert Hall in the other direction.
Cannot fault it, thanks for an amazing stay. Highly recommended.",5,2013,03,20
133,Royal Garden Hotel,"I have stayed here last Saturday. The first thing is Reception. The welcome was very good and highly professional. Room Service, Housekeeping and the Concierge were were always prompt to accomodate and assist where necessary.
If you are looking for a relaxing stay in a good location this is the place to stay. 
The quality of the hotel and its staff have been brilliant.
I can suggest eating at the Park Terrace which is stunning. 
I would certainly choose this hotel on our next stay.",5,2013,03,19
133,Thank you for our stay,From the moment we walked into the RGH you felt welcomed by a personal vibe- often rare in such grand opulent surroundings. The check in was quick and friendly and the room was perfect- breathtaking views of the park. All the facilities in the rooms were built for comfort and relaxation- perfect if you are tired from shopping/sight-seeing.  Highly recommended.,5,2013,03,19
133,"Quality, Quality, Quality",I have stayed here a few times and each time the quality of the hotel and its staff have been superb. Everyone is friendly and welcoming and nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are a very high standard as are the restaurants. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough for a weekend in London and would also suggest eating at the Min Jiang which is stunning!! loved it.,5,2013,03,18
133,Fabulous stay with friendly staff,"From the moment we arrived at the hotel the service was excellent. Our room was not ready so we received a complimentary upgrade. The views over Hyde park are lovely. 

All of the staff were friendly and helpful. 

Our breakfast was outstanding and nothing was too much trouble. 

The only thing that I think needs improving is the bar, but this really is minor.

We will definitely be returning. ",5,2013,03,17
133,Royal Garden hotel,"Stayed there for a dinner dance, the rooms are really nice and had a good view of the Kensington gardens.
The food at the dinner dance was good considering there was 250 people there but the drinks were expensive.
The only downside was the breakfast buffet and for ¬£25 each it is a rip off and really bad value for money and if I stay there again I wouldn't have breakfast as it is stale and cold!!",4,2013,03,17
133,100%,"This place is in a great location...I walked or caught the tube easily and there was a great pub across the road for a quick and inexpensive meal or drink.
The rooms are not massive but to be expected in London.  They are modern, clean and have everything you need.   Room service, housekeeping and the concierge were lovely and above helpful.  The weekend buffet breakfast was sensational.
I had a wonderful stay and would go back again!",5,2013,03,14
133,Fantastic stay at Royal Garden Hotel,"We stayed on a Friday night, myself and my husband had a fantastic time, our room was on the 7th floor overlooking Hyde park and Kensington Gardens. We were looking for a luxury night away without our son and were not dissapointed...We had dinner in the Park terrace where the staff and food were excellent, prior to our dinner we had champagne in Berties bar where the host was most welcoming. We enjoyed our breakfast and must say if really did feel like 5 star!
If you are looking for a relaxing stay in a good location this is the place to stay.",5,2013,03,13
133,Our prize winning weekend!,"I won a national competition which included 2 nights for 4 people in king rooms with full English breakfast and per theatre dinner on one night. My husband and I our daughter and adult granddaughter stayed. We also had fantastic seats for Carmen at the Royal Albert Hall.
Our rooms were very clean and comfortable with superb views, especially our daughters on the 9th floor we were on the 7 th. Our meal in the terrace restaurant was good but not outstanding.
The best thing for us was the location. number 10 bus brought us all the way from Euston to the hotel door. Also number 9 vintage route master took us from outside the door to Trafalgar Square for the galleries. We are senior citizens so were able to have free travel on the buses with our passes. Will definitely  look out for special offers next time we come to London and would recommend the Royal Garden to our friends. All staff were very helpful.",5,2013,03,07
133,great hotel,"we have been twice now to this hotel and we will definitely return staff very eager to please cleanliness was spot on food in all restaurants excellent great having car park right next to it, good location for all amenities",5,2013,03,06
133,Avoid the breakfast!,"Recently spent the weekend at the Royal Garden Hotel, whereby most aspects of our stay were at the quality expected of a 5 star rated hotel. The rooms are very clean and modern with amazing views. 

HOWEVER, we chose to have breakfast delivered to our room on both mornings of our stay, which was a major mistake. On both occasions the hot breakfast was cold, not even warm in the slightest! We found that some items on the plate were completely inedible, hence the food trolley was returned with near complete meals on the second day!  The selection of pastries were solid and had obviously been hanging around for a while. On the first day my porridge was forgotten about and had to be delivered later .. 15 minutes later! On the second day both of our fruit juices had been completely forgotten about! The selection of sauces and jams varied in quantity on both days, hence showing signs of inconsistency in the service provided by the hotel. 

I have had better breakfasts staying at lower rated hotels, using better ingredients and providing meals that are still hot!! At ¬£25 a head I feel this experience to be completely unacceptable and would choose to have breakfast at local eateries during future stays! As a chef myself I see no excuse for this situation, therefore this is an issue the hotel must be addressed as this is not the first review giving negative feedback about the breakfast!",3,2013,03,06
133,"Great staff, perfect location","Well appointed rooms with impressive views. Clean hotel with staff that give that little bit extra to make your stay special. Concierge service is really top notch. Breakfasts are worth the cost. 
Location is perfect right next to the park, and embassy district with all the big museums within walking distance, and the tube only a short walk away. I don't recommend many hotels, I stay at many different hotels in my business life, this one I would recommend to any discerning visitor.

The only minus really was that cost of the Wifi.",5,2013,03,05
133,Well placed on Kensington High Street,"A very well placed location, a 2 min walk from the tube station and with plenty of shops and restaurants in the neighbourhood. The hotel is nice and clean, only the rooms could have been a little bigger but that's the price you pay for being downtown London. The hotel offers free wifi. ",4,2013,03,02
133,Below average facilities...great staff,"We had a client conference in London so our company booked us at the Royal Palace Gardens.
The hotel is located in Kensington, so it is easy to reach from Heathrow... one can take either the Heathrow Express to Paddington, or the tube to Earl‚Äôs Court. If there are 2 or more people travelling, or the traffic is not inconvenient, a taxi can be taken.

On arrival, I cleared the room rent for the days I was staying and was informed that the hotel would block 50 pounds per day on my credit card to cover for any additional cost. (The practice is normally to use the credit card in case additional expenses are borne. Not sure why the hotel blocked the amount...I was very uncomfortable of having a forex transaction on my card and then having it reversed on checking out). I got a transaction confirmation message from my credit card company, but on checking my account on the internet, thankfully there was no entry. 

I asked the hotel for an adaptor, and must say that the guys at the concierge desk went at great lengths to ensure I got one for the type of plug my laptop had, as it was not have it readily available.

I went to the room and found it to be quite small for the price my company was paying (over 200 Pounds). I have travelled to other European cities which are as expensive as London, and surely one would get a better room at the price agreed.

Anyways...one of the low points of the stay was the Air Conditioner in the room. There were two knobs for the AC: one for putting it on/off and speed, and the other for temperature. But the temperature knob was such that it had only a ‚Äò+‚Äô sign at one end, and a ‚Äò-‚Äò sign at the other. Forget a digital indicator for the temperature, there was no analogue indicator what the temperature reading would be at both ends of the knob. It was difficult to figure out at what setting the AC should be kept at, apart from the plus and minus signs. So fearing that I would catch a cold in near 0 deg temperature after a 9 hour flight, I set the knob closer to the plus sign, and had to promptly wake up in a couple of hours, profusely sweating.

The TV in the room had a large number of channels, but was not mounted in front of the bed implying that one could not see TV sitting up in the bed without straining one‚Äôs neck. One had to sit on the sofa / seating area in the corner of the room to look straight at the TV screen.

The breakfast experience was a little queer. The hotel offered complimentary breakfast to our company‚Äôs guests, but it was a cold breakfast, with 4-5 items on the table menu. The bill for breakfast though was for the entire breakfast (25 pounds), making it difficult for me to figure out whether it was complimentary or not. I checked with the hotel reception, and thankfully the hotel had charged me only for the item ordered from the table menu (4.5 pounds). Maybe a bill just for the incremental amount should have got charged, as was eventually done to my total bill.

The saving grace for this hotel is the staff...a bunch of young, professional, helpful, friendly people.

Maybe the hotel is charging a premium for the easy access to the Kensington Palace, tube station, buses as well as Hyde Park, but it is essential to provide a certain standard of comfort that one can expect.",3,2013,03,02
133,"Great location, wonderful breakfast","The hotel is located in the heart of Kensington, a few minute walk from the main shopping areas and pubs. The metro (tube) is a couple of blocks. Bus service within a block.The rooms are beautiful, spotless but a bit small. We have a wonderful view of the park. The staff is wonderful and breakfast is excellent. It is very well worth the price for the location and service you get.",4,2013,02,27
133,Just Perfect!,Great location and the staff eager to please. The rooms were spotless and very well laid out. Breakfast was superb and the service just right. An excellent value- I wouldn't think of staying any where else.,5,2013,02,26
133,Great views & good location,"We stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel as part of a 10th anniversary weekend in London. We had pre-booked the Garden View room which, from our 9th floor window did give an excellent view over Kensington Palace Gardens across London. The rooms are a bit on the small side, but with a decent seating area to admire the view. Although we were quite close to the lifts, we heard no noise during our stay

We didn't dine in the hotel as we had a reservation at Petrus, but had pre-booked the continental breakfast - when we arrived at breakfast, the cooked breakfast looked particulary appetising, so we upgraded for the princely sum of ¬£4.50 per person  

The hotel is well located for Kensington High Street & five minutes on a bus or taxi to Knightsbridge. Also very handy for a walk around Kensington Palace Gardens & Hyde Park

On site parking is expensive, however this didn't affect us as we used the tube

We would recommend this hotel & will definitely stay there again",5,2013,02,25
133,A Special visit,"An excellent hotel. Service was superb.
Arrived early but the room was not ready, told would contact on the mobile when ready as a priority.
Advised it would ready at 1400 as thsi was the check in time. Returned just before 12 but still not ready, without question offered a tea and coffee and came and found us twenty minutes later when the room was ready.",5,2013,02,25
133,Fantastic service and great location,"One night trip to London and normally stay at the connaught, however after my stay here I will certainly be back.

All the staff are very well trained and are polite and helpful, the make eye contact which is important. 

Great breakfast and again could not do enough for you.",5,2013,02,25
133,"A small price step-up, a huge quality step-up","I normally spend about ¬£120 a night on a hotel in London, but am generally a little disappointed. This time, I spent ¬£20 extra (via booking.com) and got something that really felt special.

The room I had was a 'Queen' which is the entry level for this hotel. That said, it was still spacious, was spotless and very well fitted out, especially in the bathroom with Villeroy & Boch fittings. Towels, sheets and bathrobes were whiter than white and there were a couple of nice touches with some complimentary chocolates and newspaper.

What I really liked was the way I was treated by everyone in the hotel from the reception staff to the doormen and cleaners. As probably one of the smaller spenders at the hotel during my stay, I certainly wasn't made to feel that way and I will definitely be looking to re-book this hotel for future visits. 

On a practical note, the hotel sits at the end of Kensington High St, 5 minutes walk from a number of great shops and eating/drinking options. The Royal Albert Hall is 10 mins walk away and a gateway to Kensington Gardens is just to the side of the hotel.",5,2013,02,24
133,Informal professional service. Always good,Has become my London home is recent years. Always greeted and staff seem to remember you. Always friendly. Probably the best room service breakfasts going too. Would recommend Park Terrace restaurant too. A cut above your average hotel restaurant,5,2013,02,23
133,The Best Location in London,"We always stay within 10 minutes of Kinsington Palace, usually in an apartment.  For our 15th visit to London we decided to pull out all the stops and stay at this hotel which we had been looking at for years.  We were very pleased with every aspect of this property from the room, the staff, and the food service.  Kinsington Garden being adjacent to the hotel was an obvious plus.  Underground stations for 3 different lines are within a 10 min. walk.  We look forward to returning to this property.",5,2013,02,23
133,Great traditionally modern English hotel.,"A few days business trip, free upgrade, great service, splendid room, Beautiful view to the park. First time in London to have the room ready to be occupied before the official check in time. Tube is right at the corner connecting to everywhere in the city.",4,2013,02,22
133,"Helpful Concierge, Comfortable Beds, Two Blocks to Tube","This hotel, in total, is very nice.  I can't give it 5 stars because a couple of things were missing for me.  First, it is in a very nice neighborhood.  The bus stops right outside of the hotel.  The tube is two blocks away.  You will probably have to change lines once if you want to get to the most common tourist areas.  However, this is not a big deal.  It is right next to a park, there is plenty of shopping, a couple of pubs, two clubs, restaurants, and a Whole Foods.  It seemed very safe. As a side note, if you want to go out at night to the tourist areas, you will need to take a night bus if you stay out late or be ready to pay for a taxi.  The taxis are very expensive.  The hotel itself is very nice.  The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. The bed was great with nice linen.  The bathroom was beautiful with a large shower and plenty of lighting.  However, there is no free Wi-Fi anywhere in the hotel.  It costs 20 GBP per night!  Ridiculous!!!!  In this day and age, I don‚Äôt care if you are a 5 star hotel, that's just poor business.  There was also no iron/ironing board in the room.  We did find one in the hallway, but it was inconvenient.  The concierge was very helpful and gave us tips only a local would know.  I would not recommend the Asian restaurant.  WAY WAY overpriced for the food.  It was nothing special.  In fact, I found it to be rather boring food.  And, the drinks are very expensive.  All in all, I would stay here again.  But, I may look for a place with free Wi-Fi on a better tube line.",4,2013,02,21
133,"Clean, comfortable, welcoming but a bit small.","Lovely hotel with great staff and nice clean contemporary surroundings. The room was a tad on the small side, with the TV awkwardly located. I would return to this hotel though as it's centrally located and great for business trips.",4,2013,02,21
133,Totally Recommend!,"I stayed here in Feb 2013 for 4 days and had a whimsical stay. I was here on a short vacation. My room had a gorgeous view of Kensington Palace. When I tell you it's across from the palace it is no exaggeration. It was amazing! It's next to a beautiful park and embassies. I was single female traveler and felt really safe in the area. It was a 5 min walk to the tube. On the weekends one of the tube lines didn't work and it took a while for me to get back but that was my fault. So plan ahead. Also because its in a shopping area everything is nearby supermarket,grocery store, Starbucks, clothing shops, restaurants cafes EVERYTHING! because of this it gets really really busy and crowded when walking to the tube but luckily the hotel is strategically located at the end of high street kensington and not chaotic so it's not a bother when you stay in your room. 

The bed and pillows were a dream!! It was soft and plush and I had to force myself to leave the bed. They also brought up wine glasses and ice free of charge when I had guests over. They even opened up the bottle for us! Little things like this really means a lot. The room was clean and large enough for me. The bathroom was immaculate.  They also had a towel warmer and thought that was cool.

I cannot comment on the food as I never ate here due mostly because it was really really expensive (especially on an American budget! Lol) so I ate in the restaurants near the hotel. 

What I did really appreciate is them giving me the option of keeping or doing away with the mini bar before i entered the room. Since I knew how exorbitant  the cost of using the mini bar I requested to have it removed. I never stayed at a hotel that gave me this option and to me RGH is really trying here in terms of customer satisfaction and making sure their guests do not get charged for superfluous things.

The staff was very friendly professional and courteous. The concierge didn't know exactly how to get where I wanted to go but he tried diligently to help me and he came up with a way to get to Hampton Court Palace efficiently due to the tube line disruption and it was a time saver! 

The only complaint I have is that they should tell you when you check in how the lights function in the room because I was searching for 20min how to turn on the lights (you have to insert your key card into a slot to turn them on). Also they should use fabric softer on the robes and towel. There were unusually abrasive.

I would definitely recommend this hotel any day and can not wait to return! It was well worth the money!",5,2013,02,19
133,Ideal location as I was attending an event at the hotel,"The hotel is really well located by Kensington Gardens and a short cab ride to Knightsbridge. The room I had was pretty small but not unexpected for a premium London property. Bertie's Bar is pleasant and had good service but the restaurant on the 10th floor (I don't recall the name) did not impress service wise although the food was good. The staff at breakfast were all very impressive and I rate them highly. The breakfast choices themselves were also excellent with plenty of fresh fruit, pastries, cereals and an a la carte if preferred. ",4,2013,02,16
133,Excellent value for a 5 star hotel,"I stayed at this hotel on business last week for first time, rest assured I will be returning. Firstly the location is fantastic - just off Kensington high street, secondly this is without doubt the best value 5 star hotel in London which I have stayed at. I took advantage of a stay 3 nights pay for 2 offer which significantly reduced the bill. The views from my room over Kensington Palace (Kate and Will's future home) were also spectacular!",5,2013,02,13
133,An top hotel at a resonable proce,"Stayed here for 3 nights in Feb 2013 with friends. Can't fault the rooms (we had 2 doubles) nor the service at both reception and in the dining room. It was PERFECT.

Don't know what the ""rack"" rate is but we got a good deal vial Expedia.

Rooms are modern and well equipped to a high standard. Lovely bathroom with bath and excellent shower. Good quality bedding and towels etc.

Had a lovely dinner (good travelzoo half price offer). We were required to show them the travelzoo voucher when we arrived at the dinning room and they recognized it immediately, knew exactly what the deal was and provided a level of service and quality of food which was second to none.

Reception and concierge staff where extremely pleasant, courteous and efficient.

The only criticism I had (which is common to many hotels) is the cost of broadband access (¬£20 a day) which will stop anyone other than those on a self authorizing expense account from using it. Nowadays, it should be included free. 

I highly recommend this hotel",5,2013,02,12
133,Great hotel right in the middle of Kensignton,"Great overall service , great gym , great restaurants and bars and very nice location. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were nice, clean and bathrooms were clean as well. 
Very nice lounge and waiting areas.
Only issue we had was with the breakfast service at the restaurant which was slow.
Could get buses easily , tube station is walking distance.",4,2013,02,11
133,Very nice hotel/great location,"We visited the Royal Garden Hotel on January 31, 2013 for 3 nights.  The staff was great.  We got a garden room over looking the park.  I wouldn't recommend the standard room.  It's really tiny.  I really loved the location of this hotel.  It is not in the hub of the tourist rat race.  It's in a beautiful London neighborhood with shops and restaurants, and a short walk to Nottinghill.  If you do stay at the Royal Garden Hotel I highly recommend the Chinese restaurant on the top floor.  Make sure you get a reservation, and reserve the duck for a very special experience.  My only complaint with this hotel was probably not even the hotels fault.  We were in a nonsmoking area, but the person in the room next to us was smoking anyhow and the smell came right through the walls into our room.  Very strong.",4,2013,02,08
133,Great service,Great for a weekend break handy for west end and Kensington shops.Staff were friendly and attentive room service quick and good value.also Bertie's bar did great cocktails so a good place to finish off the evening,5,2013,02,05
133,Great location,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and I'm quite happy. The hotel is right next to Hyde Park (Kensington Gardens) overlooking Kate & William's Kensington Palace. The tube station is minutes away and there are lots of restaurants and shops on the street. Great location! The Chinese invested hotel went through renovation in 2011. I think it totally worths it. The room is comfortable and cosy. I should admit however that there is little room to put toiletries in the toilet. The bed is comfortable. The room service is very fast and efficient. The food menu contains Middle-eastern food (yummy). 

The downside of the hotel is it doesn't contain slippers as most similar hotels would and the staff might omit you during fire alarms! While I was staying there, the fire alarm rang and all the people on the 9th floor corridor started to use the stairs. The fireman came and left after 10 minutes. I couldn't learn anything from the front desk -is it safe to go upstairs, why this happened etc. I learnt from the American guests on the elevator that their fire alarm is so sensitive and it goes off all the time. This was the 5th time in the month. We were all happy that the fire alarm didn't start in the middle of the night!! 

Apart from this, the hotel is perfectly fine and fulfils basic expectations.",3,2013,02,05
133,Very good hotel for business while in London,"I usually visit London a couple times a year on business and this is by far the best value for money hotel that I've stayed at.  It's not the absolute best hotel, but it's priced very fairly and it's really hard to think of a complaint about this hotel.  Great rooms, comfortable bed, very good staff, good hotel breakfast, adjacent to Hyde Park, right next to Ken High Street tube stop, peaceful and efficient hotel.  This is not in the city center, so if you're here for sight-seeing you might want to stay a bit further East, but again, public transport is convenient from this location.",5,2013,02,05
133,London Trip,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 night we had a fantastic stay, all the staff were friendly and very helpful. The rooms are excellent and  food and service were also excellent. The only downside was the cost of the drinks in the bar , although i suppose this can be put  put down to London prices.",5,2013,02,03
133,Premier Inn in disguise!,"I am staying here for three days and am unimpressed by the size of the rooms and the general atmosphere and service.
My room is a queen room so I wasn't expecting it to be huge but I can't actually open my suitcase without taking up all floor space available.  The room is like a ship's cabin and decor like a Premier Inn.  Don't know how it has managed to achieve 5 stars, it feels more like 3. Location is good though.  ",1,2013,02,02
133,Ideal London Hotel,"I don't usually review hotels but feel compelled to review this hotel due to the almost ideal stay I've just experienced. Was impressed from the moment the doorman and concierge rushed to help me out of my taxi, loved the idea of the receptionist after checking me in walking me up to show me my hotel room. The room was a great size for London with a nice comfy 2 seater sofa, and although I didn't get a park view, the view of the high street from the 7th floor was pretty impressive. Breakfast was lovely, again with great attentive service, food was always fresh and of a high quality and in my opinion well worth the price tag. Though I was here on business I felt very relaxed & looked after, and I used the nearby Kensington gardens & Hyde park to go jogging in and relax.

My only small gripe was paying 20 pounds  daily for the relatively slow wifi/internet which in this day and age I think is very excessive and I think the time for charging for wifi should be at an end considering how cheap it really is. 

Overall though I have left extremely pleased and will definitely make this my hotel of choice for the next time I visit London whether it's business or pleasure.",5,2013,01,31
133,Excellent afternoon tea,"My friends booked an afternoon tea at Royal Garden Hotel as a treat for my birthday. The food, service and ambiance was great with live music and beautiful view of Hyde park. We enjoyed it so much that we lost the track of time and stayed for more than two hours. We had royal tea with a glass of champagne and strawberries that was delicious. Highly recommended!",5,2013,01,27
133,"Very nice evening, great restaurants, wonderful staff, great rooms","Stayed there last week end. King's size room on the 9th floor. Very nice view, very comfortable and quiet. Nice set up with the sofa on a mini-mezzanine. We had a wonderful lunch at the 10th floor chinese restaurant min jiang. The food is always fantastic. For dinner we decided to stay in the hotel and try the ground floor terrace restaurant. We had no reservation but the staff accomodated us without problem. The menu is very simple abut comprehensive. The price is phenomenally low. The focus of the restaurant is quality produce and it shows. Our main course and deserts were superb. Full of flavour and cooked to perfection.",5,2013,01,25
133,Nothing left to chance,"Travelled with my sister and from breakfast in Park Terrace, drinks and a great club sandwich in Berties to an outstanding dinner in Min Jiang the level of friendly service was second to none...nothing was to difficult.
For a large hotel the boutique feel was captured.
Love the 5 days and will stay there again.",5,2013,01,21
133,First time brilliant!,"Our first stay at this hotel. Excellent location overlooking Kensington Gardens. Convenient to use the on-site parking. We started with a lovely afternoon tea. Probably the best scones I have eaten! The jams are homemeade at the hotel - berries and champagne - delicious! We had a garden veiw room - I can be a liitle prickly about the sameness of hotel rooms - it was layed out well with a lovely sofa sitting area overlooking Kensington gardens. We had dinner in the Park Terrace restaurant. It was fantasctic. The starters were delicious, interseting and visually stunning. The mains kept up the trend and desert almost finished us off. No space for the clever petit fours! Pop out the front door onto Kensington high street for a great variety of shops and restaurants. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!",5,2013,01,21
133,Totally enjoyed this hotel again,"I stayed at this hotel in 1997 for a week and had great memories of it, so I elected to stay there again with my family on our Christmas trip to London. We rented three rooms.

Again, I had a great experience. The view from our room was great, out across the Kensington Gardens.

The location of the hotel is perfect for tourists, just a short bus or tube ride to all the major attractions. And it is so nice to be a bit away from the hurly burly. The gardens are a major plus. We walked there and watched the sun come up every day.  Kensington is a busy interesting place.",5,2013,01,05
133,Car park a nightmare!,"On arriving at this hotel, we self parked in the underground car park.  To get down to the car park you have to go down a very very narrow entry, which goes on and on......and you scrape your tyres constantly, and are worried you are going to wedge your car on the way down, even in a medium size car!  When checking in I mentioned the problem and asked if anyone had complained before.  One member of staff assured us yes, another assured us no, at the same time!!!  I guess the answer must if been yes!   Then our room wasn't ready, despite we were an hour after check in time,  we were offered a complimentary drink, but had to wait over another hour before we checked in,  we were told people just seemed to leave when they pleased!!!!
The room was clean, bathroom was nice.  I think a room at the back away from the road would have been better.  Despite being on a high floor, we heard a lot of noise outside, and the wind was howling through the windows at night.   Nice location for Kensington palace and Walks around the parks.  Easy to drive to off m40.  Would not stay here again, because of the Car park.",3,2013,01,04
133,Great first stay!,"Having eaten at the Min Jiang restaurant located on the top floor of the hotel on a number of occasions we decided to stay at the hotel for a long weekend just before Christmas. The hotel is in a brilliant location with bars, restaurants, coffee shops, convenience stores, etc... all within a minute or two walk and the tube is about 5 min away.

The hotel itself was immaculate, staff are both friendly and helpful. Services provided by the hotel were very good with free wi-fi and wired connection in the room (due to booking through hotel website I believe? I also found the business centre to be of good use when needed to print off some travel arrangements.

Will definitely stay here again and looking forward to our next visit!",5,2013,01,03
133,"""Great Stay Once Again!""","We stayed at this hotel last year (2011) and again this year (2012) during the Christmas holidays. It has always been magnificent. Greeting us personally is always a delight from calling the front desk and being addressed by name before you ask a question to having our names on the flat screen t.v. in our room. That's exceptional. The surrounding businesses near the hotel are also great (grocery stores, restaurants catering to different types of food, department stores, etc.). There was only one problem. We were charged a fee to exchange currency.",5,2013,01,01
133,Superb stay over Christmas,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel over the festive period and had the most fantastic time. From being recognised by the staff when checking in to the friendly farewells on leaving the whole experience was superb. The location is great, the rooms overlooking Kensington Palace quiet and relaxing, and the food outstanding. We are already looking forward to next year.",5,2012,12,30
133,"The ""Unfortunate"" Hotel","We stayed at this hotel in May and are finally able to write a review.  We stayed for four nights and were not at all impressed...  

When we entered the hotel (about 5:00 in the afternoon), not a single clerk could look up and extend a greeting.  Finally, we walked up to a women and she asked if she could help us.  (We were exchanging Disney points for our stay and this equated to well over $500 per night.)  My wife mentioned that she noticed that we would have gotten free internet if we had booked directly for a much cheaper rate.  The clerk said,  ""Unfortunately, we can't do that.""  

We were sent to our room -- which was extremely small, with no dresser or chest of drawers to unpack our cloths.  The view was looking over the busy street -- certainly not the views of the park that is touted in the advertisements.  And the icing on the cake was the shower in the room, which had a step up and a rain shower that came from the ceiling.  I would have had to have squatted to be able to shower.  I called the front desk to ask for a different room.  I was told,  ""Unfortunately, we are filled and don't have another room to offer.""  I also mentioned that the view wasn't anything to write home about.  At this point, the clerk said,  ""Well, sir, didn't you do any homework to see what you were going to be getting?""  I told her that I HAD -- and that ALL the view were of the park!!!   Finally after insisting that we weren't going to be staying in this room, she said that she'd have to look through the log to see what she could do.  She called back after 45 minutes and had two other rooms to offer.  The one was even smaller than the current room and we settled for a room where I could actually stand up to take a shower.  This one was still to small to have a dresser or chest of drawers -- we had to leave a lot of our cloths in the suitcases.  And the view was even worse than the first room -- this time we got to look directly over a tarred roof!   We've stayed at the Four Seasons and the Mandarin Oriental -- and this one didn't even come close to comparing.

For a top class hotel, this one DOESN'T even have a swimming pool...  And if you want to go to work out in the exercise room or spa, you literally have to leave the front of the hotel, and go next door and then downstairs.  Very weird!

For breakfast the next morning, we asked the server if we would be able to be finished in 45 minutes, as we were meeting a friend.  His response was a snotty, ""We'll see.""  My wife ordered two fried eggs, and got ONE that was over easy -- this certainly didn't speed things up!  After this experience, I specifically asked that we didn't get this waiter again, and we did have a pleasant breakfast for the other 3 mornings.

Regarding the location, if you enjoy staying in a suburb that is over 10 miles from the real center of the tourist attractions, then that's one thing.   This is NOT a great location at all.  You have to take a taxi to ANYWHERE you want to go.  The subway is over a 5 minute walk and is a big hassle.

This is not a hotel that we enjoyed at all.  Having a tiny room (that was overlooking a roof), a small bathroom, a big hassle at check in, snotty front desk clerks and snotty service in the restaurant just doesn't make one very delighted.  Next time, we'll CERTAINLY stay at a different hotel! 

Let me make this clear....  Odds are that you are not going to get the nice view that they show in the brochure, you're going to live out of the suitcase (because there aren't drawers provided to unpack), you'll waste a lot of time traveling to where you want to go, you'll get a tiny room and tiny bathroom, and you'll get SNOTTY service.  Good Luck with that!!!",1,2012,12,29
133,Modern hotel excellent location,"This is a very nice modern 5 stars hotel located minutes walk from Kensington palace and park. It's prime location and excellent clean rooms make this hotel a very good choise. We stayed in the garden view room. Nice view and excellent room, bed, big flat tv and fabulous bathroom. Service is also very good. Breakfast , wi fi were not included in the price and are expensive to my opinion. There is no free wifi even in the lobby which is shameful. Be aware when you use airport transfer if you are two couples for higher fee that is failed to be mentioned on the hotel site. Bottom line is still excellent. ",5,2012,12,29
133,Good Hotel......good value,"I have stayed at this hotel a couple of times and really like it....seems a bit of a favorite with football teams as well as there has been either a team or some football legend staying there every time we have!.........the reception/door staff are efficient and friendly, the rooms are spacious and clean with good amenities, all you would expect from a good London hotel. If you are lucky enough to have a room overlooking the park the view is lovely. They have a nice bar upstairs where the service is good also.
Breakfast can be a little chaotic and busy and if you order from the menu they do charge extra, and I did notice a couple of people to whom this hadn‚Äôt been made clear, there is however no real need to order extras unless you particularly fancy something as there is plenty to choose from on the buffet, my husband had a very good full English breakfast from the buffet and I had a good selection of fruit etc. All in all a good hotel.",4,2012,12,18
133,Good stay..,"The hotel lives up to expectation. Helpful staff and good rooms. I got a road view room but there was zero noise. Breakfast had a good spread. Best thing about the hotel is the excellent location. The tube station is hardly a 5 minute walk and lots of good places to shop over the weekend.

Did not a chance to have dinner at the hotel, but the other couple who were travelling with us, did and they gave very good feedback. 

Overall, im coming back next time in in london.",4,2012,12,12
133,"Why, when in London, do we always stay the Royal Garden Hotel?","That is, besides being expensively modernized and in a Prime Location on the edge of Kensington Gardens and neighouring the Palace and the shops of Kensington High Street - our full confidence in knowing: -

   We will receive a genuinely warm welcome from everyone, whether it is from the general  
   manager or the chamber maid.

   The ease and comfort of knowing all arrangements will have been made, including every effort
   to ensure we have our favourite room.

   The hidden secret of the hotel's competitively priced, yet award winning, restaurants

   Leisurely afternoon teas (once again, at surprisingly reasonable prices)  whilst devouring the
   best  scones since mother used to make them and listening to the melodic sound of Nina
   tinkling  the ivories.

   Proper coffee prepared by the genial Park Terrace boss, Massimo, who crafted his art in
   Florence.

   The smiling face of Vilmos, running the bar; which is an appropriate description because he
   moves around the tables so quickly he must be on skates!

We look forward to our next visit.",5,2012,12,10
133,Fire?,"Reading the two previous reviews I can wholeheartedly agree, the night in question December 5th (my birthday!) was a very cold night and we were left outside barefooted for two hours...not one single member of staff in sight!! We were never informed about what was going on, you would think a 5* hotel would have some sort of agreement with another local hotel to have a room where their guests could wait in the warm. It completely ruined our trip to London as we were too tired the next day to do anything we had planned to do....unacceptable!!",2,2012,12,09
133,No complimentary biscuits!,"Stayed here recently on business. Efficient check inn although quoted the wrong room rate. The rate was corrected on check out. 
Room was nice I stayed in a single occupency room which was suitable. Bathroom was well equipped and modern. Bed was very comfrotable. I did not have a park view, but no road noise either so that was fine.
The hotel is very good at marketing add on's for your room lots of items priced up for you to have. However the only complimentary options they provide are tea, coffee & a bottle of water. For the price of the room I would off expected a complimentary biscuit. As per my previous comment I could of had a biscuit if I had bought the box priced ¬£3.00!!",3,2012,12,09
133,No more trust!,"I have been staying at this hotel for the last four years on business, and since moving to Spain from the UK my wife stays here when returning to London...so we like the hotel! Unfortunately the hotel has let itself down with a recent fire alarm when my wife and young daughters were guests. They were left outside for two hours in the freezing cold from just before 1.00am...no fault of the hotel...BUT...to have no staff stay with the guests...have your guests in night clothes congregating at the entrance to a night club where drunk men also congregating...that is the hotel management.

I called the General Manager to let him know how disappointed I was...he sounded apologetic, took my wife's name and said he would contact her. In these situations a heartfelt apology and a promise to fix it next time is usually all you need...you guessed it...he (nor any of his staff) made any contact in the two evenings she remained in the hotel.

I believe my daughters were the only children there (13 & 15), left outside a nightclub with drunk men and no supervision from the hotel staff in sight...they will not see me or anyone from my business again!!!!",3,2012,12,09
133,I will happily return,"I stayed at the Royal Garden for 6 nights in Oct 2012, combination business trip and weekend stay as a tourist. On my previous trips I had selected hotels near the Insurance District, convenient for work but the neighborhood always struck me as rather dingy and dull.  I was much happier with the Royal Gardens' Kensington location.  Station for the Tubes is a quick 2 block walk from the hotel, 20 minutes to Tower Hill or Fenchurch.   Kensington is vibrant with upscale shops, abundant restaurants, attractive residences & Hyde Park green space.  Very pretty and engaging area, had a fantastic weekend strolling the shops, the park and wandering the market on Portobello Road.   Hotel itself is nicely appointed, modern, comfortable, upscale...not stodgy or overdone, but also not stark or edgy.   Staff was helpful and provided great advice about the area.   Food in the bar was actually good, and food in the top floor fine-dining chinese restaurant was excellent.  My room was a decent size for a city hotel, with a large and luxurious bathroom. Deep, deep tub and separate shower, with rain shower-head fixture.  King bed was comfortable and storage space was plentiful, plus desk, lounge chair & flat screen TV.  My room was away from the street and very quiet, and had a great view of Kensington Palace.  No ""Royals"" spotted, however.  Hotel price was in line with inescapable corporate guidelines, always tough to find in London.  I plan to make the Royal  Gardens my go- to hotel for my twice-annual business's trips to the land of the Queen.  ",5,2012,12,08
133,Book direct,Free WIFI if you book direct. Overall good value. Room is new but common areas look dated. Staff is not as friendly as other reviews have said. It doesn't provide turn down service unlike most other 5-star hotel. ,4,2012,12,07
133,Great hotel but our trip was marred.,"I have just returned from a 2 night stay at this lovely hotel.  The rooms are clean, beds comfortable service was great.  Unfortunately, on our first night there the fire alarm went off at 12.50 am and we had to leave our room immediately and congregate on the street outside.  My friend and I only had time to grab our handags and go!  It was freezing cold and we were both wearing only towelling robes and no shoes!  Two other guests very kindly lent one of us a pair of socks and the other a pair of gent's trainers.  There were a few silver foil sheets passed around to the lucky ones!  There was no information on what was going on from the few staff members and it got so bad that we hailed a taxi and paid him just to sit there with his heater on.  After nearly 2 hours we were let into the foyer but no information was forthcoming.  I really feel the hotel should have at least provided a hot drink to us all.    I suppose these things do happen but it should have been handled better by the night staff.  Unfortunately the whole experience left us very tired and our proposed shopping trip for the next day was marred.   
I would still return here again as the location was great, day staff were brilliant, especially the young man on Reception who had Trainee on his badge.  He did arrange for us to have some of our extras on our bill removed due to the inconvenience we had the night before.",4,2012,12,07
133,"If you stayed here before, it is vastly different. For the Better.","We stayed here in 2010 and we found the hotel to be a bit stuffy- far more suited to business people than leisure travelers. I was a bit reluctant to return but I am glad we did.

The location was always excellent. However, this time, there was a marked attitude change with the staff. They are far friendlier and helpful. That applies from reception to dining area staff.

If you like a hearty breakfast, spring for the full English Breakfast. It is a few pounds more than the Continental but well and truly worth it. Additionally, the lunch in the restaurant is in the same price bracket as counter lunches in local hotels- and far superior.

And the Prince of Wales hotel a few blocks away has a great atmosphere.",5,2012,12,05
133,Great hotel in a convenient location,"Have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington. We stayed in a garden view room and it was lovely. A view over Kensington gardens and the room was so comfortable with a nice seating area too. The room was contemporary in style with a beautiful bathroom and a large comfortable bed and large flat screen tv. The staff were super helpful and the concierge arranged our restuarant booking for the Saturday evening. The hotels own Chinese restuarant is extremely popular so book as early as possible. For eating out I can recommend Maggie Jones restuarant which is just around the corner from the hotel, and Ken Lo's Chinese restuarant which is at the Olympia end of Kensington High Street. The hotel is ideally located for the tube station and the Royal Albert Hall. I will definitely be back.",5,2012,12,03
133,Excellent hotel,"We have stayed in this hotel three times over the past couple of years and each time enjoyed our stay. The hotel is conveniently located for a lot of London attractions but particularly for the Royal Albert Hall, a ten minute walk way. From the minute you arrive the staff are attentive to your needs without being 'in your face'. 
The room we had this time was a king size room which had a lovely seating area and a spotless large bathroom. The turn back service was a lovely touch too.
The breakfast was very good with plenty of choice. We also had Afternoon Tea which I can fully recommend. Bertie's Bar located above reception has a very good atmosphere.",5,2012,12,02
133,"Lovely hotel, good experience","I have been to this hotel a couple of times before actually staying here in June 2012. My boyfriend was working in London, and I stayed in this hotel with him.

Rooms are very clean, including bathrooms, linen is soft and toiletries are from White Company and smell lovely. Only thing is that the Queen rooms are quite tiny and only really designed for single occupancy, but my boyfriend and I managed to make it work.

We had a streetview room, but it wasn't noisy at all and on the 8th floor, we had some pretty good views of the city.

I had terrible hayfever whilst staying here, and the staff were happy to provide me with many boxes of tissues! The concierge was also very helpful in recommending restaurants in the area (quite expensive though - this is Kensington!)

The hotel is in a great location, right next to Hyde Park and also close to High St Kensington tube, and a short walk from Notting Hill too.",5,2012,11,27
133,Central location ... Very comfortable,"Great location ... central in the city, off Kenningston Park (like staying off Central Park in NYC). Bit pricey but all London is, and pound conversion adds in.  View can be park view towards Kenningston Palace or busy street .... 10 floors.
Tubes nearby; get a bus map when you buy your 'travel day' pass (or Oyster card). Tube gets you to the river attractions, BB, WAbby, etc, then you can walk. Infomal eateries, cafes nearby. Great neighborhood.
At hotel ... all staff, reception, concierge, resturant, very nice and helpful.  Atmosphere comfortable. Breakfast buffet and ordering very good ... $$$$$ Didn't have dinner. Elevators fit 9 but w/bags 3-4 .... had to wait, wait (eventually went up to go down, and also took the stairs). Room comfortable, bed and pillows good. Some rooms have elevated sitting/desk area ... be careful if steps!  Bath room ample BUT shower stall (with door opening only in) very small ... almost can't get in/out .... so big people be aware!
If driving, you can park there. Cabs there. ",4,2012,11,26
133,Perfect London Stay,"Traveled with my husband and two college age daughters to London for Thanksgiving weekend (November 22-25). Attractive hotel with two great restaurants (we ate dinner at both). The Continental breakfast (included) was perfect and served in a pretty dining room overlooking the park. Our rooms were quiet, nicely furnished and very comfortable with wonderful views. Lovely bathrooms with shower and separate tub.The excellent maid service freshened up our rooms twice daily. Views at night from the top floor bar/restaurant were beautiful - do not miss that! Concierge service was friendly and helpful. My only suggestion to the management would be to please add free internet. In this day and age I think a hotel of this caliber (and price) should just go ahead and include free Wi-Fi.",5,2012,11,26
133,Always a great stay,"I have just returned from my second stay at the Royal Garden Hotel, Kensington. The location of the hotel is fantastic. High Street Ken station is about a 5 minutes walk away, with plenty great stores also along the same walk. The hotel staff are great too, and the breakfast is awesome. summer stays here are particularly awesome as the hotel borders on Hyde Park. The rooms are a little on the small side, but most London hotels have similar sized rooms. 

The rates we paid were great for a 5 star hotel, and to top it off the Springboks were staying there too. On our previous visit the Proteas were also in house. I will suggest this hotel for any leisure travellers.",5,2012,11,26
133,Royal Garden Hotel excellent location!,"This is a top notch hotel for anyone visiting London- very convenient to public transportation (both bus and the Tube). Lovely rooms, excellent service, and a really great breakfast to start your day. Pricey, but there are no inexpensive hotels in London, are there?",5,2012,11,23
133,Lovely Weekend,"My husband stayed last weekend in the Royal Garden Hotel at Kensington, London. A lovely hotel, very luxurious. The staff were both friendly and helpful. The hotel is right next to Kensington Gardens and the Royal Palace. The food was brilliant, especially the evening meal.

Would certainly go again.",5,2012,11,22
133,Small details.,"Very central, very good service. Taking into account the emerging markets such as Brazil, Angola and Portuguese tourists, the hotel does not have one single tv channel in portuguese. think about it! Small details make a difference, besides when you have 15 channels in arab language.",4,2012,11,21
133,Fantastic stay. Highly recommended,"We stayed at the Royal Garden with six friends as we were attending the Royal Variety Performance at the Royal Albert Hall.  Absolutely perfect location.  The reception staff always friendly and helpful from the very start of our visit....even though that they couldn't tell me if One Direction was staying with them.....and we missed them....that was sad.  We did however meet a terrific young band called The Vamps which made up for the disappointment.  We were all very comfortable in the dining area as we were all very chatty with our new found friends, but the staff carried on around us with great efficiency and we were all made feel as if it didn't matter at all that we were taking our time with sheer enjoyment of our stay.

Our rooms were very spacious and very, very comfortable.  Beds and pillows just right.  This was 
the best hotel in a long time for cleanliness.  The bathroom was so shiny that I couldn't stop looking at it.....was told that it was 'just water' that kept the shower door so sparkly....amazing.

The view from our panoramic window over Kensington High Street was fantastic and with the windows closed was not noisy at all.  loved it.

Yes, you could say that the hotel is expensive, but we say that you get what you pay for and that is 5 star pure class!!",5,2012,11,20
133,a very high stanard,"Maybe it's unfair me writing this review as I don't normally like big modern hotels. It would be hard therefore for me to give this 5 stars.  

I stayed for a conference and given the shear numbers being catered for the food and service was actually superb.  The evenning menu was a cut above the usual conference fayre and the pride the waiting staff took in the way they served the tables was quite exceptional.

The room was lovely with some nice features and great views over the roofs of London.  There was a huge selection for breakfast and everything was tasty and very fresh.

Every member of staff seemed desperate to go that extra mile, nothing was too much trouble.

The downsides then... This wouldn't be a great place if you were in a hurry.  One lift was out of order but even taking this into account the lift waiting time seemed quite lengthy.  The breakfast and reception queues seemed to qet quite long.  To be fair this might have been due to the lovely personallised service given by the staff but even so it wouldn't suite those in a rush.

The wifi was a bit a confusing - there was a a plug in thingy which I didn't quite understand and the wifi seemed to be payable at ¬£5. If I have got this wrong Royal Garden I humbly apologies. But for a business hotel the whole thing seemed a little troublesome.

The bed was a little hard and didn't really have that comfy, fluffy ""hotel"" feel that I'd expect (pillows were lovely though). I slept well but not as well a some other hotels.

I am probably being picky.  Its a lovely hotel and the staff are probably the best I've ever encountered in any place ever.",4,2012,11,13
133,Worth a stay just for the views,"This is our preferred place to stay in London. 
Although a little way from the tourist centre of town, the location and the views over Hyde Park make this hotel hard to beat, it would be worth a stay just for the views. We also love to walk in the park, it takes about 40 minutes steady walk up to Oxford Street, about half that to Harrods.
If arriving by car the corkscrew descent to the underground parking can be a challenge for larger vehicles, the fee is ¬£35 per day. Kensington High Street underground is just 5 mins walk.
The welcome at reception was as good as ever, friendly and efficient. Rooms are generally a good size and well equipped. A high floor with Park View, 6 or above, is best for amazing views of the London skyline.
The old Park Terrace Lounge (our favourite late afternoon retreat for drinks) is sadly gone, to accommodate an enlarged and face-lifted breakfast / dining area. Bertie`s bar is the alternative and service there is good, but there are no windows and the bar does not open until 5 pm. However they do have an early evening discount of 25% off champagne, so we got used to it!
Breakfast is a mixture of buffet (hot and cold selection) and A la Carte. Quality and service is good, look out for room deals including breakfast otherwise it can look a bit expensive.
The recent makeover has certainly improved the rooms for comfort and soundproofing. Unlike many hotels the Climate Control works effectively and quietly. The large separate shower with powerful water supply is a real plus, and the large beds also very comfortable. Newspapers are complimentary.
We did not try the hotels 10th floor (Chinese) restaurant on this visit, but we have previously found it very good.  Views from here must be some of the very best in London and if you have the time to eat in, try it.
Even after 30 plus years we are always drawn back here, still our favourite and highly recommended for a long week-end or a business visit.",5,2012,11,13
133,Brilliantly located,"This hotel 's location is perfect -right in the heart of Kensington! A few minutes walk from the tube and with great views over the London skyline or park, depending on whether your room is at the front or rear.  I'd suggest a high floor to get the best of the views (and to keep you away from the inevitable noises from the street/road below).

I travel a little with work and always struggle to get a good nights sleep, but actually this hotel was great for bed comfort and quality of duvet and pillows etc.  The rooms are on the small side if you are staying in a standard room, but for London, it was probably a fairly average size overall. I stayed at this hotel as I was attending a conference and evening awards ceremony and I must say that the food quality and standard was all excellent. 

The overall service was also very good, and I liked the turn down service especially.

It's a great hotel and we got an excellent deal because of the conference package, but I agree with others comments that the general cost is on the high side.",4,2012,11,13
133,Nice Hotel,Our family stayed here for 5 nights.  Good location and the hotel was very clean and the staff very helpful.  The breakfast area was great.  We were able to walk to a lot of local sightseeing spots and the Tube was fairly close by.  Also we had no problem getting a cab whenever we wanted.,5,2012,11,12
133,mixed feelings,"Stayed there two weeks ago as part of a group.  Good room on 6th floor, nice view across roofs, large bathroom.  Daughter was on 3rd floor overlooking the road - do not book lower room with this outlook.  The noise from the home-going nightclub-goers was appalling.   Son's room on same floor, on the other side of the corridor was quiet, but he had to ask reception to remove the gentleman passed out outside his door.  This is a very large hotel, and there were at least two business seminars and one wedding going on over the weekend, so very busy.  We were taken aback on the first day, going into breakfast to be told ""your package doesn't include a cooked breakfast so you have to pay extra"".  I thought I was in a 2 star hotel, and felt embarrassed..  My daughter did not realise, and paid an enormous amount for baked beans for her 6 year old!  The hotel's situation is fantastic - the park and shops, plus underground station within minutes.  The concierge is knowledgeable and helpful.  The staff do their best, but as in most large hotels, the rules can take over commonsense - i.e. do not have more than 5 people sitting round a table in the downstairs bar or you will be asked to move elsewhere. Plenty of attention during breakfast - for the first ten minutes anyway.  There was one exceptional older waitress whose name I did not catch who was more human than trained .employee.  We were a family business group, and the business side seemed well organised.",4,2012,11,10
133,Hmmmmm,"I booked the hotel in the same evening after making the mistake to enjoy too much their top floor views over the Hyde Park and the city and overenjoy their drinks.

Despite having their prices in the same bracket as the Dorchester, the room layout seemed to be more like a Hilton/Premier Inn.  A small room overlooking the road from the upper floors, hence being woken up by the noises of High Street Kensington but having good bed sheets and bathroom towels and toiletries.

Probably not going to make the same mistake again.",4,2012,11,09
133,Lovely stay!,"I recently spent the weekend at this hotel. I can't fault it at all. It was as expected, stylish, immaculate, well presented and had everything I was looking for. Great location. When using the car park be careful not to drive into the Israeli embassy next door and note that they have a height limit so unless you know how to drop your suspension on anything of range rover height, you'll need to park elsewhere.",5,2012,11,05
133,Perfect hotel bothered by inconsistent service,"We recently had the great opportunity to spend 5 days at the Royal Garden Hotel located in the Kensington High Street/Hyde Park area.  I will expound later on the epicness of the location.  Perfect in pretty much all ways. 
Our stay started pretty crappily.  We flew in from LAX and had a car service deliver us to the hotel.  9 total people in our group.  They had hired a box truck to deliver our luggage.  The driver weaved his way up the driveway (not easy with all of the parked taxis and luxury cars in the way) and made it to the front.  At this point, we could have dragged our bags out of the back in about 90 seconds.  No such luck.  Front door guys (dressed silly, but awesome) directed our driver to push it off to the side.  Just mostly blocking the exit to their roundabout.  This took copious amounts of time.  Parked up.  Great.  Let's grab our bags and get to our rooms!  No such luck.  Security dude (or someone) wouldn't let us offload our stuff.  Pretty boring at this stage of the game.  After traveling for about 19 hours, with room keys in hand, it pretty much sucks to be held up by a dude power tripping.  I think that we just overruled his reality and grabbed all of our bags (in about 60 seconds).  We move stuff around in a very quick and efficient manner for our work.  We are good at this.  
Up to the room.  Wait, no elevators.  Oh, the first one is available.  Nope, not for you.  Velvet rope.  Only for the VIP's.  Clearly, we are not VIP's.  Just look at us!  Other guests were even less patient than us and pushed in front of us instead of standing in the rear of the very obvious line.  Blimey!
Minutes later, nirvana.  In my room.  Super tiny.  My biggest issue was how to place my bags so as not to trip myself in the middle of the night when I go to pee. I sorted it out pretty quickly.  Next task, open the blinds.  Ooh, la, la.  View of the park.  Super stoked!
Next on the agenda, makes some iced tea.  Hot water maker.  Check.  Tea bags.  Check.  Ice.  Wah, wah.  Call downstairs, no problem.  Bucket of ice to the room within 5 minutes.  Pleasantly.  
As stated prior, location is key to this property.  I have spent an awful lot of time in London.  This is my favorite area.  Being adjacent to Hyde Park is pretty much the best thing ever.  There is so much to see and explore walking throughout the park.  We had pretty great weather so it made it even nicer.  It never gets boring.  For me.  
Also, pretty much everything that you need is at your fingertips.  Tons of restaurants close by.  our favorite ended up being India Kitchen, or something like that.  About 5 blocks away and super tasty morsels.  
Now the reason for the 1 star deduction.  All day long, this is a 5 star hotel.  The service was hit and miss throughout our stay. Dumb little stuff that drives us crazy (we travel ALOT).  I will spend over 200 nights in hotels this year.  When you look at me, you would never guess that over time I would bring an awful lot of money to the travel and hospitality industry.  Looks can be deceiving, folks. 
Housekeeping:  All very nice.  All very friendly in the hallways.  Very thorough in the rooms.  I specifically put my stuff in different spots throughout the room.  Places that work for me.  Do not take all of my receipts and stuff and move them to a ""better"" spot.  Very annoying.  There were multiple complaints from my compadres about housekeeping ignoring the Do Not Disturb light and coming in while we were gone. 
Mini Bar stockers.  These people need to be talked to.  All of us had instances where our Do Not Disturb lights were on and they attempted to come into our rooms.  Like they had some sort of Diplomatic Immunity.  Let me fill you in on the Royal Garden's Do Not Disturb set up.  Pretty much the best ever.  Genius.  Foolproof.  There is a switch by the door.  You flip it up, a red light goes on in the hallway that indicates ""Do Not Disturb"".  You flip it down, a red light goes on in the hallway that indicates ""Service my room at your leisure"".  No floppy sign that can fall off of the handle or be stolen.  Really NO WAY to be confused about the status of the room.  On my last day, I hear a knock at the door.  3 Mini bar folks ready to come in and make sure that I am not stealing their stuff (I am exaggerating here).  ""Oh, sorry, we didn't see your light"".  Really?  Your face is 2 feet from it.  It's right there.  On the wall.  Light is red.  Red means Do Not Disturb.  Your code, not mine.  Pretty easy one to figure out.  This stuff drives us crazy!
Back to the outside greeters in the awesome costumes.  Dudes look great.  Very regal.  You would have thought that each one of us was a carrier of the black plague.  They viewed us with such disdain that it was pretty unbelievable.  I know that there were no Christmas bonuses being earned off of our stay (9 rooms for about 6 nights), but hey, incoming money is money.  Especially in these times.  Pretty crappy and uncomfortable.  Lame if you ask me.  It wasn't just me.  Everyone in our group felt the same way.  We even walked across the street to meet our car service in the rain so that we wouldn't have to inconvenience the helper dudes.  Over it. 
Front desk staff was super nice. 
I ordered ice from Room Service about 6 times.  Each time it was delivered very quickly (within 5 minutes, except for one 30 minute wait).  Our very last day I did not receive my order.  That was disconcerting but I overlooked it.  
Reader's Digest version: Beautiful (yet small) rooms.  Great view.  Perfect location.  Nice hotel.  Great staff except for a few.  
If you dress nicer than we do, the front guys will probably treat you like royalty.  I am not going to change my appearance for them.",4,2012,11,05
133,You can't always go home.,"I used to stay in this hotel all the time back in the late 80's and decided to bring my wife here on a recent visit.  The hotel has since gone through at least ownership change since my last.  The hotel was nice enough, though I would say over priced.   I choose and paid extract for a park view room, which had a beautiful view.  However, the room was small and had some form of platform built in the middle, which made the space event more fractured. 

The location is great, but would say this is pretty much a business hotel.  I love Kenningston but I would guess there are many, more cozy, hotels to say in this immediate area.  Very expensive",4,2012,11,05
133,Quality but watch out for the Car Park !,"A smashing Hotel, I stay there at least a couple of times a year around the Xmas period and have done for many years. I'd suggest a room with a view of the Park. The breakfast room/bar area was refurbished a couple of years ago and is very nice.
I suppose the only criticism is the Underground Car Park attached to the Hotel, it seems to go down in a spiral to near to the centre of the Earth, its so tight that you really have to be a good Driver, or have a very small car to get in and out without destroying at least 1 of your alloy wheels !",5,2012,11,02
133,Excellent Customer Service,"You can tell whether an establishment has the Customer Service culture embedded - and during my 9 days' stay at this hotel, this culture is prevalent at all levels of the hotel. This alone speaks volumes for the quality of the service - from the doorman to the General Manager. 

I travel extensively for both business and pleasure - in each country, you try to find a ""niche"" hotel to stay - and for London - this is the ""Niche"" - it is good value for money, a tad high, but worth it.

Location of course, is also key.",5,2012,11,02
133,Great value,"Very pleased with hotel. Good location - next to Kensington Palace and Hyde Park, 5 mins from subway. I got the weekend rate, which was fantastic for London. My room overlooked the city skyline, and everything in the room was ""just right"". Very efficient use of space, to the point that it got this Japanese feel. Will definitely go back.",5,2012,11,01
133,"Wonderful, wonderful experience","This hotel is one of the best value hotels we have used. We emerged from another hotel very disillusioned, but the Royal Garden Hotel was an accidental, but wonderful, experience. Best value in London.  We even stayed another night. The staff are amazing and everything this hotel says on their website is true from our experience.  Thank you Royal Garden Hotel for making our stay in London the very best it could be.",5,2012,10,30
133,Top quality and good value in London,"Very happy with this hotel; well-appointed room, quiet, with great views over Kensington Gardens, efficient and friendly staff, good quality food and drinks, excellent location, and very good value by London standards",4,2012,10,29
133,Not disappointed,"Stayed hear for 3 nights at the end september in a suite.  Location to tubes/restaurants etc is fantastic.  Concierge is one of the best I have encountered.  Hotel accommodated an extra early check in (so i could get changed) with no problem.  The restaurant is above average however as there are often business meetings taking place it can become crowded. 
Breakfast was excellent - mackeral fillets a personal recommendation!
Mini bar expensive and also some varied gifts for sale in the room - including CDs and gifts, not entirely sure the relevance!

All in all well worth the ""premium price"" for the service alone.  Sadly wish i had not been on business as i do not feel i had the opportunity to really utilise the facilities and convenient position to all central london has to offer.

Black Cabs always parked outside the hotel reception which made life much easier.",5,2012,10,26
133,Royal garden hotel review,"We stayed one night here recently and had a fabulous time. We had asked for a quiet room and were given one on the eighth floor looking over the back. It was very quiet, the view was great and the bed was very comfortable. Having been to see Aston Villa lose rather dismally at Craven Cottage this hotel did cheer us up. Next morning we even saw the Everton squad preparing to o to QPR which was very exciting. I must say David Moyes appears masterful! The only thing I wasn't so keen on was dinner in the Chinese restaurant. It was very beautiful and smart but I did not enjoy my dinner as much as I hoped. However It was high quality and nicely presented so I think it's me not liking Chinese food that much. All in all a lovely pace to stay and a well stocked minibar to keep one's strength up.",4,2012,10,23
133,Fab Birthday Treat,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Royal Garden last weekend.  Quiet room on the 9th floor, spotlessly clean, very comfortable beds, good quality bathroom with The White Company toiletries.  Friendly, efficient staff, huge breakfast choice but cooked food could have been hotter.  Dinner in the Park Terrace Restaurant delicious.  Sorry we could'nt stay longer.",5,2012,10,22
133,used to be amazing,"I have stayed at this hotel for many years while on business in London, and the hotel is great and location is amazing and staff are wonderful, whats changed ? a nightclub has opened, do not know when but i have stayed for 2 nights this week and both nights my sleep has been disturbed by a new club. A very disappointing experience and this has turned a wonderful hotel into something more a kind to a ""west end"" hotel which is awful. Its a real shame this hotel that was so suitable for business travellers has become a hotel more focused on entertainment for people who are not staying in the hotel.",1,2012,10,18
133,Overnight Stay when attending concert at The Albert Hall,"Chose this hotel because it was easy walking distance to the Albert Hall, upgraded to a garden room which gave us fabulous views over the park well worth the extra ¬£40. Easy to get to as we arrived by train 5mins from Kensington underground.
We thought it was a lovely hotel, great position for a stroll in the park.Lots of really good affordable restaurants nearby. Also easy shopping in Kensington.
The bar is also open late which was appreciated on our return from the concert. Would certainly use again.",5,2012,10,17
133,One perfect night,"I spent a night here with two of my sisters celebrating a 50th Birthday, we had an executive triple room on the 9th floor. It had spectacular views over London only surpassed by the views from the Bar on the 10th Floor which look directly east over Hyde Park. From check in to check out 24 hours later we could not have had better service. Everyone without exception went out of their way to make the stay special. The room was very spacious and even with three of us didn't feel crowded, the bathroom was similarly spacious. Everywhere was spotlessly clean. The location is perfect for Hyde Park, Kensington Palace and Royal Albert Hall. We ate out in a local restaurant and were spoiled for choice only a few minutes walk into Kensington High Street. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel but went to The Orangery at Kensington Palace for brunch which was amazing. The ohly reason I haven't given 5 stars is that you have to go outside the building and in another lift to get to the spa. No chance of nipping down to the sauna and steam room in your dressing gown!
All in all highly recommended and I wish we had stayed two nights.",4,2012,10,15
133,Well located adjacent to Kensington Gardens,I was not quite as impressed with this hotel as previous comments so maybe was a little unlucky. I found the hotel too corporate & impersonal.  Staff at check in so so - concierge likewise.  Room was fine - bed dipped a bit in middle - probably where twins were pushed together. Liked the big TV fixed into the wall opposite bed.  Bathroom was excellent & very clean.  Really enjoyed the bath & separate shower very high quality - everything worked very efficiently.  Breakfast was rather confusing initially & quite expensive - different concept to normal but staff very pleasant & very comfortable seating - a nice bright room.  Didn't find the staff so good when we had a drink in the bar in the late afternoon (same room) - unsmiling & had to get their attention to order & to reorder. Internet access very expensive. Had lunch at the Chinese restaurant on the 10th floor - excellent & lovely view of Kensington Gardens - a  lovely park to stroll around.,4,2012,10,14
133,birthday treat,"Six of us stayed here for a weekend break and a trip to the Albert Hall for my wife's birthday. The whole experience was fantastic, including the weather. We started with drinks in the bar @ 5pm followd by the Theatre Supper. After the event we returned to the bar where we had some drinks and a birthday cake celebration.Full english b/fast was excellent, and all the staff very attentive and service was good. Special mention to Marta for organising the cake and coming to check all was good. Also to Gregg the Concierge who managed to fix us all up with a trip on teh Duck at very short notice.Great time.Only difficulty was price of carpark,which is NCP and really not good value",5,2012,10,12
133,Short break,"Arrived in London for the Classic Brits outside appearance of the Hotel not good but inside it was fabulous. The receptionist was very helpful and pleasant and the porter rushed over to take our bags. It is certainly right you get what you pay for. We opted for continental breakfast which was nice didn't think it was very good value but there was lots of choice. The maid service in the rooms was excellant towels changed twice daily if needed and toiletries and tea and coffee replaced both morning and night along with a turn down service.  
Lots of shops and eateries in the area. Went into the corner shop opposite for some items found this was very expensive for a seen better days corner shop.
 This was one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in and would stay here again",5,2012,10,08
133,Kensington on the park,"Twice I have stayed here and on both occassions found the location and accomodation excellent.

Adjacent to Kensigton palace and park 5 minutes walk from the Royal Albert Hall in the heart of Kensigton its an ideal location and easy to reach by car with valet parking available.

The rooms over looking Kensington High St are a little noisier than those overlooking the park and of course the view is superior too but the accomodation is the same and a high standard of quality.

Staff are efficient and always courteous and although I have only taken breakfast here the choice of tastes and quality are wide ranging and first rate.

If visiting the Royal Albert Hall ifor an event ts a natural choice.",5,2012,10,08
133,"Three friends, One night in London and the hotel","Two friends and I stayed here for one night. The staff was friendly and helpful we arrived before checkin, they took care of our bags even our friends who was not staying at the hotel was able to leave his bag. We were three people sharing one executive room, with the most amazing view of hyde park. The bed was large enough for the three of us to share, and it was really comfortable. Since we arrived back late from shopping and were tired the hotel recommended a great Indian place they also called and booked a table for us. There are lots of shops near the hotel, and is close to metro and bus. We arrived the same day Stoke was to play Chelsea, and the Stoke team was staying at the hotel. 

It did have to call down to the desk a few times before our bags were delivered to our room, but that is not that important.",5,2012,10,02
133,Good standard business hotel,"Rooms are clean, good afternoon tea in the restaurant overlooking the park, excellent Chinese restaurant on the upper level and nice concierge.  The only thing lacking in the hotel is charm and personality.  But if you are on a business trip those are generally at the bottom of the list.",4,2012,10,01
133,Business convention,"Stayed here recently for a few days for a business convention. The events people at the hotel are the best I have ever come across and the quality of the food served during the event was first class.

On previous visits I have had a garden facing room which is larger and very quiet. On this occassion I had a smaller room over Kensington High Street. Noise was not a problem and the room was adequate but not particularly spacious.

My rate was B&B which includes breakfast served in the room at no extra cost - a real treat.

A great hotel, with excellent staff in a perfect location.",5,2012,09,28
133,Brief Business Trip: Solid,"Central London location is very convenient.  Walk, Tube, Bus, Taxi to many of London's most popular locations and shopping venues.  I was in the city for a brief business trip, and the hotel had everything I needed.  Staff very helpful.  Concierges were top notch.  On the expensive side.  Although I needed internet access during my stay, I do not recommend paying the hotel's rates (34.00 GBP for 24 hours, 5.00 GBP for 2 hours).  Far too expensive.  Starbucks right across the street with free wireless (please make a courtesy purchase of a beverage and/or food item)",4,2012,09,27
133,"Great Hotel, Great Location, Great Service","Stayed at the Royal Garden on business. Had a suite overlooking Hyde Park. Really good Service, great room, and brilliant location. No complaints at all. It is highly recommended for a business trip, plus holiday destination. Proximity is perfect.",5,2012,09,25
133,Best London Hotel Stay Ever!,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel with our two small boys and had a fabulous experience. 

We cannot say enough about the excellent service and attention to detail.  We stayed in a one bedroom suite overlooking Kensington Park - the perfect set up for our family!  Our favorite part of the room was the spacious bathroom.  Both of our boys loved going for ""a swim"" in the colossal tub! 

The location was also ideal - close to the park, great shopping and a gorgeous Whole Foods! We will definitely return to The Royal Garden Hotel next chance we get.",5,2012,09,22
133,Perfect location for a perfect Hotel,"Not what I would call a pretty buliding... but once you enter, things change and you find yourself in a perfectly well kept immaculate 5* hotel. Feeindly Staff, you feell at home and welcome at all times of the day. 
The location is perfect and allows you to enjoy axperience diffrent London areas in a great way.
The parc is right at your feets, we enjoyed renting nearby bikes and relax. Great shopping and restaurants are also nearby.
The hotel has a great chinese restaurant on the top floor with an amazing view.
I particulary enjoyed Antonio's Negroni's at the bar and very well made classic Irish coffes !
This hotel is defenitively one of my favourites in London, you get great value for money !",5,2012,09,19
133,Excellent hotel,"My partner and I stayed at this hotel back in January 2011.  There's not much to say other than perfect.  It is in a great location, especially for us as we had an evening at the Albert Hall.  The view over looking the main street was okay however being that little bit higher up in the hotel I enjoyed the roof top view as it had a feeling of being in a different country, I think the snow added to that.  The room was excellent, spacious, very clean and had everything you could need. The food was great, the main course (steak) was cooked to perfection, the best steak I have ever had.  I would strongly reccommend this hotel, especially with such friendly staff.",5,2012,09,16
133,Best hotel in Kensington,"We have stayed at this hotel a few times, most recently for a birthday celebration weekend.  We stayed in a 'garden' room with views across Kensington Gardens.  Cannot fault the rooms, the service or the food.  Without doubt the best hotel in the Kensington area!",5,2012,09,16
133,Great Location,"Great location for shopping, (High Street Kensington/Notting Hill).  Right beside Kensington Gardens,   many nice brasserie style restaurants and bars nearby. Approx 50 mins to Heathrow via Tube.  Hotel is pricey but 4 star ..worth shopping around booking.com etc. for better rates. Nice rooms, bright and very clean.  Book back of hotel for less street noise or view of the park.",4,2012,09,11
133,Very good location for a business trip,"I stayed at the Hotel during a conference held in the Hotel. The event was a great success, the location of the Hotel is ideal to combine business and leisure, the room was good (did have the ""normal"" room) the suites overlooking the park are great, the service was good and breakfast is excellent. Will come back for a leisure trip for sure to explore the area around the Hotel a bit more. Kensington is a top spot for your morning run. All together not a luxury destination but a very good 4+ Hotel.",4,2012,09,11
133,excellent for a short stay,"i`ve spent only a night here and for this purpose it`s an excellent place, for longer stay i would choose something bigger. if you have something to do in the area late in the night its better to stay here and then go to work than take a taxi/private hire.

pros:
- nice room, yes small BUT its the standard in the city
- comfortable bed & chair, for one person its perfect
- good location in a pretty upscale `hood for a reasonable price (by london standards)
- despite its right at a noisy road, the noise reduction is fairly good (3rd floor), dunno anything about the night club that others mentioned as it is monday now.
- better to use the stairs than the escalators, perfect for fitness

cons:
- the air conditioning doesn`t do a good job in heating up the room
- no views but then again its central london
- while the noise reduction is good dont expect a quiet place
- breakfast only from 7:30, if you leave earlier (like me) you are likely to miss it...",4,2012,09,10
133,The ultimate luxury break,"What a fabulous anniversary weekend we have just had at this hotel. Have always had fantastic service and love the luxurious rooms. Thanks to a marvellous upgrade we got to experience a suite overlooking the park. What a view, what a room! (Two rooms, a lobby, two bathrooms, a dining room and a fully stocked, large mini bar. All immaculate.)Took our two junior monsters and they were treated royally by the staff, as ever. Nothing is too much trouble in this hotel and I felt truly pampered, not to mention stuffed, after the sumptuous breakfast we consumed! I cannot wait to go back.",5,2012,09,10
133,Perfect for after the Proms,"We booked the Royal Garden because of its location next to Kensington Palace for a special evening to save having to get the night bus home after the Last Night of the Proms at the nearby Albert Hall. It's literally a 10 minute walk away from the venue.

The room was spacious, although sadly although we were on the Gardens side we were only on the second floor so had no view (though we could see the tops of the trees!). The decor seemed to be very fresh and the bathroom was palatial, with a huge bath and a separate generously sized shower with both an overhead and a hand held attachment, which once I'd worked out how to use, was very welcome. 

Tea and coffee making facilities were available though hidden away in a cupboard. The fridge was well stocked with goodies, most of which were hugely over-priced, but this is typical in all hotels I've been to. An example was a jar of sweets for ¬£6.75 - potted M&Ms! The fridge itself was more effective than some I've come across and kept our bottle of water well chilled.

The bed was vast and a bit on the firm side.  Having an illuminated clock/DAB radio/iPod dock on the bedside cabinet was very welcome.

Beware if you don't like seeing yourself - there are mirrors everywhere - all down one side of the entrance, on the front of the wardrobe which takes up one side of the room, and on both sides in the bathroom. 

There was a huge TV which also had connections for most gadgets you could think of in case you wanted to plug in your video camera, computer, etc.

We had the continental breakfast which was a good selection of fruit, cold meat, cheese, cereals, yoghurt, pastries, rolls etc. It was possible to upgrade to full English for ¬£4.50 but we didn't as we were having lunch. Service was gracious, prompt and friendly.

If we can save up enough Avios we will definitely stay here again next time we go to a concert at the Albert Hall.",5,2012,09,09
133,Pure luxury,"What a superb hotel, in a great location for museums and the parks. We received a superb upgrade and met some pop stars at breakfast. A truly memorable stay with service which was second to none. Food was of a top standard, and the view from the suite was unreal !",5,2012,09,06
133,Best ¬£20 spent on lunch in London,"When we booked this restaurant for Sunday lunch, we did so because we had tickets for the 360 Theatre very close by. 
I must say expectations were not high because of the price, which was ¬£20 for 2 courses.
However, what a marvellous surprise we had!
We found it difficult to chose from the menu as the options were all favourites.
Portions were not small either.
The food was excellent, at least 4 star service and frankly we enjoyed the lunch far better than
the show!",5,2012,08,29
133,Perfect weekend,"Have recently returned from a stay at the Royal Garden Hotel where we made to feel so very special. Every single memeber of staff we met went out of their way to make us feel so very welcome and we felt that their manner was 100 % genuine. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a garden suite room which was out of this world. We had breakfast both days which was excellent, the choice of food was brilliant. On our last night we had a meal in the Park Terrace which was very good. 
Everything about our stay at this  hotel was perfect, but it was the staff that made it such a special weekend for us.
Hope to be able to return later in the year.",5,2012,08,24
133,A secret no more,"The Park Terrace restaurant on the ground floor of the Royal Garden Hotel has for long been a well kept secret among us foodies.   My wife says I must be mad to let the wider world know about it, but it really is superb and amazing value for money considering this is a five star hotel.  We ate lunch there today for the umpteenth time and, as always, we we not disappointed.  The set lunch is ¬£16.50 for two courses, ¬£20 for three.   Astonishingly good value, with no corners cut.  There is plenty of choice, the portions are generous, though elegantly presented, and the service under the watchful eye of maitre d' Massimo is faultless.  Today, I chose roast lamb, red cabbage and dauphinoise potatoes after a starter of para and mushrooms,  and finished with a board of five English cheeses.    My wife had a haddock starter, fish cakes and apple crumble.   With a two glasses of champagne and two of Sancerre ros√©, the bill was ¬£82.83, without service.     The tables are well spaced, and the view across Kensington Gardens to Kensington Palace through floor to ceiling windows is simply stunning.
Five star it may be - deservedly - but there is nothing stuffy about the Park Terrace.    As we were leaving, they were setting the tables for afternoon tea.    That is a road test for another time maybe.",5,2012,08,17
133,Ming Jiang - wines expensive but overall worth it as it's very good!,"The Royal Garden Hotel is one of those special places! I first stayed there in 1970 and it has always been my venue of choice for parties and celebrations. They can do no-wrong in my book! 

Ming Jiang opened about 18 months ago and is without doubt one of the most expensive Chinese restaurants in the UK - but boy is it worth it!!

Situated on the 10th floor it offers a unique view of London over Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. it is very busy so booking is essential. The clientele are a mix of hotel guests and non-residents. All very upmarket, reflecting the area and the prices on the menu! The bar area is very comfortable and they have a good coktail menu. The layout and decor is top notch - you know you are somewhere special.

The staff are lovely, Chinese in the main with some staff from elsewhere in the hotel. The chefs come out from the kitchen to carve the duck dishes (an essential pre-order) so service is at the high standard you'd expect.

The food is high end Chinese, not the sort of dishes you'd find in your local take-away so take care as some of the sauces are very hot/spicy. Starters are beautifully presented. Middle course (duck) includes 2 sauces and slices of skin that are sublime - no good for dieters, and main courses are big enough for 2 to share. 

Wines are very good but far too expensive. Takes the cost to a stratospheric level, Champaign at min ¬£70 a bottle or ¬£15 a glass and house wines at ¬£45 a bottle for something you'd get in Sainsbury‚Äôs for ¬£6.99 is just too much. They'd do a lot better working on their selection which I reckon is a hangover from the original continental style 10th floor restaurant. i noticed a lot of people we opting for beers and soft drinks!

Overall a great experience but one to keep for special occasions!",4,2012,08,17
133,London Olympics,"We would like to say a big thank to the whole Royal Garden Hotel staff for a great job they all have done throughout our project connected with hosting Russian delegations here in London during the Olympics. Thanks for your patience and a great performance. There were minor mistakes but together we still did incredibly well. We do hope to work with your wonderful team again on our future projects.

Best regards, 
Sports Lab Plus Team",5,2012,08,16
133,"Elegant luxury, coveniently situated","We stayed in the Royal Garden during the Olympics. With easy access to the tube it was ideally situated to travel to and fron the olympic stadium. Very convenient also for shopping, strolls in the park and shows in the Royal Albert Hall.",4,2012,08,15
133,Impressive (very),A really good hotel - could not fault anything. Had a fabulous room on the top floor with views over London - very comfy beds with very good quality linen. Restaurant and bar also on the top floor with stunning views Kensington Park. The staff and service were absolutely first class - very friendly and efficient. Location is also very good - very near High St Ken tube so easy to get round and about. Would definitely return.,5,2012,08,12
133,"Location, Location & Location","I stayed here on a business trip and the same was arranged by our client. We were pleasantly surprised about the location - located right on Kensington High Street and just next door to the Kensington Palace Gardens..(where LNM stays along with a few consulates).

The rooms are small but very neat and comfortable. I was on Level8 with a city view which was quite stunning - unfortunately didnt get the Hyde Park view which I am sure would be better. 

The breakfast was decent and the staff/people very courteous and hospitable. I used to take walks in the KPG next door (no cars allowed) and get out of the other side where Cafe Diana is located.

All in all a very no-nonsense, satisfactory experience with enough bragging rights on the location.",4,2012,08,11
133,Getting what you pay for: you pay a lot here and you get a lot,"Ok, you are probably going to pay a pretty penny to stay here, but the good news is even if your wallet is emptier, you will very likely be happy. The hotel rooms are very clean, modern, have lots of gadgets (remotes for TV, digital clock radio etc). They are smallish but not ridiculously so, and you are in downtown London after all. Its quiet. you can't hear the neighbours or the street. The breakfast room is lovely, hushed, pleasant for extended newspaper reading or meeting a friend for a quiet chat. There's a business centre for printing and PC work. The restaurant on the top floor is good chinese (though with a bit of attitude). Beds are comfy, toiletries thorough. There's a gym attached nextdoor which is adequate if you want a whizzoo on the bike or a pseudo run (though why you wouldn't run in Kensington Gardens next story is a mystery to me). Shopping is out the front door, across the street and a block or two away in H&M or Marks and Spencer, Monsoon - all the High Street names - as is the Tube. Tea kettle in room with Earl Grey, sugar and milk. You couldn't fit a cot in an average room with lots of luggage comfortably but two people - no problem. They might have bigger rooms for kids. Housekeeping staff are thoughtful and attentive. Front desk staff - nothing is too much effort, and they seem to be multilingual.",5,2012,08,09
133,I love this hotel,"I have stayed here before ... it is a little pricey but having had a horrible experience at the Hilton Olympia early in the week, it is worth the price. 

The hotel is SO clean.  The rooms are small but SO WHAT and I have never had a bad room (stayed there 3-4 times).  While I have never had a Hyde Park view, the small rooms have huge windows and good-sized desks so a quiet, nice place to work.

They mistakenly charged me the Olympic rate for whole stay.  When I suggested that may not be appropriate for whole stay they reversed the Olympic rate for all nights but Friday which was opening ceremony night so that struck me as fair.

For the first time, I ate at the hotel restaurant on the top floor.  It is Chinese which is not my favorite, but the dim sum was fantastic and the view INCREDIBLE.  You can see most of Hyde Park and all of the way to the ferris wheel down town.  It had really great service.

It is always easy to get a taxi (even during Olympics), it is a quick walk to the tube, there is a Whole Foods and Boots really close if you want to grab some fruit or water for your room.  Room service ALWAYS right on time.  I had an important meeting and coffee was there right at 6:00 am (I had to leave shortly thereafter.)

This is not a Four Seasons but frankly it is better than some Four Seasons I have been too.  I highly recommend!!",5,2012,07,29
133,Great view from our room!,"First of all, i would say the location of this hotel is simply excellent. Easy access to all the London attractions as it is on Kensington high street! Beautiful room, very clean bathroom (looks like new!), excellent view to the Kensington park!

I would say, it is now our favourite hotel in London.",5,2012,07,21
133,Best hotel in London by far,"We stayed here post our wedding and it has to be the best hotel in London that I have ever seen. Great staff and service, really helpful. Hotel has very high standards and it all shows. Rooms are of a very high quality, amazing view of Hyde park. Bathrooms a little smaller than some others but still of great quality.",5,2012,07,20
133,My Favorite,"My favourite hotel in London and I have tried a few. First class 5 star all the way. The overall style of the rooms is 100% to my liking. The decor is tasteful contemporary but the rooms still feel warm and cosy. The bathrooms are great, big bath tub and shower with an abundance of towels on a heated towel rack and plenty of soap, shampoo and all those other things you expect in a 1st class hotel. The linen and the beds are great. On the 10th floor you will find one of the best chinese restaurants in London with absolutely the best view. Berti's bar is great and I make it a point every night to sit and read the paper. Usually end up chatting to the bar staff who are very nice.
Final comment on the business center who are very helpful and reception and concierge who are flawless! The service given seems very genuine.
It is without doubt a quality ""pad"".",5,2012,07,18
133,Kiwi in england,"Stayed here on the way over to Italy with my mama, found the service excellent, good on ya my kiwi mate at front desk for getting my jacket ha.... rooms were comfy and had everything we needed, thanks for the stay, can highly recommend xo",5,2012,07,15
133,Luxury hotel in central location,"We stayed here as a family for Christmas, the hotel is of a very high standard if a little lacking in ambience ‚Äì perhaps that‚Äôs because it was Christmas and quiet. The staff were helpful and polite if not particularly friendly. The rooms are decorated to a very high standard and the facilities are excellent as you‚Äôd expect in an establishment of this standard. The outer rooms have excellent views over Hyde Park. The bars were comfortable but deserted ‚Äì Christmas again I guess. The location is good for Hyde Park but unless you are a really keen walker you need to take the taxi or tube to get to the West End. This being London allow at least half hour each way. There are some nice restaurants around the hotel but they are mostly local diners. You have to go to the West End for the high end stuff. There are plenty of shops nearby and a decent pub across the road. The only slight complaint is that the hotel bar closed quite early ‚Äì around midnight. We‚Äôd just got back from a meal and fancied an after dinner drink ‚Äì we got about 30 minutes. I‚Äôm used hotel bars staying open until the last guest staggers up to their room!",4,2012,07,10
133,Lovely Hotel,"Lovely hotel, close to the tube, great restaurants and shopping. Nicely appointed rooms and very comfortable. A bit on the pricey side to say the very least but London is high priced to start. But hotel is very well maintained and the staff is warm and friendly.",5,2012,07,09
133,Exceptional,"We had a lovely stay here, and chose it because it was close to the Royal Albert Hall.

Great quality, large hotel with brilliant facilities and intelligent, attentive staff. The room was exceptional: we were upgraded to a suite for no extra cost which was a lovely surprise, which was massive and had a large comfortable bed, and far-reaching views across Kensington Gardens.

We also dined in the restaurant, and the food and service were both great, as was the quality of the breakfast (which was taken in the room).

Good value, and great location. Being London, the underground carpark (and the access to it) is quite tight, and both times here I've kerbed the wheels on my car driving out of the carpark as the access is quite awkward; but it's nice to have the carpark to use if needed.",5,2012,07,09
133,"Great Location, children friendly, great value for money","We stayed here in June 2012 with our children and had interconnecting rooms. We are from Australia. We found the Hotel fantastic, value for money and would definitely recommend it to others and will stay here again.",5,2012,07,09
133,Exceeded our expectations!,"We spent a night with 3 children and had a fabulous stay at the Royal Garden Hotel.  The location was perfect with shopping and museums within walking distance, but the staff was really warm and friendly!  We were so pleased as each staff member we came across during our stay were so lovely and accommodating.  We will definitely come back!  Thank you!",5,2012,07,08
133,"Centrally located, easy access, nice rooms...","I stayed here for one night in June as part of a layover for my flight out of LHR the following day.  Very easy to get to from Heathrow.  Took the Heathrow Express to Paddington and hopped onto the tube to get off at High Street Kensingon station.  From there, a short walk to the hotel.  

Hotel was clean and room was generous size with free Internet access.  Unfortunately cannot speak to any of the amenities as I was only there one night.  For those of you who want to catch the city bus tours, it's a moderate walk through Kensington Park to the pickup areas.  Could also catch the tube again if necessary.  

Given I was hardly in my room for the one night, it is difficult to gauge the value as it ended up being >$300 USD for my one night.  Overall, I have no complaints about my stay or the room. and think it's a solid choice for those who want to be near public transportation, shopping and the sights.",4,2012,07,06
133,Always a wonderful stay!,"The staff at the Royal Garden really treat their customers like royalty.  We had another terrific stay!  

The Concierge group is most willing to assist all the time - they suggested theater shows, kept our tickets for several weeks, gave other info, and really made our stay enjoyable.  (And, even remembered us from our visit two years ago!) The room was lovely and we had a wonderful meal at the Park Terrace for lunch, as well as delectable breakfasts there each morning.

The location can't be beat - right in the center of a great area.  Near the Royal Albert, not far from the museums and of course, Kensington Palace!

Our one comment is that we will request the side overlooking Kensington Garden/Palace the next time, if possible.  Facing Kensington High Street can be rather noisy - especially if you are on a lower floor.

All in all, a terrific start and ending to our trip to England!",5,2012,07,06
133,This Time Business,Alone this time and on business I wanted to stay nearby to Harley Street. Quality sleep and an easy transistion from home. The Royal Garden Hotel was exactly what I hoped for. An easy walk to and from my destination with all I would require. Yes. This was a good choice.,5,2012,07,04
133,Best place to stay when in London...,"If you're looking for the best (and very central) hotel to stay when in London, look no further than the Royal Garden Hotel. I have never been let down whenever I've stayed there.",5,2012,07,03
133,Lovely and convenient location,"We enjoyed this hotel immensely.  Located near foreign embassies, small palaces, and elegant town houses.  Saw members of royalty.  Near Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park.  Enjoyed afternoon tea in hotel's restaurant and the breakfast was quite nice as well.  The room was spacious and had great views of the city.  I am allergic to feathers and the staff accommodated my request for a feather-free room with efficiency. The concierge was very helpful.  The hotel is only 2 blocks from the underground.",5,2012,06,25
133,great rooms and nice view,"Located in Kensington, at a walking distance of Kensington High Street subway station and right on the park. The district is full of shops and restaurants. The building is quite ugly, it's even shocking in the middle of such a beautiful site full of history but the decoration outside is great. From the 9th floor, where my room was located, I had a great view on the park and the back of Kensington palace. My room was very quiet, with a large bathroom and furnished and decorated with a great taste. As I stayed there for a meeting, I had the opportunity to eat twice and the food was really good, with great desserts. It's really a four star hotel with a lovely staff, always happy to help or to talk with guests.",4,2012,06,24
133,Nice hotel for a treat,"Kensington is a great part of London - good hotel in terms of standard, cleanliness etc. We stayed on NYE - the party was fun too!",4,2012,06,18
133,Not the best of experiences,"Awful value for money.

Staff very very courteous even the housekeeping personnel said ""Good Morning Sir"" as I passed. However trying to get the use of an ironing board and iron was impossible for my two night stay.

I was forced to pay for items from the mini bare the never existed I even showed them my receipt from the convenience store over the road proving I bought my water and snacks there, but to no avail. 

There was no Trouser Press in the room and whilst the tea and coffe in the room was complimentary you will need a good relationship with your bank manager if you want a biscuit.

Finally the in built light in the Wardrobe stayed on 24/7 and the auto cut off when the door closes was broken and maintenance no showed twice.

I wont be staying here again, and I will be feeding this back to the confrence organiser and to my own conferencing people.",2,2012,06,17
133,Great place to stay,"Not much to look at on the outside but the hotel is beautiful on the inside. The guest rooms are a reasonable size, not large but certainly not small. The entire property was well maintained and very clean. The full English breakfast was very good with some interesting selections, and the wait staff was very courteous and attentive. The hotel location is excellent, adjacent to Kensington Palace and Kensington Gardens, a short walk from the High St Kensington tube station, and within walking distance of many sights and attraction in the Kensington area. Several buses stop right at the hotel and there are many shops and restaurants just a few steps form the hotel.",5,2012,06,11
133,Great value for London location,"I have stayed at this hotel for work previously and thought it would be out of my price range for pleasure but weekend rates were very reasonable compared with other central London hotels. I paid only 165 GBP per night for a single queen room. It was definitely small but had everything I needed including a lovely view out the back over the gardens and palace. Staff were always helpful and it was very quiet. The location is so convenient with many great dining and take away options nearby, as well as the beautiful gardens.",5,2012,06,10
133,Loved this hotel,"Had a great time! Lovely rooms, friendly staff and great facilities! We ate in the restaurant and had the most amazing Duck. The hotel is in a fab location, 2 minutes from the tube! ",5,2012,06,07
133,Loved it,"I was actually looking at 4 star hotels but found this hotel which was only slightly more expensive and I'm thrilled I decided to pay the extra as the standard of this hotel is outstanding.
The location was perfect for us travelling with a toddler as it is right next to Kensington Gardens and the palace, but also the great selection of shops cafes & restaurants of Kensington high street are right on your doorstep so no trolling around on the tubes with a little one. Breakfast was especially impressive the hot & cold buffet looked delicious we opted for fresh cooked dishes off the menu and it was infact the best eggs benedict I have ever eaten!
Rooms are modern in design and immaculate bathroom gorgeous deep bath with music linked up to listen while you soak.
Very impressed, will definitely stay here again and recommend to friends.",5,2012,06,04
133,Another great stay!,"Excellent location, with great views from the 9th floor! The staff are all very helpful and attentive. The rooms are what you would expect, with a comfortable seating area. It was good to have a bath and a seperate shower. Lovely restaurant and terrace bar. Will definitely stay again, reasonably priced parking, great service and comfortable rooms, what more could you want!",5,2012,05,30
133,Great Hotel!,"Our 9th floor room was spacious and very clean with a beautiful view of the park.  Bathroom was immaculate.

Park Terrace was a serene space for a late afternoon drink.  Head Bartender Vilmos provides professional friendly service.

Dinner is Min Jiang was fabulous.  Food and service were outstanding.

While I am not a fan of busy Kensingtin High Street, the hotel is located at the end and the location is excellent for accessing all means of transportation.

I would highly recommend this hotel",4,2012,05,29
133,Lovely view of the gardens,"Booked into the Royal Garden for a special weekend away with relatives.  We were very pleased with our choice of hotel.  The hotel was excellently situated for the places that we wanted to visit, including Kensdington Palace.   We had garden rooms overlooking Kensington Gardens and would recommend these.  Our rooms benefited from a lovely view and had all the facilities expected of this standard of hotel.

All of the staff that we met including reception, restaurant at breakfast and waiters in Bertie‚Äôs Bar were friendly and efficient.

We did not have dinner at the hotel but found the breakfast to be very good.  We would return to this hotel.",5,2012,05,28
133,Great renovated hotel,"Stayed at the Royal Garden hotel as part of the Worldhotels Conference and enjoyed the hotel very much. Renovated rooms, good service and and staff attention.",5,2012,05,28
133,Nice hotel but would not stay again !,"Booked a king room but only had smoking rooms on check in NOT GOOD so gave us a queen room NOT GOOD !     Also only one cup in room to make tea so had to share ,  and they call this a five star hotel I don't think so ! ",3,2012,05,27
133,"Bumford, the absent manager","How to train  staff to enter the hotel rooms without knocking? How to keep  bread at least a day past it's sell date before serving? Our room developed a leak around midnight which we were told is very common with such an old air conditioning system.  Who do you talk to when you ask a cheese plate without goats cheese and the first bite of something that looks like Brie turns out to be goat? Of course the manager is never actually on site at this hotel, or his staff are carefully hiding his prescence, so discussing the shortcomings of this barely 2 star parading as a 5 star with someone of influence consequently highly unlikely. I thoroughly urge anyone contemplating staying here, to think again. I am traveling the world over, and have never in my life had such an awful hotel experience as the one I am living now. Hoping to check out early and never to return. We are a party of ten rooms, and everyone had to complain. No one apologized, nothing will change here...",1,2012,05,25
133,Just as good on our fourth visit,"My wife and I stayed six nights in a Garden Room in late May 2012.We are in our early seventies so the location is superb. The room was quiet, spacious and the bed and pillows very comfortable. Free internet usage in the room was fantastic as it allowed us to stay in touch with home on a regular basis (no high mobile phone bills) and to better plan our tourist activities.

We stayed in a Garden Room on Level 9 on our last trip in 2009 and were extremely impressed by the panoramic view over Kensington Gardens. However, to our disappointment, this time we were allocated a room on Level 1. Level 1 is below the tree line and therefore, the view was mainly restricted to the trees on the boundary of the adjacent Kensington Gardens. 

Having booked nine months prior, we did have an expectation of being allocated a room on a higher Level. Our thanks to the Trainee Receptionist, Natalie, who did make her best efforts to secure a room on a higher Level for us, but to no avail.",4,2012,05,23
133,Fabulous Hotel Fabulous Location,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this hotel - it was conveniently located in Hyde Park - right next to Kensington Palace and near a tube station, restaurants and shopping. The room was very modern with an excellent king size bed. The breakfast was amazing.",5,2012,05,22
133,Did the job for a business trip!,"Stayed here for 6 nights in April. Did my booking through Expedia.com.au and got a reasonable deal for a top hotel in London. Deal came with no extras so breakfast and wifi not included. When you add over 20 pounds for fairly average buffet breakfast and 20 pounds per day wifi charge and it doesnt seem so reasonable. You can solve the breakfast issue by walking across the road to Giraffe which is a great little cafe with friendly service and good food or even cheaper is down at Whole Foods market for coffee, juice, bacon and eggs, etc. for under 10 pounds. Wifi charge is outrageous these days and that really has to move with the times and be offered for free.

The room was quite small but functional. Beds, cleaning and amenities as you would expect. The gym is separate from the hotel, down in the basement and accessed by a lift from outside the hotel. Its VERY average unless you go into the personal training room which i think requires membership or a charge - it wasnt offered. The gym equipment is very limited and steam and dry sauna was small - showers, changerooms need a makeover. The concierge were great and gave great advice on transport options, restaurants, laundry and held/delivered parcels. Well done boys!

I love the location on High St. Kensington. Bus stops outside in both directions and tube is a short walk. You are at the end of the shopping strip so away from the crowds. If you are lucky to enjoy the views over Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park back to the city you will agree they are spectacular. I had a function in the Chinese restaurant on top floor which i imagine is expensive but WOW the views! Food was pretty good too.

i travelled on business so price less of an issue but if it was coming out of my own pocket i would say it was on the expensive side for what you got when you include breakfast and wifi. But hey, thats London! where do you find decent quality close to the city all inclusive for 200-250 pounds. Maybe time to adjust the price expectations.",3,2012,05,16
133,Serenity in Hyde Park corner,"This hotel is pure calmness destination in London. Within a walking distance from almost everything...High Street Kensington station, Albert Hall, National Museum and of course the beautiful Hyde Park. The room that facing the Hyde park are second to none.
The hotel has a Spa. Make sure you try the 10th floor authentic Chinese Restaurant called Min Jiang.",4,2012,05,14
133,Excellent,"Great Hotel, for London and the staff are great. If I had to make one criticism , the staff in the restaurant and bar could be a bit more attentive but other than that it was great.,",5,2012,05,13
133,good hotel with fantastic location but some slight imperfections,"Stayed two nights for an inhouse conference. Was given an upgrade to a better room becos there was a mixed up in my reservation by the conference organiser. Staff was professional in handling this issue, was settled within 10 minutes and I am happy, got a complimentary upgrade! 

Room was great, spacious and with a view of kensington garden. What more can you ask for! 

The meeting rooms were a bit disappointing. I guess coming from Asia, we seldom expect to see meeting rooms with low ceilings! there were a few workshops going on simultaneously and finding the venues are difficult. it really requires a GPS (a bit of exagerration!). But you know what I mean!

The breakfast was quite normal, continental but service was a bit abrupt and crude. I walked in to the restaurant and the person at entrance showed me to my table. I sat down waited for a while and since nobody offered me coffee and it was not found on the breakfast table, I went over to the person at entrance to order my coffee, but he asked me to go back to my table and sit down! said the person will come over. So obediently without making a fuss I sat down again. 

waited for a while longer and since nobody asked me for coffee, I spoke to a staff that walked by, that I really needed a coffee. So the person nodded his head and finally the person the person that welcomed me to the restaurant entrance and I approached initially came over to my table and asked ""do I need coffee or tea?"" duh!!.......

Its might be a minor issue to many people but coffee in the morning to me is like an ""on"" switch. My recommendation will be to have a coffee machine / or a few decanters at the buffet counter for us to take it ourselves. 
 
And you can reduce the amount of coffee served as most of the time, we only need one cup. But this serving comes in a small coffee pot that can serves at least two cups. Moreover the remaining coffee in the pot will be cold by the time we pour our next cup so we cannot add sugar as it will not melt.  So to me its a waste!

all in all, its a good hotel and worth recommending for others to stay",4,2012,05,10
133,Great location and friendly service,"I stayed for 6 nights at the Royal Garden Hotel in a large and bright room overlooking Kensington Gardens - just the view I was hoping for!  I thought the room was quite comfortable, which was great since I spent a lot of time there working in the evenings.  

My stay also overlapped with Justin Bieber's, but I disagree with some other reviews - I thought the staff did a very good job accommodating the rest of us ""normal"" hotel guests, especially considering the mobs of people out front, which was not their doing or in their control.  Also, I had intended to stay at the Royal Garden for 8 nights, but got unfortunate news of a death in my family shortly after arriving, and the hotel was very gracious when I asked to be relieved of 2 nights of my reservation to leave and attend the funeral.  They held onto my large suitcase for me during my leave and then made sure I was comfortably accommodated (in the same room, actually!) when I returned 2 days later.  

The location of the Royal Garden is truly wonderful.  I have always loved spending time in Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park so it was nice to have the park at the doorstep to go running or walking... whenever the rain stopped.  :)

The only complaint I have is that the WiFi seemed rather weak and slow, which made working from my room less convenient.  But ultimately, I had a great experience at the Royal Garden and would surely stay there again.",5,2012,05,09
133,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location","I have stayed at the Royal Garden many times.

This is a lovely hotel right next to Hyde Park and close walking distance to Kensington High Street.

The rooms are well appointed and a good size.

Service is excellent.

A great hotel!",4,2012,05,09
133,50th birthday,"I booked for one Saturday night for myself and my wife (we had managed to dump the kids for a change) to celebrate my 50th birthday. I asked at the time of booking if I could have a high room with a view of the park as it was my 50th birthday. We didn't get a high floor (3rd) but we did get upgraded to suite and a free bottle of champagne (which was terrific). One tiny gripe is no-one mentioned why we were being upgraded (it may have been they had overbooked the standard rooms) or why the champagne was left in our room. I assumed it was because of my birthday put a note (even a post it note!) with ""Happy Birthday"" would have made a difference. We had afternoon tea which was good with a nice window seat - the sandwiches were just beginning to dry out and had clearly been prepared some time earlier. I've no objection to food preparation in advance, the logistics of feeding masses of people must be a nightmare, but two pence worth of cling film over the sandwiches would have prevented this. The scones, cakes and tea were all lovely. The room was huge and really nice and we had a good night‚Äôs sleep. Breakfast was a bit chaotic, there was no-one at the desk so we waited a few minutes until the receptionist turned up and showed us to a nice window seat. The breakfast was a buffet ‚Äì Continental and English cooked breakfast ‚Äì and we were told to help ourselves. Shortly after we settled down several large groups turned up and, with the receptionist absent again, helped themselves to the buffet and tried to find a table. This resulted in a fair amount of chaos as cutlery was requested and tables hurriedly cleared. A simple sign with ‚ÄúPlease wait here to be seated‚Äù would have resolved this. Finally, as we had helped ourselves to some items from the cooked breakfast buffet, we were asked to sign for this (¬£23.50 each) even though ‚Äúit was included‚Äù. When we checked out I was ready for an argument if the 2 x ¬£23.50 appeared on our bill but it didn‚Äôt. All in all a very enjoyable stay which could have been perfect with a few management ‚Äútweaks‚Äù (none of which would cost the hotel any significant money). I hope the management take note.",4,2012,05,07
133,For the view and location,"The only real reason to stay here is the view. Get a garden room or better and get an everchanging view across the park as the daylight dims and the city lights start to twinkle on the other side of the park's darkening expanse. You don't need to draw your curtains because there is no one in the park at night to see in.
Staff are very pleasant. The Park Terrace restaurant has rather uninteresting food which sounds better than it tastes. The gym is just ok. They could do with one or two more benches and something for leg strength. There were only a few people there when I was: had there been more it would have started to feel a little cramped. The saunas and steam rooms are single sex so most of us can't share them with our partners.
Good cocktails and views from tenth floor bar.
Overall impression is that other top hotels do everything better, but few have such views. In other words, if you don't get a room with a view better to go somewhere else.",4,2012,05,07
133,Special Occasion Let Down By Confusion Over Breakfast Charges,"I recently decided to surprise my partner in choosing this hotel to stay at for one night to celebrate 5 years together. We went for the Garden room with spectacular views over Hyde Park in which the package also included complimentary breakfast the next morning. 

After a delicious dinner in the Knightsbridge area, we went back to the hotel room to enjoy some champagne compliments of the hotel (must pass on my thanks to guest relations officer Simona Riccio!). The sleep we had here was very relaxing and one of the most comfortable stays in a long while. Waking up, we had breakfast delivered to our room and it was nice to eat a great spread of food in front of the morning park view. 

That said, the stay was only let down by the fact that I was informed right from the start that breakfast was included in the price I paid to celebrate our special occasion here, but was not. I had the option of having breakfast in my room or in the Park Terrace. I asked upon booking how the breakfast in room worked and was told we just had to tick what we wanted and would all be included in price already. Upon arriving at the hotel and seeing the slip I would need to fill in, I was still confused as to what would be included and wouldn't be. I therefore called reception to ask twice before I ticked the breakfast menu on whether there was anything excluded from what I could order and was told there wasn't and that I just had to put it out my door by 2am and that it was covered by the package I had booked.

When coming to pay for my stay at the end at reception, I then found out I had to pay ¬£35 on top of the price for my overnight package stay!! As you can imagine I wasn't particularly happy upon hearing this. For a hotel of this quality and stature, I was not told at any stage whether there was any items excluded from my breakfast ordering in the room. 

Given it was to celebrate our 5th year together with my partner they sounded very accommodating when I booked and throughout, only to lump me with charges for enjoying our special occasion here! We only paid part of the amount back after discussing this with the receptionist, but this event somewhat dampened our celebrations to what was otherwise a very nice stay in a great hotel. 

I hope they can look into clarifying things more for people as this is a place we would surely look into staying at again, but currently reconsidering given what occurred over the weekend.",3,2012,05,07
133,We kept your credit card details so we can easily take your money...,"This hotel is perfectly situated, recently renovated in other words, could be perfect. What a pity that the only interest the staff apparently has is how to squeeze more money out of you! Read below how they do this and it will become clear that this is apparently a practice put in place by their management.

I stayed here a week ago (checked out on April 25th) everything fine, paid the 800 GBP for two nights (bit expensive but hey‚Ä¶ Kensington next to the palace) at check-out they asked me if I had anything from the minibar, no ‚Äì checked with my wife, neither did she ‚Äì so, NO we had nothing from the minibar. Yesterday I got a letter from the hotel that in a joint effort between housekeeping and the reception manager they decided that I did apparently have something from the minibar but that I shouldn‚Äôt worry, since they kept records of my Amex it was easy to take GBP 5.50 from my card, so‚Ä¶ they did, cash in, un-authorized. 

I am still flabbergasted by this, how can you do that? If you really, really think that someone tried to rip you of over a bottle of water, or whatever it was, (The royal garden hotel didn‚Äôt specify it!) why don‚Äôt you call your guest and ask? Since you kept my credit card number I imagine you also kept my cell phone nr. ‚Äì It's not about the money, it's the principle...

I stayed in this hotel on various occasions over the last years, rooms are nice, staff on average friendly and helpful, yes, they were distracted because of Justin Bieber and the 200 fans standing outside the door, but that's something you can laugh about...

There are however things that you just don't do, like this, it's a complete breach of trust and a flagrant disrespect for your guests. This was the last time I came here. There are many nice hotels in this area, and I‚Äôll be checking them all. I am a regular to the area, and I can recommend anyone looking for a hotel here to try one of the others, in 15 years of regular travel all over the world I‚Äôve seen a lot, but this beats them all.",1,2012,05,05
133,Top class quality,"Luxury in the lap of luxury, is how I would describe this excellent place.  
The rooms are expansive, luxurious and comfortable.  Some of the rooms have a view of the Kensington Gardens and it is a treat.  The location otherwise is good too - with several restaurants in the vicinity to choose from, you are never far away from a great dining experience.  I am told parking is an issue, but since I cabbed it, did not face a problem.  My only regret is that I stayed here for a short duration of two days, most of which were spent on work.
The only dark spot on an other impeccable experience was the inordinate delay in processing our check-out which was quite surprising for a hotel of this quality.  We were told the delay was due to the staff being occupied with the demands of a celebrity that was staying here.",4,2012,05,05
133,Watch out if you are not a celeb!,"I stayed here for one night and unfortunately it was the night that Justin Bieber was staying and so the rest of us, got put in second place.  We watched many a row from guests who were annoyed at not being able to have access the way you normally would in a hotel. The front door staff did not help with our bags and seemed as if helping was a hassle instead of their job.  The reservation team mixed up our room choice and only moved us when we kicked up a fuss.  The papers we requested and paid for were not delivered and the gym only opened at 9am on a Saturday which is crazy by today's hotel standards.  Finally, at breakfast, i asked for a pancake.  He repeated the order and i then went back to him to ask if the 'pancake' was ready?  Reply, not yet.  Five minutes later, he gave me a waffle!  Go figure. I normally stay at Soho Hotel run by the Firmdale group and the difference is exceptional.  I'm going back there next time!  Royal Garden is not a place to stay if you are looking for individual attention as a fee paying guest!",2,2012,04,30
133,Great hotel even better second time around,"My wife and I love this hotel. We stayed here 2 years ago for 12 days, 6 of which we were unexpectedly held over because of Volcanic Ash. The staff and hotel were lovely then, and even better this time around. I needed to change our room because I was unhappy with the view compared to last time, and they happily switched us to the same room we had stayed at the first time. The room had been even more improved, this time with voltage converters, flat-screen TV, iPod dock with speakers, and a separate shower and bath-tub. Our stay this time was for 10 days, and the concierge staff are worth their weight in gold, handling tube directions, restaurant reservations, confirming flights, posting packages, you name it. Justin Bieber was there later in our stay and the hotel was under siege with screaming girls, but the staff took it all in stride. Restaurants and room service were all of excellent quality, we were greeted like old friends each time.
The icing on the cake was when I arrived at Heathrow and discovered that my wallet was missing. I called the hotel, spoke with Melvin in Security, he took my phone number, checked my room, found the wallet in the room safe. He called me back, had me send an email authorizing them to post the wallet, and sent me an email confirmation that it was sent in that day's post and would arrive in a few days. My wallet continued credit cards, cash and traveler's checks. Can you imagine a New York hotel doing that? (I've been robbed in many of them, by the staff!)
So in closing I can't say enough about the level of service at this hotel, and it's such a great neighborhood. We'll be returning there every time we're in London.

133,Five Star Quality,"Stayed here with my young family prior to running in the London Marathon
From arrival and through out our stay the service and friendliness was excellent
Room service (due to young family) was brilliant great quality and choice and so reasonably
priced.
The bedrooms are modern very clean and comfortable with great subtle touches.
Breakfast was a relaxed experience with great views and variety of fresh food every morning which my 4 year old loved.
In fact i believe it help me achieve a PB in the marathon as our stay was hassle free.
We will be back for anoither visit as there is so much on near the Hotel",5,2012,04,27
133,Cannot fault this wonderful hotel,"Me and my husband stayed here weekend of 31st March as part of a west end show package.  The hotel is fantastic.  A short walk from Kensington High Street tube station, located right next to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace.  Its location cannot be faulted.  The rooms were tastefully decorated and very modern, complimentary toiletries and bathrobes were available and a free safety box.  We were sent up a bottle of wine with compliments of the hotel and the check in staff and concierge were fantastic; especially Luton who was most helpful with helping us decide what to do with our last afternoon in London.  All in a a superb well deserved 5 star hotel.  We will definitely be back!

133,Very Nice Stay,"We had a very nice experience at the Royal Garden Hotel.  The staff were helpful and friendly and the rooms were updated and very clean.  The breakfast buffet was varied and delicious.  The evening bar service was excellent.  They make a mean martini.  We loved that the hotel is on the edge of Kensington Garden and the Palace.  Lovely area, though not extremely close to many of the tourist attractions.  We would definitely return to this hotel in the future.",4,2012,04,23
133,Luxury with Service,"The impressive Royal Garden Hotel has a prime London location with Kensington Palace Gardens and Hyde Park on either side; the Royal Albert Hall is within a short walk with Knightsbridge and Earls Court just a short journey by tube from Kensington High Street.
I have enjoyed staying at this hotel on many occasions whilst attending an annual music industry conference in March each year. Apart from the excellent facilities, it is the staff and their dedicated service that I must mention, they are always friendly, polite, attentive and helpful, other hotels really should follow the Royal Garden Hotel‚Äôs example of training staff and General Manager Graham Bamford and his staff should be congratulated.
The dining room overlooks the park and for breakfast guests are presented with an impressive buffet combination of either hot or continental options. 
A bedroom overlooking Kensington Palace Gardens or Hyde Park is memory worth taking away together with the fantastic view of the London Skyline. I shall definitely stay again either for business or for a special family occasion.",5,2012,04,18

Great room,great service and fantastic location next to Kensington Palace and Hyde Park.

And check out Cote across the road for well priced French brasserie food.",5,2012,04,17
133,Fantastic,"We booked Royal Garden for a night as part of our first wedding anniversary celebration a couple of days ago. On arrival, we were asked about our plans for the evening/ if we had any and i explained that we were celebrating our first anniversary. The person at reception we spoke to was genuinely interested, wished us a happy anniversary and we spoke generally for a few minutes. Our room was not ready (we arrrived slightly before check in time) so we were offered a seat in the restaurant lounge.

shortly after, the person from reception (apologies I did not get your name) came to us with our room card and said our luggage had been taken up and asked if we wanted to be escorted to our room. We declined as we were finishing of some drinks and went up ourselves. Once we got to our room, our luggage was there as mentioned and a comp bottle of wine and chocolates were waiting for us with a hand written card wishing us a very happy anniversary. We really appreciated this touch and thank the staff very much for this - by the way the chocolates were so amazing!!

our room was an executive room and was a very nice size for a central london room. It was clean and had all the ammenities you would expect from a 5 star hotel (though i didnt use it, i was really impressed with the mini bar stock). We also asked if it was OK to check out 1 hour later and they were extremely accomodating.

all the staff were extremely friendly and very geniuine when asking if they could help. I have stayed in many 5 star restaurants across the world and while Royal Garden matches up to most of these in terms of look, rooms, services offered etc, the level of customer care is the best I have come across in any Hotel i have ever stayed. I have never written a review for anything in the past but on this occassion i think it is important to do so if just to thank the staff and note the outstanding customer service.

Only downside was the bed as this is two beds joined together and so was not as comfortable as other beds in Hotels i have stayed at.

The Hotel is also in a great location with many tourist attractions nearby and excellent transport links. Would definitely reccomned to anyone, and I wont be staying in any other London Hotel apart from Royal Garden in the future.

Thanks.",5,2012,04,17

I could not fault the rooms, we had some problems with the Air Conditioning but that was rectified as soon as it was brought to their attention.",5,2012,04,10
133,Should be for price,"We were going to Royal Albert Hall to see Show of Hands and this was a great location. Rooms were fine, bed comfortable, service very good and breakfast was fine. All in all, a nice Easter treat. Would use again for that special occasion!",4,2012,04,08
133,"""Wow""  What a treat !","Our stay here was a birthday present from my sister (thanks Sis). We arrived expecting a decent sized room it was an Executive King so with maybe a bigger bed and some expensive potions and lotions in the bathroom. We ended up taking our youngest children although it was supposed to be a treat for the grown ups, we were really glad that we did.

We were taken up to our room by a member of the reception staff slightly surprised to be going up to the 10th floor, even more surprised to be going into the inner sanctum through a secure corridor but the real surprise was when she opened the door to the suite and we were presented with the most astonishing view of the London Skyline. From Hampstead in the North and Crystal Palace in the south with the London eye on the Horizon but the joy of looking across Kensington Palace Gardens and Hyde Park out of the huge windows it was breathtaking in a room that was bigger that the ground floor of our house. This room turned out to be the sitting room and the bedroom was next door equally large with the biggest bed I have ever seen, at this point the courtesy bell went and housekeeping arrived with a complimentary bottle of wine. 
Yes there were expensive lotions and potions in the bathroom along with a bath big enough for my youngest daughter to practice her swimming in, with a tap she described as a waterfall .

Thanks to all at Royal Garden Hotel for a truly fantastic experience!",5,2012,04,06
133,Our umpteenth visit to this very special hotel,"So many hotels are a disappointment, whether grand or modest - which is one of the many reasons why we are so fortunate to have made so many visits to the Royal Garden Hotel.  It always feels like  home from home, plus the added advantages of gentle, thoughtful pampering from such helpful staff, comfortable newly refurbished rooms, award winning food and an ideal location. We have already booked for our next visit.",5,2012,04,03
133,A good hotel in a great location,"I have stayed at this hotel on many occasions, the last time being in March this year.  It is always an impressive entrance to the hotel, located right next door to Kensington Palace on Kensington High Street.  Well located for Heathrow and central london.   The service is always good here and the staff are always friendly and ready to help.  On this occasion we had one of the older rooms (delux) with a view of the High Street - very noisy if you have the window open.  Plenty of space with a separate seating area.  Really comfortable beds and everything provided in room.  Mini bar is expensive - like all 5 star London hotels!   Breakfast is a combination of an extensive continental buffet and traditional hot buffet.  There is a ¬£4.50 surcharge to upgrade to include the hot buffet.  We kept to the continental and were well satisfied.  A generally good hotel but not outstanding.",4,2012,03,30

133,Excelle nt location right next to Kensington Park,"This hotel has an excellent location right in the heart of Kensington High Street . There is  a bus station right in front of the hotel and if you buy a bus pass, you can take the bus directly to Knightsbridge. It is also not too far from the West End.

The service was also good and although there is a gym which is located just below the hotel (you have to take a separate lift down to the gym and spa) , it's wonderful to be able to go jogging/ for a walk at Kensington Park which is just 2 minutes away and next to the hotel. 

The restaurant Min Jiang is highly rated as one of the top Chinese restaurants in London and has a lovely view of the park. 

The room rates are definitely reasonable for such a great location.",4,2012,03,27

133,"First Class Hotel, up there with the best","Stayed here for one night in March 2012 and I have to say this hotel overall rates as one of the best I have stayed in. Friendly and efficient staff starting with the doorman who provided very convenient and reasonably priced parking. Our room was wonderful, fantastic views over London and the Park, very good toiletries and all the facilities you could require. The best part for me however, given that I am extremely noise sensitive was the fact that I had the best night‚Äôs sleep I ever had in any city centre hotel. I never heard a sound! 
The only reason I did not tick ""excellent"" in every box was that from a cleanliness point of view I dropped my phone and it went under the bed and when I looked underneath, it had not seen a Hoover for a very long time. Also whilst the king bed was very comfortable it was made up of two beds joined together and the joint was not good and this is one of my pet hates. The only other remark I would make is that we thought the bath towels and robes were looking (not feeling) a bit tired and worn. Don't be put off in any way though, these are only my little picky bits, this hotel is right up there with the best.",5,2012,03,20
133,Great stay...,"I have stayed in this hotel for five nights during March 2012.¬†Check in process was very smooth and staff were accommodating.¬†

The room size is average for hotels in the same class. Rooms are clean and tidy and the price was acceptable at 160 GBP inc vat, Standard room. ¬†Internet was complimentary¬†with the room.

The hotel location is very good nearby the famous London High Street and with a walking distance of the underground station.¬†

The only drawback I can think of is the noise.¬†My room was on the 7th floor. However sometimes street distractions can be easily heard in room. Especially during weekends. ¬†I reckon if my room was located on the other side (Garden view) the noise might be less.

This hotel is ideal for business trips and for elderly people. I would definitely recommend this for friends and family.",4,2012,03,20

133,5* is not enough,"Have just returned from our second stay at the Royal garden, what a totally brilliant hotel. 
Service is excellent and attentive but not intrusive, food just to die for and attention to detail that really should cost a whole lot more than it does. 
I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, my only niggle is the car park, which, if you own a Range Rover, as i do, will focus your attention like nothing else trying to get into and out of as it is almost exactly the same height as the car and daunting to say the least! 
That said, if your staying over in London, this should be your first and only booking. ",5,2012,03,18
133,Excellent,Only stayed one night and picked because of close location to the Albert Hall (5 minute walk) This hotel is not a pretty or interesting building from the outside and not stunning inside however it is extremely clean and uncluttered and has an air of good organisation everywhere. Immediate and polite service on reception and friendly and helpful concierge. The refurbishment is evident with a lovely 'new carpet' smell. Our room was spotless and well laid out with good bedding and comfortable beds. Pillows were new but very squishy and had we been there for longer we would have requested more as there were no cushions in the room either. The use of the wood and extensive mirrors in the room was superb and the bathroom was fabulous. The lighting  was the best I have ever seen in a hotel room with switches labelled as to where you were lighting and best of all a night light near the bathroom for those middle of the night visits to the loo without waking your partner - inspired! Other hotels everywhere take note! Also loved the TV/Radio speaker in the bathroom which also had great lighting and mirrors and a really decent selection of toiletries. The only things missing from the room were a free bottle of water a couple of biscuits oh and no iron? Found this unusual in a hotel of this standard and my only reasons for dropping a point.,4,2012,03,16
133,Thank you,"What an amazing Hotel. We booked this hotel to celebrate our 25 Wedding Anniversary and I am glad I did. We rquested a low floor room as my wife suffers from fear of lifts. we did not expect much but got a fantastic room on the first floor.
Then my wife ended up ill. NOT the hotels fault. but the room was so comfortable she was able to spend her time there. Thank you to the Reception Staff for directing us to the Hospital. Thank you to the Concierge for making sure my Wife did not have to wait long for a taxi. (by the way London Taxi Drivers are the best) and Thank you to the Restaurant Staff for your Service.

133,"Genuine 4/5 star, very reasonable for London","Despite the vast number of hotels in London, I've settled on a couple of ""pet"" hotels for accommodation when travelling with my wife or with friends for leisure. Hotels for staying with work are often booked centrally, so can be a bit random.

When this hotel came up at being booked for a work event, the reviews looked promising. Arriving, everything was as expected - very pleasant reception and friendly concierge. Tea, coffee and snacks for the wee meeting before we headed off to the main venue were great.

Rooms were clean and approaching genuinely luxurious, even in the cheaper rooms. Given the location, the value is very good too. Comfy beds, comprehensive minibar, scrupulously clean and great bathroom - all the trimmings basically. Prices would be a touch expensive outside London, but given you're smack next to Hyde Park, you can't go wrong if you want to push the boat out slightly.

Couple of nice bars, very pleasant breakfast room (didn't eat in main restaurant) good gym/spa and business centre, plus free wifi and very helpful staff. Location is great, as you're near a lot of popular venues in the West and is very close to Kensington High Street underground, plus is outside te congestion charging zone if you're driving.

Same advice I offer for oter hotels when prebooking - shop around for discounts over rack rate and prebook breakfast if you're likely to be having it, you'll save a fortune. If you're going to be travelling round London for a few days - Oyster card is the way forward.

Overall, I suspect I'll stick to some of the cheaper more central hotels when travelling with friends and still have a slightly more central favourite for theatre oriented breaks with my wife, but if you're planning on basing yourself round Hyde park and fancy a treat, look no further and book without hesitation.",5,2012,03,04
133,Would stay here every time in London,"I may be a little biased as we were on the Sunday night deal which is B&B in a garden room for under ¬£200, but we found this hotel to be everything we want in London. Firstly you can park under the hotel and not go inside the congestion zone. The garden rooms overlook Hyde Park and Kensington Palace so they are quiet and have great views and have just been refurbished. The room service breakfast is served in the same fashion as you would get at Claridges and you can walk to most places on the west side of London. Finally the staff are helpful but unobtrusive.",5,2012,02,28
133,"Stay here! Great staff, nice rooms, bathrooms are a delight.","I have bern to London ovet a 150 times.
Usually stay at the Park Lane, St James Club or the Metropolitan.
The staff at the Royal Gardens were really nice, warm and very service minded. Rooms were spotless and housekeeping did a brilliant job.
The beds were excellent, nice rooms, mine overlooked the park ehich was lovely.
Best was piping hot water, high pressure Grohe Rain Showers and hand showers.
One complaint was that my room was slightly warm. I did not complain though as it was not too uncomfortable.
I highly recommend this hotel and congratulatipns to the Hotel Manager who has created a highly motivated team
at his hotel. Applause!

133,Very luxurious would recommend,Have stayed here for business and then revisited with my family and then another occasion used the car park ¬£35 for all day in this location is a brilliant price. Can't fault anything.  Service was excellent very clean.  Pleasant staff very helpful.  And so close to science/history museum and harrods. Will stay here again. ,5,2012,02,22
133,Excellent,"Excellent but not pretentious, very good location close to Kensington gardens. The rooms were clean and very nice.",5,2012,02,22
133,Amizing view on the top,"Stayed for 5 nights on a business trip. Location is good, several shops around, tube station 3mn walk.

Rooms are big (for London standards) comfortable, mine had a view to the park which was nice. Breakfast on the top floor restaurant is an amazing experience, great view. Allow you an extra time to enjoy all your eyes want to see. The bar also works at night, but closes early in the evening (as London in general).

Staff friendly enough, expect to pay for your wi-fi. Comfortable bed.",4,2012,02,18
133,Very pleaseant stay,"We stayed on the refurbished 2nd floor and it was very comfortable, as usual the Breakfast was so delicious and Staff are really helpful and courteous. I am sure we had ironing facilities in our room when we stayed previously > and for a 5* Hotel a few biscuits on Coffee/tea tray would'nt go amiss !",4,2012,02,16
133,Lovely Hotel in Great Location,"Stayed here for one night on 12.02.2012 as a treat for my birthday.  We were seeing a show at the Royal Albert Hall and this was the perfect location.  Booked a garden view room and we got one on the 8th floor.  View was amazing, shame it was a bit cloudy.  Room was very nice, clean and comfortable.  The large tv was great.  Ate in the restaurant downstairs for lunch and got room service in the evening.  Food was amazing!

Only slight negative is we got there at 1:45 as were told room would be ready for 2pm.  The only one they had ready was on 2nd floor and not the one that had been allocated to us on the higher floor.  Had to wait until 2:45pm which meant had to rush to get to show but not the end of the world.  

Hotel is very luxurious, staff are friendly and helpful......all what we expected.  Location ideal and it was a shame we didn't have longer to spend here.  I would definitely come back :-)",5,2012,02,13
133,Loved my stay at Royal Garden,"I loved my stay at the Royal Garden Hotel.  It's right in the middle of everywhere I wanted to be and took no more than 15-20 minutes to get to a major attraction.  Plenty to do within walking distance.  Many restaurants and shops down Kensington St.  So much history to see and take in.  I stayed on the 8th floor and had a lovely view from my room.  The rooms were clean and very comfortable, and I especially enjoyed all the amenities of the bathroom.  The staff was very helpful, polite and patient, as I had a couple of issues with my converter :/  The concierge was very helpful in accommodating all my needs, providing restaurant suggestions and providing directions to the various hot spots.  I would definitely recommend this Hotel to anyone visiting London.  Only one suggestion ......take the Discover card ;/ They don't take it and I had a few issues with my Diners Card being accepted as well.  But the helpful staff was patient and ultimately we were able to get that cleared up.",5,2012,02,12
133,Silver Bells and Cockle Shells,"Stayed here for three days on business. Fantastic.
Great service from all from - when I pulled up in a taxi to when the concierge boys put me back into one to leave. Concierge & porters special mention - very helpful and always willing to please & help. 
Rooms were modern & comfortable. Great bathrooms! Good service options on TV and good wifi service.
Location on Kensington High Street means you are close to everything; well, everything I wanted to see. Would love to have stayed longer (& not on business); so I hope I get the chance to return.",5,2012,02,02
133,Generally very good,We stayed 3 nights at this 5 star hotel. Overall we had a very pleasant stay. The decor is generally modern and welcoming. The service was ok but not quite what I would have expected from 5 star accommodation. The food was very good both at breakfast and dinner. The location is good if you want Kensington although we found we wanted to be going to the West End regularly which is an expensive taxi ride away although the tube station is not too far from the hotel,4,2012,02,01
133,Garden Hotel Rates a Bouquet,We just got back from a week at this hotel. Our room on the ninth floor was spacious with a sitting area a few steps up from the bedroom. The bathroom was large and well equipped. The staff was very helpful and gracious. Each morning we had a delicious continental breakfast overlooking the park.The hotel is in a great location for neighborhood restaurants and easy access to the tube and buses. It is a great place to stay!,5,2012,01,30
133,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel last Saturday,28th January 2012.  My husband and I were going to an evening show at the Royal Albert Hall and the hotel is in easy walking distance.  We arrived early hoping to leave our bags as we wanted to go sightseeing.  Our room was ready and were were able to go and have a cup of coffee before we set off.  The underground station at High Street, Kensington is just down the road which is ideal.  The staff could not do enough for us.  My husband and I are coffee monsters and I asked at reception for extra milk so that we could have coffee in the room.  In 5 minutes someone came to our room with a large jug of fresh milk.   The pre-theatre meal at the Park Terrace restaurant was ideal as we booked for 5.30pm so that we could go on to see the show.  The meal was excellent.  The hotel is surprisingly quiet for being in the center of London and we slept well.  The breakfast was excellent with a wide choice.  We would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2012,01,30
133,WOW,"We stayed for a night in early January and was lucky enought to be in a refurbished garden room on the fourth floor which was spacious, nicely decorated and had a view of the park and Kensington Palace.  The bed was really comfortable and the flat screen tv had lots of channels . The bathroom had a bath and seperate walk in shower. We had a meal in the chinese restaurant on the top floor of the hotel which has spectacular views, we had the Beijing duck which was delicious.  The full english breakfast is to die for.  The staff were very attentative and made our stay all the more special.",5,2012,01,24
133,Truly a 5-star Hotel,"The rooms are completely renovated and very spacious.  The bathrooms had every possible amenity one could want, right down to a radiating towel warming rack!  The bed was very comfortable with a couple of TV viewing chairs at the foot of the bed for added comfort.  But by and far what made this hotel special was the staff.  Every morning our room was cleaned and refitted with everything from cotton balls, cotton swabs, perfectly placed towels, neatly cleaned dry bar...they even replaced the sewing kit that I swiped!  The housekeeping service was so good that by day 3 I began taking little things like shampoo and a shower curtain just to see if they would magically be replaced and sure enough every afternoon that we returned the room was as it was when we first checked in.

We booked with the convenience of free breakfast and were not the slightest bit disappointed.  The English breakfasts were a delight and a great way to start the day.  They do show you what you would have paid so I was very thankful that we added the daily breakfast in advance.  

The location is fantastic, a bit off the beaten path which I thought was a huge plus.  Lots of nearby shopping, several restaurants across the street, and even a few pubs well within walking distance.  Heck, there's even a Whole Foods just a few blocks up the street and the High Street Kensington tube station very close by.  Mostly we took the buses which conveniently stopped right across the street (route 9 and 10 seem to get you to most of the central tourist spots).

The only downside to this hotel was the concierge who was a bit young to hold that position and as such was not very helpful, not for a lack of trying but rather for a lack of knowledge about the area.  Asked where we could get a sandwich and she pointed us to...Starbucks.  Starbucks?  Really?  I've never known a Starbucks to carry sandwiches.  We stayed over the New Years holiday having booked a Thames midnight river cruise and wondered what time we should head out to Westminster pier (mind you it was New Years Eve).  I called down to ask the concierge who happily replied it would take a mere 15 minutes so there would be no need to rush.  We left early anyway, not trusting her advice and that turned out to be very fortuitous as most of the roads were in the midst of closing at half past 8 o'clock.  Hmmm, the concierge failed to mention that little tid bit of information.  We probably would have missed our boarding time had it not been for a very hasty taxi ride captained by a courteous driver who took a personal interest in getting us to the pier before the road closures.

In all though, the hotel was superb and the slight mishaps with the concierge were too slight to even consider in our overall rating of the Royal Garden Hotel.",5,2012,01,21
133,Stands up to its reputation,"The hotel is as the name says well located. The connection by bus and tube is ideal. If one wants to have a walk outside the noisy High Street Kensington, the Kensington gardens are just next to the hotel.The renovated rooms are spacious. The entertainment in room is very good. breakfast delivered in room was good. Only negative point was the heating. Even on full it wont warm up the room. Service and staff friendly..",4,2012,01,20
133,Perfection,"I was fortunate to stay at this hotel for a week while exhibiting at Olympia for the BETT education show, I have to say the experience was perfect from the start. Your met by courteous doormen and professional reception staff. The check in process was swift and my room whilst not particularly spacious was pristine. Breakfast had quality ingredients and was always presented very well, we were fortunate enough to have breakfast on the 10th floor one morning with its view over Hyde Park and central London I only wish we could of done that everyday. The hotels location is ideal for as a base for exploring London, and it has plenty of restaurants and amenities nearby including an underground stop, large park and cinema all within walking distance.

For balance I would recommend the hotel manage it's staff closer in the restaurant at breakfast as service did suffer slightly during busy times.  This was only a minor niggle during what was a very pleasant stay.",5,2012,01,19
133,"More than 5 stars, for sure!","On their website, they speak of 5 star service without the stuffiness. That is exactly what this hotel delivers. All the employees are respectful and eager to assist with any request but you can also see clearly that they are relaxed in their jobs and enjoy the trust of their employers. The hotel manager was frequently located in the lobby area to great his guests and offering his staff his guidance when neccesary. I appreciate that. 

My room was well appointed and comfortable. I especially enjoyed my view. The bathroom amenities were the most impressive I¬¥ve ever seen in a hotel. 

I had a standing business lunch in the Terrace restaurant which was delicious. All the staff had a smile on, clearing plates and glasses as soon as they were put down. 

The location of the hotel is 2 minutes walk from the South Kensington tube station which is perfect for navigating the rest of London but most of the time I felt like enjoying the services on-site. 

In general an effortlessly relaxing and elegant hotel property which I will return to. 
Thank you for my ever so pleasant stay.",5,2012,01,18
133,The hotel you may feel real London,"1. Room : spacious enought for 2 person if you are a solo treveller,more than enought with Queen room type. 

2. Food : personally, quite salty and fatty for me. 
If you are an Asian traveller, 
Definitely miss spicy foods. 
Out side of hotel, 
Many choices to find restaurants and cafes. 
Generally speaking,
I couldn't find good food for me any where in London. :( - it's personal, please don't forget. 

One thing, enjoy the English tea time !

3. Staffs and service 
The society of Warm and kind people at the Royal Palace Hotel. 

I could feel they are listening to guests and reacting very quickly.",5,2012,01,16
133,"Great hotel, unfortunate circumstances","My daughter and I Stayed 4 nights due to a previos great stay. We were jet lagged coming from u.s. and like their 24 hour services that other london hotels lack. Location is great by kensington high street. We got a good rate for 4 nights on their winter break rate which included breakfast.  When we arrived at 9:30pm from new york we had only eaten breakfast due to the time change.  We ordered room service at 10pm after checking in and for some reason they didn't get the order to us until 12:30 and only until a nice front desk clerk named Ben personally went to check on them after I had made numerous calls to room service.  Needless to say this room service mixup goofed up our sleep schedule.  We could have been asleep by 11pm and woke up at a decent time. The next morning at 5am was a fire alarm and we had to go out in the cod with our pajamas.  Ended up to be a false alarm.  They could have let the people with children at least stay in the lobby till they knew.  Its a clean, very well located hotel. However their substitution of less qualified workers from other European countries does not help this hotel.  This stay i got the twin room and i found it better than the garden view room.  It has a little more room from the wall.",4,2012,01,11
133,Relaxing stay in on New Years Eve,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Our room was spotless and surprisingly  quite given the location. Our stay was very relaxing and we both had  a good nights sleep. We had lovely views across Kensington High Street from our room.  Plenty of nice independent restaurants around if you fancy a nice meal out too.,5,2012,01,05
133,Pleasant stay,"We stayed here for 7 days in a suite on the 8th floor.  The room and bathroom were very clean and both spacious.  Very sound proof, as we never heard any outside noise from our room.  Eash night we received turndown service that included refreshing the room.
All of the staff are very professional, efficient, friendly and very helpful. They will honestly help you with anything that you need. The hotel is in a fantastic location..close to great shopping, dining, the park, and train.  
My only complaint is to get to the fitness center and spa, you literally have to walk outside the front entrance of the hotel to get to it...I was not very impressed as this area is loud and crowded with taxis and people coming and going-it seems a bit odd to me.",4,2012,01,04
133,location/location/location,"The Royal Garden,situated between Hyde Park,Kenny high street+Kensington Palace.Great hotel,used by business,tourists+concert performers.One of the best located hotels in London.nr Royal Albert Hall.wifi+ bkfst expensive if not included.Great organic food store 100 mtrs away.+multi award winning Churchill arms pub is 8 min walk up Kensington Church st with great inexpensive Thai rstrnt.Checkout Fullers real ales especially the ESB(extra strong brew).Notting hill+Portobello rd are walkable or get the no 52 dbl decker bus!..I tour with concert musicians all over the world+ this is my fav pIt stop in Europe.",5,2012,01,04
133,"Great value hotel, perfect for tourists and business travelers","I have stayed here a few times for business. The location is perfect, being right on the park (perfect for an early morning run!) and close to some great restaurants and fabulous shopping. It is also relatively convenient to get to from the airport. Rooms are small, but updated with decor and furnishings that make it look like a more expensive, modern hotel. Not a 5-star hotel, but overall a great value for the relatively affordable prices. Great service also. I highly recommend.",5,2012,01,04
133,Solid Choice,"Found an excellent price on the net for 2 nights including NYE. Checked in, all was in order, until there was some loud banging noises from the floor above which turned out to be the kitchen of the Chinese restaurant on the 10th floor. One call to reception, and the front office manager moved us to a Jnr Suite on the 8th floor and offered a bottle of Champagne by way of apols. Very Very good service / professionalism. Many thanks Margaretha.

Super location, decent hotel. Good price and absolutely cracking breakfast. All in all if you want somewhere ofr around the GBP200/250 mark, there is not better place in Central London for it, for sure.",5,2012,01,03
133,5 star hotel right next to Hyde Park,"My wife and I stayed here for a weekend break and found it of exceptional quality. Breakfast was especially good (full English and continental style buffet). Room was in a great spot on a lower floor overlooking Kensington High St which, despite being very busy, did not affect us in the slightest. The rooms were very well soundproofed and a relaxing nights sleep was enjoyed. The tube station is only a few minutes walk away, in one of London's safer neighbourhoods. The hotel even provides a handy jogging map of Hyde Park for those of you who like to keep fit on vacation.",5,2011,12,31
133,Comfy and quiet but this is not a Luxury Hotel,"I was looking forward to staying here as I had assumed by the reviews and the hotel's own website that this was a 5 star luxury hotel.  Unfortunately, while very nice, it is just an upscale 3 star hotel located in a posh area of London.

The location is not ideal if you're a tourist as it is in the West part of town away from most of the tourist sites.  For business travelers (like myself) or others who want to avoid the tourist crowds this is a nice option as you will avoid most tourist crowds, except for those visiting the nearby (and next door) Kensington Palace.  Rooms are very small and like most places, get slightly bigger the more you pay.  For almost 200 pounds a night, my room had no room for me to fully unpack my one suitcase while staying there for 2 weeks.  The closet had about 8-10 hangars and was small.  There were no dresser drawers for additional storage so I had to use the 2 desk drawers.  While it had a full size bed, one person in the room made it more than cozy so I'm not sure how it would be for 2 people (indeed, when I ordered room service, the table could barely fit through into the room).

Rooms have been recently renovated and are warm and have nice beds (some people might think they are too firm).  What was great about the hotel was that except for hearing your neighbors doors slamming in the hallway, the hotel was very quiet even for those rooms facing Kensington High Street.

Bathrooms are nice but again can barely fit one person in them (multitasking anyone??).  Staff is pleasant when approached but make no effort to exude any welcome when guests enter or leave the lobby.  The Chinese restaurant at the top of the hotel has terrific views and decent food, but staff are distracted and slow.  I had to ask 4 times for my bill before finally giving the ""server"" an angry look so he would get the message (perhaps they are more attentive to their Asian guests???).

I think what most disappointed me was that it seemed that here you got better service, the more you paid per night.  Several of my co-workers were also staying here and those that were paying more (and had bigger rooms) received turndown service that included refreshing the room (amenities) and a bottle of water.  Those of us in the ""cheap"" rooms, just had the duvets on our beds turned over into a corner (hence the ""turndown"").  It was quite surprising to see such a lack of attention to service for a hotel that promotes itself as a luxury hotel with housekeeping staff not up to par (for the poor Japanese maid who doesn't speak English, please learn some basics as when we ask for something and you don't understand it gets tiring!).  My company spent thousands of pounds here housing our staff and we didn't even get a thank you or special gift for bringing our business to them.  It seems like the management is focusing more on the Asian market (there were lots of guest from Asia staying here) and maybe that's more profitable for them.  So be it-----I know my company won't be spending any more money here.",3,2011,12,27
133,Business Trip to London September 2011,My wife and I stayed at Royal Gardens KEnsington for ten days 1-11Sep2011. The hotel is exceptionally well run and met all our expectations and then some......The meals were first class and room service great. The location is great for those who want London but access to the great parks and gardens. Shopping on our doorstep in Kensington High Street was great value for money. It provided a great business base for my London visit which took me to Docklands and London Central. Great hotel with service plus.,5,2011,12,27
133,Wonderful stay in Kensington High Street,"We stayed in the Royal Garden hotel in September 2011. It was a business trip combined with a little site seeing. The room had a great view over Kensington High Street and we felt like royalty staying at that wonderful property. The location is on Kensington High Street, literally 200m away from the tube station and is located 50m away from Kensington Palace and Gardens.

The check-in was extremely efficient and flawless and whilst there were no rooms available overlooking Kensington Gardens, they did offer to move us the following day but we settled for a high room overlooking Kensington High Street. 

Our room on the 20th floor was extremely spacious and wonderfully appointed. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room very luxurious complete with a great workspace and sitting area and a 42‚Äù television.  The large bathroom had a very comfortable bath and separate shower with wonderful amenities.

The buffet breakfasts were an absolute treat with a wonderful selection of AMAZING yoghurts, fruits, juices, cereals and a huge variety of heated options.

The hotel staff were not at all pretentious and constantly went out of their way to help you whilst making you feel completely at home. Many 5 star establishments have an arrogance about them but this hotel knows exactly how to look after their guests.

Upon checkout, there was a matter of a meal that had been erroneously charged to our room from the restaurant. As soon as I queried it they removed it from the bill straight away without putting up a fight at all. I really must say that this establishment is well run and extremely classy.

We have stayed in a number of great properties on our trips to London and this was by far the best.  

Well done to the hotel and its staff for creating a real home away from home in London. We will most certainly be visiting them again.",5,2011,12,22
133,Genteel city break,"Had a single room which was comfortable if not 'roomy'. Staff were friendly and helpful and facilities were excellent. Min Jiang restaurant on the top floor is worth a visit, order your Beijing duck in advance.",5,2011,12,21
133,Bertie's Bar - a handy meeting place for business,"If you're in the Kensington area and need a quietist place to meet to discuss business, Bertie's bar on the mezzanine floor of the Royal Garden Hotel offers reasonable privacy with which to conduct business over a cup of coffee mid morning.

A pleasant space that allows an overview of the comings and goings of the lobby below if you choose to sit near the glazed front portion of the area.",4,2011,12,17
133,True 5 star service,"From the moment we arrived we experienced service we never thought possible. Nothing was too much trouble and we were treated as friends until we left. We arrived early and left our luggage to go shopping. After a short taxi ride we spent the day buying presents, getting back to the hotel early evening. Our luggage was already in our garden room which was amazing, the lounge area overlooking kensington gardens. We ate in town but if the dinner was half as good as the breakfast it would have been superb. A great nights sleep and what an amazing bath and shower suite to spend a long time relaxing. After the most filling breakfast we left luggage again headed to winter wonderland and Harrods. Late into the afternoon and we picked up our luggage, we were again treated as friends. One big tip, you have to upgrade to the garden rooms well worth the extra. Overall an amazing stay and the team at the hotel have found the fine balance between 5 star service and a down to earth friendly hotel where all guests are treated equally, a credit to the training given and all the team were truly enjoying themselves....well done and thank you. ",5,2011,12,13
133,"Great location, good views and amazing staff","Worth the money!  You can probably get cheaper hotels but if you pay for a Garden room at this place you wont be disappointed.  The view was fantastic across hyde park out of the huge windows, especially at night.  

The location is great with loads of shops and restaurants on kensington high st. and there is a car park right under the hotel. You can hire boris's bikes very close to the hotel so that you can cycle all over the city...a great initiative imo. 

The staff at the hotel were so friendly and polite.  It was other halfs birthday and i asked them if they could leave something nice in the room for us.  When we arrived there were 4 mince pies and a complimentary bottle of wine in the room...she was chuffed.

The beds in the garden rooms are massive! We really enjoyed stretching out and getting a good nights sleep. 

There were only very minor problems; the baths have the plugs that pop up and down with the twist of a nob and the plug got stuck.  We went out and when we returned it had been removed meaning we couldnt have a bath but we wanted to try out the walk-in shower anyway so no harm done.  But then the lights stopped working in the bathroom.  We didnt complain as we were having such a great time and couldnt be bothered with the fuss but it could annoy others. 

But these are minor cosmetic issues and should not count against what is a great hotel and i hope to return soon!",5,2011,12,13
133,Fabulous Hotel - Great Location & Excellent Service,"This was our second stay at the Royal Garden Hotel ( 14/10/2011 to 20/10/2011 - we stayed here 1 year ago) - on both occasions at the conclusion of vacation from Australia cruising the Mediterranean with Silverseas. We so enjoyed our first stay that we had no hesitation in booking again at the Royal Garden. This time we were welcomed back like old friends and had such a fabulous time, that we have already booked to enjoy 2012/13 Christmas and New Year in London staying at the Royal Garden. 
Our Garden View room had been recently refurbished and was welcoming, modern, comfortable and most relaxing to return to after busy sightseeing activities - quiet room and comfortable beds made for very restful nights. 
All the staff were most helpful and very friendly - special mention for all staff in the superb dining facilities (breakfast & dinner) - food is delicious & tasty and fine dining in the Min Jiang truly delighted us - in addition Berties Bar is a great drinking venue.
A special feature that certainly differentiates staying at the Royal Garden for us was the outstanding assistance and service that Robert Shorter and his Concierge Team provided to two Australians staying in London. Nothing was too much trouble in helping us to thoroughly enjoy our London vacation - tours, theater tickets, restaurant bookings, public transportation information, what to see & how to do it - you request it and they provided the answer. All the Concierge Team certainly enhanced our enjoyment of vacationing in London.
Location is so convenient to all the key London attractions - public transport is close by and is just great when you wish to enjoy all that London has to offer. 
Our best recommendation for this hotel is that having stayed there twice already we are going back, for a 3 weeks stay in December 2012 / January 2013 as the Royal Gardens Hotel and Staff not only exceeds our expectations but truly delights this customer.",5,2011,12,12
133,"Modern Hotel, located in heart of Kensington","Fortunate enough to stay here on a customer event my company was hosting.   From the moment we arrived in reception via valet parking into reception, I was struck by the good level of service, attentive yet unobtrusive staff.

Room was spacious, modern and clean, very much in line with our expectations for a top end hotel.  Missed out on a view of the Park and this meant there was some street noise through the night.

My only criticism was a rather bland cooked breakfast from the buffet style restaurant and the Berties bar feels rather pokey for a hotel of this level",4,2011,12,10
133,Incredible Hotel...Convenient and Sumptuous,"The Royal Garden Hotel is one of the best in London...on par with the Dorchester or Grosvenor.  The staff are extraordinarily helpful and friendly.  The property has two great venues for dining and a great drinking venue, ""Bertie's Bar"" for cocktails and socializing. It is convenient to a number of bus lines and a short walk to the Circle/District tube lines.  The property abuts Kensington Palace, is near to the Royal Albert Hall and a short walk to Harrod's.  Wonderful, all and all.",5,2011,11,28
133,"Excellent hotel, great location and service","I stayed here with my wife for 2 nights, the first night for a works dinner in the function room. The service and food for the dinner was absolutely superb. The serving staff circle around a table together and place the food on the table at exactly the same time. The dinner was faultless from start to finish. Breakfast next morning was superb, buffet style and top quality. Full cooked breakfast, cold meats and cheeses, cereals, freshly squeezed juices. Room was excellent, minibar expensive, shower low pressure on the 9th floor but otherwise very good. Parking is expensive at ¬£30 per day in the basement of the hotel. Drive down to the car park is via a corkscrew affair which seems to last forever and made us feel a bit odd once we got down there ! High Street Kensington tube station is a 5 minute stroll away down the main road. Hyde park is right next door and Kensington Palace is also right next door. I'd be happy to go back to this hotel.",4,2011,11,27
133,Wow,"I've just spent three nights in the royal garden hotel, and I cannot praise the hotel and staff highly enough , there are not enough superlatives to adequately describe this hotel. It has a central location , royalty and embassy's for neighbours , I would like to single out the concierges for special mention, as a full time wheelchair user , their help was appreciated , in accessing the hotel, the help with car parking etc was above and beyond.
I will be back I've found my home from home",5,2011,11,21
133,Wonderful stay in London...perfect location,"Much of what you would need to know about this hotel has already been said by other reviewers so I'll try to add a few new things.  Yes, the rooms are nice, beds very comfy, bathrooms small, etc.  But as a business gal traveling for work it was perfect for my needs.  The location was ideal.  First of all there is a Starbucks across the street where I was able to have java fix each morning.  Secondly, just down Kensington is an amazing Whole Foods store where you can purchase completely cooked prepared meals.  It can save you big $$ going there and they have a huge selection including great vegetarian, cheeses, wines and a nice organic health and beauty section.  

Also, the bus stop is right out front and the tube stop is just down the road, right past Whole Foods.  You can pre buy and Oyster Card and use it on the bus or tube to get around very conveniently from this hotel.  If you need a taxi, hail one on your own...I hear the black cabs add a surcharge when the hotel hails it for you.  Not sure but the cabs will stop right in front of the hotel.  The park is next door, the V & A down the street, shops galore.  It's a great location and I'll be back.  I think I'll call this my London home hotel from now on and I do travel to London quite a bit.",4,2011,11,18
133,"Affordable Luxury - Bright, Spacious and Comfortable","We booked an executive room and it looked exactly as pictured on the hotel website.  Since the rooms are newly renovated, everything looked clean and polished, with an entire wall of windows bringing in plenty of light. The beds are extremely comfortable - the perfect beds to sleep in after walking around in the city all day long.  In addition to Whole Foods, the neighborhood has plenty of small restaurants and coffee shops if you want to grab a quick bite nearby.  The tube station is close by, and there is also a stop for the hop-on, hop-off bus right across the street.  We stayed there for an entire week and will definitely go back the next time we visit London.",5,2011,11,17
133,Would stay again..,"This is a very nice hotel in the middle of Kensington. Good location for Hyde Park and within walking distance of Notting Hill and Portobello market. 
Very clean, good service and our room had a great view of Hyde Park and Kensington Palace.
On a negative, I would have to say that the bedroom and bathroom was on the small side for a five star establishment and, as with most five star hotels, bar and restaurant overpriced. 
Although there are better luxury hotels in London, if the price is right I would certainly stay here again and would recommend it to my friends.",4,2011,11,15
133,Found my new London home,"Just returned from a 3 night stay at this wonderful hotel.  The hotel upgraded all its rooms over the past 2 years and I must admit to being pleasantly surprised by the quality of the beds and the superb setup of the bathrooms.  Walk-in shower with fantastic water pressure, the beds (we stayed in a twin superior room) were excellent and the 37 inch flat-screen TV even had HD channels.  Everyone who I met that worked at the hotel was pleasant and extremely professional.  Breakfasts were great, with lots of choice and plenty of savory versus sweet offerings.  For the North American traveler, a Whole Foods is located just a block down Kensington High Street and Wagamama is just 50 metres from the entrance to the hotel.  Cannot recommend this hotel enough!!!",5,2011,11,14
133,Superb,"I stayed in this hotel as a single traveller. I was given a lovely room overlooking Kensington Palace and Hyde Park. This ia a superb hotel where you are made to feel very welcome. Breakfast was wonderful and the front desk were very helpful when I had questions about the local area. The room was really clean, large, bright and airy. I was able to walk to the Royal Albert Hall in less than 10 minutes. Nearby are easy to reach shops and great places to eat. I would always stay at this hotel again when I am in London.",5,2011,11,13
133,"A nice hotel, well located, with good service, but disappointingly small rooms.","A nice hotel, with good service, well located. The rooms however are very small, and with the exception of the bathrooms, very basically furnished and decorated. Ibis rooms in a 4 Star Hotel. I would recommend it for service quality and location.",4,2011,11,13
133,Great hotel,"Great hotel, right next to Kensington Gardens, just in front of Kensington Palace, short distance from Buckingham Palace.  Lovely, clean hotel, rooms lovely, service excellent.  Great cocktail bar just above reception area, not cheap but worth it.",5,2011,11,12
133,lovely,"The hotel was lovely, easy check in and straight to our room....which was very tiny!! There was only a foot either side of bed, it was supposed to be a deluxe room!.It was lovely and clean bathroom smart, it,s a good job that we were only in room to sleep,Cheap enough for 2 nights stay, brilliant location,Couldn,t fault it really apart from the smallness.Didn,t eat there so can,t comment, butt all in all not bad.",4,2011,11,07
133,Great location,The view of the park is fantastic and the hotel is on the perfect corner in London. It frustrates me that there are no electric outlets in the bathrooms.,4,2011,11,04
133,Location worked a treat,We stayed here as we were going to a concert at The Royal Albert Hall and it is probably the nearest 5* hotel.  We had a garden room which looked out onto Kensington Palace.  The room is was split level which made it feel a little like a suite (bonus!).  The bathrooms are quite large and have a separate bath and shower which was nice.  We didn't get to experience the hotel bar or restaurant as we were only there for one night and ate at a local restaurant.  The only negative is that the hotel feels a little impersonal but then this is a big London hotel!  We would stay again if we needed to be on the Kensington side of London.,4,2011,11,03
133,High Quality,This is about the 6th time i have stayed at this hotel and every time the level of service and quality of the facilities measure up to a consistent high level. For the first time i arrived by car and having the car park right next to the hotel and being valet parked just makes driving into London and having to stay that much more easy. A really big advantage if you have to drive and stay. Very comfortable and functional rooms that make it just a pleasure to stay. One of my favourites !,5,2011,10,30
133,Yet another great visit to this very special hotel,"Yet another welcome visit to the Royal Garden Hotel - We echo all of the other well deserved 5 star reviews of this very special hotel and confirm the many virtues of unique location, comfort, great food and efficent friendly staff.  

It is not often these days to find a hotel where you feel as comfortable as those rare moments at home when there is the time to put your feet; plus enjoying the added pleasure of being so well looked after, that it really does amount to pampering, in the nicest possible way.

No need to leave the hotel to seek a retaurant because the hotel food is award winning with a super lunch in the Park Terrace is surprisingly good value.

Try the popular afternoon teas where the scones are the best since mother used to make the.  All of this whilst listening with pleasure to the tinkle of the ivories from the excellent and very pleasant Nina,

Do not forget to ask Massimo, the Park Terrace  Manager, for a geniuine Italian cappuccino, and taste the difference. He is a real master and such a charmer too.

Yes, we look forward to our next restful visit.",5,2011,10,28
133,Never lets us down!,My sister and I stay at Royal Garden Hotel twice a year for our shopping trips - we LOVE it and wouldn't think of staying anywhere else. The Garden Rooms are excellent and the views over Kensington Palace and the Park wonderful. All the staff are really helpful and can't do enough for you.,5,2011,10,26
133,Great location!,"I stayed at this hotel 2 nights.  The hotel is in a great location.  The Kensington Gardens are right next to the hotel.  The gardens are beautiful.  We ended up walking through the gardens to Buckingham Palace and then further into the tourist attractions in London.  It took a while but it was a great walk.  The hotel it totally refurbished and has great amentities.  A nice feature for American travelers is that there is a 110V outlet in the room so you do not need an adaptor.  The room was fairly small as was the bathroom.  

Kensington High Street is also a nice street to walk along.  There are stores and restaurants nearby.  The tube station is also a block away.  

I loved this hotel and the location.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2011,10,25
133,great five star experience,"We stayed here for son's graduation, which was close by at the Royal Albert Hall. We chose this hotel because it was perfectly located to stroll down there, and we wanted to stay somewhere fabulous for this really special day. We weren't disappointed - this hotel is lovely, our room was spacious, with an equally spacious bathroom and raised seating area. As an extra treat, we had afternoon tea looking out over Kensington Gardens, in Bertie's Bar with the added entertainment of a very accomplished pianist. I'd really recommend this hotel for visiting this part of London.",5,2011,10,23
133,An Oasis in the Heart of London,"A superb hotel with exceptional bedrooms and the raised area with a sofa and desk enhance the comfort particularly for the business traveller. The staff were magnificent and all appear to understand the meaning of customer service. The bar area and restaurant were outstanding although the late night service was a bit slow due the high number of people using the facility. As a seasoned traveller using hotels every week I congratulate all concerned for a true, 5 star experience.",5,2011,10,22
133,A great all round experience,"Everything was great - Newly refurbished hotel so don't be fooled from older reviews which reflect old hotel. I asked for a quiet room as I saw some reviews about a noise problem near busy road at the front. They obliged and the room was lovely with a small raised area with sofa and Desk. Beautiful bathroom too. All excellent. 
The only complaint was the doorman on day one who offered to park the car in the multi-storey adjacent to the hotel. I said yes and 2 hours later when I asked for the car he explained he had elected to 'buy' on my behalf a 3 day ticket there. AS it was Friday pm I knew I only wanted 24 hours so that from Sat pm I could park on the road outside for free til Monday am. He said it would be difficult for him to change it as the charge was already addedc to my room. He politely said that I could have mentioned that I only wanted 24 hours... I replied that he could have asked!!!
Anyhow he did arrange for the charge to be refunded so all's well that ends well but it was a bit odd that he didn't ask. I had assumed that when I took it out the charge would be then be calculated. However this was the only negative for the whole stay of 3 nights.

I didn't use the hotel restaurant or bar but I could see that the bar looked great.

If you want to be in the heart of things consider hotels around St James instead. This was OK but every time we wanted to go anywhere it was always a 10 minute walk to the tube and then several stops on the underground. We kept going into the Mayfair / Marylebone and Leicester Sq / Soho areas so we really should have booked in that area.",5,2011,10,19
133,A recent stay,"We have just returned from a three night stay at the Royal Garden and everything about our stay was first class. All members of staff were so friendly and helpful, our Garden room was just perfect (Room 843), and the food quality and service was excellent. Having stayed in several other Hotels in London and other places how we wish that we had stayed at Royal Garden more frequently. We cannot wait to return because it met all of our requirements in a quality way. Thank you to all who made our stay so memorable.

Doris and Brian Tilley.",5,2011,10,18
133,What a treat!,"After staying at a rediculously bad hotel my wife and I decided to treat ourselves to a night at the Royal Garden on our last day and night in London (price wise it wasn't much more than our previous crappy hotel).  All I can say is wow!

This hotel is truly a 5 star.  Right from the moment I walked in the door I was greeted by a front desk staff member who was absolutely lovely and warm.  

The room was beautiful, luxurious, new and spacious.  The bed was amazing and incredibly comfortable.  The bathroom was huge with a big tub and separate shower.  It even had a heated towel rack!

You couldn't get a better location being right on the park and right on Kensington High Street. 

Staying at this hotel was a true treat.  We will be back!  ",5,2011,10,13
133,Great Value and Affordable Luxury,"The one thing about my experience with the Royal Garden Hotel over the years has been that each time I return, something has been upgraded/improved. Somehow, the hotel manages to keep up with technology challenges, etc. and it is always contemporary. What never changes is the hotel's overall quality and service, making it a reliable choice.",5,2011,10,13
133,Fabulous hotel,"We chose this hotel due to it's proximity to the exhibition centre. We normally stay nearer the theatre area but are so glad that we went for convenience this time. We experienced a new area of the city and it is well worth visiting. The area has a very different feel, definitely an area where people live and work. Back to the hotel - a very warm welcome on arrival and smooth check in. The room was fantastic, unfortunately we were only on the 2nd floor so did not have the amazing view over the park but husband has no head for heights. We decided to book a table at the amazing Chinese restaurant on the 10th floor on our first night. We were not sorry. The staff were so welcoming and helpful and the food wonderful. Although it was dark we could tell that the vista would be wonderful and so I checked it out in daylight the following day - wow! The staff at breakfast were the among the best I have experienced and very attentive, the food excellent. It is a pity that it is not included in the rate but is extra. Also the internet is charged as extra which I still find strange in a high star hotel. There is a little bistro across the road just down a side street which serves good food, nice wine with tables outside that offers free Wifi. Berties bar is a comfortable area for a night cap and there are several other bars very close to the hotel which are good. I would definitely return to this hotel and would have no hesitation in recommending it to others.",5,2011,10,12
133,Sad excuse for a hotel,"The standard rooms are tiny and odd shaped, staff seem very busy not helping you, and the hotel is obviously dependent on a few rich regular clients. 
No late check out beyond 12 midday, even if u pay. After we packed everything the reception asked why we are leaving early!!",1,2011,10,12
133,What a welcoming retreat,"We spent ages reviewing 4 and 5 star hotels in London in preparation for our week away in the 'big smoke'.  We finally decided on the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington.....I'm so pleased we did.

The staff at the hotel are superb, so warm, sincere and welcoming, from reception to room service and from bars to lounges....special mention for the guys in Berties Bar who were particularly friendly.

The room, which was a garden room, was a very decent size, light, clean, modern and had smashing views over Hyde park.

Fab place and will definitely be going back.",5,2011,10,10
133,Afternoon Tea,"I organised afternoon tea for our office as a retirement bash for one of our staff.  They did afternoon tea considerably cheaper than some of their London counterparts.  The service was excellent, the food was great and the atmosphere was lovely.  The description of overlooking Kensington Gardens was sort of true if you discounted the huge wall but apart from that, we had no complaints and I would certainly use them again personally and also for work functions.",4,2011,09,30
133,"Great position, nice hotel","We stayed at this hotel in September while enjoying the sights of London. We found it very enjoyable staying there and found the staff very friendly. It is central and we were able to catch a bus outside the hotel to most areas of London. Buses and cabs were fantastic, the Underground left much to be desired (drab and dirty) so we preferred the buses most of the time to find our way around. Continental breakfast was something to look forward to; bathroom was new, roomy and very nice to have a bath in with a roomy shower and all the bathroom facilities you could ask for...loved the magnifier mirror; bedding was beautiful and crispy clean.
Only downside was having to pay $35 for 24hrs of internet. All our other hotels in Scotland, Paris and Singapore were free so why does such a high rated hotel have to charge for internet?",4,2011,09,28
133,Ellegant & Sophisticated,"The Royal Garden Hotel was spectacular.  The room was beautiful.  This is the second time my wife has stayed at the hotel.  The restaurant was magnificent.  Our anniversary dinner was great.  The hotel is located just down the street from Kensington Palace, which is to be the new home of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.  There is a tube station nearby making travel about the city easy and convenient.   There are many shops and pubs on Kensington High Street.",5,2011,09,25
133,Great English standards,"Beautiful friendly hotel, great location, freindly staff, rich breakfast. everything you need in one place. very helpful staff with a smile. clean rooms. loved it.",5,2011,09,21
133,Classic London,"We love London and we loved staying at this Hotel again. Superbly located adjacent to Kensington Gardens home of a memorial to Princess Diana (we came here the day after her death to see the Gardens totally carpeted in flowers brought by grieving Londoners). Just round the corner, all the typically British shops and clothes stores jockey for position with cafes, trendy bars and a good selection of Restaurants. If you want a healthy walk, we did the Royal Albert Hall, Madame Tussauds, Natural History Museum, Harrods and Hyde Park quite easily. A 20 minute bus ride on a double decker took us onto Oxford Street. The Hotel itself is good. Nice split level room; very good Min Jiang Chinese Restaurant and decent service. Car Park was a bit of a challenge for our visitors but a great place to stay if you find a deal.",4,2011,09,21
133,Faultless,"Stayed for two nights and nothing could be faulted, there was even a public underground carpark for convenience, excellent",5,2011,09,20
133,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed here last month and felt it worthy of high praise, Fantastic garden view excellent spacious clean room, and friendly helpful staff. Not a cheap hotel, however worth every penny.",5,2011,09,19
133,Service in London top,"If you read my past reviews, my family and I always stay in Windsor England.  However, the increase in tourism and the fact that my children have outgrown windsor prompted me to search for another hotel near Heathrow and equally charming. We always stay in England on our way to and back from the U.S. for at least 3 days. Why did I choose Royal Garden Hotel?  1.  It's not too far from Heathrow like central London is.  2.  It's on the high street with shopping and restaurants right near you.  3.  The hotel came highly recommended.  4.  It had the kind of service for a jet lagged family like 24 hour room service, and a great bellman for 6 very heavy luggages. The hotel really did live up to what I wanted.  Kensington is absolutely charming with the gardens and high street.  The service in the hotel is equal to top hotels of the world.  They arranged the ride from the airport which was done exactly as I had requested. We ordered breakfast at 5:30am being jet lagged, but they said it was fine even though breakfast didn't start until 6:30am.  The room was nice and comfortable with a seating area overlooking the park.  Bathroom very luxurious with separate shower and bathtub.   That's quite rare in London.  I like this hotel and hope to stay here in the future.",5,2011,09,16
133,Spot on location,"Why come here? Location is excellent, short walk to tube, opposite great little restaurants, breakfast places, shopping. Room very comfy, clean, great bed and linen. Easy to airport. Def return",5,2011,09,13
133,Wonderful - will definately be back!,"Wonderful hotel. Chic but warm and welcoming.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Couldnt do enough for us.  Bedroom large enough for two with pleasant sitting area with fabulous view over Kensington Gardens.  Well supplied warm bathroom with bathrobes and slippers along with all the usual shower gels and soap etc.  Loved the ""turndown"" service in the evening, nice touch the bottles of mineral water by your bed and the goodnight mat at the side of the bed, curtains closed and soft lighting and music. Very welcoming after a busy night out on the town. Our room on the 5th floor was completely quiet and the bed was so comfy and the bedding so soft we did not want to get up.  Breakfast, what can I say....amazing.  Everything you could possibly desire and if its not there, chef will make it especially for you.  Great place for a base for exploring London, good access to tube stations and a bus stop right outside door of hotel,  what better way to see London than from the top of an ""old red london bus""   We will definately stay there again next time we are in London.",5,2011,09,06
133,my favourite london hotel,"I stayed here on a shopping holiday with my mam.  It was just so lovely, i felt spoilt.  The room was lovely, perhaps a little small but the huge window with fab garden views made it seem bigger. the staff were lovely and friendly.  the stay was topped off with breakfast in bed, the best i've ever had i must say! I got quite a good rate online.",5,2011,09,05
133,"Very comfy beds, and no noise at night! Amazing sleep!! Defo 5*!!","Lovely hotel, quiet in the corridors at night with very comfy beds (I did not want to get up!!), great free shampoo/shower gel/ sewing kit in bathroom, extremely friendly and helpful staff....  Lovely view from floor 7 towards the main street...
The only thing is the breakfast is about ¬£23 per person (ouch), but Chez Gerard is across the road and if you use a 'tastecard' you can get 2 for 1 there xx
Everything you need is in the area.... whether it be food and drink, clothes shopping at TK Maxx...or a stroll in the park..... Perfect x (minus the expensive breakfast) x
And only a 5 min walk from the tube station x",5,2011,09,03
133,Always a great pleasure to come back!,"We stayed at this, our very favourite hotel, on the night of 19th August 2011. The rooms and restaurants have been beautifully refurbished ( although must say that the rooms seemed pretty good to us before) but one thing never changes and that is the warmth of the welcome from the staff throughout the hotel. We arrived back from the theatre at about 23.30 and were absolutely starving so ordered from room service and what a feast for the palate it was and such wonderful value for money with, again, impeccable waiting staff.
Cannot wait for the next excuse to book. Thank you Royal Garden.",5,2011,08,27
133,"Very nice, Gorgeous garden view, internet pricey","We were delighted to come back to this our hotel where we stayed after we got married. We were even more pleased that the hotel allowed us to see an alternative room, warn us our first room booked was unsuitable and finally upgrade us to the Garden Room upon a reasonable supplement.
The Royal Garden also had a solution to 2 of us eating less heartily than the third, room service was not marked up so sharing a breakfast was better value for us than the buffet for three. Our only suggestion, internet access should be cheaper, helping the ""Value"" rating.",4,2011,08,25
133,fabulous hotel and location,Beautiful hotel with very comfortable rooms and a wonderful included breakfast each morning.  It was handicapped accessible and located by Kensington Park and Kensington Palace and near the Tubes - a very enjoyable stay.,5,2011,08,25
133,"Very nice hotel, small room","This is a very nice hotel and the only reason why I didn't rate it Excellent is that the room I had was unusually small.  The space between the end of the bed and the wall was about a foot which tells you how narrow the room was. 

However, the quality of the accommodation and the location right beside the park in Kensington was superb. Room was very cold and no way to make it warmer but fortunately, I prefer it cool at night.

The staff was very nice and efficient upon checking in.  I had the room service for dinner and the food was excellent.  I would stay here again although I would inquire on a larger room.",4,2011,08,24
133,"Best hotel stay ever, would love to go again","I was meeting up with friends in London and booked The Royal Garden Hotel via LastMinute.com. It was amazing. They let us check in early, check out late, were super friendly and helpful right across the staff from check-in to concierge to restaurant - everyone was wonderful. Facilities superb, room amazing. I really can't find a fault and I am a genuine customer! These days I don't get to go away as often as I would like and this hotel wasa splurge more than usual, but if I can ever justify a stay there again, I will.",5,2011,08,20
133,Loved it!,"I stayed here with my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday and we weren't disappointed. The location is excellent, right on High Street Kensington with plenty of bars/restaurants and access to public transport, and right next to Hyde Park. We went out to eat so I can't comment on the restaurants or bar. There is also a gym and spa but as we were only staying one night we didn't get chance to use them. All the staff we encountered were friendly and happy to offer assistance if we required it.

Check in was swift and we were in our room relaxing within no time. We had a Garden View room on the 2nd floor which had a view over Hyde Park, but  we were a bit low down for a proper view. The room was a decent size, it even had a raised area with a desk and sofa! There was a built in wardrobe and some drawer space, I'm not sure if this would be enough if you're staying longer than a few days. The bathroom had a separate bath and shower, it was nice to have a relaxing soak after a day in London! It was a nice surprise to find the bed turned down when we got back from dinner, and I liked the 'Good Night', 'Good Morning' mat. The only time we heard any other guests was when they were right outside our door. We had a really good night's sleep, the bed and pillows were so comfy we didn't want to get up in the morning! There was a bit of a wait to check out but when we got to the desk it was even quicker than check in!

We would definitely stay in the Royal Garden hotel again.",4,2011,08,19
133,"""This is how an hotel should be run""","My husband who was born and brought up in this area had always wanted to stay at the Royal Garden and I used a birthday to celebrate and make his wish come true.  The hotel did not disappoint in any way. From the friendly and very efficient  young lady on reception to the waitresses who served us at breakfast, referring to us by name was a nice touch. The breakfast buffet was one of the best I have come across and finally I must mention the customer relations team who along with all the staff we encountered were first class.This is how to run an hotel, we thoroughly recommend it and  will certainly return.",5,2011,08,19
133,Great hotel but please note High Kensington Tube Station closed on weekends.,"A very nice hotel. The room was comfortable, clean and beautifully decorated. The bathroom was large & spotless.  

My favorite thing had to be the shower pressure.  All  the hotels I have ever been to have super weak showers where water just drizzles . It  would  take forever to rinse conditioner off my hair.  This one, was AMAZING.  I  also loved that the overhead shower had a massage setting. It felt so good after a long day of walking and sightseeing.  

Just a small WARNING, the High Kensington Tube Station by the hotel (Circle line)  is closed on weekends for repairs so you will have to rely on bus or taxi.  I'm not sure when the repairs and upgrades will be completed so it's best to call the hotel before hand.  I found it a little inconvenient but I was still able to get around using the city bus that passed by the front of the hotel.  I just found it slow due to London traffic.  The tube would have been better.

There were lots of nice restaurants in the vicinity.  There is a Starbucks across the street.  Notting Hill and Portobello Market was within a 10 minute walk. The Big Bus sightseeing hop on & off bus also stopped in front of the hotel making it another option for getting around the city (although this bus was 10 times slower than the city bus)

We also found the concierge Gregg to be very helpful and a pleasure to talk to.

I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",4,2011,08,17
133,Excellent accommodation but service lacks attention to detail,"Since our last visit the rooms have benefitted from renovation. We have used Park Suite Accommodation and found this to be excellent. Spacious accommodation with great views, excellent bathrooms and a separate lounge and dining room with own guest facilities. Suites exceptionally well equipped as you would expect from a hotel of this standard. Room service is excellent quality and always prompt. The hotel was not busy during our stay. However upon arrival we were kept waiting for almost an hour whilst our suite was being prepared - we were told that it would only be ""a few minutes"". We were basically forgotten and left sitting in the foyer - an offer of tea/coffee would have been the least one could perhaps have expected during our waiting time! When the suite was finally ready an examination of the mini bar revealed the leftovers of partly consumed Marks & Spencer cream scones, the age of which were indeterminable, but presumably left by the previous occupants of the suite. Definitely NOT 5 star standard at Reception or of room preparation . I purposefully made no comment regarding the contents of the mini bar to see when these would in fact be removed. It took 2 days !!!!",4,2011,08,12
133,"Excellent, we loved it","Great Location, fantastic staff, we couldn‚Äôt have been made more welcome from the minute we stepped through the door. This is a great hotel and I won‚Äôt hesitate to stay again, we really didn‚Äôt want to leave. This hotel is made all the more special by its really excellent staff, who  seem to anticipate your needs. I can‚Äôt fault anything and would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in London.",5,2011,08,10
133,"One of the best hotels ever, anywhere","The location is fantastic.  Our room overlooked Kensington Palace and Garden.  It was large (especially for Europe) having been remodeled.  Very clean.  Good restaurants near by. (We just happened not to eat in hotel restaurants so couldn't tell you about those, although they gave us free tea and coffee while our room was being prepared.)   Close to underground.  Best of all, all of the staff just bent over backwards to help us - with everything.  It was absolutely wonderful.",5,2011,08,06
133,Great Location; Pleasant Stay,"I've stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel several times on business and have had nothing but good experiences.  The staff is friendly, the breakfast buffet is great and the location is terrific.  I love the fact that there is a Whole Foods on Kensington High Street so when too tired to eat out, you can always shop there and buy healthy food.  It's an exciting area in London and transportation is easily accessible.",4,2011,07,30
133,A very enjoyable stay!,"I stayed in this hotel while I attended Wimbledon. It was booked for me through a tour operator as part of a package. This is a high rise busy hotel at the top end of busy Kensington High Street, right next to Hyde Park with the quieter more beautiful Holland Park at the other end ( about a 15 min walk). I was worried about the noise ( the park facing rooms were more expensive) but was given a room high up on the 14th floor with a lovely view over London.The double glazing helped, and even then, the traffic noise was not too intrusive.  The room was very small and it would have been difficult with two people, but for one, it was adequate and comfortable.I suggest that if there are two, that you ensure that you have a larger room. The little love seat under the window looking out over the rooftops was a nice touch.  There were tea and coffee making facilities and a well stocked mini bar. There is a large suspended flat screen TV with all the cable channels.
I had some trouble logging onto the internet with my laptop, but was ably. assisted by a helpful and friendly IT person. For a large 5 star hotel I was disappointed that there was not an area where you can have a drink with a nice outlook.( There is an Asian restaurant on one of the higher floors which has a magnificent view over the park and lake and a great place to eat ( I did not dine there so cannot advise what the food is like).  I had a drink there, and was served without a fuss, but the small lounge area is really for dinner guests) There is a dark rather unappealing bar on the mazzanine floor which does not open until late in the afternoon. The only other place is the small lounge area next to the diningroom which overlooks an small outside patio on the park side. However I had a very good light meal there served efficiently and with a very friendly smile. I am very impressed with the staff. They are professional and genuinely warm and  friendly.  I was particularly impressed with the concierge when I left something at the hotel. The article was found and I was phoned within a short time and arrangements were made for me to collect it. Room service is also good. ( A mark of a well run hotel!).
Kensington High Street has restaurants and all the stores one needs. One big plus is the magnificent Whole Foods Store where one can buy anything one desires to eat or drink. A welcome stop after a long day at Wimbledon!. The tube station is a 5 min walk from the hotel and itself is clean and bright with Boots and  a Marks and Spencers food store. Upon my return home I received a letter from the hotel thanking me for my stay, completing the questionaire, and welcoming me back again. I will certainly return!",4,2011,07,28
133,Great location and spiffy rooms,"If you want Edwardian architecture for your London hotel, don't stay here. If you want a great location, spotlessly clean rooms (recently refurbished for the Olympics in 2012), a delicious buffet breakfast, friendly staff, and outstanding value, by all means book the Royal Garden immediately. 
Several bus lines run right outside the hotel, and the tube stop and several good restaurants are quite close. Portobello Road is just a short bus ride up the street. Our room had a fabulous bathroom with both shower and tub, and a nice sitting area that overlooked Kensington Gardens. Being near the park is a great plus if you want to get out and walk around in a lovely setting. 
The modern design wasn't my favorite. But all of the other qualities made me appreciate this hotel, and I'd stay there again. The only tiny negative comment would be to check first before opening any bottled water placed at your bedside at turndown: Although it may appear to be offered free of charge, you may wish to check your bill for you may be charged for it! (They took our charges off our bill.)
Thank you, Royal Garden, for a nice stay.",5,2011,07,27
133,Excellent London hotel,"Excellent hotel in central London. Garden room overlooking Kensington gardens was very nice indeed. Nice to see some greenary from the room. Staff excellent too. Breakfast was superb. 

Expensive yes but this is London so it is probably reasonable value. I'd definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2011,07,24
133,Hated to leave,"First class. That is the Royal Garden. Excellent location, near public transport. A staff that wants to help. The rooms are beautifully furnished and are relaxing. The Royal Garden never let us down on one thing.",5,2011,07,21
133,"Service,Service,Service Impressive","All i have to say is service,service,service I was really impressed with my second stay here ,I'm usually back and forth from Beijing to the Big Apple it was one of the hotels that will be staying on my home away from home list.. I really don't get time to enjoy the room being to and from meetings .. But what i do enjoy is the friendly staff always willing to accommodate my request even if its a late dinner at 2am .. My hats off the to  reception. 
A few negatives  internet/slow speed room was not ready on-time . On the positive i did get upgraded for the late check in ....Had another  lovely stay 
On my next visit I will surely to take a minute to enjoy all the ammenities and surroundings maybe I'll pack my running shoes and go for a jog........ just maybe...Cheers",4,2011,07,19
133,Lovely Hotel in Ken High St,"The Royal Garden is a great hotel just off Kensington High Street. on the right side you have the shops and on your left side you have Hyde Park which makes it a top location. Rooms are great, either overlooking the Mews and the park or overlooking Ken High Street which can be a bit noisy. Food in the hotel is excellent, staff great. Hotel atmopshere is a bit old-fashioned at the weekends with English ladies wearing 60's hats and seems to attract old-conservative-types.",5,2011,07,16
133,Garden Room is the way to go,"This is the third time I have stayed at this hotel in the last six months on business and wanted to post an update.  Both previous times I stayed in a regular room and found it a bit small, facing the street.  The regular room is about 190 sq ft and you barely have a place to put your suitcase.  This time I upgraded to the Garden room and was glad given I have a new appreciation for this hotel with the extra space and the view of the park.  The room is not terribly larger (about 250 sq ft) but has enough space for a couch and table, and a full desk (not a combo desk/bench seat), and the TV was in the middle of the room, not in the corner.  The bathroom was much larger with a walk-in shower.  The view was fantastic of the park.  Depending on what days and time of year, the upcharge may vary, but I would recommend anyone used to a North American sized room, consider it.",4,2011,07,06
133,Great stay - Great location,"Stayed 5 nights in August 2011 during our vacation in London.

Location is terrific as it is only 5 mins walk to tube station with shopping along th way, but the most impressive is room with a hyde park view. The room is luxury as expected.",5,2011,07,06
133,Why do we love it and always go back whenever we visit London?,"Is it because: -
amazing location -  alongside Kensington Palace and overlooking the park yet on the door step to the shops of Kensington High Street and close to all the attractions of this very special city.
Choice of award winning restaurants making it unnecessary to look further.
Afternoon tea listening to a wonderful pianist whilst enjoying  the best scones since my mother used to make them.   
The comfort throughout of a very recent major refurbishment .

Yes but: -  the main reason why we keep on going back is because of an expectionally settled and highly skilled top management team setting the standards of continuity of a welcoming staff going out of their way to be helpful.",5,2011,07,04
133,Classic london hotel,"Excellent hotel, recently refurbished to a really great standard, great rooms, really good size, have stayed a few times and got upgraded last time to a suite which was amazing absolutely huge overlooking kensington palace gardens. Great location, excellent value for money, brilliant breakfast. Nice food in the bar too, friendly staff, highly recommended!",5,2011,06,28
133,"Fantastic, a great treat but a bit dear",Wonderful mini break great location. Expensive but a great treat for a special occasion,5,2011,06,18
133,"Great Stay, Great Location","Stayed here on business, with some leisure, for 5 nights.  Rooms were clean, comfortable and modern.  I had a street view room and it was quiet, with no street noise.  My room was a bit on the small side - to be expected in London.  Service was really good & the concierge was particularly helpful in guiding us to great restaurants & shopping.  

The location was amazing - right on Kensington Garden/Hyde Park.  Went for runs & walks through the park with all the flowers in bloom.  Across the street is a Starbucks & Whole Foods (with dining area) - great for quick meals and snacks.  Easy access to the underground/metro.  Overall, great stay & would be happy to stay there again.",4,2011,06,13
133,Great hotel for business or a couple,"I stayed three nights for a conference that also took place at the Royal Garden, and my overall impression was of a neat and tidy gem. The location is great, tucked into a corner beside Kensington Gardens and convenient to buses, the subway, attractions, and major shopping areas. Since this is a city center hotel, both the rooms and public spaces are tiny (especially by North American standards), but very usable and of an extremely high standard.

The design, furnishings and amenities were all five-star and very comfortable, while the service was crisp but efficient. I loved the half dozen complimentary truffles that were waiting in the room on arrival - a nice touch. I also had the pleasure of dining in both of the hotel restaurants, which were fantastic. As a bonus, although most of the room service items were expensive as expected, the basic in-room Express Breakfast was actually quite affordable and filling. 

On the downside, the internet access system was atrocious and terribly overpriced. Although it's still quite common in luxury properties, this practice is becoming more and more annoying as the years go by. Otherwise, this is a fabulous little gem of a hotel - highly recommended.",5,2011,06,13
133,Had a Wonderful Experience~,"On a recent trip to England, we decided to stay a couple of days in London. We chose the Royal Garden Hotel and we couldn't have been more pleased. We stayed in a Garden View room and is was wonderful! Great space, very clean, delightful views and amenities. Also, I loved the location of the Hotel. You felt like you had space to roam! Right next to the Royal Park and Kensington  Place. Also, Whole Foods is only a few blocks away..Big Bonus. LOVE IT! Staff was pleasant and helpful. We enjoyed the breakfast offered. I would recommend this hotel, highly. Thank you for a memorable stay.",5,2011,06,08
133,"Excellent staff, great room","Not cheap but worth it if looking for attentive service and luxury. My standard room was great with a deep bath, robes and a super size bed.
Staff amongst the best I have come across.",5,2011,06,08
133,5* hotel but no free wifi,"Beautiful big room with the necessary facilities and large bathroom (quite scarce in London).

Front desk and concierge were very friendly.

Realised that for a 5* hotel, there is not much security measures. Anyone can just walk in, enter the lift & punch in a number to go to desired hotel floor. It's quite appalling for a 5* (or even a 4* hotel).

Location was great and there was good shopping and supermarts between hotel and train station.",4,2011,06,03
133,lovely,"hotel situated in a very good position if you want to have run or jogging..
Kensington park and hide park is just down the hotel.
The only bad thing is that in the room i didin't found slipper....
the hotel was clean and confortable.
The breakfast is to expensive .
I THINK I A 5 STARS THE INTERNET CONNECTION SHOULD BE FREE",3,2011,06,02
133,Lovely hotel in the center of everything,"I stayed in the Royal Garden hotel for one night because of business. The hotel is placed in the heart of old town, right behind Hyde Park (next to the south entrance to Kensington Gardens). Tube station is only few yards away. The hotel has two posh restaurants, we had a dinner at Park Terrace Restaurant. Even is on the lobby (so you dont have a panoramatic view) you can eat next to the walls of Hyde Park. Food was just fabuluos. Min Jiang Restaurant on the top is known as hidden gem with high quality (and also more expensive) food. Breakfast was adequate but too expensive (not worth the price).
Hotel, even it looks bigger from outside, looks more like boutiqe hotel than cosmopolitan big brands like Hilton. Rooms are a bit tiny, but equipped well. In the bathroom is the popular The White Company cosmetics. Be honest, there arent enough towels, so I asked for additional.
During my stay there was something like reconstruction in the upper floor, so unpleasant suprise. Hope they did it well till now.
So finally i can recomend this hotel as a lovely place for everyone who needs a central location, great services, amazing food and good price too. Comparing to the other 5-star hotels, The Royal Garden has a big advantage in price. Just compare it with the other similar hotels in the old town!",4,2011,06,02
133,A Nice Hotel,"I have stayed at the Royal Garden several times over the last few years and have always found this hotel to be reliable, friendly and comfortable.
It is in a very nice neighborhood with terrific shops and restaurants.  
I am a runner and being next to Kensington Gardens and the Park is amazing.  There is nothing better than an early morning run in that park!!  The last time I stayed at the Royal Garden was during the week of the Royal Wedding.  Even though the hotel was quite busy, you would never have known.  The staff are professionals and handle volume well.  Unfortunaltely my new company's office is a bit further away, but I may still find it worthwhile to stay over at the Royal Garden from time to time.",5,2011,05,28
133,Good location for leisure travel.  Not so good for business in the City or West End,"We stayed here based on my manager's recommendation.  The rooms have been renovated which is a nice feature relative to some other hotels in London.  Well located next to Hyde Park, Kensington High Street (as well as the Tube station).  Did not eat at any of the restaurants but I have been told the Chinese restaurant is excellent.  

Rooms are small like most London hotels but the fact that it has been renovated makes it a good value.",4,2011,05,22
133,Super Posh - Location Location Location,"I have stayed at this hotel many times.  It has a great location, good shopping and food near by.  Its expensive though, and although the room service is prompt some items were excellent and yet others not up to par with what you would expect from a hotel in this snack bracket.  The rooms are wonderful, and comfortable. Modern with flat screen TV's, fantastic bathrooms, great soaps, first class towels, and nice finishes.  WiFi Internet to your room is extra and is costly (starbucks has internet across the street)",4,2011,05,20
133,excellent service and friendly staff,I have stayed several times and am very impressed with the service at the concierge desk and the management. We recently stayed and they were doing refurbishments on the floor above us and when we complained of the noise they moved us to a bigger room(we were 4) and charged us only our lower rate. Another time my son forgot some school work and they found it and faxed it on. They really make an effort. Only complaint is that internet is paying.,5,2011,05,19
133,"Excellant Location, Great Hotel","Had a break away with my husband as a treat.  Delighted to have booked into the hotel, it was a treat and something you don't get to do every day.  Arrived at hotel and was met by a male receptionist, very friendly and offered help with luggage which we declined.  Stayed on the 10th floor,  while the room had great views of Kensington Garden the room itself was smaller and not as modern as i thought and as the pictures on their website led you to believe.  Room had good facilities, tea/coffee etc which is always a bonus in hotels these days.  Shower was also great, great water temp as hot / cold as you would like.  Bedclothes / sheets very clean and lovely to sleep in but i unfortunetly cannot say the same fo rthe bed.  Instead of having a long sleep in I couldn't wait to get out of it.  My husband was wondering if the bed dipped in the middle but we checked and found it was 2 single beds sipped together.  Not exactly what i had expected.  We went to have a drink in Berties bar but found this a little disappointing also, on the first occasion we were the only ones there so after one drink headed to another bar close to the hotel.  Tried the bar on another night around 11pm and there was 4 people in it but no atmosphere.  The restaurant was fantastic and staff very attentive. Receptionist staff friendly and speedy without rushing you, conceirge very helpful and also used the business centre which was great.  We would definetly go back as the location is great, shops and restaurants / bars a very short walk.",4,2011,05,15
133,Love staying here,"I have stayed here twice for work - its a great hotel.  I love the rooms; they are spacious, modern and very clean.  The In Room Dining is excellent and I always look forward to it.  The bathrooms are extremely large and have plush linens and robes.  Alot of the rooms overlook the gardens of Kensington and its so nice.  My favorite part of this hotel is the Chinese restaurant on the top floor - the Peking Duck is the best I've every had as is the Szechuan Eggplant.  Can't wait to return :)",5,2011,05,09
133,Excellent Hotel,Perfect hotel in every respect. I would highly recommend.,5,2011,05,06
133,good location,good hotel in a great location next to kensington palace.Breakfasts were lovely with a fantastic selection of food which was very fresh.very close to the tube station and some good shops and restaurants nearby.,4,2011,05,03
133,PERFECT IN EVERY WAY,"My wife and I stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel in London for 4 nights in early April 2011.

Everything about the hotel was great...the room, the business centre, the continental breakfast in the hotel, etc...

The room was very clean and modern with plenty of space.  The bed was also very comfortable.

My wife enjoyed the fact that she could go run in the parc right next to the hotel (Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park) each morning.

Location was great as well for the Tube (High Street Kensington station) and for our visit to Stamford Bridge for a Chelsea English Premier League match.

We would definitely stay at this hotel again.

133,"Personal but not intrusive, sophisticated but not stuffy.","This hotel will always have one thing going for it - location. Over looking kensington palace gardens and hyde park, being in the centre of London yet being able to kick back and relax only a short walk away from the buzz of the city! I stay here seldomly but when I do I appreciate friendly faces and the personal service especially that of a manager who is truely interested in your experience and listens to you. The rooms are well appointed and clean the only thing that is lacking is an ajoining hotel spa. The hotel has a spa and gym underneath it but lacks one truely in the hotel that is a decent standard. Great staff who easy to deal with and tailor your stay!",4,2011,04,14
133,If you don't mind paying 20 pounds per day to have internet access,"Location is very convenient. Hotel is in the middle of renovation with construction currently going on 2 floor 7 days a week which can be noisy. The rooms facing High St Kensington are quite noisy from the street traffic. Hotel is clean, rooms and bathrooms are ok but definitely not 5 star. Internet is a joke: 20 pounds for every 24 hours per gadget and you need to log in via cable.",3,2011,03,26
133,Exceptional - quality and service,"Took my wife for her birthday to London - Every member of staff from the moment we arrived until we departed, made us most welcome and valued throughout our stay. Our bedroom was extremely comfortable with plenty of space - including the bathroom - which is rare in London. We had the most wonderful dinner experience in the Ming Jiang restaurant - on the top florr of the hotel - strongly recommend the duck carved at the table by the chef ! The view across the park and  London was amazing. Breakfast again was delicious with a great variety of fresh food, great coffee and even a chef to cook your eggs exactly as I ordered.",5,2011,03,20
133,Never been treated so badly at such a nice hotel.,"This hotel was in a great setting, close to High Street Kensington station and overlooking Kensington Gardens, adjacent to Hyde park. It was a typical dreary, rainy London day when we checked in. We had just been traveling for the past 7 hours when we finally got to the hotel and checked in. The receptionist ( Gosnia) greeted us nicely enough but didn't even notice we were soaked to the bone OR that it was even raining out. (We mentioned we were tired and miserable, but glad to be there) It was a few minute before 2pm ( our actual check in time) but she said to have a seat and she would let housecleaning know that we needed priority so we could check-in. 45 MINUTES WENT BY! I went to the desk to politely ask when our room would be ready. I thought they might have forgotten about us but seeing how we had  all of our bags with us in the lobby it was hard not to notice us! She checked again to see how long it would be but said housecleaning still did not clear a room for us. She offered my husband and I complimentary coffee which we accepted. 45 MINUTES LATER we still found ourselves sitting in the lobby! My husband (who has worked in the service industry for years) finally went to the desk to see what the issue was. The whole time we sat there we saw dozens of people checking in and being taken to their rooms. When he asked why we had to wait there a different receptionist ( Melissa)  explained that it was friday and that they were busy!!! (This hotel has 390 rooms!) She finally conceded to the fact that we would not wait any longer and tossed a room key to us. No baggage porter was offered and we were left alone to drag our bags up to the 9th floor by ourselves. When we walked in, the first thing we noticed was that the AC was kicked on full blast. (London that day was in the 20's F.) The view was spectacular & the room was gorgeous but seeing it was so cold we turned up the heat and left to eat/see some sights. When we arrived back at the hotel later that evening the stench that came through the door was like a smack in the face! We found that the drain in the shower was the culprit and housekeeping had blasted the AC to cover the rancid smell. After much debating between ourselves we decided to close the bathroom door and open the window. It was already late and we couldn't afford to stay up waiting another hour or so for them ""to open up a room""! (We had an early flight home the next day) Long story short, the room only got worse from there, the walls were paper thin and we heard quite a bit of commotion on all sides. In the morning the smell was so bad we decided to wake as early as possible to just get out!! Upon checking out we explained to Melissa and the other manager(?) that it was absolutely terrible. We then discovered that the room was directly below the chinese restaurant (which probably explained the smell) and right next to the laundry rooms (the noise). The manager just smiled and said ""you should have told us and we could have moved you"". Knowing that Melissa knew we had waited an hour and a half we explained that it wasn't an option to wait any longer for another room. We felt Melissa put us there in full knowledge of the terrible location and smell all because we had politely asked to not have to wait so long. With out so much as an offer to carry our bags out or offer a taxi to the airport they told us to come back and see them! I have never been so offended by a group of people in A SERVICE INDUSTRY! It was quite a pity b/c the hotel was beautiful and in a great location! I assumed we would get the 5 star treatment from a 5 star hotel but I was sorely disappointed. This was also our anniversary trip and If we hadn't prepaid for the room (months in advanced!) I would have happily gone to The Dorchester instead!!",2,2011,03,20
133,Awesome,I stayed in this hotel for a 3 nights for a business and leisure. I like it a lot. Next time will stay there again:)),5,2011,03,12
133,Really a 4.5 star hotel - but in a 5 star location,"I recently stayed at this hotel twice - in Dec/10 and Jan/11 for a total of five nights on business.  I didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel, but I can't really report that I find it to be a 5 star hotel -  4 or at best a 4.5 stars- but in a great location and can offer very good value for central London at below 200 pound prices.  

No issues with the front desk on check in or check out.  Concierage helped me out once looking for a specific store and eagerly drew directions on a map which after walking around in the rain for 20 min turned out to be wrong - but he tried.  A GPS enabled smartphone is the new concierage - except at data roaming prices not a cheap one.

I guess i was put in a Queen both times which i found very small and based on the website dimensions would be about 170 sq ft.  The upgraded King and Garden are more closer to 275 sq ft which would be a typical North American basic entry level room  Of course this is to be expected in Europe but don't be surprised if you choose the cheapest room looking for value in central London and then after walking in scratch your head wondering where you are going to put your large luggage (as I did).  I was told I was put in the recently refurbished rooms but I didn't find them that impressive for a new renovation - nice and modern but not luxurious that you would expect to live up to 5 star standards.  If this hotel was in a large American city it would be a 3.5 to 4 star as a Hyatt or Hilton.

Did not eat at the hotel.  Lots of restaurant options in the immediate vicinity.  I enjoyed walking over to Whole Foods which is 2 min away for a quick and inexpensive breakfast (well below 10 pounds).

Did not enjoy the large circular door at the front entrance which jammed frequently and is quite slow. 
Sauna/steamroom adequate but small and a little tired, and used a few times - but did not enjoy having to walk outside and in a separate building.

Beds/bedding no issues and slept well.  Both times faced the High Street but did not hear the traffic.  

Biggest beef was on the 2nd visit i was put in a room where immediately above it sounded they were jackhammering the floor presumably to redo the tile in the bathroom, which was aggressively loud in the afternoon after checkin.  After a day of travelling with flights and trains - believe me, you do not want to sit in your room to try and relax for a few minutes before an evening out, and have it felt like someone has a drill on your head.  The front desk promised it would be over shortly, and then it kept going - and then after some back and forth admitted it would be awhile.   So dont' tell me it will be over when you have no idea.   I can understand it's difficult to run a hotel when you are doing a major refurbishment, but it really is unacceptable to place someone in a room immediately adjacent to aggressively loud activity - block off zones around the construction when it's expected to be loud at that stage.  And fill in the front desk a litle more and encourage them not to give out information when they really have no clue.  

Overall I would return to this hotel based on the value it offers for the location and getting a rate in the 180-200 range - but it falls a little short on overall room furnishings styling and overall facility for a full 5 star.",4,2011,03,10
133,"Location, Location, Location!","This hotel was part of a Theatre break. We stayed for 2 nights.
Our room was ready at 11am when we arrived. It was surprisingly large and well appointed with a separate sitting area. Plenty of storage space, desk with internet, mini bar etc. Large bathroom with full bath as well as a shower.
The hotel is in the process of refurbishment and there was some noise from this during the day, but did not impinge on our stay.
Staff are extremely friendly and helpful, especially at breakfast. Nothing too much trouble. Actually the breakfast overlooking Hyde Park was really good and included in our price. Not sure we would have paid the daily cost of ¬£38 for 2 continentals though.
They actually still do an evening turndown service which was almost the same as the morning clean, nice touch.
The proximity to Kensington Palace, Hyde Park, and surrounded by lovely shops and restaurants make this an ideal base. If the price was right we would most certainly stay here again.",5,2011,03,05
133,Absolutely Fantastic. Couldn't compliment it enough,"I stayed here as part of my honeymoon and I honestly couldn't compliment the hotel enough.  We also stayed in other 4 & 5 star hotels during our honeymoon but this stood out as the best by far. The staff were always polite and very helpful and the rooms were extremely comfortable and very relaxing. From the moment you arrived at the hotel you felt like you were at a 5 star and that service continued for the whole stay.
The fire alarm went off one morning and thankfully it was a false alarm but the staff wasted no time in evacuating everyone and they even provided jackets for people incase you were cold outside. Your comfort was still what was most important to the hotel.
We ordered room service on one night and not only was it excellent value for money but it was delicious.  Again, 5 star for service. taste and value for money.
Will definately stay there again and would have no problems recommending it.",5,2011,03,04
133,Not a 5 star......,"I think once you actually stay in a five star then you know when your not in one! So as they claim to be a 5 star Ill rate them as one!

The first thing is dont pay ¬£300 quid a night here! Stay in a Premier Inn for a fraction of the price and have the extra ¬£200 in you pocket so at least you dont feel ripped off for what you are getting!

I got a rate here so I said Id give it a go but even at my 'rate' I wasnt impressed and would be inclined to give it to my regular hotel in the area as opposed to coming back here but Id never pay the prices they seem to regularly charge as it isnt worth it!

I had a room on a Saturday night onto the High Street and I could hear every druken loudmouth pass well into the wee hours as well as every cop car/ambulance the wissed passed at full siren - even with their famous glazed windows! The bed was 2 single matresses with a double sheet over them. There was a slope to the middle of the bed and frankly uncomfortable. The pillows were the worst rubbish Ive seen in a long time - they just turned to mush and offered no support. The sheet was also torn on the second night.

To use the telly you need to spend 2 weeks on the hotels course on using it! Pointless, whats wrong with on and off and if you want channel 3 then you press channel 3.....! ¬£23.50 for a Breakfast.........yes ¬£23.50! 

The other annoying thing is if your neighbours make any noise you tend to hear it, not good when your already having a rough time in your joined up bed and crappy pillows!

The wooden frames around the doors and the skirting boards in the halls are all chipped and worn, very shoddy! 

If this was advertised as a 4 star and value for money Id say book it! As a five star and these prices then go elsewhere!

This Hotel struggles to get the basics right a comfortable bed and a quiet nights sleep! If I paid ¬£300 for this I would have felt ripped off - if your looking for a 5 star experience then this isnt it!

Staff were generally friendly and the location is great in fairness.",2,2011,02,25
133,beautiful hotel with excellent service!,"We had booked this hotel with a package. Went to the hotel from Heathrow by tube with suitcases, which is only a good idea if they are half empty because you do have stairs at some stations! We went back by taxi, which was much better with a full suitcase of course. 
Checkin was quick but because it was Saturday night the hotel was very full and we only got one rather quiet but very nice and big room, overlooking a side street, on the 8th floor. The other room was on the small side and looked out onto Kensington High Street and was thus quite loud. We were told we could probably change rooms on Sunday, but my family decided to stay in the inital room anyway. 
Breakfast on Sunday was interesting: we were met at the entrance of the restaurant by a young lady who asked for our room numbers (!) and then led us to a table and she put menus by our side and  wished us a nice breakfast, but  without saying anything in addition. We then proceeded to help ourselves to the buffet and started eating. Then a waitress came and asked what kind of breakfast we were having because of payment and we answered that we think we are all having the same breakfast as it is included in our package. She checked and then sent over the head waitress and we were explained that only continental breakfast was included in our package and apparently we were not supposed to eat from the rest of the buffet (which is offered only on Sunday or the weekend, but not throughout the week!) for free...We explained that the lady at the entrance of the restaurant had not told us this! It is not such a big difference for the breakfast buffet (4.50 Pounds) but it was strange noone had bothered to tell us this! I am sure lots of people don't realize this and I believe people should be told upfront - why do they ask for the room number ? That was however the only small negative comment I have to make about our stay but  it was explained to us in the end and the head waitress let us know that she would not charge us the two extra breakfast cost, which I thought was highly professional! All in all, personnel at the hotel is very friendly and professional; we got top service! We had a few questions about sights/tube etc. and once we were even allowed to look something up real quick on the internet in the business center! 
If you can get a good rate for this hotel it is definetely worth it!",5,2011,02,15
133,An excellent Hotel with wonderful staff,"We spent the weekend here and had a wonderful time. The hotel is well kept, the service is excellent, the staff are attentive and the food excellent.

At ¬£225 per night, B & B, for two in a a large and well appointed room on the edge of Kensington Gardens this hotel is excellent value.",5,2011,02,13
133,Can't fault it,"Very comfortable, enjoyable stay. Good location in Kensington High St close to tube. Comfortable room and bed. Everything spotless. Fantastic breakfast and good courteous service. I pod dock in room was a good touch. One minor niggle was a limited choice of uk tv channels.",5,2011,02,06
133,"""Very friendly""","A great and friendly experience. The price was excellent for a 5 star hotel.Especially good for business travelers, but also for those that want to see the city because the proximity of the Underground Station, Bus Stops and the great information the staff provided at any time.And a 5 stars from me for the friendly Staff in the restaurants and bars, great staff and nothing too much for them",4,2011,02,05
133,Great Hotel - with a great location,"Although we only stayed a single night we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Royal Garden.  The bedroom was spacious and nicely decorated - especially if you like trendy tones of brown.  More importantly the bed was really comfortable and the bathroom scrupulously clean.

No complaints about the reception staff - who were all very helpful.  As was the concierge and all the restaurant staff.  We didn't take an evening meal - but the breakfast was excellent.

The other plus for the hotel is the fantastic location - right next to Kensington Gardens, with the shops of Kensington High Street literally on the doorstep.  Our room overlooked the avenue of Palace Gardens which was pretty good - but  the rooms across towards Hyde Park must have brilliant views.

Would definitely go back again.",5,2011,01,28
133,Great Hotel and Staff,"I stayed at the Kensington Royal Garden Hotel mid January 2011 with my partner and found the hotel be be great. Check in was fast and straight forward and the staff very friendly and approachable. The room was on the 7th Floor and was not overlooking the High Street which was great. The room was big and spacious for a London Hotel , big bed and the bathroom was also spacious with both seperate bath and shower. Having been to another 5 star london hotel recently this was far superior. yes it is a little on the pricey side but well worth it and would happily return again",5,2011,01,19
133,Don't expect a quiet night's sleep here.,"The management of this hotel looks after the big spenders but if you're just one couple, as my wife and I were on a stay last July, you're toast. We were woken at about 5 a.m. on our first night by loud music, talk and laughter from the room next door. Three calls to the front desk brought no visible action or audible change. No staff appeared. The noise continued. Later, when I complained in person, I was told that if we wanted a quieter room, we would have to repack and move, as the noise makers were part of a large party who had booked several rooms near ours. So the troublemakers, who apparently had been nightclubbing until the wee hours and decided to continue in the room next to ours, got to stay and we had to trouble to make the move. When I wrote to complain in detail on the guest survey card, I received not a peep of explanation nor word of apology.  Unless you're planning  to book a bunch of rooms and spend mega-bucks, don't expect to have your right to a quiet night's sleep upheld by the gutless, greedy management at this place.",2,2011,01,12
133,Excellent location /facilities - service oriented Staff - Comfortable rooms,"We had a most  enjoyable 6 night  stay at the Royal Garden Hotel

Location - excellent - easy access to London via bus or underground - both close by

Room - Our Deluxe Twin Room with Park Views was supurb - very comfortable - enchanting views of Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park - comfortable beds - enjoyed a relaxed night's sleep

Breakfast  - A great breakfast was served at the Park Terrace and provided an excellent start to the day

Lunch/Dinner - The Min Jiang was oustanding - beautiful views of the Park - excellent and friendly service and the Peking Duck was delicious - We lived in Hong Kong for 8 years and the Peking Duck exceeded any of our dining experiences in Hong Kong

Staff - From Reception to Bar Staff, Waiters, Housekeeping  and the Consierge Team- We found everyone to be very friendly and helpful in fulfilling our every request - Of particular note was the outstanding assistance we received from Luton Anderson and John White  - they went out of their way to help us with Theatre ansd Restaurant  Reservations plus gave excellent advice on what to See and Do in London and how best to accomplish this - This consierge team so ably lead by Robert Shorter certainly  made this a memorable stay for us

We enjoyed our stay so much that we are returning in 2011",5,2011,01,02

BUT
Unfriendly staff, and extremely noisy in rooms that look onto kensington high street.",3,2010,12,17
133,The most luxurious sleep & service in London,"Truly 5*.  This is one of the best hotels in London - a secret gem.  Nothing is too much trouble, from reception to room service all the staff give everything to make your stay a delight, Min Jiang dim sum is second to none and all in all a truly fantastic experience..................thank you",5,2010,11,19
133,"Spotless, well designed room with everything one needs  at a fair price .5 Star.","I have long wanted to try this hotel and finally remembered to give it a go. I'm glad Idid! Newly refurbished , perfectly appointed room , small but everything was in the right place.. Excellent bathroom, good lighing all thru . Pleasant dinning room with gorgeous view and most attentive yet unobtrusive service.. Where can you sit for an hour with the morning paper and have a thoughtful waiter refresh your coffepot without even asking.. ?!
I would thoroughly recommend this very smart well located hotel. If I was there for longer that a couple of days would try for a room with a bit more space...",5,2010,11,16
133,Fantastic staff,"This is a real five star hotel. The staff is fantastic and there is always someone at hand to help. Queen rooms are small, but as I understand only for single occupancy - but very well appointed with everything from bed linen to towels and bathrobes being of best quality. Only fault is the internet connection through the flat screen TV which was near impossible to use. Will definitely stay here again. At 145 pounds per night it was half the price one would expect.",5,2010,11,09
133,Love this hotel,My third visit to this wondeful hotel was in september. I vent with family to celebrate my 50th birthday and was sure of a very pleasant stay. I was very satisfied and will certainly be back - hopefully many many times.,4,2010,10,28
133,"Excellent hotel, well located","I found a great deal on this hotel for a weekend stopover while returning from business in Ireland.  The rooms are small but very space-efficient, the bathroom was immaculate and well-appointed, and if you are lucky enough to get a room facing the gardens (as I was), the view is spectacular - Kensington Palace set amidst the green velvet jewel box of Kensington Gardens.  I didn't eat in the hotel at all - I found it a little pricey for a leisure traveler whose expense account didn't cover the stopover.  However, there are fantastic places to eat right across the street and within a short walk.

This seems to be primarily a business-oriented hotel, so everything is extra - collect calls, internet access, etc. and I found the prices pretty steep.  But I got a great deal on the room as I've mentioned, so that wasn't a deal breaker for me.",5,2010,10,25
133,The best place in town,"The service offered throughout the hotel is fabulous.

I can not rate the hotel highly enough!

A special mention to Berties Bar and Min Jiang for making our wedding annivesary such a memorable one, Thank you!

133,Royal Garden Hotel is pure bliss,"I recently stayed here for the first time with my friend and we had an amazing stay. The staff were friendly and helpful and very attentive. I liked my stay here so much. I really couldn't fault the hotel facilities, location and we were given a recently refurbished room which has a lovely view of Kensington High Street. Will definitely stay here again. I've only stayed in two 5 Star hotels in London and of those 2 I prefer Royal Garden (the other hotel was the Savoy) pre-2010 reopening.",5,2010,10,20
133,One of the better hotels in London,"From the Door Man to the front desk  clerks and even greeted by  the Hotel Manager - Marilyn Watkinson...the service is top notch...stayed in one of the newly renovated room and it's very high tech, room 737.  Rain shower and a separate bath tub.  Towel warmer.  Fruit basket and bottle of water is replenished everyday....Full breakfast (at a minimal cost) and the best Chinese restaurant around London...Mian Jang...  Had a very nice view over looking Hyde Park...great jogging area and nice to walk around....Nice little shops and bars and coffee shops nearby.... No wonder Rihanna and other stars stay here....",5,2010,10,18
133,"Wonderful experience, would return in a heartbeat","On arriving at the hotel it was excellent service from the start, all the staff were exceptional and very pleasant. I booked a Superior twin room for myself and a friend as a birthday treat and was not disappointed. The room was large, airy, clean, well decorated and exceptionally quiet, and the beds were sooooo comfy. I can honestly say it was the best nights sleep I have had in any hotel I have ever stayed in. The breakfast was organised and had everything you could wish for and the concierge service was second to none. A truly wonderful hotel and I would highly recommend staying here. The only downside for us, was that we had to leave for home after just one nights stay.  We will be back !!!",5,2010,10,17
133,Top notch place at nice location,"Stayed there for 1 night for work (client booked us there). Great location next to Hyde Park. Breakfast was very good (though expensive, as almost always in hotels...). Wanted to try the gym but I was too early (jetlag) and it was still closed (e.g. no 24-h service) so I went for a jog in the park instead. I guess it's a good one as also used for non-guests.
Rooms were a bit small, but overall very good (quite, cosy and high quality).",4,2010,10,16
133,Better hotels available.,"I stayed in this hotel to attend an awards ceremony that was being held there.  I felt it pricey but worth the extra to be in the same hotel.

I made my booking for a queen room via a third party company and it was clearly listed as a double room for two people.  I was later advised by the hotel staff that this room was not deemed suitable for two people and they ‚Äòrecommended‚Äô I pay an additional ¬£30 to upgrade.  Which I did.

I must admit the room itself was very pleasant and spacious, but no matter how hard I looked I could not find any tea or coffee facilities.  I contacted reception but was told this facility was not available but I could order from room service if is wished.  Sorry but I am not paying over ¬£3 for a tea bag and hot water (I don‚Äôt take milk or sugar).  Luckily Starbucks was opposite so we paid a visit.  I was later told by other attendees at the awards that they had tea and coffee in their rooms.

I then followed the instructions provided to access the Wifi but couldn‚Äôt do it.  I phoned the number provided and was asked if I had purchased Wifi as it was at additional cost.  There was no mention of this on the instructions.  Again, no I am not incurring the excessive additional costs.

It was horrible to wake up in the morning with no facilities for a cup of tea so we planned to ship out pretty quickly, but despite being told checkout was at 12, there was a knock on the door and in walked the maid wanting to know what time we were leaving.

Considering this was a 5 star hotel I was extremely disappointed.  I stop in hotels regularly for work and this is the worst I have stayed in as far as experience goes.  I have stayed in 3 star hotels where the staff are friendly and bend over backwards to accommodate your needs.  I have stayed in hotels where tea and coffee is not provided in your room but is available complementary on request.

All this hotel wants to do is apply additional charges for things we are accustomed to being included.

It turned out that the prize I could have won at the award ceremony was a two-night stay in the same hotel.  I have never been so relieved not to win something!  Yes the bathrobe was nice, but I‚Äôd swap it for a cuppa any day.",2,2010,10,11
133,Best hotel service in UK,"Every member of staff we met this hotel went out of their way to deliver superb customer service. The last time we encountered service like this was in Singapore (never in a UK hotel of this size). We later discovered that this hotel is linked with the Goodwood Park in Singapore. All is explained! 
We had a garden view room one night and a contemporary room the other night, Both had very comfortable super king beds, a settee, fitted widescreen flat TV and full bathroom. 
The food in the Terrace restaurant and lounge is top notch and good value. You do not need to leave the hotel to enjoy a tremendous meal in sylish surroundings. In October there is a half price champagne offer- enjoy!
the Spa and Gym are a disappointment, not quite up to the standards of the rest of the hotel. The gym is equipment is quite new though.
Short walk from here to the Albert Hall, Kensington Gardens are next door.",5,2010,10,10
133,Disappointing,"Supposedly a luxurious Hotel it relies in its location to provide the wow factor.
If one is to spend that sort of money one would expect more than two tea bags, some real coffee bags, real milk; more than one towel, one cup and saucer and free wifi; in house movies and an air conditioning unit that is not so noisy that it keeps one awake at night.
Incoming guests at 1am should be encouraged not to shout and scream on the forecourt.  As initially suggested it is close to wonderful Hyde Park and despite the austere reception area the staff are less so and friendly.",3,2010,10,07
133,Great View and Location but eat elsewhere,"The location and views overlooking Kensington Palace Gardens is amazing. The rooms are large by London standards, and there is no traffic noise. 

Very convenient location for tube and bus stop.

Breakfast at ¬£21pp is a ripoff! Internet at ¬£20/day is too expensive.",4,2010,10,07
133,Lovely stay,"My first time staying in the Kensington area. We got off at the High Street Kensington tube station and walked about 5 minutes to the hotel. Great shops and eating places along the way. Check-in was seamless and within minutes was up in our Garden view room. The room was fresh, clean, and had a nice little sitting area at the window as the room had a nice view of Kensington gardens, was nice and quiet ( great to unwind in a city ). The room was nice and spacious and was nicely laid out. The beds were comfy, in the room, the room had plenty of lighting and a dimmer for adjusting. Nice toiletries from the White Company, a bath, rainwater shower and when we requested more toiletries ( never seems to be enough for two usually in hotels ), they sent some straight up no problems. All the staff were so welcoming and accommodating , the concierge looked after us well too. The only negative I can say would be that the food and drink in the hotel are crazy prices, the internet too. But, when in London, why sit in and eat when you can get out and explore? 

Overall, loved the hotel, got a great service and have no complaints.",5,2010,10,04
133,Great Place To Stay while in London,"The concierge staff of this hotel are phenomenal!!  We had an medical emergency during our very short stay here and they couldn't have been more helpful!  (Our 12 day trip to England, Wales and Scotland was cut to 36 hours in London!!  For all that, the Royal Garden helped us to have pleasant memories of that time)  

The room was clean and pleasant although the view out our window was disgusting.  We expected that as the price we paid for our nights there were below normal due to our booking at a discount site.  Luckily, we hadn't come to London to look out our hotel room, we came to see the city and the address of this hotel couldn't be better for that activity.  It's at the center of everything we needed.  Expensive but worth the effort if you want a classy place!!

We ate in the restaurant and unfortunately, were not impressed by it but you can't have everything!!  The class of the hotel made up for alot!!",4,2010,09,23
133,"Loved this hotel, great location & friendly staff!","I stayed in this hotel for 9 nights with my sister, on our first trip to London. We were thrilled with the location since it was easy access to the tube and many shops & restaurants. The hotel is extremely clean, well kept, and welcoming. All of the staff have smiles on their faces and are very eager to help. The concierge really took time to help us plan some of the more touristy things we wanted to do, as well as made great dinner recommendations for local places. 
Our room was upgraded since we arrived quite early in the morning (red-eye from D.C.), and we ended up having to wait several hours to get into our room. However, this is completely understandable since check-in is not until late afternoon anyway. The gentleman at the front desk did everything he could to expedite a quick turn around on our room, and ended up giving us a larger suite (complete with fresh flowers!) so that we would be able to rest comfortably. 
I did not eat in the restaurant there, but I did frequent the bar which was a very relaxing atmosphere and had a special on champagne :) 
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone-it offers great service and warm accommodations, and you really can't beat the location!",5,2010,09,19
133,An Awesome Hotel,"We stayed at the Royal Garden in September and were very happy with our stay. The rooms are spacious and the view of the park was great. We stayed in an unrenovated room which was really well maintained, the tv was small but the room was large and the bathroom was a good size. The staff were very helpful and polite.

The one draw back was the lack of English skills of the breakfast staff, but they had good attitude non the less. The fitness club was small but well maintained. I would recommend the Asian restaurant on the 10th floor was amazing and the wait staff very professional with a good wine list.

This hotel is great value relative to other hotels in it's class.",5,2010,09,16
133,Ok but not quite a 5-star service,"I stayed in one of the queen rooms. The room was bright and nice, although not very big.
I was surprised not to find a hair dryer and slippers in the room.
Also, on both mornings of my stay, it took about 15 minutes to get the toasted bread I had ordered for breakfast.
All in all, it is a very good accomodation but I've certainly seen better 5-stars hotels!",3,2010,09,07
133,A very stylish hotel without the 5 Star pompessness you sometimes get,"We stayed in this hotel for our anniversay and can highly recommend this hotel.  The hotel is outside of central london, but if your feeling active you can walk to centre and Harrods within 40 minutes.  The views from our Garden Room were spectacular across Kensington Gardens.  We also used the gym and it was pretty much empty both times.  The staff are friendly but not too in your face.  This hotel gives you 5 star luxury without the sometimes snobby element that you get in 5 star hotels.  Would definitely stay there again.  Eating out in Kensington there is ample choice and Chelsea also has numerous lovely restaurants just round the corner.",5,2010,09,02
133,Book with care!,"1.  When the reservation was made price agreed was ¬£158 + VAT at check-in they tried to charge 200+;
2.  The reservation had been made for two rooms overlooking the park at the rear ‚Äì one such room was provided 902 but my partner and I had 833 on the front;
3. On going to the room I went to use the toilet to be greeted by a stool floating in the pan ‚Äì great start;
4. On retiring it was not before 3 a.m. that we were able to get any sleep with the noise from a bar opposite ‚Äì in fact the noise level was so high we might just as well have moved our beds in to the street. 

Reception would make no compensation and now awaiting reply from General Manager - would NOT recommend this as a 5 Star hotel.  Also watch the Italian Restaurant in Kensington Court - rubbish.  I hope London does better for the Olympics otherwise there will be a lat of unhappy visitors.",2,2010,08,31
133,Very lovley and posh,"This hotel was an absolute joy to stay in. They gave us a complimentary upgrade as we were staying for our anniversary. The room was spotless, the decor classy, and the staff friendly. Sometimes 5 star staff can be a bit pretentious, but not here. The location is fab for shopping, hanging out at cute cafes and going out in the evening (try the Piano Bar nearby). The only minus points were the food at their restaurant. It was a bit bland for the price, but OK. Also, there is no free parking. I would definitely stay here for a special occassion again.",4,2010,08,17
133,"Perfect location, Lovely Hotel - Quirkey 5 star london hotel","I was booked in recently for a two week work trip (staying the Thursday/Friday, then back home for the weekend, returning the Monday/Tuesday).  The location of the hotel was fantastic!  not your usual business trips stuck in your bedroom.  I walked round Hyde Park, and explored the shops on Kensington high street. Found a fantastic place to eat called 'whole foods' if your budget doesn't quite stretch to the high prices in the Hotel.

The hotel is expensive, worth the cost to stay but I wouldn't pay to dine there - although the food I did have was incredibly good!!  Was a little disappointed not to receive a bottle of water in my room, but the rooms were lovely with fantastic bathrooms.  On the first stay I had a wonderful room overlooking the bustling Kensington high street with a wonderful little sofa area/bench seat in the window.  On the second stay I wasn't quite so impressed, my room was a little smaller and had a big corner unit TV with storage that reminded me of furniture resembling a static caravan! I was only there for 2 nights, so didn't need the storage and missed my window seat to watch London from as getting ready and working.

All in all had a wonderful stay and would love to return with my family.  well worth pushing the purse strings for the incredible quality, class, comfort, and location.",4,2010,08,13

At around 300 GBP per night it is a beautiful hotel, with great rooms, very nice restaurant and right next to Kensington Palace and Kensington Gardens. The Kensington High Street  Tube station is only a short walk away, and the Number 9 bus stops outside the hotel. Royal Albert Hall is only a 5 minute walk away. The bar is very nice and it is a very comfortable way to spend a few nights in London.",5,2010,08,12
133,IT MADE OUR ANNIVERSARY TRIP TO LONDON COMPLETE!,"myself and my husband won 2 nights stay on our local radio, and we were delighted with our prize! the staff and concierge were second to none. they made us feel welcomed right from the minute of arrival to the second we departed. we felt beause we had recieved our stay as a prize and was complimentary the staff would not treat us the same as a paying client... not true, they are the hub of the hotel and its success. we had only one day to take in london, so the concierge suggested we take the open top bus, what a fantastic way to see london! the area of kensington is amazing and so clean, the royal garden fits in completely!!
the only drawback i would have is the fact i rang to ask for an additional pillow and none was recieved, also i think the breakfast prices are way to expensive.
we are planning to stay at the royal garden before christmas with our daughter again and we are looking forward to it already... keep up the good work!!",5,2010,08,10
133,Top location,"The Royal Garden Hotel in London Kensington is a hotel which for London is a pleasent surprise. Rooms are very spacious. Staff very friendly and location being in Kensington is simply great. While being located very centrally its still very quite.

133,The perfect hotel for people who have never stayed at a perfect hotel,"Subject: Royal Garden Hotel

Location: London, England, United Kingdom, Europe

Title: The perfect hotel for people who have never stayed at a perfect hotel

A lot of the reviews for this hotel seem to be on the positive side. They gush about ""luxuries"" such as bathrobes, large windows and comfortable beds. Maybe I'm jaded but I expect a bit more from a hotel. For example,  I expect the hotel phone system to function. Call housekeeping and no one answers. Call the concierge and your call goes straight to the operator. Do you enjoy telephone calls to your room in the middle of the night and when you answer there is no one there? This happened three out of the four nights we stayed. Do you consider functioning electrical sockets a luxury?  At the Royal Garden they are. When two of the sockets failed to supply power the hotel reluctantly sent an ""engineer"" to fix them.  After examining both sockets for a good twenty minutes  he declared them broken.He promised to return to fix them the next day. He never returned and they were never fixed. Do you consider peace and quiet a luxury? I assume at night the halls will be quiet and that I will get a comfortable nights sleep.  This was by far the noisiest hotel I've ever stayed at. If you like large groups of rowdy footballers and tipsy busloads of tourists running in and out of their rooms at all hours and carelessly slamming their  room doors perhaps you will enjoy your stay more than we did. One afternoon my  wife and her sister booked a table at the fine Chinese restaurant, Ming Jahn one of the few positives about the hotel. But even though the food was excellent their meal was compromised by children running unsupervised throughout the dining room. When they told the manager he informed them that it was a tremendous problem but that the hotel insisted on allowing 
unsupervised children rather than turn away the business. Quite understandable in a family restaurant, but this is an upscale and costly place and indicative of the way the entire hotel is run in general. There is a sense that for the clientele being catered to, it's all good enough. If all of that sounds like the kind of hotel experience you're looking for, perhaps the Royal Garden is the perfect hotel for you.",1,2010,07,19
133,This recently refurbished hotel is a must!,"The Royal Garden Hotel, Kensington is conveniently situated next to [not surprizingly ... given it's name!] next to Kensington Gardens.  It is a relatively modern hotel, with an amazingly helpful staff.  Recent refurbishments to the ground floor restaurant and to Bertie's Bar have brightened up the hotel since I was last here 3 or is it 4 years ago.

For those that wanted to do the touist bit [and we did] one of the 'open top' tour buses stops opposite the hotel ... very convenient.  There are loads of restaurants, cafes and pubs near by ... and the tube station is just down the High street, and even taxis into the West End don't cost too much, given the distance.

We had a wonderful 3 nights ... and next time we are in London, will definitely stay there.",4,2010,07,09
133,"Great location, lovely hotel","On a reunion trip to London commemorating our summer working there many years ago, my friends and I stayed at the Royal Garden, which we picked for it's location.  Kensington is a charming area within walking distance of many beautiful and interesting neighborhoods.  When we expressed disappointment with the room we were originally assigned, we were given a lovely 4th floor room with a view of Kensington Palace.  The staff was always very helpful, especially after we were stranded by the volcano.  The Business Centre and concierge staff were helpful, and another less expensive room was located for us since our original room had a booking on it.  The hotel is expensive, but they worked with us to enable us to stay for four extra nights.  If you stay there please drink a ""Bertie's Special"" in Bertie's Bar for me!  I would definitely stay there again.",5,2010,07,08
133,A Right Royal Place To Stay,"We chose The Royal Garden Hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary and found we had made an excellent choice. We were shown to a beautiful modern room, complete with bathrobes, overlooking Hyde Park. The aircon was set at a sensible level but we could have adjusted it if needed. The tv was huge and the lounge area luxurious whilst the bed was massive and comfortable. Our guests joined us at Bertie's Bar for Champagne before adjourning to The Park Terrace Restaurant for a delicious meal. All the staff were extremely warm and friendly  and couldn't have done more.  This is not a cheap place but we felt it still represented excellent value for money. Go on - spoil yourselves!",5,2010,06,10
133,Not the greatest hotel,"The Royal Garden Hotel is the Disney Vacation Club hotel in London.  The hotel might be a decent choice for a hotel if you are familiar with London, don't mind rude staff, are used to limited central air and heat and are comfortable dealing with an odd plumbing configuration (you need to run the water in the sink to mitigate the temperature of the water in the shower--I am serious about this! ).  This was my first trip to London and I was so very disappointed in the hotel.  Disney Vacation Club affiliate hotels are usually nice, so I was unprepared for the extremely poor level of service from the staff and the plumbing/central cooling-heat issues.  In addition, when we checked out there were additional charges to our room for a meal or 2, movies (the in-room movie service was not working the whole week we were at the hotel) etc.  

On the positive side though, the hotel room was very clean and it was nice to be able to reserve a car to and from the airport through the hotel.

However, overall I could never recommend this hotel.",2,2010,06,08
133,Excellent Service,"Excellent hotel in most ways.Genuine and polite doormen.Receptionists who seem genuinely pleased to see you and not just a 'have a nice day' mantra.Even the maids said goodbye and wished us well!Obviously happy staff - well done to the management to.Room was larger than average for London and had a small seating area next to a very large double window that allowed you to watch the world go by below.Despite being next to a busy road the room was very quiet.Bed was big and confortable with nice pillows.Bathroom solid with big towells,robes and nice toiletries.
Didn't eat here as too much choice elsewhere.
A little more expensive than we'd usually choose but probably worth it",5,2010,06,07
133,Fantastic!!,"Truly fabulous. I cannot think of a single thing wrong with this hotel. The room (10th floor) was faultless, the restaurant, out of this world and the service, possibly the best I have ever recieved! Thankyou for a really special stay!",5,2010,05,31
133,"Excellent location, wonderful service",Following advice from another reviewer I booked through moneysupermarket.com and received a significant discount on the room rate.  This hotel is expensive as you would expect in Kensington but the service is excellent.  We accidently arrived for breakfast just as service was finishing but were still treated wonderfully.  The continental breakfast was amazing.  We could have upgraded to full english but didn't feel it necessary with all the goodies on offer.  I would definitely stay again if I felt like treating myself.  Note: this hotel is within the congestion zone and parking for 24hrs was around ¬£30 when we stayed.,5,2010,05,30
133,One of the best hotels in the world,"Having stayed at this hotel on several occasions, I can honestly say it is one of the best hotels in  the world.   The service is outstanding and any request was quickly met.    The rooms are stunning with views over Kensington Gardens.     Great for either business or pleasure.",5,2010,05,27
133,"Excellent, High Quality Hotel!","Recently stayed in the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington and enjoyed a excellent stay in the hotel. The entrance and lobby is very impressive and check in was completed in a matter of moments! We booked a superior room which was large in size, good size bathroom and spotlessly clean throughout. All staff from check in to check out were extremely helpful and courteous. The hotel is ideally located in Kensington for exploring London either by foot or by public transport with the tube only a five minute walk. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone!!",5,2010,05,19
133,"Great for business, not so fun for honeymooners","We stayed here for one night between Southampton and Heathrow.  The hotel was modern and clean and nice but geared towards the business traveler, not really towards sightseers and honeymooners like us.  The Kensington-High area is near Hyde Parka and apparently considered a very posh area. The staff was awesome, excellent service from room service, housekeeping, concierge, bell hops, front desk, all of them.  The concierege gave us excellent advice as to what to do in the city, where to pick up the T, what pubs to check out, etc. If we hadn't asked him for adivce we wouldn't have known about the Thames River path. It was a great way to enjoy the city.  Concierge rocked!",4,2010,05,07
133,good stay but check reservation,"we booked hotel thro 1800 hotels, as a birthday surprise,requesting twin room on 5th or near floor, we got double room on 3rd floor, porter informed reception we were then shown twin on 4th floor, it was dingy,tired looking and very basic and hardly any view, certainly not 5* so we returned to double room, this was spaciuos with seating area, and fruit and complimentary bottle of water,and great view along Kensington high steet .Breakfast was slow, waiting 15mins for cooked  food , although it was very good, Staff very pleasant and helpfull ,.We have stayed here twice before, and it is being refurbished, but we felt it had lost a lot of the finer touches, so was slightly dissapointed.Won,t stay again.",4,2010,05,02
133,"Great location - Service, however, is an unmitigated disaster","Couldn't ask for a better location with a view of the park - that is excellent
Rooms are tired
However, please only stay here if:
- you never require service
- you dont mind being ignored
- you think that nightly turndown service is an option, and certainly not yours!
- you think that raising an issue, does not require a resolution
- you think that if they assure you they will help out, you don't actually expect them to do so

seriously, i have stayed in many decent hotels and have never seen anything like this.",2,2010,05,01
133,What a wonderful hotel!,"The Royal Garden was a lovely hotel in a perfect location!  The staff was exceptional.  The concierges were helpful and really went out of their way to assist us in any manner.  The staff, in general, were polite and lovely to deal with.

The room, unfortunately was rather small.  We had 2 twin beds and a roll out for our 17 yr. old daughter.  It wasn't ideal and a bit cramped, but we could manage.  The TV was modern, the lighting was fine.  We were told the room had just been remodeled.  The bathroom was a nice size, but the lighting could have been better...Our view was nothing to speak of (we had the rooftops, not Kensington Gardens).  We were exhausted every night, so the conditions weren't noticed as much...

Because one of the restaurants was still being remodeled, we had breakfast every day in Min Jiang on the 10th floor overlooking the Gardens.  The continental fare (it was included) was excellent. There were eggs (scrambled - not the best), meats, fruit and lots of pastries.  We were looking forward to having a Champagne Tea, but because the other restaurant wasn't open, we had to go to The Orangery (which was very pleasant).

There was a spa -- which we didn't use and actually, we didn't even go to Bertie's Bar.  The lobby is beautiful with fresh flowers and free newspapers.

We opted to have a hotel chauffeur pick and drop us off at the airport.  That was actually way more convenient and economical than the other options from Heathrow.  (We saw some poor people dragging their luggage in the crowded Tube.  Not a pleasant time for them!)

Prior to our trip, I emailed the staff about a lot of issues.  They were very attentive to answering me and securing whatever we needed.

Our only complaints were that the laundry services were VERY expensive, as was the Internet.  (We ended up taking out laptop to the local Starbucks!)

All-in-all, though, I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely come back if I could!",5,2010,04,27
133,The BEST Hotel,"This hotel was amazing.  I was stranded for over a week in London due to the Iceland Volcano.  The people couldn't have been nicer and more helpful.  Thanks to Anne-Cecile,
Matthew, Daniel, John for all your kindness and helpfulness.  I will always stay at this hotel when in London.  My room was lovely looking out on Kensington Gardens.  It became my home away from home.",5,2010,04,27
133,Fantastic hotel - highly recommended,Stayed here for one night while going to see Paolo Nutini at the Royal Albert Hall.  From check-in to check-out the staff and service we received was first class.   We got an excellent deal of ¬£143.00 online which was a bargain for a hotel of such high standard.  The staff could not do enough for us and were all cheerful and very welcoming.  The hotel is a short 10 minute walk from the Albert Hall and all the sights and sounds of London are within easy tube travel to.  Will definately return on our next trip to London.,5,2010,04,12
133,"On the whole, a lovely hotel, although they need to work on their housekeeping service and concierge staff.","My husband stays here often for business, however, this is the first time I've accompanied him. We were upgraded to a suite which has it's own separate section on the 10th (top) floor. 
The doorman was great, and attended to us/our luggage immediately. The reception staff was friendly and efficient. Although the lobby was simple, reflecting that it was more likely a business hotel, its atmosphere was not cold. Their restaurant on the ground floor was undergoing renovations. 
Our room was however, very spacious, and well-appointed and we were generously supplied with chocolates, fruit, and bottled water. We had a view of Kensington High St. through a stretch of windows, and there was lots of natural light. It was furnished in simple luxury, clean lines, understated but everything was of good quality and built to last. The bed was very comfortable but my husband found it too soft.
The bathroom was tiled in a sand colour, simple, almost utilitarian, but spacious and again, well-appointed. There was a bathtub, which was also where you showered.
As we arrived from Heathrow after a 13 hour flight, we had an early night after dining nearby down one of those charming lanes Kensington is known for.
Amazingly, at 9ish pm (I checked this after), when we were fast asleep, our room door opened and an Asian-looking woman (in my haziness, I thought she was in a black maid's outfit!) came in through to our sleeping area and she looked as shocked as I was when I sat up to see who had barged in! She left the room in a hurry. We made sure we double locked and secured our room door every night since!
Later on during my stay, I noted that none of the chambermaids were dressed in black!! Isn't that incredible?
Apart from that, everything was lovely. Breakfast (normally at the restaurant on the grd floor) was in the beautiful and well-known Cantonese restaurant near our bedroom, which had an amazing view of Kensington gardens, manned by well-trained waiting staff.
On our 2nd day, we had left the room in the late morning only to find on our return that it had not been made up. It was past 3pm. The chambermaid rang soon after to clean, and had to do so while I was in the room. A senior member of housekeeping apologised and he explained also, that she was a trainee.
A week later, we stayed at another hotel in Mayfair which was about GBP 100 more expensive per night (see my other review!) and I would come back to the Royal Garden in a heartbeat. It's located around 2 minutes from the High St Ken underground station, close to Albert Hall, lovely shops and great restaurants. It has a nice, welcoming feel to it as there's a nice mix of professionals and residents in the area.  
Unfortunately, as we checked out, there was a huge conference starting that day and the lobby was a total mess with masses of people milling around. The staff were clearly flustered and were definitely colder on check-out than on check-in. Our friends who came to fetch us tried to enquire about our whereabouts and were met with unfriendly and impatient faces, and a brusque dismissal. They had stowed our baggage(left for 30 mins) accessible by a side-entrance further from the hotel entrance, and it was a great hassle to get our vehicle loaded. Our friend had to drive round twice as he was being bothered by impatient cabs and cars behind us. This was the only other thing that marred an otherwise very pleasant stay.",4,2010,04,10
133,"Great view, great staff, nice place.","A friend and I spent just one night here when we met up to celebrate her birthday. We had a good deal from Travelsupermarket. We asked for a non-smoking room on booking and were given a (twin) room on the 10th floor with an amazing view across Kensington Palace and its gardens towards North London. Breakfast was served in the hotel's Chinese restaurant (due to renovations being underway in the normal restaurant) and the view from there was also amazing, looking East over Hyde Park.

The hotel lobby, corridors and the room are all quite business-hotel-like but all appeared quite new. Apart from the view, I wouldn't say the room we had was spectacular but it was nice, not too frilly, had a two-seater sofa and an armchair, video-on-demand, two Internet connections and a lobby area (so that you didn't walk straight into the room from the corridor and so that you didn't walk into the bathroom straight from the room).

I was pleased to find that every single member of staff we met was extremely polite and friendly. Breakfast was perfect (our deal only included continental breakfast so we paid a ¬£3.50 upgrade charge each for cooked breakfast).

Buses leave from outside the hotel to get closer into the West End and Kensington High Street tube station is nearby. Kensington High Street has good amenities, cafes, restaurants, etc. and Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park are on the doorstep.

I would stay here again if I could get a similar deal.",5,2010,04,01
133,The only hotel we ever want to stay in when visiting London!,"We have stayed in this hotel 5 times now over the last 4 years, and we love it. The rooms are well apportioned and clean, and extra touches like volume control in the bathroom so that you can play music from the TV while having a shower, are excellent. The garden rooms have a wonderful view over Hyde Park, and on our last visit we stayed on the top floor overlooking Kensington High Street. Again a fantastic view, but my preference would be a garden room. The hotel is a short walk from the underground, and the surrounding shops are very hard for me to resist (as I have always visited with my partner, I am banned from dragging him around the shops, luckily we both enjoy a walk around Hyde Park!). The breakfast is top quality with loads of choice, and all very well cooked. I can't wait to go back and see the refurbished lobby and enjoy a drink at Berties Bar! Although the hotel is at the top end of our budget, we are happy to pay it, knowing that we are going to get a lovely hotel room, and help from courteous and friendly staff. We are so confident over the quality of this hotel that we recently recommended it to a friend (something I would usually be too nervous to do about any other hotel) who has now stayed there and thoroughly enjoyed it too.",5,2010,03,09
133,Top quality hotel,"This is an excellent hotel.  Stayed over the weekend and enjoyed every minute. Staff are very helpful and attentive but not intrusively so. Our room was a deluxe which had fine view over Hyde Park. The location is slightly out of centre of London for tourism but this is no real problem: bus stops right outside, tube not far and taxi ride about ten pounds to
centre. There are many fine restaurants nearby also, we had great French food at Brasserie right across street. Rennovations ongoing but did not disturb, this remains a top quality destination.",5,2010,03,01
133,love this hotel,"Very relaxed  atmosphere and excellent staff always very friendly and efficient, i have stayed here 3 times now and love it every time.
Full breakfast was wonderful and very fresh with about 8 different juices to try.
The only downside was that our bathroom was very small but the room itself was wonderful twin beds so comfortable didnt want to get up, we also had a sofa ,chair and table, the mini bar was amazing but expensive, 
very convenient for Harrods, royal albert hall, kensington gardens and its orangery for afternoon tea, all the shops of high st kensington.and oxford st etc not that far away, get an oyster card for travel
The royal garden also has leisure facilities  and a casino so make sure you take photo id.
It is having refurbishments done at the moment so felt a little closed in at breakfast which was on the lower ground floor and no windows, this was because the upstairs 10th floor restaurant was full.Room service was included ,and the robe was lovely and soft.",5,2010,02,18
133,Excellent,An excellent hotel in a good location.The rooms were spotless and well appointed with great views.Staff couldn't have been more attentive.The hotel is in the middle of a refurbishment but it did not cause us any inconvenience at all.We thoroughy enjoyed our stay.,5,2010,01,29
133,Brilliant London Hotel,"I have stayed in this hotel on numerous occasions, mainly on business but the location is just brilliant and the staff and service are faultless.  The views from the bedrooms are great and I love the newly refurbished rooms and can't wait to see the new lobby!",5,2010,01,13
133,Great room and friendly service with a smile,"We stayed during the hotel refurbishment, it was a shame about this because they have a beutiful lobby and bar downstairs and of course this was unavailable.

The room was outstanding, the bed was very soft and one fell into an easy and restfull sleep, we did not eat but had pre dinner drinks upstairs on the 10th floor resteraunt, the cockktail barman was a delight as where all the staff and made us feel very welcome.
Breakfast in the morning was also served upstairs due to the refurbishment but this was a plus as the veiw was to die for.
Breakfast was served with panash by a very freindly waiter, but I feel the price is very steep if you do not have it included in your tarif, It was a buffet and was well laid out and offered a good selection.
If I had to be honest and sum up our stay I would wait till march for the refurbishment to be finished, The hotel is a real delight but when fully operational it will be outstanding, we own a small hotel ourselves and know what hard work it is to attain the standards offered so full marks to all concerned and a  final note the room was spacious and spotless our thanks go also to the house keeping team.",4,2009,12,18
133,Wonderful,"I stayed with a friend to celebrate our 40th Birthdays, we mentioned this when booking.  The receptionist (sorry didn't note name but she was very helpful and accommodating) called over the duty manager who congratulated us on our Birthdays.  We were told we were in a newly refurbished room.  The room was lovely, bathroom looked like it had never been used, the room was available well before the usual check in time.  When we returned in the evening we had received the turn down service but also they left us some chocolates which was a lovely touch.  It's a shame the main reception wasn't available with the lovely Christmas tree I had seen in photos.  I felt like we were entering the hotel through the staff door but this couldn't be helped.  Overall it was fab, great staff, great service, superb bed and pillows, great location and breakfast was good too.",5,2009,12,15
133,We would love to come back,"We stayed two nights in this hotel Saturday and Sunday and enjoyed every minute of it. The staff were incredibly helpful and the food was just great. The location cannot be beaten, close to the the tube and buses, within walking distance of the Royal Albert Hall and the museums and right next to Hyde Park. 

The hotel is undergoing extensive refurbishment at the moment and the reception arrangements are a little confusing but once we found it everrything went well from there. The room had plenty of space with a comfortable sitting area and an exellent view across the park. No tea making facilties in the room but a call to house keeping produced a tray within minutes  with everything we needed at no extra cost.  

Food was exellent with some good lunch and dinner packages, but if you have not got breakfast in with the room rate the cost is more than I would pay no matter how good it is. Breakfast is also very busy particularly on the Sunday morning but even at full capacity the service was first class. Drinks as always in top hotels are expensive but they come with first class service and more nuts and olives than you can eat.

Although there are major refubishmenst going and some temporary arrangements in place we were not inconvenience by the work at all and if you are looking for good value I am sure there will be some good packages available in the coming months. I would have no hesitation in going back to this hotel.",5,2009,12,07
133,"Great Location,Outstanding Staff","We spent 1 night at this hotel.The Staff could not have been more friendler..everyone of them said Hello and the Concerige was really helpful.There are some renovations taking place but it didnt disturb us,the room was a little dated but comfortable.It did lack a tea/coffee maker but this was the only negative.
we really loved the location and would definetly stay there again",4,2009,11,30
133,Karno's breakfast,"Yes this hotel is well located,the rooms are well furnished and a good size and the service often willing, but a property of this quality should not allow the breakfast service to degenerate into the circus that I experianced on a Saturday morning.
Firstly inadequate capacity.A 25 minute wait.We were directed to an ajoining lounge for coffee.No seats so stand and wait.No coffee cups so no coffee.Use the toilet?I wont go into the condition of that!
On eventually being seated the buffet was on a small table and difficult to access without dropping my meuseli down a fellow guests neck.A long wait for eggs and omelette as the hard pressed single chef struggled to cope with the demand.
All this for well over ¬£20.
On day 2 of our stay we actually got up early to try and avoid the circus.Just what you need on a leisure weekend.Better but fundamental problems remained.
The hotel is about to embark on a refurbishement.I would suggest that before they spend a penny on the fabric they sought out the logistics and capacity of their breakfast operation.Donating space to banquetting or a signature restaurant is fine but Royal Garden dont neglect the basics!",4,2009,11,23
133,Couldn't have asked for more,"Had a great 2 night break in London.  Arrived well before check in time, which wasn't a problem, left our luggage & walked around the park & they called us when room was ready. Easy access to tube network from hotel & helpful concierge ensured that no lines were closed towards our destination. Had room service & food was delivered in good time & was good.",5,2009,11,11
133,Very good all-round hotel in a great location,"This hotel has been our regular base for business trips over the last 25 years and more recently for private week-end breaks in London. The many visits have always been enjoyable and the recent upgrades are certainly worthy of comment.  
Our latest visit was 22 October for three nights in a refurbished ""Garden Room"" on the 9th floor. To get the best views here always ask for a high floor. We always book a Park View room,  the vista over Hyde Park and to the City are simply amazing. We found the new class of room on floors 7,8,9 were worth the extra cost. These rooms are in a more modern style and have excellent facilities. The revamped bathroom now has a separate large walk in shower but this has cut down on the original wardrobe space (no problem for short stays). The new wall panelling, wood, fabric and mirror walls provide a welcome improvement in sound insulation, this was not very good in the original rooms. Large comfortable beds and a comfortable seating area are standard as is the in-room safe. Mini Bars are well stocked and there is now in-room tea / coffee making facilities. Breakfast in the Park Terrace is excellent, a la carte service is Monday to Friday and buffet at the weekend, it does get very busy around 9 am at the weekend. The top (tenth) floor Chinese restaurant is worth a visit, food is very good if a little expensive and strangely there is no attempt to keep food warm on the table. Berties Bar and Park Terrace are both comfortable retreats with excellent service. The staff throughout the hotel are generally very polite, friendly and efficient and some have been there for many years, a good sign hopefully of a good employer!
Outside the hotel, beautiful Hyde Park offers excellent walks, Oxford street or Harrods are both about 25-30 mins brisk walk so a realistic and enjoyable alternative to the tube or taxi on a nice day. There are good restaurants along Kensington High Street, again easily within walking distance. The tube station is 5 mins.
If driving, car parking under the hotel is via a rather tight spiral ramp and costs ¬£30 per day, the annoying new ""Pay and Display"" system means you have to return to the park and pay again after 2 days (on the dot!), we tried to prepay our third day 2 hours early  and the machine wanted to charge ¬£56 instead of ¬£30.  This is not the Hotel's fault  the parking is a separate company but this new system is a bit of a put-off for guests who use it.
Final tip, check your bill carefully for Mini Lounge items and late charges, we have frequently found these to be wrong.
Overall this is a very good all round hotel in a great location. We will certainly keep using Royal Garden for our London visits.",5,2009,10,27
133,Wonderful time - thanks so much,"A small group of girlfriends had managed to leave small children behind and get some precious time out.  All of us were arriving at different times and staying different lengths of time and Felicity on reception could not have been more accomodating of our various requirements.  A huge thanks to concierge Mansoor for finding us the best places to go - he really was spot on re price, atmosphere and location.  A great stay - we'll be back!!!!",5,2009,10,27
133,"Excellent rooms, service and location","We stayed in a Garden Room on the ninth floor for seven nights. The room overlooked Kensington Gardens and had views towards the London Eye and the Gherkin.

The Room was of a very high standard including a very comfortable King sized bed, large TV screen, tea/coffee making facilities, mini-bar and all the essential electronic gadgetry.

The en-suite was roomy and had quality toiletries and lovely large fluffy bath towels. The heated towel rack was a bonus.

We appreciated the fruit platter and welcoming note that we received from the Guest Relations Manager at the start of our stay.

We had dinner once in the Min Jiang Restaurant (as a special treat) on the tenth floor and enjoyed both the meal and the spectacular night view. We ventured into Bertie‚Äôs Bar on a couple of occasions after a night out and were treated to a large selection of nibbles with our drinks.

There was a large selection of good quality food for breakfast in the Park Terrace Restaurant. Even got to see some of the Aussie cricketers who were staying at the Hotel for the One Day matches.

I made two separate bookings for the seven nights in order to take advantage of the cheaper weekend rate, which had the B&B option. Check-in presented no problem as the bookings had been combined and we had the same room for the entire period.

We have now stayed four times at this Hotel and find its location beneficial. There is a bus stop right outside the Hotel and the Underground Station 100 metres away. Pubs, shops and a supermarket are conveniently located and Portobello Road is within easy walking distance.

This stay we noticed that the Hotel is now offering reasonably priced lunch and dinner options. Although we didn‚Äôt try any out, they did look attractive. 

Special mention for the concierge who helped us out on a couple of occasions.",5,2009,10,14
133,Lovely long weekend at the Royal Garden,"Just back from a 3 night stay at the Royal Garden, our 3rd time at this hotel and the most enjoyable.
The hotel enjoys a perfect location at the south west corner of Kensington Gardens, with many of its rooms offering lovely views of the gardens and Kensington Palace.
We upgraded to the newly renovated garden rooms which guaranteed the views mentioned. Our room (939) was modern and light with an elevated seating area beside the almost full length windows. It had a king size bed, large flat screen TV, while the bathroom had bath and a separate shower.
The hotel offers several packages and our choice was 3 nights for the price of 2 including full breakfast, which made this a really good offer. 
Breakfast in the Park Terrace can be very busy at the weekend and my advice is go early (before 9am), or you may have to be patient and queue for 5 to 10 minutes. I would also be wary of some of the tables in the busy passage ways, as there can be a lot of people movement back and forward to the various buffets, which some may find distracting. 
Lastly a mention to all the hotel staff. I cannot every recall staying at a hotel in London where all the staff encountered were so outwardly warm and friendly.",5,2009,09,22
133,Great Hotel and Great Staff,We just were at this hotel for a week and the dining and concierge staff were both very friendly and attentive.The location is great being right on the High Street with lots of local restaurants and shopping. 5 minute walk to the Tube.,5,2009,09,21
133,Very nice,"Very nice hotel, good location.. but seems like different type of rooms, I got a good one. Strange to meet bodygards each time I got to my floor, butt guess it was someone important there..",5,2009,09,18
133,Wonderful hotel next to Kensington Gardens in Hyde Park,"We booked a junior suite and had a wonderful room with a pull out sofa bed for our child, and a nice view of High Street Kensington through the large windows by the workstation.  

The bathroom was huge.  The hotel room looks recently refurnished so everything in great shape.  

Hotel is a few minutes walk from the metro station, bus stop in front of hotel, covered car park under hotel, and Hyde park is right next door.

Definitely the best hotel I have stayed in London at this price.",5,2009,08,31
133,Superb,"From the moment I checked in to my departure, it was an excellent visit.  the new rooms on the 8th floor are absolutely superb, well appointed with the guest in mind at all times.  Breakfast was excellent service and buffet.",5,2009,07,31
133,The best of the best.,"We stayed in this hotel for two nights while on a concert/shopping trip and, in my opinion, it really is one of the best hotels in London. Nothing is too much effort for the staff and the rooms are large and comfortable with all the amenities you'd expect from a hotel of this standard. That coupled with the excellent location make it well worth spending the few extra pounds on the booking. We'll definitely be back again soon.",5,2009,07,06
133,"Nice location, reasonable hotel, room basic 3-4 star.","My friend and I stayed here for our birthdays and we booked the Spa Escape.  The hotel is in a nice location situated right on Kensington Gardens. Our room was very disappointing.  We had paid for an upgrade which was inlcuded a garden view and a sofa.  Unfortunately we were on 1st Floor so couldn't see much.  The room was clean, but very dated and looked nothing like the rooms on the website.  The hotel is clean, but I note from the website that it was refurbished in 1996 which is what it looks like, not too old but I would say it could do with some updating.  The staff were friendly and helpful.   Our luggage went missing for 3 hours, although they did make up for it with a free bottle of wine! The Spa is lovely and the treatments were bliss!   It's easy walking distance from the tube station and there are a selection of high street shops on the doorstep ranging from Karen Millen to Top Shop. There's also an average variety of restaurants and pubs.   The park - Kensington Gardens is a superb park, really lovely with so much to offer everyone of all ages. It's a constant hive of activity and I would thoroughly recommend a walk through it, but allow at least half a day.  All in all the hotel was average.  Nothing to complain about, but wouldn't go back.",3,2009,06,29
133,Excellent value,"In April 2009 we enjoyed a very pleasant one night stay at the Royal Garden Hotel as we were going to a concert at the Royal Albert Hall.  As it turned out, this hotel couldn't be better placed as it is only a 5 minute walk down Kensington High Street to the Albert Hall.  Located right next to Kensington Gardens and the Palace and a 2 minute walk from Kensington High Street tube station it is a fabulous area to explore London from.  

We only booked a few days before and managed to get a standard room with breakfast included with Superbreak for well under ¬£200, which compared very favourably with other hotels in the area.  Our second floor room overlooked Kensington High Street, but we were not troubled by noise from the street below.  The room itself was very spacious with a huge comfortable bed and the room itself and the bathroom were beautifully clean.

The breakfast was superb - buffet style but with huge choices of hot food, cereals, fruit and continental breakfast items.  Would well recommend getting a bed and breakfast deal as breakfast is ¬£20 pp per day if you pay separately!

All in all, a really excellent stay and we would certainly look to stay again next time we visit London.",4,2009,05,18
133,"Friendly & professional service, but poor sound insulation in bedrooms","This hotel is excellent in most respects - and the friendly efficient  service deserves particular mention - but it is let down by the poor sound insulation in the bedrooms. If you happen to have neighbours who like to have the sound up on the TV and radio - as we did on our last visit - your peace and quiet will be disturbed. In fact, when the occupant of the adjoining room sneezed during the night it sounded as if he/she was in our room. 
It is also worth noting that rooms at the front of the hotel are affected by traffic and street noise.",3,2009,05,04
133,"Great location, great service","We stayed in the Royal Garden hotel for long weekend break in London and left very pleased with our experience.

We had a superior deluxe room which meant we had a fantastic lounge area that overlooked Kensington Palace Gardens - a very relaxing view where we spent a good few hours reading and chilling out. I would best describe the room as 'old fashioned comfort' which will not appeal to everybody. It was very clean and comfortable, but perhaps not up to the 5 star chic appeal of many of the London hotels that many visiors will expect.

We ate in both of the hotel restaurants and received fantastic service and food in both - we would definately recommend them to anyone visiting the hotel. All requests we had were met with a friendly 'pleased to help' attitude from every staff member we encountered, which made the stay effortless.

Luckily, because we booked last minute we managed to pick up a fairly good deal on the room rate, whereas if we had paid full price I would consider it to be quite steep for the room quality/size/amenities.

Overall a very enjoyable stay, made by the excellent food and staff service.",5,2009,03,20
133,"Great Hotel in great location, second visit looking forward to our next visit.","This hotel is in a perfect location situated on Kensington High Street.  Our delux room was spacious and overlooked Kensington Palace/Gardens. Our friends had a standard room which was just as spacious but with a view of the high street.  Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. It has the best of both world with the tube, restaurants and bars within minutes walk and also Hyde Park and Kesington Gardens also within a few minutes walk.  The champaigne in Bertie's Bar was good and reasonably priced. The first time we stayed the breakfast was waiter service which gave the hotel the edge on other hotels but the second time we stayed it appears to have changed to buffet style but the food was still great.  The only improvement I would make would be  have tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms, then  I would have been completely happy.",5,2009,03,09
133,Great Location and Service but not really a five star property,We Stayed in Royal Gardens Hotel during my husbands business trip. Our son of three came along too. The location is excellent as you are right next to the park and there are many resturants on the street across from the hotel. The service was excellent and professional. We recieved a special rate as we stayed over the weekend. Unfortunately they put us in a room on the 1st floor looking to the hotel machinery so we could not open the cutrains and look out to the park although when we veiwed the rooms before we booked we were shown a lovely room looking at the gardens ( this was our decision to stay there). The bathroom was well sized for London but the rain shower did not work only the standard one. The bed was comfortable but we found a strange stain on the sheets that had not come out during washing (not acceptable for a 5 star establishment). The decor is comfortable but is in need of some refurbishment. Room Service was excellent and the breakfast served in our room was perfect. One the whole we enjoyed our stay but some aspects of the hotel are not in the 5 star range. But the service definately is.,3,2009,03,01
133,Lovely hotel in great location - close to tube & shops,"We stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel for 2 nights whilst visting London for some Christmas shopping and stayed in a delux room on the 7th floor which overlooked the High Street.
The hotel is right on Kensington High Street close to the tube station, so it was really easy to find. Check in was smooth and our room was large and very clean. The bathroom was spotless and the bed was super super comfy!
We didn't use any of the facilities at the hotel as we were out and about all day but the concierge did look after our cases and shopping bags after we had checked out as we were not leaving until the evening!
This hotel was lovely, very impressive looking and in a great location, we had a very enjoyable stay!",5,2008,12,28
133,Not my kind of Five Star,"First of all the front of house staff at this hotel are really friendly and efficient, housekeeping leaves something to be desired. We always have a weekend in London at this time of year as it coincides with my little girl's birthday.  I booked an executive family room for the four of us, told the hotel it was my daughter's birthday they did not acknowledge this in any way. 
The room itself  (515) was very nice and a really good size for London but the bathroom............was small, to say the least, and a real 1980's throwback. I could'nt believe it when I saw the brown pipe type hairdryer on the wall! As other reviewers have mentioned, the towels and bathrobes are really poor quality and quite old. Turndown service was literally just that, they turned the cover down, they did'nt tidy the bathroom or our dirty glasses away. The breakfast buffet was very good but on Sunday morning we had to stand in the bar area for over 20 mins to wait for a table with what seemed like the rest of the residents of the hotel. We had a lovely weekend but this hotel compared to it's competitors if definitely not the 5 star experience my family and I enjoy. Good location for Kensington and what great views over kensington Palace.",2,2008,12,01
133,Attractive London Hotel with awesome views!,"We recently enjoyed a two night stay via redemption of our Disney VC points. DVC has recently paired down the offerings of properties to redeem in London, but the Royal Garden is still  a viable option.

Upon arrival, a pleasant and cheery desk clerk offered us a room upgrade availble early (10:00 am). She personally walked us to room #837, a recently refurbished room overlooking the park. After taking in the stuning panorama; Kensington Palace, London Eye, Royal Albert Hall, our clerk remained to answer any questions, ensure the bellman brought our bags up, and ensured the room was to our satisfaction. 

As a recently refurbished room, expect granite in the bathrooms, separate shower and spa tub, towel heater, and TV speakers. TV's have been upgraded to 37"" flatscreens, and the rooms now have outlets for all regions plus the internet jack.

The only meals we partook in the hotel was breakfast; on Sundays expect a hot buffet with mostly British breakfast items and a custom egg bar. Buffet area was kept tidy and staff were keen to ensure all was well. 

PROS: Great location on Kensington High Street within walking distance to the Palace, shopping, Royal Albert Hall, tube stop and dining. Public areas kept immaculate, and staff was polite and professional. Newly remodeled rooms are decorated to a high standard without being fussy.

CONS: Few if any. We managed to hear conversation and TV noise from an adjacent room, but little else.

SUMMARY: Appropriate hotel for those wanting more from their London hotel experience. While not in the same league as The Covent Garden Hotel or The Draycott, it does manage to stay in the same league as most higher end  chain properties",5,2008,11,03
133,"Nice Hotel and location, but extortion for the extras.","We stayed here for a three night break recently, some of the reviews here made it look like a nice place. This hotel is in an excellent location situated next to Hyde Park and Kensington High Street, but the hotel is not as much ""contemporary"" as it is down right 70's.

On the positives, the location is excellent:- situated on Kensington High Street and minutes from the Underground station of the same name makes it close to the city without being in the city. Plenty of great shopping and restaurants nearby, as well as Hyde Park and Holland Park (a real hidden gem with its Kyoto Japanese Garden), and Notting Hill's Portobello Market about 20 minutes walk away.

The hotel itself is nice, although their decorator should be shot... among other things, the restaurant itself is a miss-mash of designs that don't seem to work too well, including two huge (and awful) Grecian statues in the style of Atlas holding up the ceiling... I have no idea what the designer was going for here. The room we had on the 10th floor was spacious and very clean, and allowed for some excellent views. The staff are friendly and pleasant, and the room was well equipped and well maintained.

Okay, on the down side, as far as I can tell, this hotel's goal is simply here to extort money from you. Internet access in the room is ¬£20 (approx ‚Ç¨26) a day! How a hotel can justify that kind of cost is beyond me, thankfully there was a MacDonald's down the road with free WiFi. The mini-bar prices were also ridiculously overpriced.

Breakfast, which was a nice but very average affair, was also grossly over priced at ¬£20 per person, and the service was appalling:- first day we received toast 20 minutes before the actual breakfast arrived, and the second day it was the other way around... everything we ordered just seemed to come out to the table in random order and most of the time  we were waiting on something (although on the weekend they ran a buffet instead of an ordering system, which made the experience marginally better). 

But the real highlight was begin overcharged on check out, three times the actual cost was charged to my credit card. No explanation and no apology was given, and I'm still trying to sort this out with the management. 

While I enjoyed my stay here, I doubt I would stay here again. The location was the biggest attraction and advantage with this stay. As others have said here, this hotel does not justify its 5 star rating. To expect low priced, or even free, internet access is not unreasonable in a 5 star hotel, and the over charging of my credit card left a bitter taste in my mouth.

But if you do happen to stay in this hotel, or in Kensington, we found a really nice Japanese restaurant nearby, Feng Sushi, which we found to be very reasonably priced compared to other local restaurants and the service was superb.",2,2008,11,03
133,advertised as a 5* but more like a 3*,"I selected the standard room and was expecting a small room with 5* amenities. The room was small and the bathroom even smaller! The room was very outdated; the in room phone must have been a 1960's version. There was no message light and no dial/key pad. Very antiquated. The charge for wi-fi is exorbitant; 20pounds a day!!!! No other options available. The phones did not have dialup or cat 5 capabilities. The bedspread was dated and was an old fashioned quilted gold . There is an exposed old blanket, no triple sheeting as would be expected in a hotel billing itself as 5*. . The TV was an 11"" outdated portable style, it was color; surprise surprise. But it was positioned in a place very difficult to watch from the bed. The service was pleasant but the breakfast service in the restaurant  was unorganized and very understaffed. It took 30 minutes to get a toasted muffin because the kitchen forget to prepare the order.
Overall it was an okay experience for the price. Had it been presented as a 3*  hotel then it would have been a decent experience. The food in the bar was very mediocre. The staff was pleasant and helpful when asked for assistance.",2,2008,10,12
133,home away from home!,"been there more than 4 times
amazing location, classy rooms, great restaurants, feels like home everytime
extremely friendly staff and plenty of things to do nearby,
CAN'T WAIT TO GO THERE AGAIN!",5,2008,10,03
133,Not exactly contemporary or 5 star,"I had the opportunity to stay at the Royal Garden courtesy of a prize package my friend had won. On approach it looks like most major hotel chains and the lobby is impressive. The doormen, check-in desk and concierge were all incredibly friendly and smiley. Our room was a twin overlooking Kensington Gardens. I really don't class this hotel as ""contemporary"". The decor, the finishing touches and technology are all very dated. The bathroom was fairly small and needed a good steam clean. Beware the bath plug - my friend nearly lost half her toenail! The beds were squishy and comfortable but I loathe extra tight bedsheets and old fashioned blankets - feels like a straightjacket. The TV was archaic and there was no kettle/tea making facilities which really should be standard. Why would anyone pay ¬£3.50 for a cup of tea? (Starbucks across the road will suffice!). My friend was also woken up a few times in the night by a banging noise. I heard it around 7.30am.   We also discovered the ¬£300 room rate did not include breakfast. If I had booked and paid for this room I would have been disappointed. This 5 Star does not mean luxury - there are no special touches in the room but its a well located hotel for various attractions and pretty good shopping.  I also wish hotels would stop using photos of their most glamourous rooms on their websites, when most of us stay in the standard rooms - its no wonder we get fed up whe we arrive to see our very different looking room!",3,2008,09,15
133,Great Service,"We booked this hotel through Disney Vacation points and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. We spent a portion of our England trip with relative in Hunstanton, Norfolk along the coast and we drove a rental into Central London with the much appreciated Sat/Nav system. I don't think we would have been able to transverse the complicated and harrowing London traffic without it. 
From the moment we arrive to the time we left everyone was wonderful. Starting at the front drive with a wonderful doorman who took care of contacting the rental company repeatedly to pick up our vehicle. To the gracious front desk staff who were nice enough to change our rooms from 2 twins to a double due to my husbands mistake during booking. 
We were very please with the recommendations and assistance from the conserge staff who were extremely helpful with the allocation of a wheelchair for our stay so that my Mom-in-law was able to see the sights with us and thier dining suggestions were wonderful. 
We had English Breakfast included with our reservations which was delish with a buffet and choice of entrees and service was impecable. Thank goodness it was included considering it was 20 pounds per person. 
Rooms were very nice. Our double had a good sized bathroom, very well appointed and we also had a sitting area which was nice, overlooking Kensington Street. There was a stong odor of smoke in the room, but since we really only were there to sleep it did really bother us. The twin room my in-laws had was very spacious and on the 10th floor had a great view of the tops of london's buildings. It reminded me of Peter Pan's flight. :-)
We had a wonderful time and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good landing place in this great city. We will definately have to go back as we only had two full days in the city and that is just not enought time to really enjoy everything this city has to offer.",5,2008,08,07
133,Mixed,"If you want the best of this 5* (but definitely more like 4*) hotel, then you really have to get an expensive room with a great view over the park.  And you don't have to like squidgy little bathrooms with tiny baths and no heated towel rail and old seventies-type brown hairdryers -- even in that expensive room.

And when will the owners of expensive hotels realise that we don't want to wait for room service for a cuppa? We really do need and expect a kettle and the rest.

Sometimes I have had large rooms or even been upgraded to suites overlooking the Palace and Round Pond, but this time I had a little room that seemed to be over the kitchen roof, as there was an unending noise like an air vent going on all night.  That reminds me that other reviewers have mentioned the heating/aircon system that obviously has a mind of its own.

We ate at the new Chinese on the top floor.  I didn't see that the food was better than in the general run of Soho restaurants, but then I'm just after good nosh, not a load of fussing about.

Breakfast is always super, with everything you could want, and I always find it very very relaxed in the sunny dining room, but again I felt that the staff were fussing, as if they were overworking to improve their service profile.

I actually like the Royal Garden very much: for its nice lobby, its good lifts and the general feeling of being in a large, secure and anonymous hotel.  I will always go back, but I don't expect anything like the Four Seasons kind of standard.",3,2008,07,24
133,a wonderful stay,"We stayed for one night at the Royal Garden Hotel as we were going to the Royal Albert Hall, which was five minutes walk up the road. The staff couldn't have been friendlier. Check in was quick and efficient and we were taken to our Junior Suite by the receptionist. We had a nice room with a separate seating area. There was a side view towards Kensington Gardens. The bathroom was a decent size with White Company toiletries. We had a Champagne Afternoon Tea which consisted of a glass of champagne, strawberries as well as the usual sandwiches, cakes and scones. There were also several different teas on the menu. As it was also my husband's birthday this  was a very good experience. The bed was very comfortable and the next morning we had a good breakfast, including fresh fruits, pastries, cereal and a cooked breakfast. Check out was equally efficient. A wonderful stay for the two of us.",5,2008,06,22
133,Royal Garden - Great Every Time,"This was the second time I stayed with the Royal Garden and I only have positive things to say.  The staff is unbelieveably helpful and polite.  Patrick at reception was especially helpful and kind in giving us pointers where to go for a good night out. Staff really went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. Rooms were spacious, which is rare for such a centrally located hotel and everything was very clean as well. Breakfast was included with our rate and brought to our room every morning. It was very fresh and carefully prepared. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone, as the hotel is centrally located and in a generally safe area of the city. We could see Kensington Palace and Gardens from our room. Starbucks is across the street and Topshop a few steps away! What more could you ask for! Be sure to inquire if Patrick or Jesus are working the desk, they will make the difference!",5,2008,05,21
133,Not a 5*. Very Shabby,"My boyfriend recently took me here for my birthday and we were both very disappointed. 
We had booked a junior suit. It was small and dated. We had been told we had a garden view room but were given the wrong key. On speaking to the desk we were told that we could not move as our original room had been given to someone else. 
The room whilst an ok size was very dated. There was no DVD or CD player, the sound from the TV in the bathroom was broken and so always on, the toilet roll holder was broken and the windows were so bad we were both kept up half the night with the traffic. There was also banging from work going on in the hotel next to our room for much of the afternoon. 
If you do decide to stay here, insure you get a garden room or you will get no sleep, the rooms are not soundproofed for a main road. 
We had breakfast in our room and whilst there was plenty of food the hot meal looked as though it had sat on the side for an hour. 
All in all this not a 5 star hotel. We recently stayed at the Landmark which in comparison make this look like a hostel. 
For the price you will find a better hotel",1,2008,04,24
133,Great hotel in Kensington,"We recently returned from a trip to London and we stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel.  It was lovely and we received terrific service.  The staff were very courteous, kind and helpful at all times--the concierge and the bellmen particularly.   We used the Business Center to email home and it had several computers and printers for our use.  The continental breakfast is wonderful, and the English breakfast (included with our room) offered everything you could possibly think of for breakfast.  The location of the hotel is great and within easy walking distance to the Kensington High Street tube stop.  Also the #9 bus to Trafalgar Square stops right in front of the hotel.  We did not try the hotel restaurant for dinner (expensive!) but did have a drink at the bar which was wonderful (free snacks included--olives, nuts, etc.) There are several good restaurants nearby--we ate more than once at Strada (Italian restaurant across the street) and at the Whole Foods food court (it has a seafood bar, a sushi bar, a tapas bar, etc.).  There is great shopping nearby as well--Urban Outfitters, Marks and Spencer, Clarks Shoes, an electronics store, etc.  Our room was not what I would consider ""plush""--however it was very nice, spacious and the bathroom was fully equipped.  Something we wish we had known beforehand was that the hotel offers a European cell phone rental service for a nominal fee (we had rented ours in advance).  While the Royal Garden is pricey, it is an extremely nice hotel and I would visit again.  It offered a restful and comfortable retreat after a long day of sightseeing.  Also, when considering cost, don't forget that London is one of the most expensive cities in the world--you should be ready to pay more for food and other necessities than you would in most other cities.",5,2008,03,26
133,Excellent place in Kensington,"I am writing this review shortly after checking out of the Royal Garden Hotel. Stayed for two nights. When I arrived, the check-in staff were extremely helpful and courteous. I did not have to wait in a queue. They immediately opened a spot previously closed at the counter to check me in. The room was very spacious, comfortable and clean with the ususal amenities. Unfortunately, the window faced the street rather than the park but despite that there was little street noise (even though I was just on the 2nd floor). The bar in the lobby looked nice though I did not have a chance to try it (it was a bit sparse in terms of patrons which was a bit off putting). At check out, again the staff were courteous, professional and lightningly quick at the same time.

Overall, it was a very comfortable stay (though a bit expensive) but I would happily stay again.",5,2008,03,01
133,Stylish and friendly,"I have stayed here several times over the last few years and have never had a bad experience yet- something that cannot be said of many hotels these days.

My last visit was for my mums birthday and they arranged flowers for the room which were gorgeous.  Unfortunately the room was not the one I thought Id booked (no view to speak of and no separate seating area) and was less than the 5* standard typified by the Deluxe Rooms Id stayed in before. When I contacted reception to ask if we could move, I have to say the hotel came up trumps.  Without any problem they changed us to a deluxe room with a lovely view at no extra charge.

The breakfast buffet is delicious and plentiful. Room service is reasonable for the standard of the hotel and promptly delivered. The staff throughtout the hotel give 5* service with a smile - can be a rarity in London I have found over the years.

The hotel is only a 10 minute walk from the tube and ideally placed for exploring the sights.  I would certainly reccommend it  anyone looking for a more upmarket base for a short break.",5,2008,02,28
133,I will never forget our night here.. Amazing,"We stayed at the Royal Garden hotel for one night. It was a surprise from my boyfriend for valentines day, and it was amazing, really made me feel like a princess.

Our room was great, with a massive bed, and the most wonderful view of the Royal Park and Kensington Palace. The bathroom was a good size, with toweling robes, which were so soft.

We were given Champagne and strawberries in our room, which was just perfect, the champagne was the best I have ever tasted.

We ate at the hotel restaurant, and the food was amazing. I loved the  Foie Gras was the most amazing food I have ever tasted. The wine was fantastic and the service was outstanding.

The location of the hotel was excellent, the park is beautiful especially on a sunny day like we had.

This was the most amazing romantic evening ever‚Ä¶ I will never forget it‚Ä¶..",5,2008,02,21
133,Staff are what makes it,"I stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel just over a year ago, My room was pretty shabby but the staff were amazing, The Concierge department were faultless, they helped me book me theatre tickets and made me dinner reservations, Tiernan & Stuart in particular were great.

The location of the hotel is ideal for shopping, not too close to the West End but close enough, my room overlooked Kensington Gardens and was a treat.

My advice is stay at the Royal Garden, you can get some cheap rates but it is not a 5* in terms of decor but in terms of service it is a 6*!!!",5,2008,01,17
133,Great location has stood the test of time.,"We have stayed in this hotel a few times over many years and it really never fails to impress. Great location, excellent concierge, spacious rooms and a fab mini-bar. (sounds mad but they stock mens black socks, the extra pair of stockings and jellly babies - what else could you need?)  Check out the juice bar Crush just across the road for a morning smoothie.

The Churchill Arms is a short walk away, great if your are looking for a real traditional London pub (and possibly a few ""famous"" faces), why not follow up with a Lebanse meal @ Maroush - don't miss the Chicken Taouk! With a nightcap in the hotel bar you will not be disappointed.",4,2008,01,07
133,Really lovely,"My husband and I stayed her for one night in a room that overlooked Kensington Gardens. Fantastic views, very nice hotel and room service.
Great locacation for the Royal Albert Hall too. Would definately recommend.",5,2007,11,26
133,Loved the Royal Garden Hotel,"Was pleasantly surprised with the Royal Garden Hotel, after reading some of the reviews.  We just got back from a Celebrity transatlantic cruise and booked a 2 nite pre-cruise thru Celebrity, couldn't have been better.  We found the hotel to be spotless!  Beautiful lobby! Great view of Kensington Park from our room which was very comfortable and clean.  The buffet breakfast was great, had a nice selection of fruit, cereals, danish, croissants, and more. You can walk thru the Park to Diana's Palace and there is a lovely coffee shop next to the palace called the Orangy, very elegant.  Across from the hotel is the ""BiG Bus"" ho/ho bus, very convenient, great tour.  Also across from the hotel is a great Italian restaurant called ""La Strada"", food was excellent and not too pricey!  Cost us 40 GBP for the both of us for 2 great dinners, appetizers and wine! I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2007,09,28
133,wouldnt give it 5 stars...,"here it is listed as 4 stars. some websites show it at 5. excellent location. clean room. spacious enough for two adults. two twin beds were adequate, thought the pillows were pathetic but i suppose everyone has their preference... room was clean. nice view over kensington gardens. plenty of places to shop and eat on the high street. concierge/help was accommodating, never quite going the extra mile... no major problems just several small irritations. the tv was a nuisance to get working, a problem more suitable for a motel 6... also, i asked the concierge to order tickets for buckingham palace and he did, but he ordered the wrong ones... we were able to do what we had planned out an extra 3 pounds when all was said and done. wouldn't necessarily recommend the hotel, or stay there myself as a top choice. but overall a decent stay. not luxury, but better than your average hotel.
",4,2007,09,16
133,you get what you pay for...5*,"the royal garden is situated on kensington high street, a bustling shopping area, with plenty of places to have a coffee etc..it backs onto hyde park, so ask for a room which overlooks one of the largest patches of grass in london!

as i say, you get what you pay for...a good standard of room, ours was only average in size, but well appointed and clean. good standard of bathroom with shower over bath.

eating in the hotel is expensive, english breakfast is about ¬£18, it was nice, but i think it's the most i've ever paid for bacon, sausage and egg!

the hotel whilst unquestionably being furnished to a high standard, gave me the impression of being characterless. perhaps that's how the management want it to be, clinical.

overall, enjoyed our stay, don't know if i would return, too many other hotels in london to try...
",4,2007,08,24
133,Not a five start hotel but OK,"It is an average hotel that felt like a 3 or 4 star hotel, I could not see why it had 5 stars. 
That said the hotel rooms were fine (had a standard room), a standard hotel room similar to something you would find in a holiday inn, nothing special. Although  I had the smallest bathroom I have ever seen
",3,2007,07,15
133,Put a damper on our weekend in London,"We were looking forward to our long weekend in London to see where Princess Diana lived on the 10th anniversary of her death.  Looking through several hotel websites we came across this hotel that was near Kensington Palace.  We arrived in London early in the morning (6am) and spent the day exploring the sights.  When we turned up at the hotel around 4pm they insisted that they did not have a reservation for us. After a long discussion with the front desk manager who insisted that they did not have a reservation for us, my wife finally found a print out of the reservation in her purse.  The front desk manager then indicated that he had found our reservation but our room was not ready and asked us to wait 15min.  After sitting in the lobby for almost 2 hours, our room was finally ready.  Remember this is after flying 10 hours from the US, and spending the day walking around London.  Looking forward to resting in our room by Kensington Palace, we were disappointed by the damp smell in the room.  The small television was at the side of the bed and difficult to watch from the bed.  The bathroom was dirty with well worn towels.  And worst of all the staff did not even apologize for the horrible rooms or having us wait for so long.  The hotel stay left us bitter at the hotel and the overall london experience.
",1,2007,07,14
133,Great for Family Stay,"This isn't a hotel that particularly caters to families, but it worked out wonderfully for us.  We spent 5 nights over two trips in a Junior Suite.  It was hugely roomy and comfortable.  Room service was quick and accomodated our little boy very helpfully.

The beauty of the place is that it is right next door to Kensington Gardens, so we could be out and feed the ducks or play in the Diana playground quickly and easily.  The hotel has many buses that stop right in front and is a short walk from the tube.  (We had rooms both in the front and the back and didn't find the traffic side particuly noisy, but you might want to request the back.)

Whole Foods has opened its first store about a block away, so we got bagels in the morning there.  Wagamama's is next door and very kid friendly.  There is a Boots Pharmacy for emergencies (and apple slices and carrots).  A Marks and Spencer is also good for sandiches and the like.  Plus you have all the high street shops.

I lived in London for 6 years and always laughed at this hotel -- it is a big grey box with a pretty tacky lobby.  And here I am, happily staying there and recommending it.  Times change!
",5,2007,07,02
133,A nice stay but definitely not 5 star,"Stayed for two nights as we were going to the Albert Hall.  This hotel is ideally located for the Albert Hall being 10 minutes walk away.  It is ideally located for Kensington Gardens and Kensington High Street.

The room on the 9th floor was spacious and clean with a large and very comfortable bed.  The TV was a bit on the small size as a lot of quality hotels have larger flat panel units these days. No tea or coffee in the room but this can be supplied if you ask.

Breakfast was very good with good selelction of hot and cold dishes and the service was good.

Overall the hotel is in need of a bit of an up-grade and up-date to get it to 5 Star level as it is looking a bit tired; the location is good though.
",4,2007,06,19
133,Very nice stay,"We had a very nice 3-nights-stay at the Royal Garden Hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpfull and our room (5th floor, street-view) very spacious and very clean. Although Kensington High Street is very busy, we didn't hear any traffic-noise except the police or ambulance sirens from time to time.
There is no tea-making facility in the room, but you can ask for a tea-tray at the consierge-desk and we were brought one immediately. 

The hotel is officially rated 5-star, but surely can't be compared with some other 5-star luxury-hotels. But it was more than worth the money we paid for and we will surely stay there again on our next trip to London.
",4,2007,05,29
133,Great value,"Four of us booked  the Spa Indulgence Package.  We arrived at the hotel at approx 11.00 and were pleasantly surprised to be allocated rooms at this time.  Don't be mislead by the title ""Superior Room"" the decor of the rooms werebasic ,but the rooms did include all the facilities you would expect..  (Tea making facilities and newspapers are both available FOC if you request them) 
The customer care in the spa was excellent as were  the staff we spoke to throughout the hotel.  Breakfast was first class with a buffet catering for every dietary requirement possible.  We would definitely stay again.
",4,2007,05,15
133,fake 5 star hotel,"When we arrived at 1100, the hotel gave us an early check-in and we were very impressed with the service. But when we got into the room, my god, it was tiny. I booked for a single room, and after fitting in a single bed, wodedrobe, a desk, chair and a single seated sofa, there was no space left in the room! Because the room was so small, the TV was placed on the SIDE of the bed (not at the end). And normal stuff like kettle, tea, coffee, toothbrush and toothpaste could only be supplied if you ask. Since there was only a single bed (my mistake that i should have booked a double), we asked if the hotel could give us an extra bed or change to a double room, expecting to accept any extra charge. The reply i got was

1) cant give you extra bed (or more duvets or pillows) because it is a single room
2) hotel is full tonight therefore we cannot exchange the room for you

The attitude of the person i spoke to was bad and he did not offer me any other help (like suggesting I could go to another hotel )apart from repeating the room was for single person and it was not meant to have more than one person inside. This is just not the the type of service i would expect from a 5 star hotel.

Lastly, the bar in the hotel was noisy, i could only hear people talking and I could hardly hear the music. Again, i did not expect this from a 5 star hotel, i would have thought it would be more classy.

133,Perfectly fine place to stay,"Modern, upscale, business/tourist hotel. Don't expect to face Kensington Gardens, rather the basic rooms all face High St. Kensington, a busy thoroughfare but not particularly noisy. The location is a bit off the beaten path, but easy to get to via tube station down the block. Lots of good local restaurants in Kensington,
just prepare your wallet. Otherwise, would definitely stay there again.

133,Pleasant family break,"I booked a Suite for 3 nights in Feb for myself, husband and 2 kids (3 & 6yrs) for 230/night.  Room was decorated to a high standard and exactly as depicted on the hotel website.  Sofa bed was a single so they wheeled in another bed for the 2nd child at my request.  Concierge was very helpful at reccomending evening dining options outside the hotel as dining in-house was a bit too formal for our kids in this predominantly business traveller hotel. Great location near High St. Kensington Tube and less than 10 pounds Taxi ride from Paddington for easy transfer to Heathrow express. Overall very enjoyable.
",4,2007,03,01
133,"Poor service, staff and managment display poor attittude","I have stayed here for the equivalent of 5/6 months in total over the past 10 years (my former company uses the hotel). Its not worth the money, staff have poor attitude. They just do not understand service. Food is generally rubbish and expensive. Breakfast is OK. Management can not offer help even to resolve simple issues. Location is great.
",1,2007,02,16
133,Great location and lovely staff,"Booked a three night stay through an online agent, hotel was a 'mystery' choice although you could work out which hotel it was from the description.   Paid just over ¬£100 a night for a room including continental breakfast and so considered this excellent value for money in central London.   Staff were fabulous, all very pleasant and the service was faultless.   The room I had was very large accommodating a kingsize bed, sofa, chair, desk, table etc with no problems.  Bathroom in very good condition and of a reasonable size.   The only thing I would criticise is the food in the hotel which is distinctly average but really quite expensive.   In addition the hotel were carrying out renovations while I was staying and I was awoken each morning to the sound of drilling from the floor above, and as the hotel was busy I wasn't able to move rooms.
",4,2007,02,13
133,good value,"Stayed in January 2007. Good value for money and I would stay again. Some reviewers expect too much.  It is not fair to compare budget 5 star hotels to luxury 5 star hotels. This hotel was plenty good enough for the money. I stayed in the Dorchester earlier this year- it was twice as good, but I paid twice as much. I enjoyed both hotels for different reasons and would use both again.
",4,2007,02,05
133,"Great hotel, great location, great price","Stayed here for 3 nights over a long weekend in January and got a great deal from a 'top secret' type we offer, had enough clues to know which hotel it would be before I booked, 100gbp per night B&B for London 5* - unbelievable price. 

Arrived early and no non smoking room was available, so was offered choice to wait or to take an available smoking room. I took second option with proviso I could change if the room was smelly. It wasn't. Got a 9th floor street facing room - great view looking down Kensington High Street, especially when lit up at night. The room has a dvd & cd player, plus a little mezzanine with a sofa and armchair, so bigger than I was expecting. It was in good condition - no complaints at all, ditto for bathroom.  Daily Telegraph free each morning. 

Breakfast was good, not amazing - continental included in room rate price. Great for fresh fruit and juices, ok for cold meats & cheese (what was there was nice, but limited choice). Possible to order cooked breakfast for an extra 4.50 per person which I though was reasonable (took it one day and was not disappointed).  

Staff were very helpful, concierge helpful and friendly. The hotel bar was ok but a bit boring in terms of look & feel. Didn't try the restaurant. 

Knightsbridge & and west end just a short bus ride away (bus stop outsdide hotel), or a cheap cab ride. Tube station also very close, but found that bus was more convient to go into west end. 

Area surrounding hotel is nice - next to Kensington gardens on one side and high street shopping, bars & cafes on the other. 

Overall & given the price paid - it was suberb & highly recommended. If I had paid double or more would have expected a more specacular breakfast selection and a more interesting hotel bar.",5,2007,01,24
133,Getting older but ok,"The Royal Garden was my default hotel from 1999-2002.  During that time it had just undergone a renovation and I found the rooms (although a tad small) nice, the beds nice and the bathrooms very clean.

Now, five years later, the Royal Garden is starting to show some signs of aging.  The carpets are getting a tad dirtier and my last mattress was quite lumpy.  It's still worth staying, but I suspect things will be getting a little more tired in the months and years to come.

You can get some good deals here, compared to other hotels in London, and the location is quite nice.  Overall I have no real complaints, but I just remember when it used to be a little bit nicer...
",4,2007,01,21
133,The only nice thing there is the lobby.,"Apparently this hotel has different size/quality rooms since my coworkers like to stay there (for the same money).
My room was horrible: small and outdated with poor ventilation. The worst thing about it was the bathroom! I actually couldn't fit there, and no, I am not fat, I am pretty thin. Every time I was coming to my room I thought how overpriced it was. The floor hallway was just scary.
The food on the first floor and on the top floor was good but pricey.
The room was ready very late and I had to hang in the lobby for several hours, therefore the title...
Will try some other hotel next time!
",1,2007,01,10
133,Great!,"We stayed here from December 24th, 2006 until January 2nd, 2007 and booked a great deal through otel.com. Although the room (330) had one somewhat broken window (noisy and it didn't open) we were quite happy! Continental breakfast was included and was sufficient (although something like salami or pepperoni would add a bonus to the breakfast buffet) and varied. Breakfast via roomservice was free of charge and the requested ham and cheese was complimentary! Compliments for the concierge who booked dinner reservations for us, and told us everything we needed to know! A shame though that the Tenth, which is supposed to be absolutely fabulous, was closed everytime we tried to visit (and believe me: we've tried!). The only thing that wasn't so great is that, contrary to what the hotel itself states, not all rooms look out onto Kensington Garden. Our room looked out on Kensington High Street and that can be quite noisy. But all in all it's a good five star hotel and I can recommend it to anyone! Close to the tube, 20 minutes walk to Knightsbridge, what more do you want?
",5,2007,01,06
133,First Rate!,"We stayed at the Royal Garden for a long weekend during the Christmas/Newe Year week and could not have been more pleased and pleasantly surprised. The hotel public areas and our room were comfortable and welcoming. The staff could not have been nicer or more professional. 
The concierges on duty during our stay were all professional and quite knowledgeable and went out of their way to be helpful and accomodating. I had forgotten collar stays for my dress shirts and the concierge directed me to a local shop where I was able to obtain them. Simlarly, they made recommendations regarding convenient and inexpensive transportation and useful tips.
Continental breakfast was included in our package and provided a wide slection of fresh fruit, cereal and breads/pastries nicely presented, the staff could not have been nicer. They were attentive and very professional.
Only minor issues- my companion found that the lighting in the bathroom was not conducive for putting on her makeup; there is little drawer space and the closet could use a light- but these were minor inconveniences in what was an otherwise pleasant sojourn at the Royal Garden.
For those needing to use their computer -- the wireless service was fairly reasonable at L5 for a two hour card.
The hotel location was very convenient- just a short walk to the tube and bus stops and for a nice walk- Harrod's and other shopping. All things considered- I'd go back.
",5,2007,01,01
133,Good but could be better,"I stayed here a 3 years ago and it was fine, so I booked it again for 2 nights last week (Sat/Sun) I booked direct and seleted the deluxe room. When we arrived we had been bumped up to a junior suit, didn't have to ask. Room fine, large with lovely views across the park, clean and everything working fine. I agree with the previous post that the walls are thin, could here child crying somewhere.

I have however stayed in better 4 star - The Chestrfield at Mayfair for example.

Breakfast

Here's where they let themselves down.  There was obviously lots of office/works parties on the Saturday night, so Sunday was chaos. They provided a buffet breakfast clearly because they can't cope with the level of people. I detest English Breakfast being served this way, as it is usually cold and the selection is limited. The continental buffet was fine, lots of choice. My husband asked for fried eggs instead of the scrambled slop that was provided and this took 20 minutes!!!

The staff were far too busy and the service was poor, for ¬£19.50 per head it was dreadful - my breakfast was included, but that is a terrible price. It felt like a travel lodge.

What a difference the next day. No crappy hot buffet, just all cooked to order. Much much, better. Service was fine as it should be and staff were polite.

I don't think the Royal Garden deserves 5 stars anymore, it needs a shake up to get them to realise that good service is a continuious thing, not just when they feel like it.
",4,2006,12,05
133,poor concierge not a 5 star,"Ive stayed in many 5 stars and this just doesnt compare to any of them the concierge in particular were the most dissappointing and were of no help when we asked if they could try and get us a table in a restaurant he said no chance when we asked if there were any nearby restaurants he didnt know any (strange considering there are about 5 across the road!) as a 5 star hotel service should be their number 1 priority and it fails dismally the rooms are small and outdated and the walls are thin I could hear people in the next room talking at 6am.

the bar is overpriced and so is the tenth resturant which is also in need of a refurb how can you charge the same price as claridges when you arent in central london and you aint anywhere near that standard! v dissappointing and definatly not a 5 star hotel the service just isnt there its got no atmosphere and is vastly overpriced! Ive stayed in the atheneum which is closer to shops etc the service is the best and the rooms are better my advice is stay there we will next time.

133,An unexpected pleasure,"We stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel from Oct 20 the 28th. We were very surprised to find that is is a very nice hotel in a nice area. The DH found it to be a bit far from downtown London but Kensington has its own charm.The hotel seemed to have a great many diplomats & sports figures- a little embasy row is just next door- and it is next to Kensington Palace. The continental breakfast was included but we were able to purchase the  full English breakfast for just 4 pounds more. That was cheaper than going to Giraffe across the street. There are many small but relatively inexpensive restaurants across the street  ranging from Starbucks to Giraffe , Italian and Greek as well as a popular pub. The area is just great about a mile from Notting Hill. The service was very good although room service for a splurge evening snack left much to be desired but when we complained they withdrew the charge.  Marks and Spencer are just up the street also  for an inexpensive meal with the underground next to it - about 500 yards from the hotel.  The room and bath was average size for an American hotel with a nice tile bath. We would stay there again. 

We had not seen many reviews and had thought it to be a possible dud. But we now think that they are just keeping a great secret.
",4,2006,11,21
133,The Grass is Greener at Royal Garden,"We stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel October 28 ‚Äì November 1, 2006 while in London on our honeymoon. The hotel location is excellent, there are many shops & a variety of restaurants right out side the door, Kensington Palace & Gardens is also next door to the hotel. The Kensington High Street Underground stop is a short, pleasant walk from the hotel. The front desk staff were professional & the Concierge was very helpful with arranging transportation to the airport at the end of our stay.  

The room was a comfortable size & was clean with a comfortable bed & nice sitting area (small couch, table with magazines & a big window overlooking Kensington High Street ‚Äì great view). The bathroom was also clean, amenities included the usual soaps, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel & lotion along with bathrobes, cotton swabs & a sewing kit. In room internet access was available but for a hefty price.

The continental breakfast that was included in our room rate had a good variety of cereal, fruits, yogurt & pastries. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere with big windows that looked out onto Kensington Park.  Royal Garden Hotel was in a great location & met our needs, I would stay there again & recommend it to others. While in London I would also recommend seeing the play ‚ÄúWicked‚Äù at Apollo Victoria Theatre (esp. if you‚Äôre a Wizard of Oz fan).  If you‚Äôre American, I must warn you, the $ exchange rate isn‚Äôt very good‚Ä¶  prepare to shell out $$ esp when dining, even one basic meal at a fast food joint will cost about $13+USD per person but after all, you‚Äôre (hopefully) on vacation so enjoy!  Another dining tip, most London restaurants include the tip in your meal price so be sure to check on the menu to see if a ‚Äúservice charge‚Äù has been included before leaving a tip.

133,"Location, Location, Location","The Royal Garden has a prime location on Kensington High Street close to the best shops in London, including Harrods and Harvey Nichols.
Reception and Concierge staff are among the best I have ever dealt with. 
The rooms are a bit dated but very well mantained.  It is worthy to upgrade to one of the rooms overlooking the park.  What a view!
Breakfast is served in the cafe restaurant, excellent choice of food for ¬£18. The service is attentive and friendly but try to avoid peak periods if you can.
There are a lot of restaurants in the area but dinner at the Tenth restaurant is a must.
I highly recommend this hotel to anyone.

133,"Great Hotel, Great Location","My partner booked this as a surprise break for me. We had a spacious room overlooking Hyde Park and even better we were right in the midst of High Street Kensington shops. Our room was very clean with traditional furnishings, but the ensuite could do with a bit of an update.
The reception staff were very helpful and polite and the doorman couldn't help us enough with all the local information.
On the first night we ordered room service as we arrived very late but the next evening we went to The Tenth Restaurant which has stunning views overlooking the Park and even towards the London Eye. The food was very well presented but perhaps not very substantial for my apetite.
Overall I would recommend this 5 Star Hotel to anyone who wants to be in a great location and enjoy a warm and friendly atmosphere

133,Pleasantly surprised..,"We stayed here for 3 nights in June.  Had a lovely quiet room (which is rare for London) on the back of the building looking over a tree lined street.  Staff wonderful - rooms spacious and very clean - liked the sitting area with the large picture window.  Room service was excellant - breakfast wheeled in on a trolly and everything we asked for. Would have liked to have stayed here again after our time touring - we tried everything but they requested more than double what we paid for this visit so alas didn't go back.

133,Enjoy The Royal Garden!,"Had a terrific stay at The Royal Garden. Great hotel, that comes with a perfect location. The staff was very polite and helpful.

The room was nice, modern and clean. TV/Computer and DVD player, had no problem operating the pay tv etc.

The food was excelent, so was the 24-hour room service. Late one night we had dinner at the hotel room. Steak with new potatoes. Fantastic!

We had a nice view of Kensinghton High street, a typical London ""picture"" :o)

The Royal Garden is a true 5 ***** star hotel, no doubt!

133,"Dated, no longer 5 stars.","Five star hotel?  Maybe twenty years ago.  

Service - very good, I must say.

Location - excellent- overlooking kensington palace and on high street Kensington - good shopping and bus/tube access.  

Rooms - Was on tenth (top )floor.  Wonderful views of royal kensington park.  Musty smell to room- dated furniture with stains.  Nothing special  Good size. Thin sheets, difficult to control air conditioning- expect a hot/cold night.  TV difficult to use and took ages to load up.  No preview of movies.  No kettle!  

Bathroom - nice- bidet in one of our rooms.  Bathrobes.

Breakfast - ok, not worth the ¬£18 a head.  Poor service.  Expect to have to ask for everything, and twice.  

Business centre - open 24hrs a day, ¬£2.50 for 15 mins internet, 25 p to print.

Paid ¬£100 per night for twins.  

Conclusion - Great location, and historically probably a five star hotel, but now the rooms are too dated, furniture is old, rooms are musty.  Worth going if you find a deal, but would not pay more than ¬£100.  Very nice for a weekend break - to walk around kensington gardens/hyde park, and high st ken for shopping.

133,Decidely average,"We stayed at the hotel as part of a large group celebrating a special birthday.  All in all it was very functional without being very special.  The rooms were perfectly adequate although for the cost surely the provision of tea/coffee facilities should be a given.  The quality of staff was fine but the problem was the lack of said staff.  Each area seemed to be understaffed.  Breakfast was somewhat chaotic purely because there were not enough staff to deal with the guests. When food ran out there was no one to bring out more. 

Overall there was nothing particularly wrong with the hotel other than an insufficient staff to guests ratio.

133,Good Expensive Hotel !,"Hello, I stayed in this hotel for 5 days (biz trip). the overall impression is very good, yet, if u r paying from ur pocket for the accomodation, then watch out. i know that there r other hotels in london much more expensive but this is not the cheapest eaither. for ex, to clean a shirt it costs u 6 pounds, to use the hotel internet, u pay around 20 pounds/2 h. there s a wirless connection that costs less anyways. english breakfast costs u around 18 pound..this is just to give an example then it is up to u and the budget u have in mind.
as for the services, it very good i must say. staff s attentive and polite (the majority. room is ok but not big. toilets r in a v good condition and the food and the room service is excellent. u can request for ur tean & coffee making kit if there s no one n ur room.

133,Personalised Stay in a 5*,"I recently stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel in London during a business trip and my family joined me for the weekend as they never been to London (my wife and our son). The hotel is well located as it is not far from heathrow and close to shopping areas such as Harrods and Slone Square. I was very satisfied by the efficiency of their driver who came to pick me up at the airport and knew moreless most of the info I asked him and even tried to talk to me in Russian. In general i stay on teh other part of teh park but my assitant was adived by our agency to try this hotel has they had a good deal and ok feedback. I will also myself recommend this hotel being above the average 5* without the added $$$ that you can get in the other hotels on the Park Lane. Being on this side they concentrate more on making me fell having a personalised stay (with a welcome card in russian). But they should have more russian speaking staff.

133,"5 star service, 3 star rooms","Can't fault the service and location but expected much more from a five star hotel where the room was concerned. Had booked a non-smoking standard room but when I arrived they did not have one available so gave me a free upgrade to a 'suite'. Was really glad as it was tiny and so was pleased not to be in a standard room. However, it was the bathroom that amazed me - I have never been in one so small - ever. Bear in mind I am from the UK so not judging it against American standards. You had to open the door which opened against the bath, stand close against the sink, and close the door to get to the toilet. Was here on a conference and was really pleased it was on expenses and not coming out of my own pocket! Unless you have a strong reason to stay here I would not recommend it as there is much better available in London.

133,Very mixed experience,"I booked this for a 2 night treat for my husband, and we enjoyed ourselves on the whole, but sometimes it was hard work. I'd asked for a garden view and we were given a room that overlooked a concrete roof (!) - you could just see the Kensington gardens if you stood at the very corner of the window and craned your neck. After some discussion they upgraded (at a cost) to a room which had a fantastic view on the 9th floor - but later realised it was extremely noisy with a/c units above (& we had to ask for a tea tray - 5 star?). When I complained at checkout a very nice receptionist refunded the upgrade. First breakfast was great - lovely table/view & lovely food & v good service. Second was a disaster - terrible table near kitchen door (really there shouldn't be a table there at all) and we were told we couldn't move because they were 'too busy'! We insisted and then had to wait 25 mins for a breakfast that was undercooked - definitely felt that was the punishment. All in all, a great location but very varied staff attitudes - a shame!
",2,2006,03,14
133,Patrons beware,"On Jan 26th, 2006 we (three of us) got up at 4am and flew to London for a computer show. One in the party went to the Royal Garden, checked-in and indicated to the hotel staff that the other two rooms would be coming in after the show. After a hard day we showed up at 7pm checked in. (Credit Card taken, passports photocopied). Then we were asked to take a seat in the bar. After 15 minutes we were told their were no rooms. We were put in a cab for a ""nearby"" hotel... The Royal Garden was one subway stop and in walking distance from the show. The nearby hotel was six subway stops and one change away. It was 4-star vs 5-star and available at ""the same rate"". The room was confirmed with Credit Card on booking. Only later did we find out that some rooms never checked out, so we were bumped. Our group split, to an inferier Hotel, added transport time. etc. We have now recevied a letter that ""apologies"" and offers .... nothing.

So it seems that one should not rely on late checkin at this hotel.

133,One for the best in london,"I was in London at a company event and decided to stay at the Royal Garden Hotel from the list of recommended hotels. It was only slightly more than some of the other hotels even though it had five stars, but was the hotel where the event was being held. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The staff in Berties bar went out of there way to make me feel welcome and really impressed the clients I was entertaining. Rooms are spacious and I had a great view over Hyde Park.

Its not the cheapest hotel in London, but with most things, you get what you pay for. Definitely one for the A list.

Stunning Room with equally stunning views. 

Lots of nice touches (Bathrobes, slippers etc) but my personal favourite was the Heated bathroom mirror which didn't steam up in spite of my hot shower !

Room was big, servicein hotel fair (but didn't eat there so can't comment on dining experience)

Overall, would reccomend, but watch the bill (4 drinks in bar cost over ¬£30)

133,Watch the bill!,"Stayed in this hotel on the 16th of September.  The bathroom was not well cleaned and the room and whole corridor smelt strongly of cigeretts.  However, what really annoyed me was the bill.  I received a letter on the 23rd of Spetember relating to a mini-bar charge dated 16th Septmeber for my roon (room 612).  I did not use / take any item from the mini bar during my stay - but did open it in the hope of finding coffee making facilities.  I left a phone message for Ms Felicity Yexley of this Hotel to this effect on the 24th but she did not bother to ring back.  I emailed Ms Yexley also to no avial.  My tip - Watch the bill and what they try and charge you for after they have left

133,Lousy Service,"There is no way that this hotel is 5*.  The food in the hotel restaurant is terrible with a chef that has a bad attitude. Had two meals in the hotel. Everything you asked for had to be relayed to the chef. Our last meal (for 10 persons) took two hours to arrive and was cold. Chef is unable to cook a rare steak. All the restaurant staff seem scared of him including the manageress who was professional when dealing with our complaint but was limited to what she could do.

The hotel foyer looks impressive but then this does not reflect the bedroom comfort. The toilet is 1 inch away from the wall and therefore impossible to sit comfortably on. The key card system is a total joke. Every day, our key cards had to be replaced.

All in all, we would not return but then again, they have enough business in London to not bother about any of the above.
",2,2005,09,24
133,Clean and lovely,"Had not known about the hotel previously as our trip was planned last minute.  The hotel's website claimed to be of a 5-star quality and from past visits to London, we knew that this could be a false claim.  Check-in was a breeze, quick and friendly.  Our room was non-smoking on the 5th floor with a lovely view of Kensington Park and private residences.   Easy to find since Kensington tube station is minutes away by foot.   Extremely clean and looked to be newly refurbished.  Two beds (that did not roll around the room with castors), desk area, raised sitting area with chair, table and sofa, mini-bar, dvd/cd player and internet access.  Spacious bathroom with a good shower and water pressure!!! Called the hotel several times to reserve and change our bookings, each time my call was received by friendly and helpful staff.    Excellent, excellent hotel.  Highly recommended.   Only wished we had more time to enjoy the hotel and visit the casino.",5,2005,05,25
133,disgraceful management,"i have found that reservations staff  are inefficient about bookings, although i have stayed there many times
if you complain to management about it, they side with staff.
if you get food poisoning and complain they decide to have the food and beverages manager discuss it with you, change their mind and send you a security man to discuss your ""allegations"". when you want to know why, they ask you to leave the hotel calling you a troublemaker. the main culprit is the deputy general manager. great location, some great staff. rest is unworthy. avoid.

133,Friendliest 5 star in London,"We had a great stay at the Royal garden and it was superb. The location next to the park and Kensington Palace is excellent but what really impressed was the friendliness of the staff. They really could not do enough for us and always with a smile! Rare sometimes in many hotels.

The rooms are spacious (well worth paying the small supplement for the Park view rooms) and well equipped. Room service was excellent and a must is a meal in the restaurant on the Tenth floor.
",5,2005,05,20
133,Royal Garden Hotel is excellent..truly a 5 star hotel,"We just got back from London and we stayed at the Royal Garden Hotel. It was LOVELY. The staff is courteous and the hotel is elegant. We requested a smoking room so we had a better view of Kennsington Gardens. If you request for a smoking room, they will put you on a higher floor (6th floor - there are only 10 floors and the 10th floor is a wonderful restaurant)- hence a nicer view. The room does not smell of smoke but if if does smell of smoke, you can open the windows a little so you can air it out. We had a step up sitting area with a beautiful view of the gardens. We ordered room service late one night and ate it while admiring the city lights. Kudos to Romy (from room service). He was very polite and the food was excellent.

The hotel is next to Kennsington Gardens/Hyde park so it is very convenient when you want to take a stroll at the park. We were lucky we had a nice day so we had breakfast at the park (which we bought at Portobello Market the day before)

The hotel is within a couple minute walk to the tube - High Street Kennsington (Circle/District line). and the bus stop is in front of the hotel. 

For those who want 5 star service, the Royal Garden Hotel is your best choice. You will trully be pampered!
",5,2005,04,20
133,Disappointing,"I just returned from a two night stay at the Royal Garden.  Nobody can argue about its excellent location and the stunning views of Kensington Palace.  However, I found the service to be very below par.  My attempt to check in early was rebuffed despite the fact that I had called and e-mailed in advance and received assurances that this would be okay.  They offered to let me shower in the Health Club, a reasonable alternative except for the fact that the club attendant claimed that there were no more locks for the lockers (a theme soon to be repeated).  When I insisted that she stand sentry to guard my locker, she managed to find a lock.  Utterly silly.

After showering, I dropped off my bag at the front desk and they assured that it would be placed in my room.  It was not, and indeed they had a difficult time locating it once I did check in at 8pm that evening.  And the topper was my breakfast experience.  I was the first person to show up for breakfast on Sunday morning as I had to catch an early flight to Heathrow.  Despite the fact that their very large dining room was completely empty, I was directed to a table right next to the bus stand -- perhaps two feet away.  When I pointed to another table that was a safer distance from the bus stand, I was told that ""it was for four people.""  I was also told that ""they were out of papers"" even though I was the first person in the restaurant.  As for the food, it was quite marginal.  

In short, none of these incidents taken in a vacuum is terrible, but taken collectively they suggest a hotel that is nowhere near its self-proclaimed five-star status.  This is a average hotel with a very good location and a consistently surly staff.  You can do much better in London.",2,2004,12,22
133,An excellent ambiance,"Just returned from the Royal Garden after one of our reglar visits. The hotel has an excellent ambiance. Both bars are atmospheric. Breakfast downstairs is varied, plentiful and rates amongst the best. The range of fresh fruit and yoghurt is first class. The queues for breakfast can be problematic if you arrive at approx 10am on week-ends. The views from The Tenth are stunning and it is well worth having a bottle of wine early evening with the wonderful views before the restaurant gets too busy. Rather disappointed with our room on this occasion.  Normally we have views over the park with a raised seating level but a rather dowdy room (912) with dowdier bathroom  wasn't something to rave about. However, for an excellent location, good service, relaxed and 5* surroundings, The Royal Garden has lots going for it.

133,"Clean, good facilities and excellent staff","Just Returned from a lovely stay at the Royal Garden. Upgraded on arrival to a room with a seperate seating area and spectacular views of the hustle and bustle of Kensington High Street - no street noise though! Spacious room, very clean and well presented.  Mini bar very expensive but aren't they all!
Friendly welcoming staff and excellent concierge.  
Lovely breakfast, everything you could possibly want in a calm and relaxed atmosphere.
We ate in the hotel on the second night in the Park Terrace restaurant. The British menu shown to us at the front desk didn't really appeal but the menu shown once in the restaurant was quite varied, not expensive and excellent quality.
Would thoroughly recommend this hotel, can be expensive (5*) but some good internet deals on offer if you search. Although not as centrally located as some hotels you are just a short walk from High Street Kensington tube station past some pretty good shops. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel with regular sevices. We took the bus to the theatre and back on the concierge recommendation and it was so much easier than the tube.   A really enjoyable visit.

133,Perfect,"The Royal Garden has been my husbands and my default hotel for business trips over the past four years and we have yet to be disappointed.  You are treated like a celebrity from the moment that the doorman opens your cab door and you are whisked inside through the revolving glass door.  One of the reasons I love this hotel so much is because while you have all of the benefits of a large hotel, it is more intimate than other large chain hotels.  All of the concierge are great - case in point: my husband and I were to attend a black tie dinner and I had no idea how to tie a bow tie, the concierge volunteered to teach me how.  I have never stayed below the 8th floor, but each of the rooms I have stayed in have a fantastic view of Kensington Garden, as well as Kensigton Palace.  I also love how the rooms are split level, with an elevated sitting area next to the huge picture windows.  Room service is prompt and has great ""all american"" and international snacks.  Afternoon tea is beautiful in the small cafe next to the park(especially if its rainy and cold outside) - comfy sofas and great service(I actually had my first crumpet here)  Breakfast is great as they offer a buffet, a menu, and will also make anything you want (I love bagels with lox and cream cheese, which are not on the menu, but they will make it for me every trip no questions asked)  The bar is also nice, perfect for a quick business chat, or pre-dinner drink with friends.  The spa is also decent, as they can always fit you in for an impromptu pedicure and is great for a work out(all kinds of classes including Pilates and Yoga), if you don't feel like jogging in Kensington Garden.  The location is very good as well, right on High Street Kensington(affordable shopping) yet a quick ride away (he tube is a short walk down the High Street) from all of the major shopping and sight seeing.  There are all kinds of quick bites around the hotel, and there's even a salsa club across the street.  This hotel is definitly 5 star, but I can understand the mixed reviews.  I personally love this hotel and I think it is a great 5 star, but it is not the Ritz with its club levels or the Crillon in Paris with its 14th century suites and views of Place d'Concorde (hence my rating of 4, and not 5.)  However, when staying at the Royal Garden, one is also not paying the premium prices of these other hotels.",4,2004,09,28
133,5 star?,"I have been lucky to stay at the hotel,at the beginning of september.My room looked out over kensington high street but for this it was quiet.The room was nicely furnished,had a tv/cd/ dvd player,but when the tv was turned off you lost the clock,so makeing you have a wake up call.If you fancied a cup of tea or coffee in your room you couldn,t as it was an extra.The hotel had 6 lifts but you seem to be always waiting for one .The lifts only went to reception so if you wanted the gym or carparks you had to go outside and use the lifts there.One last point it would be nice to be offered a cooked veggie beakfast .All in all a nice hotel but could do better as it is a 5 star

133,Enjoyed our stay at the Royal Garden,"On our recent trip to London this hotel was quite lovely.  The room had a beautiful view of the park, the staff were very accomodating and the hotel's close proximity to the ""tube"" made it extremely convenient for sightseeing.
",5,2004,08,11
133,Wonderful Views,"Just returned from 3 nights at the Royal Garden Hotel. When we registered we were upgraded to a room with a view, 645 on the 6th floor. Wow! what a dynamite view over Kensington Gardens. The bed was very comfortable as was the lovely sitting area where we enjoyed the views. Service at the hotel was excellent. Breakfast in the Park terrace was very good, but not special. The location of the hotel is great. You are near the underground, good shopping, the park and some excellent restaurants. Try Zaika for outstanding Indian food..it is right across the street. Maggie Jones is a block away with very good british food. Starbucks is also across the street as is Wegamama, an inexpensive noodle shop.

133,5 STAR HOTEL,"We stayed in the Royal Garden in a deluxe room, 5th floor, 6/22-6/25, with a magnificent park view, great room, and excellent service. Truly a 5 star hotel.

133,tiny room,"We have just stayed in room 822 for 3 nights at the end of June paid good money but the room was tiny just 1 hair 1 small tv that was located in such a way that you had to lay at differing places in the bed to see it  the bed was just a double 4ft 6 it was obviously a single room that had had a small double put in did complain told thats all we got 5 star Huuummmmm think not
",2,2004,06,30
133,Best Hotel in London,"Because of its location (edge of Kensington Gardens) the view is INCREDIBLE!  Get a room facing the park and you won't be sorry.  8th floor gives a particularly fine view.  Rooms/food/servive is fine.  I particularly disagree with the bad review given a couple of spaces below, this hotel is A1 (and I've stayed in many of the best hotels in London).

133,What a great hotel,What a grea\t hotel the staff are great the rooms are great and the views are second to none. Best hotel i have stayed in London.,5,2004,05,10
133,A tired hotel overpriced and overrated,"In my opinion the Royal Garden is overpriced and overrated and seems to bathe in some kind of reflected glory of Britain past, if the displays and artifacts around the hotel are anything to go by.

The rooms are small (I am staying there now in 506) and tatty, the bathrooms also as small as a Japanese business hotel such as the Tokyu Stay in Shibuya for example, the TV a small relic, the bedlamps hanging at angles where the screws are loose, no iron, and a door which SLAMS shut to wake your neighbours and you if it is not your door.

In the last 4 days I have stayed in the Citadines Soouth Kensington, near the Royal Garden, the Westin Berlin, the Sheraton Lisbon, and now the Royal Garden and it it is the worst by far.  For superior value in the are stay at Citadines - the rooms are bigger, they supply irons in the room, with a kitchen, and laundry downstairs.  If you get an Internet special from Citadines you could pay half of the Royal Garden rates.

The Royal Garden speaks of itself in glowing phrases, for example the Health Club is praised lavishly but the reality is that you have to enter by going outside the hotel into one of the busiest streets in London.  The fitness room is just a large underground mirror-lined room, there is no pool, and the washrooms and sauna basic.  If you don't mind exiting through the lobby and into the street each time you want to use this very ordinary facility then you will be happy - for me, I think it is second rate.

Further, the Royal Garden is one of those classic overpriced establishments that also wants to gouge you at every opportunity - the phone rates from the room are nearly three times the Citadine rates, for example, the cost to call a ""free number"" is about US$2, and the so-called ""public phones"" in the lobby are also private pay phones where you cannot use calling cards to free numbers and the hotel takes its share of these calls as well, and trying to find the call rates is not an easy task.  Be prepared for a hefty credit card bill if you use these phones.

My negative opinion was reinforced by the fact that I had to ask three times to have my complimentary morning paper delivered.  Once in person as I passed through the lobby to the Health Club, and twice by phone.  It appeared eventually, without apology or explanation.

The staff are actually quite helpful, but they have the convenience of blaming the system, such as when I asked why the corridor was heated like a furnance.  Helpfully, they called maintenance, but the answer was that the heating is controlled centrally and this means apparently that nothing can be done about individual runaway floors!

Stay away from this place unless you reveal in hubris and are living on someome else's expense account.",1,2004,04,27
133,A mixed bag,"I stayed at this hotel for three nights. I found the hotel great in all respects - except one - the noise!

I am a deep sleeper but was woken every night by doors slamming and people talking in the hallway. Very annoying at 4am!",2,2004,03,30
133,Worth Every Penny,"I could not have been more pleased. My room was a tad larger than a U.S. mid-grade hotel, which is large by Eurpoean standards. The bathroom was a bit small, but that is always the case. The staff were superb in every way. I felt as if I was truly taken care of, from helping me get around the city to holding my bags before check-in. The restaurant, Tenth, was the BEST MEAL I HAVE EVER HAD. Really. Ever. And the service fantastic. My room was clean, and cleaned every day of our stay to perfection. Close to Notting Hill and Kensington shopping, and there is a stop for the touristy bus tour straight across the street. 
Hyde Park was lovely, and right next door. I will definitely stay here if I am ever in London.",5,2004,03,15
133,Great Hotel,"The trip to London was great and the hotel staff were very efficient and helpful at the Royal Garden Hotel. They were able to get tickets for shows, tell us how to use the bus system and everything worked out perfectly.",5,2003,09,11
133,WOW!,"The service here is great, and from the moment you walk in you are treated like a star!! I even got a complimentary upgrade on my room!

133,VERGOGNOSI E DISONESTI,"Peccato che non esistano 0 stelle altrimenti avrei messo quelle.
Disonesti truffatori, l‚Äôalbergo fa schifo, 5 stelle sono una chimera.
Siamo stati in questa bettola quasi un anno fa, arrivati di sera, siamo scappati dopo aver cambiato due camere, sporche, piccole, non corrispondenti al livello prenotato e pagato e sopratutto SENZA RISCALDAMENTO!!!

Stanchi sfiniti e presi dalla disperazione alle 23 abbiamo chiesto di poter cambiare hotel chiedendo il rimborso, che √® stato accordato visto che non riuscivano a far partire il riscaldamento e si moriva dal freddo.

Hanno fatto il rimborso e ci hanno dato lo scontrino.
Peccato che la transazione non sia andata a buon fine!

Ce ne siamo accorti settimane dopo da un estratto conto, abbiamo chiesto spiegazioni in una mail convinti che rendendosene conto avrebbero effettuato nuovamente il rimborso, invece erano evidentemente in mala fede, perch√© ci hanno liquidati dicendo che lo avevano fatto e che dovevamo di cercare meglio con la banca!!!

Da allora continuiamo a scrivergli ma loro sono completamente scomparsi nel nulla approfittandosi della lontananza e della nostra fiducia nelle loro buone intenzioni

La colazione prevedeva un ampio (dire ampio √® dire poco) buffet sia dolce (pasticceria, frutta, cereali, brioches, torte, di tutto e di pi√π) sia salato (sfido qualunque italiano come me a resistere davanti alla vista di quelle belle salsicce profumate e fumanti).
Io ho optato prima per il salato (una salsiccia di vitello, credo, e due 'focaccine' di patate croccanti,accompagnati da succo d'arancia) e poi sono passata al dolce (croissant, muffin e simili), accompagnati dal classico th√©. 
Oltre al buffet c'era la possibilit√† di ordinare dal men√π, ma per me il buffet era pi√π che sufficiente. Purtroppo non mangio tantissimo, altrimenti avrei fatto un secondo, terzo e quarto round di entrambi i buffet per assaggiare tutto.
L'ambiente √® accogliente e raffinato. Non ho idea dei prezzi perch√©, come ho gi√† detto, ero ospite. 
Lo consiglio, √® da provare assolutamente, ma con una bella e calda compagnia come la mia.",5,2017,08,12

133,"Eleganza, cortesia e confort!","Questo splendido hotel si trova in Kensington High Steet e vi ho soggiornato in pi√π occasioni per lavoro.
Il Royal Garden offre spaziose camere sia con una magnifica vista su Kensington Garden che su Kensington high street, anche se queste ultime sono un po' rumorose.
L'arredamento che ho trovato √® sempre stato su colori neutri come marrone e beige, sobrio ma nello stesso tempo elegante.
Letto ampio a due piazze, comodo armadio illuminato con frigo bar e cassaforte, piccola zona salotto con divano sotto la finestra, scrivania, Tv lcd, telefono, wifi.
Bagno grande con vasca/doccia sempre ben rifornito con vari prodotti in omaggio quali sapone, shampoo, bagnoschiuma, balsamo......
A disposizione anche accappatoi, pantofole, accessori per t√®, cioccolata calda, latte e caff√® con cookies e una bottiglia di acqua ogni giorno.
Non ho mai usufruito della prima colazione a mio avviso un po' cara se non compresa (circa 25 sterline), n√® dei ristoranti.
Personale molto gentile e disponibile, sia in Reception che in Conciergerie.
 
Ottima posizione, a 500 metri dalla metro (Circle e District Line), e con diverse fermate dei bus di fronte all'hotel.
Kensington High Steet √® una via molto frequentata con moltissimi bar, negozi, ristoranti, e anche piccoli supermercati.
 
Consigliato!

133,Stanze spaziose. ,"Abbiamo pernottato al Royal Garden hotel due notti. Appena arrivate nella stanza abbiamo notato che siccome le finestre davano su Kensington high street c'era molto rumore. A questo punto abbiamo chiesto se fosse possibile cambiare stanza per una pi√π silenziosa. La signora alla reception ce l'ha cordialmente cambiata con una che non dava sulla strada principale, la 650. √à vero era leggermente pi√π piccola per√≤ il bagno era pi√π spazioso e il silenzio impagabile. 

La prima sera, forse per il cambiamento stanza, non √® stata al livello di un 5 stelle. Non ci hanno rifatto la stanza e consegnato il giornale la mattina. Invece la seconda sera la stanza √® stata rifatta e il giornale √® stato consegnato la mattina seguente. Nel bagno non sono stati rimessi i dischi di cotone che avevamo utilizzato ma ho chiamato la governante che ce li ha portati subito. 

La colazione in camera √® un punto NERO dell'albergo. √à arrivata puntuale ma le 'pastries' erano insufficienti rispetto al numero di persone ma erano soprattutto PESSIME. Da non ripetere. 

Ho dovuto spedire un pacco e nonostante partissi la mattina seguente, il concierge mi ha fatto firmare un documento e se ne √® poi occupato per me. Certo l'albergo si prende il 5% di commissione... Ma visto che lo dovevo mandare in UK mi costava comunque meno che riportarlo in Italia.

L'ubicazione √® ottima. La stazione di metropolitana pi√π vicina √®: 'high Kensington street' e si trova a 5 min a piedi dall'albergo. Da l√¨ si possono prendere sia la district che la circle line. Se invece ci si vuole muovere in taxi o in un uber, arrivano in pochissimi minuti.

Non lo definirei un 5 stelle, ma un buon 4 stelle. Le stanze sono sicuramente pi√π spaziose rispetto alla media londinese. ",4,2016,07,14

Segnalo uno dei bagni in marmo pi√π spaziosi e meglio accessoriati in cui mi sia capitato di imbattermi: lavabo, sanitari, bidet e doccia con doppio soffione separata da una grande vasca. Eravamo in tre e i prodotti da bagno (sapone, shampoo, bagnoschiuma, balsamo, cottonfioc, kit per cucito, nastri per capelli) rispecchiavano il numero degli occupanti della camera. Tra le facilities: accappatoi, pantofole, accessori per t√®, cioccolata calda, latte e caff√® con cookies. Due armadi separati, una zona salotto con un grande divano che aprendosi formava il mio letto che era praticamente a due piazze, un king size bed, poltrone, tavolini e zona desk con grande TV e telefoni. Arredamento sobrio (sulle tinte neutre dei marroni e dei beige) ed elegante. Riviste e guide a disposizione, belle foto della citt√†. Non ho usufruito della prima colazione, n√® dei ristoranti quindi non ho informazioni utili da offrire al riguardo. Sottolineo la posizione strategica, a 300 metri dalla metro (Circle e District Line), e con 7 fermate dei bus (di cui uno notturno) esattamente di fronte all'hotel. Personale molto solerte e cortese, sia in Reception che in Conciergerie.

L'albergo √® un cinque stelle e offre servizi all'altezza della categoria fatta eccezione per i prodotti da bagno un po' carenti e per il servizio - a pagamento- di wifi. La posizione √® eccezionale per gli amanti della natura e la fermata del metro di High Kensington √® a non pi√π di cinque minuti di strada a piedi.

Unbedingt sollte man die 25 Pfund fuer das Fruehstueck investieren. Das war Top. Was mich bei einem 5 Sterne Hotel st√∂rt ist das jeder Kaffee und Teebeutel vom Zimmer berechnet wird. Das sollte im Preis drin sein! ,4,2014,10,19

133,"Servizio eccellente, unici nei la palestra e il wi-fi.","Ho soggiornato in questa struttura dal 26 al 29 Luglio, prenotando una stanza doppia con letti singoli. L'hotel si trova in posizione centrale e assai strategica oltre che molto bella: l'albergo si trova infatti adiacente ai Kensington Gardens; da alcune camere si pu√≤ ammirare il bellissimo parco, a noi per√≤ √® stata riservata una camera al decimo piano con vista su High Street Kensington, da cui si pu√≤ ammirare tutta la citt√†. La camera era pulita e molto confortevole. Per quanto riguarda il servizio, posso solo dire che √® impeccabile, sia da quando si viene accolti alla reception per il check-in, sia per quanto riguarda il ristorante, il personale si occupa in maniera premurosa e molto scrupolosa ma mai invadente degli ospiti. Forse questa √® la nota pi√π lieta del soggiorno. Passando ai punti deboli che secondo me non permettono di prendere il punteggio pieno, sicuramente la connessione a pagamento in camera (20 GBP al giorno), che stona con la categoria dell'hotel, cos√¨ come la palestra e la piscina, che non sono presenti  nella struttura. Per chi volesse fare un po' di fitness o una nuotata, il concierge consegna un voucher che permette l'accesso al centro benessere di un altro hotel della zona (il Kensington Close, che si trova a un paio di isolati), fortunatamente gratuito per gli ospiti del Royal. Anche questa secondo me √® una grave mancanza. Per il resto consiglio la colazione al ristorante Park Terrace, ottima e molto varia, non certo a buon mercato. Al nostro piano era presente il ristorante Min Jiang, che pare sia uno dei migliori ristoranti cinesi di Londra, ma francamente non l'abbiamo provato. Rapporto qualit√† prezzo direi eccezionale tenendo conto che siamo a Londra.",4,2014,08,01
133,"Nie wieder, trotz gro√üartiger Location und excellentem Fr√ºhst√ºck","Ich kannte das Hotel von einem fr√ºheren Aufenthalt und habe von einem der h√§ufiger stattfindenden Angebote dieses Hotels Gebrauch gemacht, da es in meine Reisepl√§ne passte. Das Hotel ist in perfekter Lage. 3 Stationen mit der circle-line bis Paddington und von dort bis Heathrow ca. 20 Minuten, besser geht es nicht, auch ist man in k√ºrzester Zeit in jedem gew√ºnschten touristischen Punkt der Stadt. Selbst ein Bus h√§lt vor der T√ºr. 
Die Zimmer sind ger√§umig und die Aussicht ist gro√üartig, vor allem in den oberen Etagen. Mich pers√∂nlich spricht eher die Ansicht √ºber die D√§cher von London an, manch anderer liebt vielleicht die Aussicht auf den Park. 
Dem Zimmer insgesamt (und dem 5-Sterne-Anspruch) w√ºrde es guttun, wenn in jedem Zimmer ein Schuhanzieher w√§re und - mit Verlaub - man in etwas komfortableres Toilettenpapier investieren w√ºrde. Insgesamt ist der Eindruck der Zimmer sehr sauber und ordentlich, auch wenn hier und da schon sichtbar der Zahn der Zeit nagt oder hier und da mal beim Housekeeping etwas beim Putzen √ºbersehen wird, was eigentlich nicht schlimm ist, ich aber in einem 5-Sterne-Haus nicht akzeptieren kann, wenn es mehr als einmal passiert.
Neben der Location und der Aussicht ist ein besonderes highlight das wirklich excellente Fr√ºhst√ºck und das Angebot, von allen K√∂stlichkeiten des English Breakfast. Auch Sonderw√ºnsche werden gern erf√ºllt. Frisches Obst ist vorhanden, mehrere gute Joghurtangebote, sogar der Kaffee ist ausgezeichnet. Die meisten Servicekr√§fte sind sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit

Eine Besonderheit in diesem Hotel ist jedoch, wie man mir bei meinem ersten Besuch erkl√§rte, da√ü man, wenn man nicht gest√∂rt werden will, extra Bescheid sagen mu√ü. Nur das ""Bitte nicht st√∂ren Schild"" (hier ein rotes L√§mpchen) reicht nicht. Gut, da√ü ich mich an diesen Brauch erinnerte, denn beim zweiten Mal wurde mir das beim Einchecken nicht explizit gesagt. Nun denn, ich brauchte an einem Tage meine Ruhe, verst√§ndigte die Reinigungskraft (oder das Zimmerm√§dchen), die wiederum jemanden schickte, um mir schnell Handt√ºcher und Papierkorb zu wechseln - soweit perfekt und alles ohne Problem. 
Leider nutzte weder das pers√∂nliche Bescheid sagen, noch das rote L√§mpchen. Als ich nach einem anstrengenden Tag wieder in das Hotelzimmer zur√ºckkam, war ""aufger√§umt"" und geputzt und die extra Handt√ºcher waren auch weg. Nichts kann ich weniger gut verzeihen, als wenn in meine Privatsph√§re eingebrochen wird. Ich rufe also das Housekeeping/Managerin an und sie entschuldigt sich kurz und verspricht mir, da√ü es bei meinem weiteren Aufenthalt nicht mehr vorkommen wird. Unfa√übar, eine lapidare Entschuldigung, in kleineren Hotels (2 - 4 Stern) bekommt man als Entschuldigung irgendwas angeboten. Um den √Ñrger perfekt zu machen, klopfte p√ºnktlich um 11h00 am n√§chsten Tag das Zimmerm√§dchen an die T√ºr. UNERH√ñRT. Beim check-out kam weder die Frage, wie es mir gefallen hat, noch eine Entschuldigung, auf Nachfragen nach der e-mail des Hotelmanagers wurde mir die Anschrift gegeben und mir gesagt: ""oh ja, das steht hier im logbuch, da√ü es Probleme gab."". 

Nach der R√ºckkehr in meinen Heimatort entdecke ich eine e-mail vom Royal Garden Hotel - ich dachte: oh, na bitte - wenigstens eine kleine schriftliche Entschuldigung. Aber nein, ein survey - den ich ausf√ºllte und um Antwort bat - ich bekam fast postwendend einen Anruf, leider zu einem ung√ºnstigen Zeitpunkt. Man verspach mir einen R√ºckruf am n√§chsten Tag - darauf ""warte"" ich bis heute.

Das Royal Garden ist ein sogenanntes ""World Hotel"" - Ich h√§tte hier sehr gerne von allem geschw√§rmt und es weiterempfohlen - das ist mir leider nicht m√∂glich, objektiv ein gutes Hotel, subjektiv ein Desaster.",2,2014,08,01
133,Grandioses Hotel das keine W√ºnsche offen l√§sst,"Nachdem ich seit nunmehr 10 Jahren in diesem Hotel wohne, wenn ich in London bin, wage ich auch eine Bewertung. Und ich muss sagen, dass ich nie entt√§uscht wurde. So sehr man auch nach einem Mangel suchen will, ich konnte keinen finden. 5 Sterne auf ganzer Linie. Die Lage in Kensington, mit Einkaufsstra√üe und perfekter √∂ffentlicher Anbindung l√§sst keine Kritik zu. Der Empfang und das Personal sind √ºberaus freundlich, kompetent und schnell. W√ºnsche und Fragen werden charmant wie professionell bearbeitet. Die Sauberkeit des gesamten Hotels inkl der Zimmer ist perfekt. Die Zimmer selbst sind ger√§umig und gut sowie stilvoll ausgestattet, die B√§der ebenso. Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksb√ºffet ist grandios, bestellte Extras kommen z√ºgig und eben wie bestellt. Die Gastronomie ist ebenfalls sehr gut, wobei ich - wenn m√∂glich - vorziehe immer andere Restaurant-Empfehlungen zu testen. Ganz klar keine Entscheidung der Qualit√§t oder des Service wegen, das ist hier ebenso stimmig wie in den anderen Bereichen.  Der Wellness- und Fitnessbereich sind sehr gut ausgestattet, die Joggingroute durch Kensington Park vom Hotel aus ist nat√ºrlich einmalig. Die Preise sind sicherlich in der Oberklasse anzusiedeln, aber f√ºr dieses perfekte Rundum-Paket zahle ich es gerne zumal London teuer und oft - die Qualit√§t betrachtend - √ºberteuert ist. Wer in dieser Preiskategorie ein Hotel sucht, dem kann ich das Royal Garden Hotel w√§rmstens empfehlen. ",5,2014,07,24

133,Bell'hotel a Kensington ma non un 5 stell,"Abbiamo soggiornato per 3 notti con altre 2 coppie di amici in questo hotel pochi giorni fa
A me e mio marito hanno dato una stanza fumatori dove persisteva sia nei tessuti dei tendaggi che nell'aria un forte puzzo di fumo, essendo allergica ho chiesto subito il cambio stanza che ci hanno prontamente concesso spostandoci per√≤ al 3 piano con una vista orribile su di un tetto incatramato.
Le camere hanno moquette , a mio avviso non ben santificata perch√© mi capitava di starnutire spesso durante la notte, e sono abbastanza piccole , bello l'impianto video dotato di sky sport-
I bagni sono ampi e ben curati con vasca e doccia
Punto vergognoso dell'hotel Wifi a pagamento 20Gbp non disponibile neppure nelle aree comuni
Per essere un 5 stelle non basta avere una bella location a fronte del prezzo richiesto bisogna dare dei servizi che qua non ho trovato 
Andiamo a Londra spesso e siamo stati un hotel 4 stelle onestamente superiori in termini di qualit√† di stanze e servizi..da questo hotel ci aspettavamo di pi√π",4,2014,06,01

El punto que no deja de sorprender, un que muchos lo dicen en sus cr√≠ticas, es que Internet no est√° incluido! Y no s√≥lo eso cobran 20 libras el d√≠a de internet! El business center tb cobra, por todo! 
Creo que en un hotel de este tipo no son las cosas que uno espera...

133,Ottimo servizio...,Ho avuto il piacere di soggiornare in questo bel albergo con la mia famiglia per 4 giorni. l'albergo ha una bellissima posizione alle spalle di Kensington Garden su cui alcune camere hanno una bellissima vista. La metroponiltana √® a pochi passi mentre la fermata dei comodissimi bus proprio di fronte all'hotel. Il personale √© gentilissimo e davvero si adopera per il benessere degli ospiti. Le camere sono confortevol e pulite...vengono pulite e riassettate due volte al giorno. Anche il ristorante Terrace al ground zero offre una buona cucina.

133,"Tolles Hotel, kleine Abz√ºge beim Fr√ºhst√ºck","Dank einer Travelzoo-Aktion kamen wir in den Genuss, dieses tolle und hervorragend gelegene Hotel zu einem wirklich g√ºnstigen Preis zu erleben zu erleben. Fr√ºhst√ºck und WLan waren inkludiert, ein Super-Angebot.
Die Mitarbeiter bei der Rezeption, die Zimmerm√§dchen und die Bedienungen beim Fr√ºhst√ºck waren alle ausgesprochen liebreizend und hilfreich. 
Wir hatten ein sch√∂nes Zimmer mit allem erdenklichen Komfort und einem gro√üen Wohlf√ºhlbad. Die Zimmerm√§dchen machen einen tollen Job, alles blitzt und blinkt. Besonders freuten wir uns √ºber einen Pralinengru√ü zu unserem Hochzeitstag, das ist wirklich sehr aufmerksam. Auch die t√§gliche Flasche Mineralwasser haben wir sehr genossen. 
Die Verkehrsanbindung des Hotels ist gro√üartig und die Lage wirklich sehr sch√∂n, Shops und Caf√©s sind direkt rundherum. 

Einen Punkt Abzug gebe ich aus zwei Gr√ºnden.
Erstens war es mir nachts im Zimmer viel zu kalt. Trotz aufgedrehter Heizung/Klimaanlage fror ich so, dass ich f√ºr die zweite Nacht um eine zus√§tzliche Decke bat, die auch prompt kam, dann war es gut.
Zweitens finde ich die Fr√ºhst√ºckssituation verbesserungsw√ºrdig. Im Vorfeld hatte ich eine mail geschrieben, dass wir Ostersonntag mit f√ºnf Freunden, die nicht im Hotel wohnen, fr√ºhst√ºcken m√∂chten. Auf diese mail bekam ich nie eine Antwort, das darf bei einem Hotel dieser Klasse nicht passieren. Samstags sagte mein Mann noch einmal beim Fr√ºhst√ºckspersonal Bescheid, dass wir G√§ste haben w√ºrden, und es wurde uns gesagt, kein Problem, kommen Sie einfach. Eine Tischreservierung war nicht m√∂glich. Als wir nun Ostersonntag zu siebt dastanden, brach pl√∂tzlich die Panik aus, es sei voll und kein Tisch frei, die beiden Damen am Eingang konnten mit der Situation √ºberhaupt nicht umgehen und holten schlie√ülich einen Vorgesetzten. W√§hrenddessen stauten sich hinter uns andere G√§ste. Ich habe das Chaos nicht wirklich verstanden, denn es waren genug Tische frei, nur h√§tte man eben einen eindecken m√ºssen. Schlie√ülich nach einigem Hin und her warteten wir und bekamen dann auch endlich einen Tisch. Das h√§tte man geschmeidiger l√∂sen m√ºssen. 
Die Mitarbeiter vom Fr√ºhst√ºckspersonal sind allesamt sehr nett und sehen aus wie Models, meine G√ºte, so viel Sch√∂nheit am fr√ºhen Morgen! Das System mit kontinentalem Fr√ºhst√ºck und englischem, das extra kostet, ist verwirrend und nicht wirklich perfekt. Man bestellt z.B. Eier beim Kellner und muss dann lange darauf warten. Wenn sie kommen, fehlt der Toast oder er ist schon wieder kalt. Am Wochenende gibt es das englische Fr√ºhst√ºck am Buffet, das ist viel besser. Insgesamt ist das Fr√ºhst√ºck gut, aber gemessen am restlichen Standart des Hotels, der hervorragend ist, w√ºrde ich sagen, dass hier die Schwachstelle liegt. 
Deshalb ein Punkt Abzug.
Wir kommen aber sehr gern wieder und freuen uns schon auf den n√§chsten Londonbesuch.",4,2014,04,22

Devo dire, d'altro canto, che non √® proprio un Hotel economico e che, per il prezzo che hanno le camere di questo hotel quello che viene offerto non √® assolutamente regalato. A mio avviso √® sicuramente un hotel all'altezza delle aspettative.",4,2014,02,20

La colazione estremamente ricca: gustose salcicce, frittate e pancetta per la English breakfast, grande variet√† di brioche, formaggi, affettati, pane, cereali e frutta per la colazione continentale.

Im Grunde ist das Hotel eine ideale Ausgangsbasis f√ºr eine Stadterkundung. 

Das Personal ist ausgesprochen freundlich und die neu renovierten Zimmer bieten alles was man braucht um abzuschalten. 

Einzig das Fr√ºhst√ºcksangebot halte ich pers√∂nlich f√ºr etwas √ºberteuert. Weshalb ich den Starbucks direkt gegen√ºber vorgezogen habe. 

Insgesamt muss man sagen es gibt sicherlich auch g√ºnstigere Hotels in London. Aber dieses Hotel ist seinen Preis wert.",5,2013,10,30
133,una grande delusione dopo due esperienze positive,"siamo stati al Royal Graden Hotel a met√† settembre a conclusione del nostro viaggio di nozze in Devon e Cornovaglia.
Avevamo scelto questo hotel, di fatto molto costoso, perch√® ci eravamo trovati molto bene in due precedenti occasioni, sia in relazione alla posizione molto centrale , che in considerazione della qualit√† eccellente del servizio.
in questa occasione invece siamo rimasti molto delusi purtroppo.
intanto, nonostante avessimo comunicato che ci recavamo l√¨ in viaggio di nozze ci hanno assegnato una stanza al primo piano , senza vista ed esattamente sopra al parcheggio dei taxi. molto rumoroso e nell'insieme molto deprimente sopratutto rispetto alle altre stanze che avevamo avuto nelle occasioni precedenti al decimo piano e con la vista su tutta Londra.
abbiamo quindi chiesto di poter cambiare stanza , ci hanno detto che avevano una convention ed era tutto pieno sino a due giorni dopo.
ci avrebbero quindi fatto sapere , cosa che non si √® affatto verificata.
e dunque siamo rimasti nella stanza al primo piano svegliandoci tutti i giorni alle sette per il rumore.
altre osservazioni da considerare: gli asciugamani non venivano cambiati tutti i giorni, l'asciugacapelli era di pessima qualit√† ( revlon evidentemente riciclato in via di sponsorizzazione ) basso e freddo con la conseguenza che per asciugarsi i capelli ci voleva mezzora , mentre per ammalarsi sono bastati due giorni, anche perch√® la stanza era fredda e condizionata senza riscaldamento nonostante all'esterno facessero dodici gradi.
infine incredibile davvero nel 2013 per un hotel cinque stelle non √® presente in albergo il wi fi gratuito; il wi fi pu√≤ essere solo acquistato a 20 pounds al giorno ( non proprio un prezzo buona).
insomma una grande delusione , anche perch√® abbiamo compreso che √® pi√π rilevante una convention della Bacardi che un cliente affezionato ( era la terza volta cj recavamo l√¨) e dunque non ci andremo pi√π, nonostante il nostro amore per Londra.
L'unica cosa che vale veramente la pena √® il ristorante cinese al decimo piano, anche in questo caso siamo rimasti delusi dalla gestione della reception dell'albergo , infatti abbiamo chiesto se ci potevano riservare un tavolo , la risposta √® stato che era fully booked, ma in realt√† quando ci siamo recati al decimo piano era pieno di tavoli liberi e ci hanno fatto accomodare immediatamente.
che delusione!!",2,2013,10,02

Nos dieron una habitaci√≥n muy amplia, suficiente para los tres, pero adecuada para personas en silla de ruedas. Estas habitaciones muy bien dotadas pero tienen que hacer concesiones que restan comodidades a quienes afortunadamente no tenemos esas limitantes. Adem√°s, la habitaci√≥n est√° situada en el 2o.

Da wir aus √ñsterreich sind wurden wir auch teilweise auf Deutsch angesprochen. Das  wir sehr h√∂fflich und √ºberaus nett fanden.
Wir hatten das Gef√ºhl, das jeder einzelne in diesem Hotel sehr bem√ºht ist um jeden Gast. Und was noch dazukommt. Wir haben uns sehr Willkommen gef√ºhlt. Es war wirklich familier.
Danke, danke, danke f√ºr alles.
Es war ein Traum und Wunder, Wundersch√∂n.
Ich w√ºrde jedem das Hotel empf√§hlen. Es ist einfache Spitze.",5,2011,08,17
133,TUTTO PERFETTO,"Personale gentilissimo e professionale, sempre presenti ma con massima discrezione.
camera enorme, pulitissima, sala da bagno grande super arredata, doccia doppia, vasca, lavello grande e bidet ( non facile da trovare a Londra)
colazione molto varia e ricca.
veramente un hotel a 5 stelle che le merita tutte.",5,2011,05,19
133,camera confortevole e ottima posizione,"Il Royal Garden e` situato proprio all' angolo sud-ovest di Kensington Gardens, quindi in ottima posizione per muoversi nell' area di Kensington. A 500 metri c'e` la fermata del metro High Street Kensington (linee yellow e green, perfette per muoversi in centro), mentre proprio di fronte all' Hotel c'e` la fermata di varie linee di autobus.  Harrod's e la zona dello shopping sono raggiungibili in pochi minuti, cosi` come la royal Albert Hall e il museo di scienze naturali.  Ma anche la High Street Kensington, a pochi passi, offre una quantita` di negozi, caffe` e ristoranti.  Al nostro arrivo ci e` stata offerta una stanza al terzo piano completamente rinnovata, affaciata sulla High Street. Le dimensioni della stanza (considerati gli standard di Londra) sono piu` che accettabili, con un letto King Size e una zona-salottino rialzata dove sono stati ben collocati un divano, un tavolino e una grande scrivania ben attrezzata, il tutto ben illuminato dall' enorme finestra con una bella vista. L' armadio ha dimensioni accettabili ed e` ben organizzato con cassetti, ripiani e appendini sufficienti per due persone.  Il bagno e` spazioso, con un grande specchio e un ampio top-lavandino, vasca da bagno e spazioso box doccia separato. Amenities nel bagno standard, ma con ricambio giornaliero.  Asciugamani e accappatoi di buona qualita`, ma niente ciabattine!
Nel complesso, mi e` piaciuto il modo in cui sono stati curati i dettagli e la disposizione di tutto cio` che e` nella stanza, in una maniera davvero confortevole e intelligente: molti specchi (che fanno sembrare tutto piu` largo), i pannelli di legno sul muro a creare un senso di calore, le luci ben disposte e regolabili in intensita`, la scrivania multi-funzione.  Unici due punti negativi: il bollitore elettrico per il caffe` collocato in un cassetto a livello del pavimento (buona idea ma scomodo!) e la connessione a Internet a pagamento (e carissima), cosa che trovo sempre assurda in un hotel di questa categoria.
Abbiamo fatto sempre colazione in camera e abbiamo anche usato una volta il Room Service: prezzi adeguati alla categoria ma con opzioni non troppo costose, cibo e bevande di ottima qualita`, servizio veloce e cortese.",4,2011,04,05
133,"Bell'albergo, posizione eccellente","Sono stata in questo hotel per lavoro. La posizione √© eccellente per andare a mangiare fuori, per fare shopping (tantissimi negozi su kensington High Street e anche un supermercato ecologico molto grande che si chiama Whole Foods) e per andare in centro a londra, grazie alla stazione della metropolitana a due passi. La stanza era molto bella (letto matrimoniale molto comodo, una bella vista su Kensington High Street)e il servizio ottimo, ad un prezzo ragionevole.",5,2011,02,08
133,Kleinigkeiten machen den Unterschied,"Ja, es ist ein sch√∂nes Hotel im Westen von London und wundersch√∂n am s√ºd-westlichsten Zipfel des Hyde-Parks gelegen. Ja, die Verkehrsanbindung durch die Tube mit der Station High-Street-Kensington und den Bussen 10 von/nach Oxfordstreet, 9 nach/von Green Park und 52 zur Victoria Station ist super, die High Street Kensington selbst ein Shopping Paradies. Das Zimmer aber ,war winzig, wenn auch gut ausgestattet.Das Fr√ºhst√ºck f√ºr 17 Pfund war absolut √ºberteuert, denn f√ºr alle Eierspeisen wurde extra abkassiert. So kostete mein einsames Spiegelei, schmale 4,50 Pfund extra! !!Hey, 4.50 f√ºr ein Ei !!!!!!? Und der Service war nicht diskret, sondern √ºbereifrig.Es ist einfach l√§stig, mit vollen Backen, 3 mal hintereinander auf die Frage zu antworten, ob man noch einen Kaffee m√∂chte, wenn die Tasse noch voll ist, oder? OK, das nennt man wohl ein Luxusproblem.
Ein weiteres ist die gut gef√ºllte Minibar, die aber nicht wieder aufgef√ºllt wird. Eine Apfelschorle, die ich am 1. Tag trank, wurde genauso wenig ersetzt, wie das dazu benutzte Glas. Schade! Ebenso schade, das √ºberteuerte Internet!
Nein, ich w√ºrde nicht wiederkommen, wenn das Preisangebot nicht ein Schn√§ppchen w√§re.
Kann ein Loblied singen auf das 4 Sterne Hotel K&K Earls Court, das nur 1 KM entfernt ist. Pers√∂nlich, freundlich und unangestrengt, und preislich deutlich g√ºnstiger, bleibt es mein Favorit im Westen Londons!",3,2010,10,22
133,"Lage bestens, Essen nicht empfehlenswert","3 N√§chte im Hotel. Zi. zur Strasse, war ordentlich, nicht zu laut. Lage optimal zu √ñffis und zum Park. Hilfsbereitschaft und Flexibilit√§t gross.
Das chin. Restaurant k√∂nnen wir leider nur sehr negativ bewerten. Arrogant, unaufmerksam - trotz entsprechender Kleidung - Qualit√§t normal, das gibt es auch bei jedem guten chin. Lokal zu g√ºnstigerem Preis. Wer in China war, kennt sicher Peking Ente, da wird man get√§uscht,spez. die Beilagen.",4,2010,10,19
133,Enorme Verbesserungen,"Das Royl Garden Hotel liegt ideal f√ºr Tourisen und Gesch√§ftsreisende 2 Minuten von der U-Bahn-Station High Street Kensington entfernt, die Zimmer wurden bzw werden renoviert. Die Standard- und Garden View Zimmer bieten nun eine sehr geschmackvolle Einrichtung, gro√üe TV-Screens und ger√§umige Badezimmer. Ebenso wurde die Garden Terasse (Restaurant) renoviert und bietet ein sehr umfangreiches Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet in heller und freundlicher Atmosph√§re. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und bem√ºht, das Hotel hat im letzten Jahr sehr gewonnen. Die Preise sind f√ºr London angemessen, die 5 Sterne sind jedenfalls verdient. Sehr zu empfehlen.",5,2010,09,22
133,"Super Hotel, aber Wifi f√ºr 20 GBP am Tag ist ein bischen viel","Das Hotel liegt gleich neben Hyde Park bzw. Kensington Gardens. Mit der Bus Linie 10, die direkt vor dem Haus abf√§hrt, ist man in 20 Minuten an der OXford Street.  Zwei U-Bahn Stationen sind in K√ºrze zu erreichen. gegen√ºber hat es ein paar kleine Restaurants und einen Starbucks mit kostenlosen Wifi Anschluss. Im Hotel wird 20 GBP pro Tag verlangt. Um die Ecke ein kleiner Pub ""Price of  Wales"", bei der man auch noch einen Absacker nehmen kann.",3,2010,09,17
133,Top-Hotel in bester Lage in tollem Design,"Ein wirkliches Top-Hotel in vorz√ºglicher Lage, nach umfassender Renovierung erstrahlt es in gediegenem, elegantem und luxuri√∂sem Design ohne k√ºhl, unnahbar oder unpers√∂nlich zu wirken.
Unmittelbar am S√ºdwestzipfel des Hyde Park thront das Hotel gegen√ºber vom Kensington Palace und dem Kensington Garden. Die U-Bahn-Station ""High Street Kensington"" liegt ca. 50m entfernt mit direktem Anschluss zu vielen Londoner Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten und Verkehrsknotenpunkten.
Superm√§rkte, allerlei Gesch√§fte, Banken, Bars, Cafes, Schnellimbisse, Fastfood- 
Ketten und zahllose Restaurants f√ºr wirklich jeden Geschmack und Geldbeutel finden sich in unmittelbarer Fussn√§he zum Hotel. Joggen im angrenzenden Hyde Park, Reiten, Tennis und Bootfahren ... dies alles ist hier m√∂glich. Zus√§tzlich ein grosses Fitnesscenter im Hotel mit Spa-Bereich un einer grossen Palette von Behandlungsm√∂glichkeiten.
Von der imposanten Auffahrt gelangt man in die Lobby, welche durch ihren eleganten, dezenten Stil mit √ºppigen Blumenarrangements, vielen gem√ºtlichen Sitzgruppen und ihre lichte Weitl√§ufigkeit beeindruckt. Eine sch√∂ne Bar auf der Empore mit kuschligen Sofaecken im ersten Stock er√∂ffnet Blicke durch Glasw√§nde auf das Treiben in der Lobby. Die grosse Rezeption l√§sst keine Wartezeit aufkommen, √ºberall k√ºmmert man sich vorbildlich um das Wohl der G√§ste und bem√ºht sich, die W√ºnsche schnell und perfekt zu erf√ºllen.  
Eine grosse Auswahl an verschiedenen Zimmertypen bietet f√ºr jeden sicherlich das richtige. Ob ein normales Queenzimmer, eine gem√ºtliche Juniorsuite oder 
gar noch ein gr√∂sseres Objekt, die Ausstattung ist √ºberall gleichermassen zeitlos, geschmackvoll und besitzt die technischen Raffinessen, die man heute von einem 5-Sterne-Hotelzimmer erwarten darf. Ich empfehle auf jeden Fall ein Zimmer mit Blick √ºber den Kensington Palast und den Hyde Park - kostet rund 20-30 Pfund mehr - manchmal bekommt man auch ein kostenloses Upgrade, denn der sch√∂ne Ausblick durch die grossen Fenster ist einfach wundervoll zu allen Tageszeiten.
Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet ist f√ºr meinen Geschmack absolut angemessen im Preis,
GBP 17.00 f√ºr ein kontinentales und 21.50 f√ºr ein √ºppiges englsiches - da zahlt man in vergleichbaren Hotels gerne 5-10 Pfund mehr - ausserdem bietet es einen so sch√∂nen Blick auf den Park, da will man gar nicht mehr weg ...
Absolut zu empfehlen ist dar√ºberhinaus das chinesische Restaurant Min Jiang.
Hier kann man bis zu maximal 20 Personen auch in einem privaten Raum speisen.
Preism√§ssig schon gehoben, aber das Auge isst ja bekanntlich auch mit und das Interior sowie die Aussicht und die Atmosph√§re sind schon besonders angenehm.

Ein Hotel, in dem man sich gleich wie in seinem Zuhause f√ºhlt, die Renovierung hat das Haus in eine ganz andere Kategorie katapultiert und es muss sich hinter keinem Sheraton Park Tower, Hilton on Park Lane oder Jumeirah Carlton Tower verstecken .... die Gr√∂sse von fast 400 Zimmern ist √ºberhaupt nicht st√∂rend und es befindet sich nach wie vor in Pirvatbesitz. .... und es wird gerne von Prominenten aus der Welt des Sportes und von Musikgr√∂ssen gebucht.",5,2010,09,09
133,St√§dtereise,"Hotel ist mit 5 Sternen √ºberbewertet, das Badezimmer ist noch im Stil der 70er Jahre, f√ºr zwei Personen zu klein und die Beleuchtung nicht ausreichend, ausserdem st√∂rten nachts Ger√§usche, die wir nicht zuordnen konnten, die Ger√§usche waren auch da, wenn wir die Klimaanlage ausschalteten.
Die Aussicht Richtung Kensington Garden war allerdings phantastisch und das Hotel ist zentral gelegen. In der N√§he gibt es ein paar wunderbare Bistros, wo man super fr√ºhst√ºcken konnte.",3,2010,08,05
133,"Tolle Lage, aber keine 5 Sterne","Das Hotel liegt sehr gut neben dem Kensington Palace, 2 Minuten zur U-Bahn, Bus vor dem Haus, viele Gesch√§fte und Restaurants in unmittelbarer N√§he. Zimmer ger√§umig, die Sauberkeit l√§sst zu w√ºnschen √ºbrig. Restaurant sehr teuer. Insgesamt kein gutes preis-Leistungsverh√§ltnis. Auch f√ºr London zu teuer.",3,2010,06,02
